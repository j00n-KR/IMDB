0,TheLittleSongbird,The case of when the special effects overshadow the script and the acting,6,3 April 2010,"Roland Emmerich is like marmite, we love him or we hate him. Personally I don't admire him, then again I have nothing personal against him, other than to say I do sometimes find his directorial style murky and unfocused. So what about 2012? To put it simply, there is a lot wrong with the film, but I actually found it surprisingly watchable. The best thing about 2012 is without doubt the special effects. They are utterly mind-blowing, and the equally astounding sound and fluid cinematography added to the authenticity. The music score is great, and the idea of the story is intriguing. However excellent special effects can mean that the script and acting aren't as good, sadly that is the case. The acting was nothing special really, but John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt do try their hardest with shallow characters as do the kids and it does show. I did think Zlatko Buric as Yuri was very one note though. These talented actors are cursed by mostly awful dialogue that is clichéd and stale, and the film did come very unrealistic in places. It also doesn't help that the pacing is too stodgy and the film is half an hour too long. Overall, not a waste, and visually mind-blowing, but nothing great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",2012
1,bkoganbing,Will Nostradamus and the Mayans be proved right?,6,6 April 2011,"The film 2012 starts with the premise that out in the movie-going public there are a considerable number of people who are aware of the prophecies of Nostradamus and the fact that the Mayan calendar ended in our year 2012. Otherwise the title and film would have really little significance.In point of fact there have been several times in history when a lot of folks thought that certain years would mark the end. In the 19th century a gentleman named William Miller managed to convince quite a following that 1844 was going to be the end of the world. When it didn't happen, he lost a bit of credibility.2012 is a combination end times film you see normally out of Christian productions and the end product of those Seventies era disaster movies. Solar flare activity has been on the rise and those flames of burning hydrogen are heating the Earth from the outside and from the inside like a microwave oven.However this has been foreseen and a disaster plan is put into operation by President Danny Glover and other heads of state. But his top science adviser Oliver Platt takes operational control and he's a nasty dude with his own ideas of maybe ruling a post apocalyptic world. He quarrels with another scientist Chiwetal Ejifor and the two have a running Spock/McCoy battle for pure science over humanity throughout the film. At the same time hack novelist John Cusack learns of the impending cataclysm and works quite a few miracles to get his family out and be listed among the survivors. In fact he plays a key role in everybody's survival in the film.One memorable character you won't forget is Woody Harrelson who runs a doomsday pirate radio station. As all his conspiracy theories are proved right, his dying reaction is positively orgasmic.Barack Obama could not have been better portrayed on the screen even in pseudonym than by Danny Glover. He gives his blessings to scientist daughter Thandie Newton and to Ejifor for their hoped for survival. Newton and Glover's scenes are the most human and humane in 2012.Is there validity to all of this? Those earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand and Fugoshima, Japan certainly give one pause to reflect. On the other times a whole lot of my credit cards have been renewed past 2012, one of them up to 2015. Can Visa, Mastercard, and American Express know something we don't.2012 set out to be the ultimate disaster film and it came considerably short of the mark. But it's not bad entertainment and does pose a few questions for the audience to ponder on.",2012
2,Leofwine_draca,Hysterically bad,4,14 November 2013,"2012 is undoubtedly Roland Emmerich's worst ever film, worse indeed than 10,000 BC. It's an outrageously bad movie, a bloated and laugh-filled variant of those late '90s disaster movies that proved popular for a time (DEEP IMPACT, VOLCANO, etc.) Clearly a labour of love for the director, who wrote as well as directed, I'm frankly incredulous over the huge amounts of money spent on this movie's production costs.The plot, in essence, sees the Mayan prediction of the end of the world in 2012 come true. Yes, it's already dated, and yes, it leads to the same old disaster movie guff. Danny Glover's the shoe-in for Obama here, while the likes of Oliver Platt fill suits and Woody Harrelson frankly embarrasses himself as a conspiracy nut. Thandie Newton reminds you of why she hasn't been seen on screen since MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2; she's simply a not very good actress.Best of all is the sub-plot involving John Cusack and his whiny/bratty kids. Cusack is like Road Runner in this movie, outrunning various disaster scenarios over and over again, until I lost count. He outdrives earthquakes, outflies volcanic eruptions, the list goes on. The special effects are admittedly spectacular - and the only reason to keep watching, I have to say - but the repetitive nature of watching Cusack escape from the brink time and again really shows off Emmerich's lack of creativity. Why not employ some help, somebody to use their imagination instead of simply repeating stuff over and over? Only in Hollywood!",2012
3,SnoopyStyle,Great action No brains,6,24 October 2013,"Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a scientist who warns the President that the world is in trouble. They decide to build massive arks to save the few and the world's treasures.Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a frustrated writer who works as a limo driver. His ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and his 2 kids live with her new boyfriend. A series of events convinces Jackson that something is wrong and the group goes on a long thrilling journey to find the arks.The first half is fun. Roland Emmerich has created a massive roller coaster ride. It's Moviegeddon. The science be damn... until the second half. Let's just say the whole ark thing is ridiculous. Even for a mindless popcorn movie, this is still too stupid.",2012
4,Hitchcoc,Time I Will Never Get Back!,3,3 March 2010,"l have to admit I did like the scene with Woody Harrelson standing on the hill, raging against the universe. Otherwise, this is probably one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is full of stereotypes, good guys, bad guys, and a total disregard for the victims of the cataclysm. I challenge even the most scientifically uninformed to sit down and pick this mess apart. People act in incredibly irrational ways. Speeches are made at devastating moments. Of course, if we all pull together, we will come out OK in the end. That is after six billion people have died. The formula is in place (did anyone see the newer version of War of the Worlds). There is the husband who only thinks of his work. He has lost the affections of his beautiful wife and his two cute children. She has hooked up with a nice guy who is base and not intellectual. But he likes the kids and is trying to invade the bond that still clearly exists. It's too much. Then there's the Russian guy with his two fat, ugly little kids with their ugly haircuts, who paid a billion Euro to be saved. Throw in the Washington Monument going down again (did anyone see Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) and hundred other landmarks and any other natural treasures that fall before our eyes, and it gets even more tiresome. Also, there's the stunt flying through smoke and debris by a man with two flying lessons that would make Jimmy Dolittle proud. This thing must have cost a fortune and it has almost nothing going for it. People act stupidly, say stupid things, and every sentimental goodbye is used. I suppose they thought this would make this movie more serious. As it is, it is laughable.",2012
5,Prismark10,Blow it up,6,13 October 2014,"From Roland Emmerich, a man who likes to destroy things on screen comes the apocalyptic disaster film 2012. Its 2012 and the scientists have discovered that the earth's core is melting, the crust will shift and lave will spew out causing earthquakes and rising tides. Even the poles would shift.Politicians, rich oligarchs, various royal families and a few conspiracy nuts know of the imminent disaster and have started planning for it by means of survivals arks being built in China. However a place in the ark comes with a huge price.John Cusack goes all out to get his ex-wife and kids to safety by tagging along with a rich Russian.Danny Glover is the US President who opts to stay in Washington. Oliver Platt is the realist but harsh Chief of Staff. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of the scientists who alerted the government of the impending doom but fearful that the rich and powerful will callously leave millions to die.The cheese-fest is dialled up to 11 as Cusack just escapes disaster by car and plane. Roads splits, buildings come crashing down, volcanoes erupt. Emmerich even blows up the White House once again amongst other landmarks.Its like a roller-coaster ride but the characterisations are a bit paper thin, some of the effects look a bit too much green screened. A good end of the world flick with some tongue in cheek humour.",2012
6,claudio_carvalho,A Silly and Corny Disaster Movie,6,27 February 2010,"When the geologist Dr. Adrian Helmsley and his team discover that the core of Earth is heating due to solar radiation, he advises the North American President about his findings. The American Govern collects money from the worldwide leaders to build arks to save them with necessary people to rebuild civilization. Meanwhile, the unsuccessful writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) discloses that the world is near to end and tries to save his son and his daughter from the tragic end.In the 70's, there was a ""fashion"" of disaster movies, in general with dramatic stories but the special effects in those years were very simple. ""2012"" is the opposite: state-of-art special effects and an imbecile story, i.e., a silly and corny disaster movie. The physical absurd are usually OK for the action, but stupid attitudes is something that is annoying like, for example, the decision to open the gates with less than five minutes to be reached by the tsunami, or swimming wearing tie. There are some posts in the Message Board listing the implausible or stupid scenes and attitudes. The Church in Brazil is suing Columbia Picture for using the image of the Christ Redeemer without previous authorization in an absolute absurd and nonsense; could the true reason be indeed an indirect reprisal for the scene with the destruction of the Vatican? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""2012""",2012
7,mark.waltz,A massive migraine of mass destruction.,3,11 May 2015,"For about a third of this two and a half hour follow-up to ""The Day After Tomorrow"", the audience must suffer through another soap opera plot, this time even more abrasively presented than its predecessor. It involves a divorced couple (John Cusack and Amanda Peet) trying to get their children to safety with the help of Peet's fiancée (Thomas McCarthy) when underground volcanoes begin to decimate L.A. and the rest of the world. They discover that the powerful leaders and the money men supporters have gotten together to build arks to save themselves from an oncoming flood. OK, fine premise so far, but there is so much silliness in the way that the plot is drawn, and especially with a powerful Russian businessman, his two Pugsly Addams like twin sons, his much younger mistress, and his personal pilot who's obviously having an affair with the mistress. McCarthy, after only a few flying lessons, is assigned as co-pilot, and already haven flown over Los Angeles where the ground is crumbling beneath them, he must now assist the head Russian pilot in flying this plane that is the size of three Concords. ""It's huge!"", McCarthy exclaims, to which the Boris Badinoff sounding Russian tycoon simply responds, ""It's Russian."" If you can get through Woody Harrelson's embarrassing performance as a stoner who first alerts Cusack to the pending doom, then try not rolling your eyes at the sight of Cusack's car barreling down a Santa Monica, California street where the road literally is exploding directly behind them. Then, there's the shots them driving or flying through collapsing highways (Goodbye, 10 freeway!) and various large glass buildings, and while exciting to see, it just gets to be a bit too much. Even more cumbersome is the efforts for everybody to get on the outlandish ark, which on DVD is much easier to tolerate than it was in the movie theater, because there's always the fast-forward button on the remote.Of course, three years past the paranoia of the real 2012, this has been proved to be a total falsehood, a fright-making exploitation with mostly one dimensional characters and one-note performances that make this a collection of clichés and ultimately, in spite of some riveting moments, a true example of Hollywood bad taste. Danny Glover manages to make his character (President of the United States) totally likable, but Oliver Platt is truly obnoxious as a government hack. Certainly, this was fascinating in its initial big-screen run, but doesn't play well with repeat viewings. Also, after watching L.A. being wiped out by Tornados (through the same director), seeing the Pacific coast go through this again makes me wonder how the director would explain L.A. being re-built within less than a decade so it could only be destroyed again. Ironically, one of my old office buildings in Santa Monica is seen sinking into the Pacific, a big chunk of that coastal city being lifted off its axis and sliding down like the Titanic in the North Atlantic. So even though I may not give the movie ""two thumbs up"" for quality, I can give it at least one for sheer gaul if not ingenuity.",2012
8,nogodnomasters,MAYAN PROPHECY MEETS HAB THEORY PLUS BAD SCIENCE,5,4 December 2018,"The theory of shifting crusts is not new, but if it did occur, the theory also states that the crust shifts around certain centers which will be unaffected by the shift. Mutating neutrinos? What is that? Once you get by the gibberish, you get into a bad script. The actors did what they could to save it, but when the script goes south, Cusack couldn't carry the load. There are long drawn out ridiculous scenes where Cusack barely saves his family as the world collapses only inches behind him. Limos and Winnebagos do not handle like NASCARs.Woody Harrelson as a modern day conspiracy prophet gave us some good moments, I wish there would have been more of him. This movie plays on the hype of 2012. It is for suckers. In 2013 we won't be watching it one way or the other",2012
9,kosmasp,"""Event"" movie",6,13 December 2009,"It's always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn't really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It's not real? Isn't a movie ""not"" real by definition? So if you really criticize something about this movie, let it be the story (or parts of it), that just don't work out quite as well. But as with most thrillers, the movie picks up pace, so that you don't have time to think about a few things, that really shouldn't be happening. But again, starting to pick too much on those things, why go watch the movie in the first place? I knew what I was going to get and it was more or less what I expected. I was kinda surprised to see that many nationalities on screen. Woody H. was quite funny, although not fully ""used"" (imo). So despite quite a few things that didn't work (always in the context of the movie), you can have some fun with this.",2012
10,Sleepin_Dragon,"A Disaster movie, it sure is.",3,3 April 2021,"It's 2012, and it's the end of the world, imminent death, unless you're one of the richest people on Earth.Along the same lines as The Day after Tomorrow, if you're expecting something along those lines, you may be a little bit disappointed.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, there are some pretty amazing special effects throughout, the destruction of cities and buildings looked amazing. I quite liked the message of hope at the end of the film, it was a nice touch.You'd see that cast list, and think you were in for a wonderful watch......sadly not, the real Disaster is the film itself.... it's not good, imagine a disaster movie made by children,the subplot and characters are childish, the events are ridiculous. It's one of those films I'd have to say....only in America.There is more syrup in this film than anyone can deal with, it's so sickly, from the gut wrenching dialogue, to the hero President. Some of the sentences will have you wishing for a supervolcano eruption, The Russian in particular.... stereotypes...much.A shambles, 3/10.",2012
11,gavin6942,"Not A Bad Film, For What It Is",6,18 January 2010,"Rather than write a full review at this time, let's just sum this up: the plot is implausible, the science ridiculous, the jokes cheesy and the action way over the top. That being said, if you want to see John Cusack living a fast-paced world of action, Woody Harrelson as a manic preacher, and don't mind a near-infinite series of improbable coincidences and things falling apart, this movie is for you.One side note: what is up with the romance and family stuff? Cusack's character is separated from his wife (Amanda Peet) and she has a new beau, who seems likable and the kids love. There's sort of a subplot of Cusack and Peet maybe getting back together, but what's the motivation? It never really makes sense.",2012
12,jboothmillard,2012,5,9 April 2011,"I had heard a few people tell me that this disaster movie was pretty terrible and not worth watching, even though I saw a trailer that made it look good, so I gave it a chance, from director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow). Basically over a period of three to four years, geophysicist Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has found devastating evidence concerning earth radiation, and it appears that the earth's core is heating up. He warns colleague Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt), and even the President of the United States, Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), and warns them that if action isn't taken as soon as possible the human race is doomed. Forward to the year 2012, where on a regular day writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his family, wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and children Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) having a regular day together. Large cracks start appearing in the ground, and quakes are occurring, and soon Jackson finds out about the impending danger from radio host and conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), based on the predictions of the Mayans. Then the earthquakes become much more powerful, causing the Curtis family and amateur pilot Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) with his family, to escape the danger and fly to safety. Then Yellowstone Caldera erupts, causing chaos everywhere with the dropping rock bombs and collapsing ground, and collecting a map it looks like the only place likely to have less devastation is China. Meanwhile it seems precautions have been taken with the four billion dollar arks that have been built to load all important people to safety, and obviously Adrian, along with the First Daughter, Dr. Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton) are heading for it. The next, and seemingly last, disaster to occur are the quakes creating the world's biggest tidal waves, and the water floods all over, but Jackson and his family, against all odds, secure themselves a place on the ark. In the end, after millions of deaths, including Frost and the President, the waters recede, and it appears that all continents of the world have merged together in the shape of Africa. All the actors do their best to give credible performances, but they cannot be outdone by the spectacular special effects as the world and all its notable cities, landscapes and monuments are destroyed by the solar phenomenon, it may get repetitive at times, but it's not a bad disaster movie. Worth watching!",2012
13,BA_Harrison,My 2012th review...,6,2 August 2012,"Subatomic particles from a massive solar eruption cause The Earth's core to heat up and the crust to destabilise, resulting in massive earthquakes, super-volcanoes and huge tsunamis that threaten to wipe out mankind. Amidst the chaos, author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) attempts to save his family by taking them to China where the world's elite are boarding several top-secret 'arks' built to survive the disaster.2012 gets the scientific mumbo jumbo out the way pretty quickly so that it can concentrate on the emotional human dramas and spectacular scenes of destruction that are the staple of modern big-budget disaster movies. Director Roland Emmerich, who is no stranger to the genre, having already given us Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, confidently handles the CGI-packed action, but with his film clocking in at a massive 158 minutes, and each successive scene attempting to outdo the previous one in terms of excitement at the expense of all logic, the film eventually collapses under the weight of its own preposterousness.The heroes of the picture face all manner of perils, always managing to escape death by the skin of their teeth, whether it be careering through the streets of L.A. as California slides into the sea, taking off from a disintegrating runway as Las Vegas collapses around their ears, fleeing Yellowstone Park in a camper-van while molten rock spews into the air, or conveniently crash landing in China (rather than the sea) thanks to the rotational shift of the planet. If it wasn't for the small fact that the world is falling apart all around them, I'd have these guys down as the luckiest bastards who ever lived.To be honest, the film's lunacy would be somewhat more bearable if only the film didn't go on for quite as long as it does; I'm more than able to suspend my disbelief for the sake of fun, but by the umpteenth incredible apocalyptic set piece, the special effects have lost their wow factor and the movie's melodrama has become so clichéd that it only serves to annoy. If the world does come to an end on the 21st December 2012, I sure hope its doesn't take as long to happen as it does in this film!Oh, and if by some small chance you find that 2012 isn't as far-fetched as you hoped it would be, be sure to watch the alternative ending—it's really, really, really dumb!5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for taking such an unapologetically absurd approach to Armageddon.",2012
14,moonspinner55,One nick-of-time climax after another; the whole film is a climax...a depressing one,4,20 May 2011,"An American geologist and an astrophysicist from India discover the heat of the Earth's core is increasing, likely to cause massive earthquakes of the 9.0 variety, tsunami waves which will cover what's left of the land, and international panic. While the world's leaders come up with a strategy to beat the odds (for themselves and the most brilliant--i.e., wealthiest--members of humanity), a science fiction writer in Los Angeles attempts to save his estranged wife and two kids from certain death. Director Roland Emmerich's end-of-civilization saga employed hundreds of special effects wizards, technicians, visual design teams, and master craftsmen, so one can be assured that the look of ""2012"" is definitely up-to-date. However, the real cataclysm here is the script, co-written by Emmerich and Harald Kloser, which doggedly follows the writer and his family after every last bit of interest in them as characters has drained out of the movie. The focus of the film is destruction! destruction! destruction! And yet it is so insensitive to the victims of this destruction that when a likable Russian girl near the end drowns in close-up, no one thinks twice about her. It's just business as usual for these gadget-happy disaster mavens, whose mantra seems to be, ""Blow it up and they will come...in droves."" *1/2 from ****",2012
15,paul_haakonsen,Visually stunning...,6,31 December 2015,"""2012"" is actually one of the best disaster movies to date in my opinion. Sure it had a very generic and predictable storyline, but the visual effects outshines all other disaster movies. And that alone makes it well-worth watching this movie.And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.Story-wise, well, then ""2012"" was as every other disaster movie ever made. Mankind stares total annihilation in the face and stands triumphant against impossible odds. Yes, a very generic storyline and one that has been used countless other times in just about every other disaster movie.They had put together quite a good cast for the movie. Of course it was Woody Harrelson who outshines everyone with his performance as the oddball Charlie. But I will also say that John Cusack did quite well in this movie, despite being well out of his usual arena of movie genres. Oliver Platt was also quite good in this given role.I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and every time I am equally blown away by the impressive CGI effects that are shown in ""2012"". This movie is a definite must watch for any fan of the disaster movie genre.",2012
16,Quinoa1984,"If you need explosions and disaster that is downright silly, you get Emmerich, as for story...",5,4 April 2010,"2012 is 158 minutes long. This is longer than other movies by Roland Emmerich that include massive destruction and big explosions and people running from that destruction implausibly without getting killed or destroyed or even really hurt that much, like ID4 and Godzilla. He makes movies so preposterously that they either work tremendously (aforementioned) or they don't (10,000 BC). With 2012 he takes the overrated (yes, overrated) myth of the world ending on 12-21-12, the day the Mayan calendar ends, by creating an immense spectacle of the world ending and humanity starting anew with arks. Yeah. That's really how the story boils down to, or how I would like to boil it down to.There is more story, LOTS more story, so much so that plots go from one to the other, characters are given, um, names and things to say and sometimes do, but by the technique Emmerich sets up we, like the director himself, want to just get to the next big explosion. Especially because about fifteen to twenty minutes of the entire film (primarily in that destruction of California set-piece as the limo goes through the streets and then the plane flies through everything as it's crumbling and tumbling very precisely sideways (no implosions of course)) is actually quite brilliant. This is not being facetious: for at least a small sliver of the runtime, when Emmerich and his crew go for broke, the film is so immensely entertaining precisely because it doesn't give a damn what you think. He'll take down entire blocks, houses, buildings, towers, you name it, he'll kill it and blow it up... just as long as our protogonist and his group make it out all in one piece.But, again, the runtime is 158 minutes. So a lot of the film is characters, like ones played by really good actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt, standing around arguing the same points over and over again (and, in a pragmatic standpoint, the guy we're supposed to hate, the politician played by Platt, makes more sense usually), and the main family of characters- Cusack, Peet, so on- are so one dimensional as to barely have personalities. Even when the Russian actors are brought on to bring some hammy action there's only so much that can be done with wooden dialog, some of it unintentionally funny if one cares to listen to it fully. And when we're mean to take actions the characters take seriously and deeply, like with Danny Glover's President, it's just even more infuriating. Really, stay with the sinking White House (so to speak)? More like unnecessary drama. Only Woody Harrelson, as a complete whacko conspiracy nut with a radio show and a wish to see Yellowstone erupt as a volcano, lights up the screen to 11 with his energy and bravado.What we want to see in the case of 2012 isn't some polemic, and certainly not preachiness. At the least Emmerich sidesteps a lot of religious crap and gives us more-so hokey Scientific stuff. Some of the technical jargon, involving super-neutrinos and tectonic plates and the globe shifting around, will be at best silly and at worst insulting to most scientists, but then again why go to 2012 for science anyway? It's all about watching characters we're meant to care about (and if I did, it was only in the most basic turn-off-your-brain way possible, which means not much actually, albeit Cusack is always likable as an actor), going from one big action set piece to another, all leading up to that ""ark"" made up by the government to ship those people that can get on out of the area before the typhoon hits. A lot of this climax, lasting as long as anything else in the film (which is long), is entertaining, but, again, if you turn off your brain and soak up the consistent, repetitive action scenes (i.e. he'll hold his breath long as he has to... which is a while).So, go ahead, watch 2012, it's certainly nowhere near the worst blockbuster of 2009 (Emmerich can actually direct big explosion-action-disaster-mayhem-murder sequences in a way that is entertaining in a stupid way, unlike Michael Bay's headache inducing versions). Just don't for a second take it seriously, not even when it puts on airs with its good actors and believable sets.",2012
17,ComedyFan2010,A disaster movie that isn't a disaster.,9,21 September 2017,"I must say I love disaster and end of the world movies. And Roland Emmerich is just the best in our time doing them. I hope we will more contributors to the genre soon to have a more diverse type of movies. But 2012 is my favorite among his movies.One always sees crazy reasons for negative reviews. ""Oh it wasn't realistic"". No sh*t, Sherlock. It wasn't a science lecture on the end of the world that has no scientific backup since it isn't supposed to happen outside of the movie. And yes, the family in the movie is damn lucky. If they went for the more ""realistic case"" the movie would be over after half an hour when their car would fall into a hole in the Earth. If you are going to a disaster movie expecting something highly intellectual instead of entertainment than you are not smart enough for intellectual movies anyways. Many complain about ""character development"".Yes there is none. You know why? Because it isn't the goal of the movie. The goal is to show the viewer exciting visual effects. Dramatic soul searching not just takes time of it but also is for a different kind of mood than these movies are. So I went to see a disaster movie and got the best out of it. The visual effects are incredible. And they are all over the movie! There are some breaks where we have some cheesy stories, but they are there only to give us a little break and go on to see some great destruction.",2012
18,edwagreen,2012 is a Real Disaster *1/2,4,10 October 2010,"As is the case with most disaster films, there are excellent special effects here. Imagine, the South Pole moves into Wisconsin!The picture itself is one big cliché. We have a family trying to escape the turmoil. What makes it ironic is that the couple are divorced and they're fleeing along with her current husband. With renewed love and anxiety, you know where this is going.Of course, we see cohesiveness and respect for our fellow human beings as the story unfolds. Naturally, there is Oliver Platt, a government official who is mainly out for his own survival under the guise of the fact that government must continue.Our own U.S. President succumbs for humanity.

19,michaelRokeefe,Catastropic epic.,8,14 November 2009,"Writer/director Roland Emmerich sacrifices dialogue and depends on an almost comical storyline to wow viewers with mega destruction. Sure the CGI, sound and special effects will sell a lot of popcorn and soft drinks. Even word of mouth will put people in theater seats. Just leave any semblance of real intelligence at the box office, lean back and hold on...and let your eyes feast on the powerful scenes of devastation.A geologist(Chiwetel Ejiofor)has the facts and figures that prove validity in the ancient Mayan belief that the wold will come to an end in 2012. He at first will have trouble convincing the President's(Danny Glover)people of the pending doom; but a novelist(John Cusack), who just so happens to have written a book about the lost Atlantis, is an easier believer...and the story line has him and his family out driving and flying the massive earthquakes and tsunamis. And somehow cell phones periodically still work. The finale is actually clever; and as the story eases into salvation, heroic feats of bravery run from sappy to bittersweet.

20,sunwarrior13,Total Popcorn Entertainment,7,3 September 2012,"2012 is a science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich. It stars John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson, among others.Disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012. When a global cataclysm thrusts the world into chaos, divorced writer and father Jackson Curtis (Cusack) joins the race to ensure that humankind is not completely wiped out.He attempts to bring his children, Noah and Lilly , ex-wife Kate Curtis and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman to refuge and attempt to escape the heightened change in the elements. The movie provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.It is basically a total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-plus hours.",2012
21,hitchcockthelegend,And the public gets what the public wants.,7,14 November 2015,"Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.The carnage effects are grade ""A"" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10",2012
22,preppy-3,Does the end of the world have to be so boring????,1,20 November 2009,"According to ancient Mayans the world will end on December 21, 2012. Something about all the planets lined up causing the Earth to fall apart. Geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejofor) finds out and warns people in 2009. The government keeps it secret much to the disgust of the president (Danny Glover). Cut to 2012. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet), HER new bf and their two annoying kids try to evade being killed when California is destroyed. They find a possible solution and rush to safety with destruction close behind.OK--the special effects ARE incredible. Seeing the entire coast of California crumble and be swept away is (in a strange way) kind of fun. All the destruction scenes are unbelievable--but that's maybe 30 minutes out of a movie that runs 160 minutes!!!! The rest is just some very talented actors having to recite some of the WORST dialogue I've ever heard. They're all giving very good performances but no one could make such generic lines work. Dialogue aside the basic plot is silly. Come on--the entire world will just be destroyed in 2012??? Also Cusack and family are constantly making these impossible escapes from near death. This happens CONSTANTLY! Gets dull after the fourth time. Also there are countless subplots and characters that add nothing to the main story. I'm STILL trying to figure out what the hell George Segal was doing here! They're boring and just drag out the movie. At 160 minutes this is FAR too long. 30 minutes or more could have easily been cut out with no loss. To make matters worse the film is constantly make you cry. Likable characters get killed and the film pours on the sentiment. I cry easily and this film set me off more than once...but it's FORCING you to cry. I hate films that do that! A good film wouldn't pull stuff like that. You would cry because you understand the characters and situations. Here it's like writer/director Roland Emmerich is grabbing you by the neck and yelling at you to cry! To make matters worse Woody Harrelson has a small part as a conspiracy nut and overacts to a degree that is just embarrassing.So--the special effects are incredible but the boring characters, ridiculous story and length make this a real chore to sit through. But then what can I expect from the guy who gave us ""Independence Day""? I give this a 1.",2012
23,CinemaSerf,"Great looking but poorly executed, overly derivative, end of the world movie.",6,13 March 2021,"Chiwetel Ejiofor is geologist (""Helmsley"") who discovers that the core of our planet is heating up, and that we are going to be facing some existential threats unless we do something, pronto! Meantime, John Cusack (""Curtis"") stumbles upon the same (top secret) information and must race to rescue his family (of course there is an ex-wife with whom he has an ""interesting"" relationship and two weans) from this impending doom. Yeah, it does all sound familiar doesn't it? Add to this mix the shockingly wooden Oliver Platt as the government man trying to implement their exit plan on huge arks, and we have a recipe for a really good looking, but stodgily constructed disaster movie. Fortunately, we do get a little humour from Zlatko Buric (""Karpov""), a Russian billionaire with a very useful Bentley, a feisty trophy wife and - most importantly - a family ticket for one of the arks; and there is also a brief cameo from HM Queen Elizabeth II (and the corgis) as we build to the denouement. It's the ending that really lets the thing down. As with much of the rest of it, the plot - usually involving Cusack - constantly goes from frying pan to fire and the jeopardy is increasingly and thereby implausibly repetitive and forced. The last ten minutes ought to be exciting and gripping, but instead they just had me praying that the thing would just get through the boringly inevitable series of conscience-wrenching moralising before reaching a conclusion that was totally devoid of any tension. Certainly, this film looks every inch the part - and $199,999,000 of the budget was creatively spent by the VFX department. It's just a shame the rest of the writing and direction effort only had the remaining thousand dollars to share amongst them all.",2012

When the year comes John Cusack attempts to save his family from the impending doom.There is no honest way to review this film. As a drama the film is laughably bad. Its simply awful and one of the worst in the truly awful pantheon of disaster films. If you've seen films like When Time Ran Out or some of the Japanese doomsday movies from the 1970's you'll have a good idea how bad this all is. Then again I can't see anyone wanting to see this for the sterling dialog.As a showcase for special effects and destruction this film is amazing. If you've ever wanted to see California slide into the ocean here's your chance. Let me be honest the destruction in the film is incredible and way cool and is the reason to see this film. Its just about as far as you can go in showing the world being destroyed and still feel good at the end. Its amazing.If you like cool special effects give this film a shot, but wait for home video where you can crank up your home theater and crack the walls.

25,zardoz-13,The Special Effects Overshadow the Second-Rate Disaster Saga,4,25 November 2009,"Writer & director Roland Emmerich has described ""2012"" as ""a modern retelling of Noah's Ark,"" and his description is spot-on specific. Emmerich reigns as the duke of cinematic disaster. He launched his epic-scale disaster classic ""Independence Day"" and followed it up with ""Godiza"" and then ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Short of blowing up the universe, Emmerich cannot continue to tp the scope of these films in term of sheer magnitude. Some of the problems with ""2012"" is that it lacks any villains. Late in the fourth quarter somebody utters a line about the operation not being a conspiracy. Guess Emmerich and co-scribe Harald Kloser forgot about the Louve Museum curator who dies in a fiery car crash in Paris because he was going to spill the beans about the approaching disaster. Far-fetched heroics and superlative special effects cannot raise this mind-numbing disaster movie above its hopeless generic origins. None of the heroes are unusual, charismatic, or interesting. ""Con-Air"" star John Cusack does his dad role again while Woody Harrelson plays an off-his-rocker broadcaster. The turgid story turns into a global odyssey from Southern California to China and the paths of a motley collection of protagonists intertwine as they struggle to save their own lives along with their families. Not surprisingly, the special effects overshadow the characters. The California and Las Vegas calamity scenes are tour-de-force, but they are wasted in a mundane melodrama about a desperate dad who rescues his cute ex-wife Kate Curtis(Amanda Peet of ""Syriana"") and their two young kids Noah & Lilly Curtis(Liam James and Morgan Lily) along step-dad Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy of ""Duplicity"") from certain death in Southern California. As Jackson Curtis, Cusack drives a limo for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric of the ""Pusher"" movies) and has written a science fiction novel entitled ""Farewell Atlantis"" that, though it sold less than 500 copies, impressed government scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""American Gangster"")enough that he wants to preserve it for posterity. The ""GoldenEye"" style scene in a Russian cargo jet plunging into an enormous chasm that was once the Las Vegas strip is the second-best scene after the wholesale destruction of Santa Monica. Some of the back projection looks really obvious. Not only is screenplay by writer & director Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser incredibly pedestrian, but it also takes them some time to build up a head of steam. Ostensibly, they hang their narrative on the Mayan calendar that predicts an earthly cataclysm in the year 2012. ""2012"" starts three years before the events with some dull exposition. Actually, the ground-breaking special effects don't kick in until about 45 minutes into the action after all this dreary expository build-up. Although this science fiction fantasy lacks the excitement of ""Independence Day"", ""2012"" surpasses than ""The Day After Tomorrow"" because it is an international disaster movie. The breathless pace of the California scenes isn't repeated, and the film sinks into a coma during the second half of its interminable two-and-a-half-hour plus running time with its final scenes in China where everybody is rushing to climb aboard a number of huge arks. These large commodious vessels look pretty cool. Of course, a last-minute complication crops up that prevents the American ark from getting under way and it comes as no surprise that Jackson Curtis will have to save the day. Danny Glover of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies is cast as an older Obama-type U.S. President who prefers to stay behind and the closest to a villain that ""2012"" has is Wilson's chief of staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt of ""Don't Say a Word""), who has no problems leaving the poor behind in the wake of destruction.",2012
26,Calicodreamin,Not the best disaster movie,5,9 April 2021,"Not the worst disaster movie ever made, but certainly not the best.

27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""When they tell you not to panic... that's when you run""",7,27 November 2009,"The quote I chose for the summary is an example of how this may frighten people(and I mean outside the safe environment of the darkened movie theater). Let's start by getting that out of the way; the world is not going to end in three years, scientists agree that it will not be that soon. And before you say ""but the Mayans said..."", no, they did not. That's a common misunderstanding. No, the fact is, their calendar *for a certain period of time* ends 2012. And then another one starts. Actually, as far as I understand, they did not really predict an Armageddon. There are people who want it to mean that the planet will be toast in that little time, and, hey, if you want to, I'm not going to stop you. Just... if you want to be informed, look it up. Don't listen to every self-proclaimed Nostradamus. With that out of the way... this is typical Emmerich stuff. If you've seen one... yeah. The effects, which are excellent, are the focus. A lot of them don't affect the viewer; their grandeur and epic scope alienate us. FX improve and their status gets upgraded from ""story-telling tool"" to ""main attraction"". There is not room for much emotion, though this does evoke a bit here and there. And it definitely is a cool ride of dumb, fun thrills. I can't claim that I wasn't excited and entertained, at times, or that I was pulled out of the experience by anything. The pacing varies, and the thing's at least half an hour too long. Tonally, this is mostly serious, with some comic relief(and the majority of that is not irritating, and that's a nice surprise). It even garners a few laughs, here and there. The acting tends to be great, and the cast is good, and well-chosen. Unusually, the children are not annoying. With few exceptions, this has marvelous editing and cinematography. The script displays naiveté and contains clichés. There is violence(largely mild) and intense sequences, as well as infrequent moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of disaster flicks and/or the team behind these. 7/10",2012

Doomsday melodramatic cheese churned with bombastic glee by latter-day Irwin Allen of the 21st century/disaster impresario Roland Emmerich proffers the end-of-the-world in the titular annui while positioning family man/Everyman Cusack to save his brood from imminent death. The real stars of the genre flick are of course the jaw-dropping, eye-popping special effect visual wizardry (to wit for my bang for the buck money shot: the wipe-out of Los Angeles is truly worth the price of admission); having said that (i.e. shooting its wad) the film is logy in its pacing and length (nearly 3 hours; you'd think the end of the world would be quicker?) with far too many 'plot lines' and characters you frankly don't care too much about.

You're going to get two things - vast quantities of death and destruction, and some vague human interest to give you an emotional stake in it. So what we get is kind of a noughties version of Irwin Allen, only with CGI instead of miniatures.This time it's John Cusack's turn to play a cipher of a dad who is trying to rescue his estranged family from the fate awaiting the rest of the world. That's your plot, folks. There isn't even the ecological preaching from The Day After Tomorrow. No, you get some scientific balderdash in the first five minutes, and that's your lot.This is very much a ""put your brain on hold and enjoy the eye candy while you munch your popcorn"" movie. It doesn't bear close examination on any level whatsoever (where did the ash from the Yellowstone Park eruption go? Anyone?) but the eye candy is wonderful.As usual, Emmerich overplays the ""narrow escape"" card, particularly during the drive out of Los Angeles.There is a particularly irritating character who keeps insisting he can't fly planes despite the fact that a) he can and b) if he doesn't then he and the rest of his group will die within the next 30 seconds.This is big budget trash, but highly entertaining nevertheless.",2012
30,evanston_dad,So Dumb It's Not Really Any Fun,2,13 April 2010,"I made the mistake of watching ""2012"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" in the same weekend. I think I can still feel my brain cells dying.I can enjoy a big, dumb movie as much as the next guy, and anyone going into ""2012"" thinking it's NOT going to be a big dumb movie deserves what he gets, but come ON. Did it have to be THIS dumb? John Cusack looks bored and embarrassed to be headlining this special effects extravaganza about the end of the world. He plays an obscure writer who leads his family to safety as the Earth's crust becomes separated from its core and starts to slip around like a loose sock. As far as I can tell, this means that the South Pole ends up where Milwaukee, Wisconsin used to be, but somehow whole mountain ranges, cities (what's left of them after mega-quakes tear them apart) and the people still living are able to just ride around the world's axis like they're on a big merry-go-round. The first action sequence is so preposterous that it leaves the film nowhere to go. Cusack, driving the best-made limo of all time, out runs a fault that is tearing Los Angeles away from the continental United States, even at one point (I'm not making this up) driving it through a building as it's collapsing(!) to end up safely on the other side. Why is it that if I tried this I'd pop a tire within two minutes? This scene, and many more like it, are played for yucks, which doesn't help. The special effects are surprisingly bad for such a high-profile movie. But the worst thing about ""2012"" is how tired it feels. Roland Emmerich is now stealing from himself, taking stray parts of his other movies and patching them together in the hopes that they'll again strike gold.The cast also includes Amanda Peet, who tries valiantly to give an actual performance, and at the other end of the spectrum, Woody Harrelson, who the Motion Picture Academy should sue for defamation. Being nominated for an Oscar in the same year that you give a performance like the one he gives here pretty much discounts 80 odd years of Academy history.Grade: D",2012

There is every kind of disaster in it - water, volcano, earth quake, the most exciting car and plane rides - you get your money's worth and more. Far better than any of Roland's previous movies. A good blend of grand scale disaster scenes and close up terror. The destruction of LA is stunning. Could have dwelt a bit longer in the other cities.The only problem was the casting. Amanda Peet's face was stony and showed no terror or even anxiety. John Cusack was a little bit too un-leading man for the role. Chiwetel Ejiofor looked a little un-scientist. Thandie Newton came across as very un-American to be the first daughter. Danny Glover was a little too old and senile for the President - not dignified at all.Screenplay had a few cheesy moments about ""humanity"" that could have been left out.This should win best effects over Avatar any time.

32,gradyharp,Noah's Ark: The Haves and the Have Nots,5,29 March 2010,"2012 is an odd film. It can be viewed on a number of levels: it brings to the public eye the old Mayan prediction that the earth and civilization as we know it will be destroyed on December 21, 2012, it is an exercise in computer generated graphics in the hands of Roland Emmerich, it poses a few questions as to what is important in life and how learning what is important is learning how to live in the now, and it is a roller coaster corny simplistic mess of a plot that sells out at every chance it gets to make a meaningful statement. The cast, watching the crumbling and burning of the planet, is huge. John Cusack is a satisfying hero/returned dad, Chiwetel Ejiofor represents the good in science, Oliver Platt propels the action with his usual ability to steal a scene, Woody Harelson is, well, Woody Harelson as dopey as ever, Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet add the appropriate glamour and love interests, Danny Glover makes a fine President of the USA, Johann Urb is a very screen-powerful presence as a Russian pilot, and Osric Chau makes a very positive impression as a personality the camera loves and a character with whom we can identify (he needs some important roles to allow us to further examine his potential). And there are others equally as well cast. What will bother those who find a degree of credence and associated anxiety with the Mayan prediction will be sorry to see the silly manner in which 400,000 of mankind and animalkind are saved in boats to land in Africa to restart civilization. But then this is Hollywood and Roland Emmerich tends to concentrate more on CGI than on content. It is long, but then it is entertaining - to a point. Grady Harp",2012

I didn't mind because I knew that you needed CGI to make this flick. A big cheer to those guys. It's unbelievable to see what they did, already seen The Day After Tomorrow (same guys) but this is a lot more. Sadly it fails in storyline. And that's the reason why it only got a 4 from me. Be honest, it becomes even childish, this is one of those over the top Hollywood productions that is so ridiculous that a 8 year old child never would be frightened. The happy ending, the take off twice with a plane, some things that make you go huh? The subway almost crashing into that plane.

There is way too many sappy depressing end of the world scenes in this film. Please someone get me the crying towel! Then the rest of the movie is watching C G I which is boring. When C G I came out it was something new but now it is no longer that exciting. One could watch just as good graphics from a video game. I know we are suppose to turn our brains off when we watch this tripe. BUT COME ON! NO Way.... R Vs cannot outrun a volcano, or jump 900 feet.

35,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: 2012,7,14 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich has already established himself as the go-to man if anyone in Hollywood wants to make an event film to entertain the masses. We've had an intergalactic portal open up in Stargate, an alien invasion with Independence Day, a bastardization of Japan's iconic monster Godzilla, a what-if tale of a freezing winter when hell turneth over with The Day After Tomorrow, and now, 2012. Instead of repeating oneself on the negative outcomes of global warming and a consequence of our raping the environment, this one breezes you through some mumbo-jumbo physics, which ultimately translates into the Earth's core heating up and Mother Nature running a severe fever, which results in hurling everything at mankind, from volcanic eruptions, massive tidal waves and of course, some insane shifting of tectonic plates which only mean one thing - an immense and tremendous cinematic destruction of the world as we know it on celluloid.To some, you'll be told to park your brains at the door. To others, they wonder how dumb a film can be in magnifying some hocus-pocus doomsday scenario. Bottom line in my opinion, this is nothing but a tentpole pop corn film for purely entertainment purposes, so if you can't accept this, then don't buy a ticket and be the party pooper. In essence, this film is more like an amusement ride, where the price of an admission ticket almost guarantees a thrilling roller coaster ride from start to finish, despite a relatively slow opening to establish a whole slew of key characters and their relationships with one another, before allowing Nature to unleash its fury in all its digital glory.Effects wise, the teaser did just enough to pique one's interest. I have to admit that watching entire land masses swallowed up by the oceans was pretty terrifying, yet these money shots are just that, the hook for someone to bite and make a beeline for the theatres. CG is carefully crafted here to make it look realistic, and detailed enough for anyone going for repeated screenings to pick out additional, minute attributes that were missed the first time round. After all, it's world wide pandemonium we're talking about here, and there's a systematic way in how the world gets destructed on screen. Unfortunately though you would be able to notice that some of the simpler effects don't get properly rendered and may come across as cheap, though thankfully the larger spectacles clearly got more devotion in getting them done right.That aside, the mammoth run time allowed for a lot of subplots and themes to be discussed, which turned out to be the surprising gem within 2012. Granted there are unnecessary tangents that could have been removed to allow for a tighter story, such as the entire cruise ship arc which turned out to be nothing more than a pissing competition at Poseidon's (the remake) way, and didn't contribute much other than to allow alternative, uninteresting perspectives besides the cursory warning of never to allow regrets to remain status quo. Or the usual lapses into bravado speeches to rouse the human spirit in survival, which turn out to be rather cliché and boring as well.The world as we know in the film is into its bleakest hour, and how do you inform anyone about the magnitude of disaster to come? Public announcements would lead to no law nor order, and the breakdown of civil society, and it's up to a group of G8 governments to set a secret agenda in a race against time to ensure that they can ensure the continuity of the human race, by playing Noah themselves.Emerich has this time round become a little bit more all inclusive in having some non-US centric participation, though this did also seem like a statement to be more politically correct than anything else. Infusing some real world sensibilities, even the location and prowess needed to embark on their massive projects, were left to the Chinese for their impeccable diligence and hard work (not to mention being the world's factory too), and probably a nod to their engineering.What would raise eyebrows in its morality tale, is how proponents in the way this hushed up secret project would become, and the silencing of detractors or those who cannot keep a secret. Natural selection based on superior gene pool got thrown out the window as well, as predetermined survivors were chosen on the basis of wealth, which of course reflects the way how capitalist societies operate in with money talking loudest. Which makes you wonder how other science fiction films which have similar premises, would have tackled this issue, from Wall E to Pandorum even.Anyway those are things that were touched upon, but not dwelled in further detail because as I mentioned, it's a film for mass appeal entertainment, finding time to poke fun at world figures and politicians such as Queen Elizabeth II, and the Californian governor. Having a large ensemble cast is part of the fun as well, and they play nothing more than cardboard characters each given a specific thing to contribute in the film. If I lists some of them down as average Joe Jackson Curtis played by John Cusack, his estranged wife played by Amanda Peet, Kinky Boots' Chiwetel Ejiofor as a prominent scientist, Danny Glover as the US President, Thandie Newton as the First Daughter, Woody Harrelson as an over the top doomsday soothsayer, and more from Morgan Lili, Oliver Platt, Jimi Mistry and Lisa Lu, to Singaporean Chin Han, who plays a young TIbetian worker.If you're looking for entertainment, then look no further than 2012, the tentpole film for this week. Just remember to check your expectations, and buckle up for that adrenaline rush. Make sure you're opting to see this in a digital hall, with a good sound system enough to reverberate the audio shockwaves across the entire screening hall.",2012
36,siderite,Worse than I had imagined,6,26 December 2009,"I heard about the movie later than most because I don't watch TV so much. When I did it was something like ""hey, did you hear about that movie that comes out this winter with the end of the world?"". So, naturally, I thought the worst of the film itself. Then I heard about Roland Emmerich directing it and started to have hopes. Then the first reviews from friends came out. I was told it was nothing else than the total destruction of the Earth, but not much else. Well, that should be fun.Now my subjective view on the matter: they hired some graphics engineers and told them to destroy the planet. Engineers, given their nature, happily obliged. Meanwhile, the director was looking for actors that are cheap enough, but known to all, so that people actually notice the scenes they are in. After the graphics guys did it, they shot the actors around the scenes and tried to give the film a story. And failed. But who cares about the story anyway? So they shipped it. (well, it's a pun in there, but you have to see the movie to get it).Le me recap. Neutrinos mutate! they come from the Sun! they interact with matter! so the Earth crust crumbles worse than in Neverending Story under the assault of the Nothing (here is the part you want to see), while cars honk and subways continue to function (meh, engineers). In the end the people of the Earth (the rich ones) regain their humanity and help a bunch of other stranded rich guys while the world ends. Why didn't they just make it a game? Or an animation movie? What was the purpose of all that pseudo scientific mambo jumbo?Bottom line: watch it with a lot of popcorn and sickly sweet juice, preferably with some mutated neutrinos. They'll get the joke.",2012

Our topic of day, is the Mega-Budgeted, Hugely-Awaited Emmerich's '2012'.Now when you make film on a phenomenon like this, you better make a highly gripping & nail-biting fare... In terms of Graphics, '2012' is a all-rounder, but in terms of screenplay.... it has minuses written all over it.'2012' starts off really well... the first disaster sequence with John Cusack & family flying off in plane is a delight. It's one of the most gripping sequences ever in a movie. Unfortunately, right after that the film starts getting tedious. Even the climax in the ship doesn't create any impact. Well 'Africa' will love this movie for sure... you guys know what I mean! Another aspect that goes completely against the film is the track between The President & his daughter. It's just doesn't touch you, emotion is completely missing. This track could've easily been avoided.In a film like '2012' you don't expect much from the acting department, but here's a mention for John Cusack who delivers a sincere performance. He is the soul of the film. Others do what they supposed are to do, 'Scream'.on the whole... We {Humans} are anyways Ass Holes... so 12-21-12 isn't really a bad sentence for us! Right?",2012
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, come on, is that the best you can do Ronald Emmerich?!",3,14 January 2010,"Roland Emmerich, what can you say about this guy? We love him, we hate him; he makes bad movies, but they're hella entertaining. I don't know what this guy has against the world, but it seems like he likes to blow it up in any way possible. From Independence Day to Godzilla to The Day After Tomorrow, we now have 2012. Which ironically I think it's funny that the director got this totally mixed up. I love to watch the history channel, so I know the whole ""myth"" around the year 2012, it has nothing to do with the world ending or being shifted. Not to say that this is never going to happen, but it's not set in stone for the year 2012. But 2012, let's go for it, end of the world! Let's talk about the end of the world, Roland Emmerich said in an interview that this is most likely going to be his last adventure movie and if you are going to retire what you're best known for: Go out with a bang! 2012 limits what he shows as the ""world"" crumbles: Los Angeles has the big earthquake, Yellow Stone National Park gets a volcano, and China has a tycoon come in. That's it! I live in Chicago and it's never mentioned in the film so I can't help but laugh and say ""Well, I guess we're safe. I'm just going to look out the window one day confused why penguins are in the back yard"".Jackson Curtis is a writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for wealthy Russian businessman. Jackson's ex-wife Kate and their children Noah and Lily live with her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lily on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park, where they meet Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist living as a hermit and hosting a radio show from the park. Charlie references a theory that suggests the Mayans predicted the world would come to an end in 2012, and claims he has knowledge and a map of a secret ""space ship"" project. As evidence for his claims, he notes the suspicious deaths of many scientists who attempted to warn the public before information about the catastrophe was de-classified. The family returns home as cracks develop along the San Andreas Fault in California and earthquakes occur in many places along the west coast. Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon when the Earth's crust displacement begins and they escape Los Angeles as it slides into the Pacific Ocean. As the world collapses around them, they try to fly to China to board a ship meant only for the rich and VIP people of the world that will ensure their survival.While 2012 is entertaining on the special effects level, it's in no way realistic, so the story blew it on any level that I could have had respect for. For God's sake, my friend is in the navy and while we were watching this movie he mentioned how in Washington, DC, the USS Kennedy no longer exists and yet it does in this movie. Another thing, I love John Cussack, but is he the new Arnold Schwartzenegger? For God's sake, it seems like Ronald throws everything at him and yet something he manages to escape at last second for each disaster. My favorite is a tie: either they go to Yellow Stone to find their friend, but when the volcano erupts they drive away while meteors are being thrown at them and even hit's the RV they're driving and somehow it still manages to pull forward. Second being how they're able to fly an airplane over an erupting volcano as it would actually pull them down due to the air clogging the engine. Ronald also picks Danny Glover as president! LMAO! Are you serious?! I was just waiting for him to say ""I'm getting to old for this.."" when he finds out about the world ending. He and Thandie Newton seemed so out of place for the film.Please don't think that I hated this movie, I was just extremely disappointed, even if we want to be unrealistic on every level, it's OK. I just felt like this was a let down, like I said if Ronald wants to make this his last film, he should just go for it and make the world suffer. Unless he makes another film with him as a giant and just stepping on all the big cities, I'd buy a ticket on the spot. But I fell for it with 2012, it's totally worth it on the big screen just to see the special effects, but it's not going to have the same effect at home. The special effects were the only thing that made this film tolerable, but just a warning in advance, it's 2 and a ½ hours! Way too long, stupid story, bad characters; let's put it this way, if you like disaster movies, this is to be seen on the big screen, otherwise, just skip it.3/10",2012
39,disdressed12,it was entertaining,6,6 March 2010,"if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 6/10",2012
40,KineticSeoul,What Roland Emmerich calls his last disaster film,6,14 February 2010,"2012 just basically tries to impress the audiences with special effects showing destruction after destruction and that is all it basically does. But that is just what you would expect from a Roland Emmerich films, although I will admit some were actually sort of entertaining. But since this is his last disaster movie or so he claimed, I actually sort of had a bit of expectations for this. But besides the special effects all it offered was hollow characters and very stereotypical and dumb characters, the plot wasn't even intelligent and was actually dull. The destruction is cool to look at but after a while you start to get numb to it. So what Emmerich does is show destruction after destruction of certain monuments around the world. So the plot is basically this, in the Mayan calendar it is predicted that in 2012 on winter solstice the planets will line up which will cause solar flares and it will effect earth in a way it will cause major destruction and during this chaos people are trying to survive. And while this is going on it hardly shows any death, mainly just destruction. This is a silly disaster film and a very long one at that, I mean it was actually kinda fun to watch the destruction and all but when a film like this is over 2 and a half hours long, than you just start to get bored. Anyways as dumb as it is, this is worth checking out on the big screen to get everything out of it, which is basically the special effects.6.2/10",2012
41,sddavis63,A Fun Special Effects Action/Adventure,8,27 March 2010,"Sure the plot is ridiculous. And,to be honest, the performances in this aren't that great, either. Still, when it's over, this movie leaves you feeling as if you've been on quite a ride. It's a special effects extravaganza - and the special effects are done very well; certainly some of the best FX work I've come across in a very long time. And that's what the whole thing revolves around: one special effects behemoth scene after another, with virtually everything (after a rather slow opening 10 minutes or so) being action/adventure and very little attention being paid to plot. Yeah, we get the basics. Some massive solar flare activity has affected the earth and is basically causing our world to turn itself inside out for lack of a better way to put it. The story (such as it is) is about the attempts of the international community to find a way to save our species (at least a few hundred thousand of us.) Considering all the publicity this movie received (or, perhaps it's better to say all the attention the ancient Mayan calendar received because of the movie) I was surprised by how little attention was actually paid to the ancient Mayan calendar in this. I believe it was mentioned a couple of times, but it certainly wasn't front and centre.It's strange to say that this was enjoyable - strange because of the poor story, the sub-par acting and the very weak attempts at humour that are scattered throughout, which seemed out of place and in some cases just too cute (think of the scene in which Gordon and Kate are in a supermarket and Gordon suggests that it feels as if they're splitting apart - at which point the supermarket indeed splits apart with them on either side of the divide.) Right. Too cute. And yet, this is well worth watching. It's fun, action-packed, energetic and it leaves your head spinning at times. I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable.",2012
42,Buddy-51,Put your brain on hold,5,7 January 2011,"In the not-so-grand tradition of ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""Earthquake,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Deep Impact,"" ""The Core,"" etc., ""2012"" is a big-budget disaster picture with a low-budget mentality. Just how foolish it will look in 2013 is anyone's guess - though it couldn't possibly look any more foolish than it did when it was released in 2009. And all courtesy of that Grand Poobah of disaster flicks, Roland Emmerich.The doomsday scenario in this instance comes in the form of exploding solar radiation that has become so intense that it's begun to cause the Earth's core to melt (like a microwave oven, we're told), resulting in the wholesale destruction of the planet's crust. This obviously doesn't bode well for the people dwelling on the surface, where life as we know it will soon cease to exist - just as the Mayans so cannily predicted centuries ago.As with any disaster-movie worthy of the title, the story involves little more than an assortment of stock characters trying to keep one step ahead of the impending apocalypse. This particular cross-section of humanity includes John Cusack as a writer of prescient but less-than-commercially-successful sci-fi novels, Amanda Peet as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as the President of the United States, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, Oliver Platt as his self-interested Chief of Staff, Chiwetel Ejiofor as a brilliant geologist, and, for comic relief purposes, Woody Harrelson as a bug-eyed, trailer-dwelling, crackpot conspiracy theorist whose theoretic conspiracies turn out to be anything but crackpot.And because of the enormous and far-reaching nature of the disaster, the movie can borrow bits from any number of previous disaster movies and get away with it; thus, we get a touch of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" here, a smidgen of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" there. Heck, there's even a hint of ""Wall-E"" in the closing moments.There's always an odd and uncomfortable moral principle operating in films of this type: namely, who cares if the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket, so long as our intrepid band of survivors (usually including an adorable pet or two) makes its way to safety. And the trite and corny estranged-spouse melodrama involving Cusack and Peet that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Klasser have seen fit to plaster onto their vision of a worldwide holocaust is enough to make us start rooting for humanity's wholesale annihilation long before the movie's hit the halfway mark. Apparently, in contradiction to what Rick said at the end of ""Casablanca,"" the problems of a couple of little people DO amount to a hill of beans, after all - at least in the eyes of Hollywood.Of course, one doesn't go to these types of films in search of grand themes or complex characterizations, but rather for the epic and wanton destruction of all things animate and inanimate - and in that respect, at least, ""2012"" delivers the goods. In fact, the action and special effects are so preposterous and over-the-top that one can't help but admire the sheer, unadulterated, childlike trashiness of it all.So hunker on down to watch humanity get the ass-kicking of a lifetime - just make sure to have plenty of popcorn and Jujubes on hand to help get you through the experience.",2012
43,thesar-2,"OMG2012 might happen. Actually, I'd rather die on 12/21/12 than watch this again.",1,2 December 2009,"Funny. On a recent episode of Family Guy, Brian gets a earful of truth serum from Quagmire and the last thing (of many) Quagmire said was: ""You know what, I could forgive all of that, all of that, if you weren't such a bore.""I forgave a lot of what was wrong in 2012 but the one thing I couldn't bypass is that it was such a bore. And that was the one thing that surprised me the most. Even knowing it was way too long at over 2½ hours, I didn't expect such Pearl Harbor moments that made me yawn and wonder what the heck were they thinking?What I did know, was how silly it was from the 5-minute internet-released trailer. I figured I would laugh, or at least snicker at some of the scenes. I found myself doing that at more than one occasion, and it wasn't the blatant and unrealistic destruction scenes. It was just how bad this movie was, when they tried to show ""heart"" or ""feeling"" or ""warmth."" Or at the consistent ""near-misses"" for our, uh, so-called, ""heroes."" Or the number of plane dipping.Despite the sometimes good special effects – I honestly can't justify giving it an extra half star for that due to the overwhelming negatives, I will say this in the movie's favor: I didn't snicker or laugh out loud as many times as I thought I would. (Side note: I watched both Twilight and The Happening because I was in the mood for a comedy and for the most part, I did laugh heartedly throughout those two films.) In this film, I was just simply bored. And also previously mentioned, this movie was so Pearl Harbor, where there were just a few scenes of mass-destruction, the reason people would want to see this mess or the reason they made it, and the rest was just plain awful. Awful, awful, awful and terribly bad.Shame on you, Cusack. Selling out. Again, that is. You could've been one of my all-time favorite actors. It all started going downhill since Con Air. Sure, he's had one or two good movies since, such as 1408. (Weird, perhaps he should choose more wisely for movie titles that contain only four digits.)Following Emmerich's very similar The Day After Tomorrow, a million things completely impossible happen within a matter of days. Here we have the very wrong theory of 12/21/12 where the Mayan calendar ends and the world as we know it shifts axis, thus destroying all mankind and man's kind of civilization. Enter in the very stereotypical divorced dad (Cusack here, Quaid in Tomorrow) and his ex, his kids, the new beauthe whole cast is recycled sitcom/disaster-movie characters.Butthat's not what you bought a ticket for, right? It was to see big explosions. Am I right? Well, unfortunately, they're so few and far between, it's hard to justify a recommendation – heck, it's like 40+ minutes before anything happens. And what's worse, is the fake ""heart-filled"" scenes and really, really, REALLY bad jokes and puns.Okay, this movie is fairly, make that enormously easy to ridicule. It wasn't made to earn Oscars – though I am sure it's going to be up for special effects, but come on. Try a little bit. Try to show real emotion, real dialogue, real people. Do something memorable.I expect this out of Michael Bay. He cares more about using gasoline to explode stuff than character development, genuine thrills, emotion and plot development. Though Emmerich is only a half a step higher, he will genuinely win the contests between the two buffoons. Here, he not only matches Bay's horrible movie-making qualities, he almost takes the prize away from Transformers 2 as the worst of 2009.To sum up, this movie is all disaster movies in one: Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon, Pearl Harbor, Independence Day, Deep Impact, Dante's Peak and many more. Heck, it mimicked Wall-E, and I should be shot for stating that. It has horrible acting, clichés (oh, the clichés!), dialogue, comedy and thee most unrealistic scenes of flight ever on film. I mean, really, how many lives do these nobodies have? How many times do we have to see a plane dip? Seriously, how many coincidences and luck-outs do this boring broken family have?I think this was sincerely made for only two types of people: those who actually believe 12/21/12 is the end (ha ha ha ha ha – I've said this before, but I sincerely don't believe in this ""end of time"" conspiracy theory, but even if I am wrong, I'll be dead with everyone else, so who cares?) and for those who just blindly want to see millions die as buildings collide. To each their own, but I appreciate a movie-goer who appreciates film as an art and not as mindless special effects engine.And the joke's on you people. Both kinds. But, speaking specifically to the later group, you'll get like maybe 30 minutes out of 158 of what you paid your money for. I'm glad you'll have to suffer through the rest, for the low taste you have.(Okay, that last part was harsh. Again, to each their own. But each ticket sold – like the never-ending Saw series, justifies these crappy movies. I have made it a point to cease watching the Saw movies for this very reason: I have to stop being part of the problem. For the money I spend, I expect more. And with less tickets sold, Hollywood might actually take notice.)",2012
44,FeastMode,epic movie surrounded by a terrible story,5,17 January 2021,"I watched this movie in the theaters back when it came out. decided to give it another shot. early on i could tell it was a bad movie. then the first action scene happened and i was pretty much blown away. then more awful human parts. then amazing action. rinse and repeat.the human parts had so many eye-rolling moments, things that made me say ""wait... what?"", scenes that had no business being in the movie, completely useless subplots, tons of cliches, and some unintentionally hilarious moments.the action was soooooo epic, and still mostly holds up. there were so many great scenes, lots of cool and creative ways to get more excitement out of a completely straight-forward survival story (about 2 viewings, 1/16/2021)",2012
45,Robert_duder,Yet again Emmerich defines the disaster in disaster movie,5,2 March 2010,"Anyone remember when Roland Emmerich was a respected director for entertainment? He has taken epic to a new level and kept his films mainstream and enormously successful. Independence Day, The Patriot, 10,000 BC (I liked it) and now this. How could one possibly expect this film would come out a bigger disaster then the one it portrays? Early trailers had me drooling. Mayan prophecy, worldwide disaster, John Cusack, non-stop action...it was the one time I would go to the movies in the summer of 2009 and not have to wonder if the film would entertain. So imagine my shock when after the first half hour I had rolled my eyes more than eaten popcorn. Any disaster film, or sci-fi flick, or even most films require a suspension of belief but the true mark of a great film maker is to make you belief that you can suspend your belief. Think about it...Emmerich made us BELIEVE that Aliens could invade and that Will Smith could kick their ass, he made us BELIEVE that we were watching early man go through trials and tribulations in a world full of mastodons and beasts of all kinds. 2012...the only think I believed was that this film was a joke, and I wasted my ten bucks.John Cusack is a terrific actor. He has a screen presence like many aspire to have. He still has the same draw even amongst a horrendous plot. Even someone with any less charisma had been in this role...I probably would have walked out. Amanda Peet can also act. She's had good roles and most of her roles have been in comedy and yet here she is trying to make us believe she is on the run with her family to save her life during the end of the world. It just doesn't work. She isn't strong enough to lead the kind of intensity required for this role. However, her and Cusack have really good chemistry and a great romantic comedy would do them both wonders. Woody Harrelson gives a stand out cameo performance as the eccentric broadcaster Charlie Frost. He is perhaps the one exception to an otherwise shockingly and unfortunately bland cast. Harrelson fans can rest easy. Tom McCarthy gives a decent performance as Peet's new boyfriend and an adversary to Cusack at first before they bond over disaster. He is lucky to do a decent job because he doesn't have a lot of charisma and fortunately his character is a nice guy. The supporting cast is made up of some really talented actors in completely lifeless roles. Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Thandie Newton are some of the big names in the film. They're performances can't even be commented on because they are simply boring and never used.So much has been said about 2012's special effects. All of it is true. The special effects are mind blowing, breath taking, brilliant and this is practically the sole reason this film gets a 5 from me and not a big fat goose egg. The sheer setting of destruction in this film is amazing. I would rather have watched two hours of the world falling to pieces and nothing else than force silly characters into ridiculous situations. For one thing, Cusack's family (his two children, ex-wife and new boyfriend) are literally ALWAYS being followed just steps behind by the end of the world. Imagine that? Every disaster is always right behind them and they ALWAYS escape by milliseconds. One reviewer said it was hard to watch characters surviving through this in the most ridiculous manner and that is exactly true. Nail biting? No it is just silly. And the script is just as ludicrous. The one liners and inappropriate comedic moments, and then on top of that the so called ""serious dialogue"" is ridiculous and will make you laugh when you should be on the edge of your seat. One of the last lines in the film is a transmission from someone who has discovered land. They say something to the effect of the disaster not being as widespread as they though. It wiped out 99% of the entire earth? That's pretty widespread. Sorry Mr. Emerich but your movie made me hope the end wasn't in 2012 but 2009...when this movie ended. 5/10",2012
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"The effects are better than ever, everything else is as laughable as before",7,31 May 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Serious film connoisseurs will be familiar with Roland Emmerich and the type of epic, big budget, effects laden blockbuster films he specialises in. They never fail to impress with the 'wow' factor, from the alien spacecraft towering over the White House in Independence Day, to the world freezing over in The Day After Tomorrow. His latest effort focuses on the Ancient Mayan prediction that the world will end in the titular year, when the earth splits open and sinks under a tonne of water. The focus falls on errant father and failed author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) who's left to save his estranged wife and children and the new man in their lives when the disaster erupts. Meanwhile, government researcher Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has returned from India with some unsettling news for those in power, which riles Chief of Staff Carl Anhauser (Oliver Platt) who first doubts the severity of the threat before becoming a bureaucratic fascist when deciding who gets space in the bunkers to survive. All the while, President Wilson (Danny Glover) tries to lead his people to a noble victory.There's a selection of decent supporting players here too, including Amanda Peet as Curtis's disappointed, stern ex wife, Thandie Newton as a conscientious member of the administration and Woody Harrelson in a brief role as a crazy sounding guy warning of impending doom. Quite a selection of characters in a lengthy, ambitious film that is somewhat overlong, and with not the least flimsy of scripts in the world, that will challenge your attention a little bit. There's just nothing overly outstanding about the film, with the typical characters (the flawed good guy, the conscientious voice of reason, the uncaring bureaucrat, the conspiracy theorist nutter, the good guys and the bad guys, basically) and the usual wild suspensions of disbelief required as the heroes are the only ones miraculously surviving collapsing buildings, engulfing fireballs, shattering fragments and all manner of dangers. A younger person may find it the most incredible film ever made, and in terms of special effects it quite possibly is, but an older, more cynical critic is likely to sit there finding it all rather corny and hard to hold their attention.It's not even jabbing at any social or political subtext (unlike the folly of man causing the end of the earth in The Day After Tomorrow) just feeding off a most likely ludicrous prediction from some ancient people. Those who've seen most of Emmerich's films will know what to expect, but in more cynical times, he needs less throwaway material than this if he's to keep making films on such a big scale. ***",2012
47,dromasca,ultimate disaster?,4,9 January 2011,"After having destroyed a few times on very big screens Manhattan, Washington DC, the United States and the whole North America it was time for director Roland Emmerich to get to the ultimate stuff - destroying the planet. What better pretext to do this than the Mayan prediction that the end of the world will happen on 12/21/12 - neither sooner nor later? So here we have the Hollywood version of the Apocalypse with no angels or saviors in sight, humanity is on its own. Sun and planets align, the core of Earth overheats, the crust cracks and the whole humanity is swallowed by huge earthquakes and tidal waves as high as the Himalayas.Well, almost the whole humanity. As in any other disaster films we do have our handful of survivors, some are bright scientists and some just your neighborhood mid-class Americans who will raise to the call of the hour. Inevitably there are some smart kids, ex-es who cancel their ex-ing one minute between the end of time and an American president who is too good or too smart to be elected but in the movies, etc., etc. Does this seem known? Well, because it really is. It's the same old, tired formula, and dialogs are worst than in many other such films, and situations are less then less than credible. But maybe the end of the world is not credible. Or is it? If the script of 2012 is an unbelievable collection of clichés and dialogs competing for the most stupid lines ever said in a movie, the viewer is left with the special effects and on the good side these are really first class. Of course, everything is completely incredible, but the fun of watching the heroes escaping the sinking of California in the mother of all cars chases, or the series of monumental tsunamis destroying all the wonders of the world plus the UNESCO-protected monuments one of the other is undeniable. A 5 year old can fully enjoy this film. Most 15 years old will consider it crap.

After finally seeing it on cable, it was actually pretty good. The special effects are really good like everyone says; and I liked the story also. But I do think John Cusack was miscast as the action hero because when was the last time he played one. And also Amanda Peet is not a big enough star for the leading female role.Just get over the fact that the hero, Jackson Curtis, accomplishes some impossible feats and just enjoy it. Sure can one really believe Jackson driving a limo and old RV over cracks in the earth and jumping huge holes.

I am not a believer of destruction of the world in 2012 but I was thinking during the movie what if? This film is about the impending 2012 destruction of the world. The actors were very good. I liked the parts of John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofer, and Danny Glover. Glover is one of my favorite actors because of the Lethal Weapon movies.Overall, this is a very good movie that has big, explosive special effects and very good acting. It lacks somewhat of a script. Too bad the effects were not nominated for any Oscars, but Avatar did have great special effects. I rate this film 10/10.",2012
50,CuriosityKilledShawn,The clock is ticking,7,17 January 2012,"...for now. In a year's time this film is going to seem extremely out of date. The end of the world plot is ludicrous, but it might have been easier if no mention of the Mayan calendar was made. The legend is obviously nonsense, and it would have been a much less silly film if it stood on its own two feet, independent of such bad science.John Cusack (who is surprisingly good here) plays a failed, but good, writer working as a Limo driver for a wealthy Russian bully. When camping with his estranged kids in Yellowstone he discovers that the Caldera, the San Andreas Fault, and the rest of the world, are about to go down. What follows is more than 2 hours of utterly insane set-pieces, split-second escapes, breathtaking visual effects (which, for once, don't offend the eye), and lots and lots and lots of mega-destruction as Cusack and his family flee from the crumbling world beneath their feet by multiple means of improvised transportation. You've never seen a spectacle like this before, and it raises the bar ex-treme-ly high for any and all disaster flicks that might follow. Emmerich certainly knows how write action scenes.Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.I fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess. If we are all still here come January 1st 2013, then perhaps we should be grateful.",2012

The master of these flicks Roland Emmerich have destroyed cities in the past pictures, but here he goes on total annihilation.Overall, if you have somehow skipped this flick on it's release, you can safely check this one out you like disaster flicks in general, because ""2012"" has it all.",2012
53,tabuno,A Burst of Screaming Special Effects,7,19 January 2019,"15 January 2010. 2012 stretches believability to the limit with a multitude of barely survival scenes, especially in the middle of this long disaster action thriller movie. The specials effects rival those of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004) which was to be expected at some point and the multitude of explosive disaster sequences and new disaster visuals and perspectives is impressive. The storyline seems credible if not convincing, except perhaps how the movie actual ends which seems to be over the top. For the most part the story is predictable though at times takes some care for attempts at substantive intellectual stabs, more than some disaster movies though not quite as convincing as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Overall, the movie was long, almost too long, almost became boring in places, but it was entertaining and provided thrills and action. An above average disaster movie that continues to use special effects pushing the envelope, though not quite there yet, but getting closer and closer. Some really, truly fascinating visuals in this movie. 7/10.",2012
54,ironhorse_iv,"Like the Mayans, this film fails to pretend 2012 right.",6,29 December 2012,"The plot to this is real simple -it's the end of the world. In 2009's 2012 solar flares from the sun are melting the earth from the inside-out, causing massive earthquakes, tsunamis, & everything you can think can happen in any disaster movie happens here. It's the mother of all disaster movies. Director Roland Emmerich provides us with a couple of poorly developed cookie-cutter meat-bags to experience the action with, as they continue to run away from while figuring out how to live throughout the disasters. Roland Emmerich's movies tend to have the same formulas to his films. Too much characters in a film that the audience rarely cares about. 2012s narrative is told from two points of view: those who know about the cataclysmic events that await the earth and those who remain in the dark. At the center of death and destruction is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a failed author with a failed marriage. He stumbles upon the news that the world as we know it is coming to an end. John Cusack is just playing John Cusack here. We rarely see any character development in the film. All he wants is becomes a hero in the eyes of his kids, his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Pete) and her current husband, Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). He heard this news from Charles Frost (Woody Harrelson) a hippie doomdayer. Woody Harrelson is just playing Woody Harrelson full of intentionally funny scenes. Woody Harrelson's character as the whack-job conspiracy-theorist and pirate-radio DJ that ends up being correct about all that ""end of the world"" nonsense. As useless as it is, the story and explanation behind 2012 is decently believable, the actions and escapes the main characters make however are anything but. Suspended disbelief is required for any film like this, John Cusack out-running earthquake by limo, by airplane, RV, and others. The film was trying to be so epic, that it made it unbelievable. This movie had too many cheesy ""close calls"". By the time the audience reached the end, it become unreal. There are supporting cast that wasn't really needed in this film if only rewritten a bit. It eats up screen time what's little left for the main characters. The film's middle-act definitely tends to drag, as it's just one suspense-filled disaster sequence after another - with very little time given to character development or even inter-character dialogue. Another thread in Roland's films are the destruction of famous landmark. the Vegas Strip, the White House, Yellowstone National Park - are blew away, even if the geography and spatial orientation doesn't make sense in half of them. The film is just a joyful orgasm of exploding cities! But after a few of these eye-popping monstrosities, the novelty wears thin. Most of the films length (158 minutes!) is just CGI special effects. I even caught myself rolling my eyes at the preposterous conclusion. People only watched 2012 for the destruction, to see people dying, explosions, death, depressing scenes and actually enjoy people's suffering as they attempt surviving the' end of days'. Curiously though, a movie fraught with death and disaster ends on a uncharacteristic up-beat, which I felt was awfully shameless given the near six-billion humans that died during the film. The film is corny, and cheesy. The biggest disaster in this movie is it's clichés, and huge plot holes. According to the film, the apocalypse is near. The Mayan calendar is set to reach the end of its 13th cycle on December 21, 2012 and nothing follows that date. 2012 tells the story of whats to come. Nothing happen in 2012, the world didn't end. So this movie is nearly pointless. Films like this are suppose to involves powerful emotive suggestion & hidden meaning thats different to what what you think the film is about. Try interpreting this film as if the disaster element was not a component. Interpret it in terms of political, economic and social change. There are a lot of gullible people out there who think the world is gonna end in 2012 because of this movie. Really lame marketing, sub-par film. The film is not tolerable in the eyes of intelligent people, it get really boring to hear about 2012 and see every minute of the doomsday propaganda. I just glad 2012 is done and gone-- so people can look at this movie for what it is, a comedy.",2012
55,The-Sarkologist,Seriously!?,2,20 June 2018,"Okay, I've seen this film once, but do I really want to go out of my way to actually see it again, and pay for the privilege. I don't think so, so I'll just write my review and hopefully encourage people not to waste their time in actually watching this film. Sure, it might also waste some money, but the reality is that the $4.00 you might pay to watch the film online you can easily get back, but that 2 hours you spent watching another directors vision of how the world is going to be destroyed will be gone forever. Seriously, if you are board, go skydiving or something.
 So, apparently the Mayans were able to predict the future and calculated the exact time when the Earth was going to end, right down to the day, except that they didn't. Then again, there was a lot of hysteria leading up to this point because despite all of the rational people pointing out that this point in 2012 was basically to the Mayans like December 31st 1999 was to us, everybody just seemed convinced that the world was going to end. Well, okay, there is this Y2K and all that, be we managed to solve that didn't we, and then again, there were people out there that did actually expect really Earth shattering things to happen on December 31st 1999, except that they didn't, other than a lot of people waking up with a hangover.
 Anyway, people seem to be convinced that the world was actually going to end, so Hollywood did what Hollywood does best and made a movie out of it. Ironically, one of the main characters in this movie happens to be one of those fringe scientists (I would say crackpot, but the thing is that he turned out to be right, but then again I'm sure there are a lot of other scientists out there that went by the title 'crackpot' who also turned out of be right) who has written a book about the event. Well, not surprisingly, this book made a very good paperweight, if anybody, other than those people that are into that type of stuff, actually bought it. Then again, bye bye PhD. I doubt he was able to get anywhere near passing his peer review, but then again PhD students do happen to have supervisors, and I doubt this research project would have got a seal of approval.
 As it happens, which is not actually all that surprising and shouldn't come as a shock to anybody that actually paid money to go and see a movie entitled '2012' with cover art depicting the world coming to an end, the Mayans, and this scientist were proven right. So, in true fashion nobody does anything about it, though in fact they do, but if I were to tell you then it would spoil the movie. Nah, I've already ticked the spoiler tag, and if you have managed to get through all the other reviews bagging this film to get to this one, then you probably already know that the billionaires are building an ark.
 Which I have to honestly ask: that is going to help them how? Seriously, these guys are billionaires. The only thing they know how to do is manage a business, and they are basically locking themselves away on an ark, on which you have to be a billionaire to even be able to buy a ticket, and they expect that they are going to be able to survive a world that has been completely trashed and all civilisation has been completely wiped away? Yeah, seriously, good luck with that. I hope your staff actually include farmers, blacksmiths, metallurgists, and any other person that happens to have any practical skill. I'm really not sure if your butler knows the first thing about planting food crops.
 Okay, I could also point out the completely unrealistic scenes where the car the heroes are in magically avoids all of the buildings, and elevated freeways, that are falling down, let alone is able to navigate Los Angeles traffic with out too much problem, despite the fact that pretty much everybody else in the city is also trying to get out, at the same time. Yeah, seriously, Los Angeles traffic is horrendous at the best of times, just imagine what it would be like in a real emergency when everybody else is trying to get out as well. Oh, and don't get me started on the scene where one of our heroes is running behind a plane that is taking off, and manages to catch up with it. Seriously, drama and all, but lets actually try to suspend our disbelief here.
 So, basically, I wouldn't bother, but if I, or none of the other reviews has managed to convince you not to waste your time, then I doubt anybody is going to be able to.",2012

57,Dr_Coulardeau,Nothing to move the planet backward,6,30 April 2014,"Some films are patchworks. This is one. And it starts with the Mayan apocalypse prevision in 2012 of courseThe apocalypse is coming. We know that. But we have to make it realistic and use the good old Christian myths again without saying so, at least not too obviously. So there is an explosion at the surface of the sun bigger than what has ever been witnessed before. That has the effect of making the core of the earth, or at least a greater proportion of the inner mass go up in temperature at a great speed, making this mass more fluid, hence liberating the tectonic plates and the continents.That means earthquakes, tsunamis and so on. Our news are full of such events. Just make them bigger, more gigantic. Waves that are nearly 2,000 meters high and you have it. Add to that Tibet and the Chinese. Noah can be repeated again: a remake of the arch and there we are. There will be three arks at the end, after the catastrophe, because we need a trinity somewhere. Without the Chinese nothing could have been done, and what's more they provided the work force, probably cheap, and the security forces to build the arks first and then to make sure only the people who have the proper passes can go on them. The world without the Chinese could not go through the apocalypse without any comfort.The US president is black of course because in 2009 it was obvious he was. A little bit of Buddhism does not harm but at the same time the only surviving Buddhist monk actually cheated the system with his brother, a lay person, to save their own parents, and end up saving a few more as stowaways.Add to that a family situation and you have it all: parents divorced, the ex-wife has a new boy friend. The children of the broken marriage, a boy and a girl, are the perfect American reconstructed or recomposed family. The catastrophe itself is nothing but special effects. They are funny, maybe impressive but certainly not frightening. So banal after all. We can imagine catastrophes of this type every day and some happen every other week. The funny part is the end. The arks find out that only Africa has survived, with a pun on the Cape of Good Hope. Humanity started in Africa and it will start again in Africa. Marvelous. But rather simple minded. Now and then some ethical questions are brought up, but they are so easy and the answer is so banal. In such a catastrophe those ethical questions would certainly not be the main questions. The main question would be to keep people from panicking or just plain hurting if not killing one another. It is nice to think that in such an extreme situation people would think of saving their neighbors. We can always dream.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",2012
58,zkonedog,"Epic, Yes, But Focuses On All The Wrong Things",4,12 March 2017,"When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year. Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.Of course, if you a fan of the ""disaster film"" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year. The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic. It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including ""Titanic"" and ""Cloverfield"".Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at ""disaster"". The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from ""War of the Worlds"" (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion. Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the ""Arks"" are chosen. What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction. Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that.",2012
59,filipemanuelneto,A poor excuse to use special effects and collect box office profits,3,26 June 2016,"Based on the catastrophic theories were heard throughout 2011 and 2012, this movie is basically the representation of the destruction of our world. Directed and written by Roland Emmerich, the film has a cast led by John Cusack, Beatrice Rosen, Zlatko Buric, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor.All those who already know the film work of this director knows the pleasure he feels to destroy our planet. He has done it in ""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"". So I think he couldn't resist the temptation and let this opportunity to destroy everything again. But I think that he will not try to do it again so soon, because he almost destroyed his own career: the film is incoherent, inconsistent and far-fetched, limited to two hours of mass destruction and abuse of special effects.The script is bad because its virtually nonexistent. This film has no story to tell us. The legends surrounding the Mayan calendar are never fully developed and the characters never deserve great attention. We know very little about each of them, and never will know more because they will gradually dying. The film's focus is exclusively the sudden change in the world and the virtual obliteration of all mankind. To make matters worse, the main characters go through a wide range of hazards and disasters escaping always by a whisker. This feature, probably thought to hold public until the end and make suspense, turns out to be so usual that makes the movie even more absurd. This is the total absence of any credibility, plausibility or realism. Emmerich didn't even tried to disguise the whole movie was just a bad excuse for another wave of destruction and special effects, for box office profits.The actors are usually bad and have mediocre characters. The only good thing about this film is a huge amount of action, absolutely stunning scenes of destruction and the amount of special, visual and sound effects. Perhaps we have seen better in other films, but it basically are the only thing that makes this film bearable.",2012
60,Rectangular_businessman,A banal End of the World,2,28 May 2012,"Considering that the plot of this movie is mostly concerned to the end of the world as we know it, for some strange reason, it feels pretty banal and forgettable.I mean, the destruction scenes and the special effects are spectacular and all that, but there is just a very little, almost non-existent, emotional connection with the main characters of the story, being most of them flat and clichéd. Despite all the things that happen in the story, I was very hard to me to care about what happened to those characters, and their ultimate fates left me most of the time completely indifferent.I know that this is pop-corn film, not a deep, psychological drama with an apocalyptic setting, but I guess that this could have been, at least, something way more entertaining, with better characters that somebody could sympathize, not just stereotypes that have been seen many times before.But I have to admit that the special effects were incredible, being the only reason to watch this film, despite the boring story, the cheesy script and the flat characters.",2012
61,TheMovieDiorama,"2012 destroys the world, decimates its characters and annihilates its story.",4,27 September 2019,"Roland ""Recipe for Disaster"" Emmerich returns to his comfort zone. But instead of an alien invasion causing the destruction of an American city, or the environment teaching humanity a lesson by freezing yet another bustling city, he instead opts for the entire planet. Washington? See you later. London? Goodbye ol' chap. Tokyo? Sayounara. Emmerich attempts to convey his most important message yet. The world is not enough. He needs more planets to destroy. More CGI chaos to conduct. The yearning for omnipotence. Somebody stop him before we get the sequel '3,476,837', when the universe implodes. I cannot be dealing with another one-dimensional mish-mash of destruction with no literary engagement whatsoever. The world is suffering from cataclysms due to a solar flare and stuff, so it's up to family man Jackson to save his, well, family by outrunning the San Andreas fault, Yellowstone caldera and a colossal 1,500m tsunami.Let's not beat around the incinerated bush as they say, chances are you watched this for the apocalyptic mayhem that Emmerich meticulously orchestrated. In which case good for you. The visual splendour and all-round screams of innocent civilians falling through the cracks of doom, will certainly keep viewers..ummm...engaged? Yeah, engaged. Entertained would be inappropriate. And obviously, the state-of-the-art technology is showcased exuberantly, with a slight undertone of melancholy as cities are wiped off the face of the Earth.But y'know, when certain lines like ""we're being pulled apart"" are exerted, followed by a giant crack in the ground ferociously splitting a supermarket in half with the couple on each side, it just makes you wonder. How? How can a film so ""90s"", with all its buoyant intricacies and ridiculousness, become so overlong and tedious. Understandably, it's a disaster flick, not to be taken seriously and sprinkled with a tiny dusting of salt to spice up the premise. Yet holy sweet lord did I yawn more times than the Russian billionaire proclaiming his nationality in his best Vin Diesel impression possible.The characters were lifeless. You shan't care if they drown, become crushed by a toppling skyscraper or incinerated by an exploding super volcano. They are literally a means to provide variance to the disasters, by travelling across the globe and narrowly escaping every situation by the thinnest of margins. Absurd. Absolutely stupid. The lines of dialogue were woeful. ""I'm not wearing any pull-ups!"". Shut it missy, before I launch you off this spaceship. The character choices themselves were baffling. Parking a camper van five miles away from the actual plane, meaning Jackson has to exert energy and outrun the sizzling caldera looming behind him. Tense? Eh. Lacking common sense? Definitely.Yet my biggest gripe is, and altogether now, plot conveniences! Yes, they're back with a vengeance. Ready yourselves. So. Jackson, who goes back to save his ex-wife's family, is a writer who also chauffeurs a rich Russian billionaire around (who happens to have a ticket to a humanity-saving ark) whose wife is a patient of Jackson's ex-wife's partner, who is a plastic surgeon, who has the talent of piloting a plane with another pilot that is having an affair with Russian billionaire wife, who has no connection to a geologist who loved reading Jackson's book (that only sold 427 copies) who allowed Jackson and his kids to be escorted out of Yellowstone (to which they were trespassing) with no charges, but soon develops a romance with the President's daughter who has no real purpose to the story whatsoever, due to the President staying behind and...yeah. Whatever.Ejiofor and Newton provide some good acting, everyone else ranged from bad to functional. And the most frustrating aspect is, that Emmerich dabbles into the moral and ethical consequences of not notifying humanity of their impending demise. The wealthy receiving and purchasing invites to save their lives whilst the rest of civilisation have no choice but to embrace death. But these infrequently forced moments of ethics were not enough to save this disaster flick from being the ironic overlong disaster that it is. Visually engaging, literarily snooze-inducing.

64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Stuff going ""boom"" good, everything else meh",5,3 April 2010,"Admitably, there's something innately satisfying about watching the hypothetical demise of the entire planet by means of natural disaster/earth crust displacement. There might even be something profound science fiction-wise lurking about in the concept of the Mayan apocalypse and the end of the world as we know it. For better or worse, ""2012"" is a little more interested in humanity's gross interest in its own near-extinction aka stuff crumbles. Who better to envision such a disaster than ""The Day After Tomorrow"" director Roland Emmerich, also the thrills genius behind ""Independence Day,"" a fact that gets mentioned in every trailer for his subsequent movies as if no film has come close to the ""gold standard"" set forth by that 15-year-old antiquated alien invasion movie adored because of an infamous movie speech.To his credit though, Emmerich doesn't make boring movies. ""2012"" is long, but it's not all that dull. It just takes about a half hour for hell to break loose -- literally, if hell is indeed underground, it tears it loose in California. Before the offensively unrealistic escape scenes though, we get our set up that an Indian scientist has confirmed that the Mayan apocalypse will indeed happen on 12-21-12 and it leads to an operation organized by world leaders to build massive refuge boats. It's kept entirely secret, however, to avoid unnecessary mass hysteria. Reasonable considering almost the entire world population is going to be wiped out anyway.To relate to this disaster through people we get Jackson Curtis (Cusack) who is divorced but trying to mend his relationship with his kids when disaster strikes. On a trip to Yellowstone with the kids, he meets Woody Harrelson who has been following the conspiracy and possesses maps to the ships, a helpful tidbit when all of LA starts to go underwater. Fortunately, his ex's (Peet) boyfriend has taken flying lessons and they manage to procure the maps and escape certain death when Yellowstone becomes the world's biggest erupting volcano.If there had been any attempt by Emmerich to make the escape realistic, it might have saved his movie for me, but it's too implausible to ignore. Once they get out of the United States and time marches on it becomes less of a sore spot, but it certain cuts into one's enjoyment of the film. I like to be entertained on a base level, but I don't like to be insulted in my make- believe either.The visual effects are strong and certainly watching things just disintegrate is among the most enjoyable aspects of the movie. Then there's also that little thrill you get from disaster flicks when people who suck die painful deaths. Emmerich is certainly all about killing off characters that violate his moral principles; this script does hit on the idea of our world leaders being selfish and thinking they would be the most vital to start the human race over again, but other than one impassioned speech, ignores themes in general.In this trend of apocalypse movies, there is certainly a chance for a film to come along and provide that sick thrill of seeing destruction yet also raise some important questions about human nature. ""2012"" is not that film, but it does highlight the possibility for that film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",2012
65,southdavid,2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5 (out of ten),5,2 January 2020,"Here I am, punished again by the Sky Movies alphabetically ordered film gods. Next on the run through was ""2012"", the disaster movie from 2009.The film is about a devastating destructive event that occurs to the Earth in 2012 and a number of characters who work to try and ensure their survival. Amongst them is author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) who is estranged from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) but has their children when the disaster begins. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is one of the scientists that first understands the depths of the disaster that will befall them, so has to work on getting a plan for Human survival in place.There is only one real positive to the film. The effects are generally pretty good, even a decade later the scenes of destruction hold up. It does show you some genuinely memorable things, subway trains plummeting from broken tunnels, aircraft carriers crushing the White House. But they are outweighed by the negatives and then some.The film is looooooooooooooooooong, so very long. Both in terms of its runtime and how the film feels. To be able to fill that length with something so intrinsically dull, is almost impressive.A film like this really needs to you care about the characters, and their survival and unfortunately for this film, I did not. The central family aren't particularly interesting, and their separation just seems immediately like something that will be over by the end of the film. Particularly telling about how much you should invest in the relationship issues is how quickly Kate moves on once Gordon meets his fate. Other characters are given screen time despite not having any real effect on the plot, Thandie Newton, John Billingsley, the old (awful) singers on the cruise liner are all there just as emotional pressure points for other characters.Technically solid, but lacking in wit, flair, humour or relatability ""2012"" is not worth your time.",2012

67,Vartiainen,Has its niche,4,7 January 2013,"I don't really have anything against Roland Emmerich. The Independence Day is on my favourite guilty pleasures, and I sat through The Day After Tomorrow just fine. It's just that all of his catastrophe/Armageddon films are pretty much identical, with superficial skin and setting changes. Some kind of a disaster is about to destroy the Earth as we know it, and all of this is seen through the eyes of a normal family that at some point just happens to cross paths with the high and mighty politicians that are trying to save the humanity. The novelty has worn off at this point.Independence Day was also better in my opinion, because it was the most honest about the fact that this kind of a end-of-the-world scenario is highly unlikely and more than a bit silly in certain aspects. It got around that fact by adding in aliens and thus making it a scifi film. The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 on the other hand at least try to be somewhat scientifically accurate and believable, which does the films no favours. Also, Independence Day had more likable characters and actors. The president in 2012 is surprisingly about as good as the one in ID, but the main family is extremely unlikable. The dad is an irresponsible bum, the mother has very little personality, the stepfather is a smug redshirt and the son is an asshole. The only likable character is the daughter, with her adorable hat-obsession. The side characters aren't any better, though the Russians are at least sometimes funny.So why would anyone want to see this film? For the special effects, mostly. It's the kind of a film where the story gets sidelined more often than not in order for the big-budget action spectacles to take place. If the viewer is expecting that and is able to accept the limitations of the story, he might very well like this just fine. I was perhaps a bit bored most of the time, because none of the catastrophe scenes were anything I hadn't seen before, but I can't say that they were bad, either. Emmerich knows what he's doing with these films.I also have to admit that the final solution to the Mayan End of the World is kind of clever. The film lulls you into believing that the solution will be fairly clichéd and traditional for these kinds of films, but then it manages to surprise you. Points for that.So, all in all this is a film that I wouldn't really recommend. If you've liked Emmerich's other catastrophe films and are looking for more, then sure, but otherwise I'd give this one a pass.",2012

Earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, tidal waves, and other really cool natural disasters that people love watching but would never want it to really happen.In this movie, Jackson Curtis, a divorced man with two kids, who drives a limo and is also an author, takes his children on a camping trip. It's there that he finds out that the world is going to end. He finds out that there are ships being built where you can safely live after the apocalypse. A ticket will just cost you about $1 billion. Yeah, so you know all the rich snobs are going to be the only people living on Earth. How depressing? Lots of stuff happens, including Los Angeles being destroyed and falling into a giant sink hole, whilst Jackson gets his kids, ex-wife, and ex-wife's current-husband to Yellowstone National Park. Then they fly to Las Vegas (I think it was Vegas) and see one of Jackson's clients, a Russian billionaire who just happens to need another pilot, and the current-husband just happens to be one. So they fly away whilst the city is destroyed. They fly over Hawaii, where they were meant to refuel, but the state is busy being destroyed by lava. That's super creepy when you know it could really happen. Eventually, the Russian guy and his family are taken to the ships and Jackson and his company must sneak onto the ship before they die. Fun Fact: This movie was banned in North Korea.Fun Fact: Seth Rogen turned down the role of Adrian Hemsley. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",2012
69,Turfseer,Great special effects + one dimensional characters = passable but typical disaster movie,5,11 August 2010,"In order to enjoy a disaster movie, it's important to suspend your disbelief to a large extent. Don't expect this type of movie to be at all logical, nor should you expect its characters to be very well developed. If the plot takes you from 'A' to 'B', with a reasonable amount of fast-paced action, then it probably has done its job.No, I did not think 2012 was masterpiece; but with its great special effects, it certainly ranks as passable. 2012 deals with a rather unpleasant subject: the end of the world. The ancient Mayan prediction that the world will come to an end in 2012, comes true in this movie. Director Roland Emmerich purposely avoids hammering his audience with true tragedy. We never see any close-ups of mangled bodies or blood being shed. Everything is shot at a distance so that we get the 'bigger picture' of what it would be like when the world is destroyed; that way, the true horror and terror is minimized.The best scenes in 2012 focus on the journey of part-time novelist and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis, very ably played by John Cusack. His journey begins when he picks up his kids from his ex-wife, who is now living with a new boyfriend, Gordon, a plastic surgeon, and takes them on a vacation excursion to Yellowstone National Park. Curtis runs into the best character in the film, Charlie Frost, in one of Woody Harrelson's best roles in a long time. What's so wonderful about the crazed Frost, is that he's one of these guys who's been trying to warn the world about his apocalyptic world view for years and now everything he's been saying has been vindicated. Frost actually welcomes death and stands impassively as the volcano consumes him. He revels in his last 'moment in the sun'. Curtis, on the other hand, initially believes him to be a crackpot, especially after Frost claims he has a map with the location of a secret ark project, which the world leaders have been working on, anticipating the end of the world.Finally Curtis sees the light when he sees the news report about the seismic activity that splits a supermarket in half which his ex-wife and her boyfriend were just in. He wisely rents a small plane and then drives to LA where he picks up his ex-wife, the boyfriend and his two children and then drives to the airport as the city collapses around them. Yes, all the near misses are ridiculous, but the special effects will keep you riveted to your seat. After making it to the airport, there's a new surprise: the pilot is dead and Gordon must fly the plane, despite only having a few lessons as a student pilot. They fly to Yellowstone in order to get a hold of Charlie's map and just escape as a volcano explodes. The map points to China and Curtis realizes that they'll never get there in a Cessna.When they arrive in Las Vegas, a huge crack has already appeared in the airport runway. Curtis runs into his Russian billionaire boss, Yuri, who has paid for tickets on the Ark, and also happens to have a giant Antonov 500 aircraft, which takes them to China. Yuri is another colorful character, who ruthlessly ditches his girlfriend, Tamara, as he only has three tickets for himself and two children on the Ark. But later, he redeems himself by saving his children by throwing them onto the Ark while the gates are closed and then falling to his death as a result.There's more exciting action when the Ark is unable to power up due to a jammed and malfunctioning boarding gate. At the last minute, as the effects of a tsunami pushes the Ark toward Mt. Everest (which has been displaced to a different location thousands of miles away due to a movement of the earth's crust) , Curtis goes underwater inside the hydraulics chamber (and with the assistance of his son) removes an impact driver which has been preventing the Ark from powering up.As to be expected, despite all the great action scenes, 2012 falls down in the area of character development. Emmerich serves up a cornucopia of politically correct characters including three blacks who are virtually faultless. They are: Dr. Adrian Helmsely, the American geologist, who proves how righteous he is when he insists that the stranded passengers who couldn't board a damaged Ark be allowed on the one he's boarded (Helmsley notes that his assigned room can fit a lot more people). Pitted against him is the supposedly heartless, white Chief of Staff, Carl Annheuser (Oliver Platt), who argues realistically that allowing the extra passengers might jeopardize the entire project. Even worse is the saintly president, Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), who decides to remain in Washington, and 'go down with the ship'. In contrast, Emmerich obnoxiously has Queen Elizabeth board the Ark with a couple of her Corgis, implying that she's a coward! Naturally the president's daughter, Laura Wilson, must overcome her grief by striking up a romance with Helmseley, as they head for their new destination in Africa.There's plenty of other cheesy stuff that relegates 2012 to the realm of the mediocre. There's a particularly distasteful line about how the gene pool will be compromised when two Arab sheiks are seen, en route to board one of the Arks. And what about how expendable Gordon, the ex-wife's boyfriend is. After he's killed, it takes a scant minute or so before the ex-wife is back in the arms of John Cusack (Curtis). Also note that that Tibetan Buddhist monks are noble but Chinese soldiers are heartless. Other disappointing characters and moments are well chronicled here on the internet. But 2012 sometimes gets it right: the last moment of the Indian astrophysicist and his family may go down as one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.",2012
70,Chris Knipp,The law of diminishing returns: why great effects don't make great drama,5,26 November 2009,"Emmerich is a specialist in rah-rah actioners with a penchant for global disaster. He tried alien invasion in his 1996 Independence Day, a world suddenly become uninhabitable via climate change in The Day After Tomorrow, and now -- what? 2012 cynically trades on a superstitious belief that the Mayans were right to predict the end of days in that year. But that's really just a come-on for cultists that's quickly dropped. The arc of the script is more a high-tech replay of Noah and the Flood. While Independence Day was sci-fi hokum, and Tomorrow was just dubious science, the explanation behind Emmerich's latest planetary doom is pure mumbo-jumbo. Obviously this director doesn't care how he gets to his effects, and he inserts the same sets of weepy vignettes and touching family reunions every time.Emmerich and his Austrian co-writer Harold Klosser borrow a popular (but groundless) doomsday myth that an alignment of planets could touch off disaster -- this time, by making the sun's fires flare up. That in turn makes neutrinos start to heat up the earth's core so tectonic plates divide all over the surface of the planet. No matter to these guys that neutrinos, tiny neutral particles that go through the earth in unimaginable quantity all the time without harm, are the least likely cause of tectonic shock disaster. No matter that the theory of a resulting ""crustal shift,"" derailing the earth from its axis and making the continents slip into new positions, has long been discredited as a real possibility. 2012 isn't sci-fi; it's bogus science, far more completely bogus than Day After Tomorrow's -- and the latter, hokey as it was, was a far better movie than this unrestrained and utterly dumb blockbuster.Much of the physical action concerns a little broken, and soon happily reunited, family, headed by Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), and consisting of his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their kids, Noah (Liam James) and Lily (Morgan Lily). Kate has been shacked up with Gordon (Tom McCarthy), and Noah has transferred his loyalty to this fellow. But that's going to change! Gordon will die a sad but quickly forgotten death and Jackson and Kate will be kissing and Noah and Jackson bonding in an hour or so. Then there's the noble US President (Danny Glover), who elects to go down with the ship, and his high-minded daughter (Thandie Newton), who's been preserving the world's art treasures, or the Louvre's, anyway. A French official spills the beans on this and his car explodes in the same tunnel where Lady Di died: what about that! Jackson is a hero, and a miraculous survivor, through a multiplication of the kind of narrow escapes that motivated the ""Perils of Pauline"" serials in the silent era. I'd call this the ""Ya doob"" effect, using the Egyptian dialect phrase meaning ""just barely."" In his review of 2012 Anthony Lane put his finger on the basic element Emmerich uses as """"the binding rule of melodrama, which decrees that all escapes shall be narrow, no more than the breadth of a hair""; ""The best thing about time is the nick of it."" This effect is used so relentlessly for Jackson's exploits that they lose their suspense completely and just become shticks.Equally tired is the nobility of Danny Glover and his cloyingly upright daughter Thandie Newton. The inevitable, discreet romance that develops, with daddy dead and the world half saved, between Ms. Newton and the top US scientist, played with largely wasted dash by the talented Chiwetel Ejiofor: how wearying it is to watch this! George Segal and cohort Blu Mankum do saccharine turns as cruise ship musicians trying to reunite with estranged offspring via phone at the edge of doom. A doom that takes far too long to come, and is dragged out with underwater sequences stolen from Cameron's Titanic. Bad idea to remind us of a really good disaster movie! The superstitious and paranoid (and above all naive) in the audience will also have much to cluck over when it comes to the plan to ""save"" a small part of the planet's population, and the way the elite's knowledge of what's coming is cunningly hidden from the masses of humanity. Isn't that just the way? Except that it's not, and if there were truth in any of this, it would have been all over the Internet. The parts of this movie that are hokiest and least able to survive scrutiny (though none of it survives that long) are those related to global knowledge of the impending disaster; who arrived at it, how it was dealt with, and what the timetable was.But in all this tiresome nitpicking I've been bypassing the big fun for the audience, and in the view of some, the malicious delight of German-born Mr. Emmerich, in what Variety reviewer Todd McCarthy calls his ""lip-smacking smorgasbord of global annihilation"" -- the way we get to see California sink into the sea, the White House smashed by a giant Navy warship, Michelangelo's frescoes in the Vatican drop to earth as St. Peter's in Rome crumbles, the Eiffel Tower floated away, Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue disintegrated, and Las Vegas, Yellowstone Park, all of Tibet, exploded from below and turned into toast. Woody Harrelson, in a wild-eyed caricature of himself and draped in long fake beard and elaborate hair extensions, gets to go down in a kind of kitsch grandeur of a Gotterdammerung atop a peak in Yellowstone.Well, yeah, wow! But without a believable plot or interesting characters, who cares? And frankly, no matter how good the CGI has become, an unbelievable event still looks unreal because I know it's not real. If 'Less is more,' then more is indubitably less; and more-and-more ultimately adds up to just that much less. It's the law of diminishing returns.",2012
71,elshikh4,"A doomsday of repetitions, clichés, coincidences, stupidities and provocations !",2,23 November 2011,"Would anybody save (Roland Emmerich) from himself, or from Hollywood? The man has been doing the same subject over and over and over again. Soon he'll make movies about ""The end of the world"" as fast as (Leonardo DiCaprio) was repeating words in The Aviator (2004)!The weirdest thing is that he said, once, that he ""completed"" the ""trilogy"" of the world's end after Independence Day (1996), Godzilla (1998), and The Day After Tomorrow (2004). He did convince me while saying that he dealt with all the reasons: Aliens' invasion, nuclear-hybrid monster, and climatic disasters. Now, with 2012, it's the world's end again, climatic disasters again, so is it a quatrain or bankruptcy?? I would have forgiven him if only he managed to handle a new side that he missed before. But unfortunately, it looked like an album of his last movies, done with many many faults as well!This has writing's disasters in a way that makes the movie a doomsday of a script. Mainly an invasion of the Body Snatchers: Anew there is a world ending (all the last 3 movies), someone is warning and nobody listens (The Day After Tomorrow), a widower American president with one daughter (Independence Day), 2 lovers come back to each other (Godzilla), a father sacrifices for his son (s) (The Day After Tomorrow), stupid bureaucrats run the crises (Godzilla), the scene of Air force one leaving the white house on the nick of time (Independence Day), the white house gets destroyed (Independence Day), and the happy end where the survivors gather to look to the daylight, and look forward building a new world (The Day After Tomorrow). In brief, it's clear that the West Germany-born (Emmerich) didn't hear the American proverb ""Enough is Enough""!Add to that a flood of clichés: the lead is running from many exploding volcanoes, yet nothing touches him in anyway. That shot is repeated throughout the movie whether it's the lead or the plane, all the planes, he rides! The lead, after saving the world by closing the door of the new Noah's ark, is dead, then No, he's alive!Furthermore, an avalanche of coincidences: while going to camping, the lead finds himself accidentally in a governmental special area. The lead finds the radio announcer who he listens to accidentally in the woods. The presidency's bureaucrat read the lead's book, then runs into him, accidentally for sure, 2 times in 2 different continents right in the middle of the world's end. The lead knows the Russian who happens to own the last plane on earth, and he runs into him in Las Vegas. That plane itself crashes in nowhere but the place of transporting the selected people and animals to the ark. The lead, in mountains of snow, meets someone who happens to be working at the ark, imploring him to take his children to it!Let alone many quakes of stupid points: the hippie announcer dies (because he's crazy!). The American president, who orchestrated the whole scheme of stealing the greatest artworks, and saving exclusively the ""richest"" humans on earth, chose to die among his people like a captain who doesn't abandon his ship (so noble my foot!). The rich people, who previously paid the very expensive price of their survival, 1 billion euro each, stands begging the rest to enter the ark, and the leaders of the world's superpowers agree in great sympathy (so noble my foot, number 2!). A hose crammed in shields of the ark's door causes the *real* end of the world (Idiocy!). Now, the lead is considered a hero when he fixes what he already caused by being such a clumsy fool (Super Idiocy!!). However, nothing is beyond the moment when the stepfather was killed so randomly just to secure the old husband in his old wife and children's open arms (hysterical melodrama at its Hindiest!).And it's not complete without being offensive: The big nations didn't apply to the compiled contract, of saving the genetically superior humans. Instead, they chose the rich ones. OK, how that is known? It's easy. Put an Arab with a headband to tell the genetically superior from the rich, where the Arab - naturally - isn't the genetically superior. OH MY GOD, this is a different level of indignity that Hollywood reaches with the Arabs!(John Cusack) couldn't persuade me as a lead of anything to date. He has no charisma, no wit, he's a perfect bore. I won't go through the rest of the cast. If anyone of them had an atom of self-respect, or right artistic sense, he / she wouldn't be in this in the first place. But they always think that being in flashy CGI celebration dominates success, fame, coolness.. whatever. Only (Oliver Platt) was lucky enough to handle a good written character, and the smart that he is made it believable. He was the sole person here who was disaster-proof I suppose!I liked the third act, with that idea of new advanced Noah's ark, without it the movie immerses directly in a black hole of unoriginality. The CGI was decent, but I have seen all of that, and all what happens in it, before and in better shape too.This is euphoric nonsense. It works with children, neophyte viewers, or someone with a desperate need to discharge some negative feelings. What I can't understand though is that how in God's name Godzilla (1998) was nominated for 5 Razzies, and this didn't get any nomination at all??!!",2012

In this futuristic movie called "" 2012 "" the end of the world as we know it should end on this date. Well except for the date, little if anything went wrong with the movie. Watching the film within the surround sound system of a Cina-Plex theater, the entire movie was an exciting, fantastic thrill-ride on steroids and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting, the assembled cast, the wonderful CGI-effects, the volcanic explosions, the crumbling earth, toppling buildings, world wide catastrophic flooding and doomsday happenings made this incredible movie a monumental visual success. The story as we see it has John Cusack playing writer Jackson Curtis, who predicted the world's end in a book entitle 'Farewell Atlantis.' Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Adrian Helmsley a scientific adviser to the president who having read the book has concluded the government should listen to him. Oliver Platt is Carl Anheuser, the Political adviser to the president and is superb in that role. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Frost a radio host and doomsday prophet. Danny Glover is President Thomas Wilson who believes mankind waited too long to hear the truth. John Billingsley is wonderfully serious as Professor West. With a supreme effort in direction, this movie will easily become a Sci-Fi award winner. The special effects will also make this an all time Classic and a milestone for John Heard in his career.

74,freemantle_uk,"Voted Sarah Palin in 2012, because the world is going to end anyway",4,12 February 2011,"The Road and The Book of the Eli were two films released pretty closely tacking the subject of a post-apocalyptical world: 2012, Roland Emmerich so-called final disaster film, sets out to show the apocalypse happening in the most stupid way possible.Starting in 2009, a scientist in India (Jimi Mistry) discovers that solar flares are shooting radioactive particles to Earth, overheating the Earth's core and shifting the tectonic plates. With every major government aware of the situation they make plans to safeguard humanity, getting all the world's treasures and getting rich people to donate 1 Billon for a ticket on ships to save people. Fast forward to 2012 and the world starts to crumble. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a struggling sci-fi writer and limo driver, who one holiday in Yellowstone National Park meets a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson), who tells him about the ships to save humanity and before California falls into the sea Jackson saves his family, son Noah (Liam James), daughter Lily (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and plastic surgeon/Kate's boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). In Washington D.C. there is a conflict between the president's scientific adviser Adrian Helmsmen (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) as they clash over what is the best way to save humanity whilst President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) has to deal with his conscience.Scientifically 2012 is complete rubbish and there are plot holes galore, from how could some massive ships be made in Tibet without anyone noticing? How could they build them in 2 years and have to make a base as well? Surely wouldn't scientists who were not involved with governments might have discovered what's going and wouldn't the media question the large number of deaths of prominent people. As well if this was sure a big crisis then governments would have made the ships be made by public money and wouldn't need to sell to the highest bidder. The plot about saving humanity and civilisation felt very much like Deep Impact but took a more unrealistic and unbelievable route. There is also the human element of disbelief from how Jackson seem to have the skills of a stunt driver and that Gordon would only had a few flying lessons is able to fly a plane through a collapsing city, which even a Stealth Fighter with top of the range computers would struggle to go through.As a director Emmerich is not known for his subtlety or his restraint. The death court in his disaster films has raisin from the world's major cities in Independence Day, the whole of the northern hemisphere in The Day After Tomorrow and know it is the whole world with 2012. The CGI effects are very good in 2012 and it is a fun, clean way to see millions of people getting killed: though I prefer it when a director only uses CGI when there is no other option and special effects do not make a film. There was a bit to much green screen and not enough scenes shot on location. But some of the scenes were just lifted from other films, like the plane taking of with the group collapsing is very much like the scene same in Independence Day, the ship being capsized is a cross between Poseidon and Titanic. The government preparations are a dumb downed version of Deep Impact and some of the family scenes are like a scene from a Spielberg film but very poorly done. Emmerich also follows his other popular theme of stupid or corrupt government officials who do not listen to reason. And the film is way too long and there are to many characters who are pointless or add nothing to the film: Thandie Newton may as well not been in it because her character did not do anything to the plot, there are stupid characters like the Russian twins and many other characters just serve to move the plot along. Plus it is too convenient about how some characters meet and know each other. Finally, a little SPOILOR ALERT: I really doubt that President's Chief-of-Staff would take the American government; wouldn't major politicians be saved so someone in the American command take over, from the Speaker, a Cabinet member or a senior senator. Plus I doubt the Italian PM would stay in Italy, particularly if he is meant to be like Silvio Belusconi who in real life would be the first to go and possibly take three of his finest prostitutes.Many of the actors know that 2012 is just rubbish and obviously did it for the money. They don't give their all. Ejiofor is a great actor and deserve to do more major roles and I think he needs to do a really good drama in the near future. Newton too is normally better then this and admittedly I though it was a little weird seeing two British actors together with American accents. Cusack obviously never followed his potential but he is not a good leading man in this film: he is more a comic actor then an action hero. I like Peet but her characters follows the cliché that she is still in love with her ex and Lily and Russian twins are some of the worst child actors I have seen for awhile. Glover is also an actor who was in the film because of the money and Harrelson who was offering comic relief has the mercy of limited screen time (his character was a little like the abducted crop-duster pilot in Independence Day). I like Harrelson normally. But character development has never been Emmerich's strong point.Overall this is a film that appeals to the lowest common denominated and relies on the audience have a no intelligent. There are some decent action sequences, but 2012 is pretty much a best of Emmerich which fails. Watch Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow instead.",2012
75,strong-122-478885,"Non-Stop, Sentimental Slop From The Year 0001",3,4 August 2014,"After patiently viewing all 2 hours & 40 minutes of this mega-disaster picture called 2012, I'm now completely convinced that German-born director, Roland Emmerich, totally hates the USA with a burning passion like no other.With each subsequent disaster film that Emmerich has directed, he's made a point of destroying the States that much more. Until now, with 2012, there's literally nothing at all left of America to destroy. It's all gone, bye-bye.And, I say, ""Thank goodness for that.""By that, I mean, I hope that with 2012 Emmerich has finally gotten this hateful wrath of his towards the USA cleared right out of his system. And I hope that this will be the very last time that he goes to such extreme lengths (in one of his movies) as a means to get his hateful point across.If you ask me, I find all of Emmerich's obsession with mass destruction not only screwy, but utterly tiresome, as well.And, on top of all of that, I absolutely resent the blatant product placement which never fails to make its unwelcome way into just about every one of Emmerich's pictures.In my opinion, all that these advertising plugs do is completely reduce said-film to the point of being nothing but an extended commercial, meant solely to showcase the consumer products that are conveniently being flashed in front of our faces.All-in-all - 2012 was a truly terrible Noah's Ark story which actually seemed to be bent on turning all of the death & destruction (that it gleefully featured) into some sort of a perverse joke.And, let's face it, as lame as this film's humour clearly was, no amount of cheap, Buddhist philosophy is ever going to be the answer for saving this world of ours.*Note* - For anyone who's interested - Out of 2012's $200 million budget, Emmerich's modest cut was only $70 million.",2012
76,dfranzen70,Funniest tragedy ever,2,3 December 2009,"There is now a long, grand history of disaster films in Hollywood. The best of the lot have combined suspense with cutting-edge effects to keep your adrenaline pumping. The worst combine cheesy CGI with shallow characters whose deaths won't affect you much.Here's 2012, summed up: Look, some recognizable landmark! Kablam! Look, a giant wave! Wooo! Do our intrepid Good Guys have enough time to outrun the imploding planet and foil a plot to save only the pretty, rich people? Probably! It's pretty clear what happened to bring us to this point. Roland Emmerich, who's made such cinematic classics as Independence Day, The Patriot, Godzilla, and The Day after Tomorrow, was asked if he wanted a quintillion billion bazillion dollars to make a movie about the end of the world, and he said sure. Then he took parts of each movie's script, filmed them mostly with CGI, and pocketed the rest. Viola! Greatest movie! (A quick break to sum up the plot. Apparently, the sun and the planets have all aligned with the center of the galaxy, which winds up causing the Earth's crust to break up, which then causes the tectonic plates to shift. Mass hysteria! Dogs and cats, living together! The End.) See, there are two ways Emmerich could have gone with this movie. He could have given us characters to follow whom we cared a little about, thus involving us in their plights, and mixed in some convincing special effects. Or he could have said, ""The heck with the characters, give me blowy-uppy thingys."" This sometimes works: See Independence Day, a movie that made me feel pretty good when I left the theater after seeing it but that ultimately, frankly, was pretty bad.Emmerich chose the latter. Which would have been fine, but the effects themselves are wildly unrealistic and often take so long to set up that you completely notice how godawful they really are. For example – and if you've seen the trailer, this is in there – there's a scene in which the Sistine Chapel falls, crushing thousands of spectators. Because the toppling is so slow to complete, it becomes painfully obvious that it's just a film running on a screen behind people running away. Sad and unintentionally hilarious.And you can forget about the plot, really, because most of it makes no sense anyway and would happen only in a Big Movie like this. Of COURSE John Cusack is divorced from his hot, bitchy wife (Amanda Peet) and of COURSE she's hooking up with a plastic surgeon who of COURSE winds up having had some flying lessons that of COURSE will save them all and of COURSE Cusack's young son will somehow save the day as well and of COURSE there is a Russian businessman who used to be a boxing legend and of COURSE he punches someone out. And of COURSE people say ""My God!"" a lot, because that's what people do in crappy disaster films. And of COURSE the president is black, because in Hollywood black people get to be president only if disaster is a-coming.At least the acting isn't horrible. Because everyone just runs from place to place in an effort to escape the horror, there aren't any subtle, low-key scenes that would allow good actors to flourish. Cusack is good in general, but what the heck is he doing in here? He's usually so good at picking projects, and he chose this? Willingly? Oliver Platt plays the kind of role that Bruce McGill typically gets, the hamhanded, I'm-in-charge, Al-Haig-like politician. I can't even remember his title. Danny Glover gets to be president and does get the best dialog in the film, even if his role isn't a big one. Woody Harrelson, as a crazed DJ deep in Yellowstone is also a lot of fun, although he's not the kind of guy you'd want to sit next to on a transatlantic flight.Final verdict: Yikes. Yikes, yikes, and yikes. If you dare watch this travesty, you might find yourself laughing hysterically at things – and this is important – that were not meant to be funny. If that's your thing, this is your movie. I managed to see this as a matinée, so I'm not out the $10-$15 that some people are right now, so at least I got that going for me. Best advice: Watch it for free at home on a big-screen TV to fully appreciate the magnitude of suck.",2012
77,PWNYCNY,"Nothing on earth lasts forever, including the earth itself.",8,14 November 2009,"This movie starts out with very cheesy acting and some grotesquely inane dialog, causing one to feel that this is going to be a very long, very tedious cinematic experience. But somewhere in the middle of the movie something happens. The writing, the acting, the directing, and the special effects pull together as the story becomes more plausible and the movie more watchable. The movie was able to sufficiently recover its cinematic bearings to the point where it was telling an interesting and provocative story. For the human race, it's pandemonium time and this movie pulls no punches in showing the chaos that ensues as the world is literally coming apart at the seams, caused by a mere fluke of nature. This movie shows that nothing on earth lasts forever, including the very planet we live on.",2012
78,dee.reid,"It's the end of the world, but not the end of movie-making, as some would speculate...",10,13 June 2010,"""2012"" is the 2009 disaster epic from the ""master of disaster"" Roland Emmerich (""Independece Day"" - his best film, in my opinion; ""Godzilla""; and ""The Day After Tomorrow""). Whether you love him or loathe him, ""2012"" is his disaster epic, with plenty of spectacular scenes of destruction, a determined band of survivors (led by John Cusack as struggling writer Jackson Curtis) trying to live through the end of the world. Some scientific babble about the sun's rays heating up the Earth's core and loosening up the Earth's tectonic plates and shifting the poles has sped up doomsday from its predicted date (by the Mayans) of 12-21-12 to some time during the summer of 2012. Scenes of destruction are nothing new in movies like this. But what makes it all so very different is that the destruction on the scale as presented in ""2012"" is unprecedented in the movies. The scenes of mega-tsunamis engulfing Washington, D.C., and India, the super-volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park suddenly erupting, and Los Angeles (and pretty much the entire West Coast falling into the Pacific Ocean) are not only spectacular and awesome to look at, but are also harrowing and horrifying. I'm not a fan of the disaster movie genre, but the scenes of such mass death and destruction in ""2012"" are so unusually affecting and horrifying that I actually had a hard time watching it, but I couldn't look away. I don't know if that was intended or not by Emmerich, but if he wanted to scare the hell out of the audience, I think that in my case he succeeded in shaking me to my emotional core, and wondering if this is what the end of the world will really look like. While I don't think the world will end on 12-21-12 - I've read enough articles and discussions on the matter to convince me otherwise - there is no question, however, that ""2012"" may very well be the disaster epic of the disaster movie genre.10/10",2012
79,MaxBorg89,The Apocalypse according to Emmerich...,5,29 May 2010,"If there's one thing Roland Emmerich knows, it's how to destroy things. Exhibit A: the White House in Independence Day, New York in Godzilla and The Day after Tomorrow, the prehistoric genre in 10.000 BC. It is only fitting, then, that his last big disaster movie - his words, not mine - should revolve around the ultimate catastrophe: the end of the world. Unsurprisingly, his take on the subject isn't very subtle. On the other hand, it's a shockingly dull affair.Based on the theory that the world will end in the year 2012 (a Mayan ""prophecy"" that also served as a major plot point in the finale of The X-Files), the movie provides some pseudo-scientific explanation for everything going down the drain, then proceeds to tell the ""proper"" story: politicians and (rich) businessmen are preparing some sort of survival plan, scientists look on as things escalate sooner than predicted and common men like Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer who happens to be vacationing with what remains of his family, try to get their sorry behinds some place safe. Not the easiest of tasks...From a purely aesthetic point of view, Emmerich really tops himself this time: impeccable visual effects merge with a truly apocalyptic vision as California sinks into the ocean, a giant tidal wave covers the Himalayas and the White House gets destroyed (again). And yet, as that last example suggests, it's all stuff we've seen before, a greatest hits compilation that strives to be better than the sum of its parts. The film is also marred by a tedious sense of repetition, its 160 minutes being divided in the following sections: people escaping annihilation by car (first hour), plane (second hour) and finally boat (last 40 minutes). Fifteen minutes, it already starts looking like bland levels of a video game.Of course, it doesn't fare much better in terms of narrative: not only is the film filled with obvious and annoying religious symbolism (see the fate of the Vatican), we also have every single cast member stuck with a role so basic the script could have been written by a 7-year old. Cusack tries his best doing the usual stuff, as do Amanda Peet (his ex-wife), Chiwetel Ejofor (a scientist) and Thandie Newton (the President's daughter), but it's painfully clear where the movie is going when even Oliver Platt is on tired autopilot. Only Danny Glover (the President) and Woody Harrelson (a hippie prophet) are able to elicit some sympathy, and, naturally, their screen-time is criminally short.To sum it all up, 2012 is a massive undertaking, worth watching for its ambition and its use of special effects. However, as blockbusters and disaster movies come, it is a disappointment on every other level. But at least it's less cheesy than Michael Bay's Armageddon.",2012
80,sauravjoshi85,A film destroyed by too many glitches,4,25 March 2019,To be honest this movie has lots of potential and could've been a masterpiece but lots of twists and turns and off course glitches has made the movie experience turn sour. Acting can't be blamed as this is the aftermath of poor direction. Screenplay is still better but it has lots of twists which is enough to test your patience and it seems that the director was intended to increase the length of movie with unnecessary twists. Ending is off course predictable but overall the movie had lots of potential which is surely destroyed and will give you an awful experience.,2012
81,Cristi_Ciopron,Good theatrical poster; movie a bit better than The Day After Tomorrow,5,9 December 2009,"I will start with the obviously good things; '2012''s theatrical poster is awesome. '2012' seems somewhat better than Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow; like that one, it amply oozes with ideological rubbish. Universal Soldier remains the best flick this director made.Other than that, the effects are less than what was, I believe, expected. Not very impressive, I assert; not very impressive, at least for a disaster movies buff like me. I mean:--that budget? ...--and those effects??! The cast is notably mediocre, notable chiefly for its bare mediocrity (except, maybe, for that Thandie Newton). Otherwise, they got George Segal, Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson for one reason or another. The script is sub-ordinary slapdash, the lines are execrably bad. There are the mandatory _clichés:--the dysfunctional family, the kid with a medical condition (Morgan Lily, we are told, pisses in bed); an additional one:--the greedy surgeon. A fat European, Zlatko Burić, does a moderately colorful villain.Yet I liked one scene--the one when John Cusack rescues his family from the crumbling house.The notions of tectonics used for this movie are very approximative. The breaking should be preceded by the shaking; it shakes before it breaks. The earth should not break like a pancake.",2012
82,davispittman,A mixed bag.....,6,26 October 2016,"2012 really is a mixed bag. I liked the actors and their performances, including Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and more. The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012.",2012
83,3xHCCH,Wasted Opportunity for a More Powerful Message,6,19 November 2009,"2012 is just barely 3 years away, and this movie reminds us that Mayan, Chinese and Biblical sources all are telling us that year would bring with it the end of days as we know it.The movie is big stuff. It looks expensive from the trailers alone. Watching the film itself though is another matter. This is already the third disaster movie by director Ronald Emmerich, after ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (unless you count ""Eight Legged Freaks""). I do not really know how a film of this immense magnitude can give the feeling of being so shallow. There was a great potential for this movie to deliver a powerful message here. But unfortunately, we get a cartoon-like movie with the most corny and downright cheesy scenes and dialog.Don't get me wrong, there are several edifying and unprecedented images like that of the White House being destroyed by an runaway aircraft carrier, or that of flooding in the Himalayas. But scenes like those when John Cusack was driving his limo through falling buildings from Pasadena to Sta. Monica Airport, or his getting out alive from a camper swallowed up by the gaping earth at Yellowstone are too ridiculously over-the-top to be any good. Definitely one close call too many.As for the characters, they are too one-dimensional and too unbelievably super-human to care about. The wild character of Woody Harrelson was too nutty to be likable. In truth, I only liked the geologist Adrian Helmsley (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), his Indian geologist friend and the family of the Tibetan monk. They had scenes of genuine pathos amidst the chaos.",2012
84,drystyx,way too Hollywood to even keep you awake,2,19 June 2010,"This is an end of the world story, in case you didn't know. Roughly another remake of WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, which doesn't make it bad. It's a common theme, surviving the end of the world, and should make a good movie.Unless you just make it as Hollywood as you can. This movie is cliché after cliché. We know exactly who will live and who will die from page one, and the attempts at humor are stupid.There's not a fresh idea in this movie. Most modern writers have better scripts in which the world is reformulated. That would be a good idea, if a better script went with it. After watching this tripe, I don't believe you could have had a script that was worse than this.The second biggest failure of this film is the constant barrage of peril. There comes a point, after about 5 disasters in a 20 second period, that we just say ""I don't care any more"", and it gets utterly boring, impossible to stay awake through. It's like the con artist who says he'll give you back the money he borrowed if you loan him more. People who grew up rough will not care for this type of ""con"", and will fast forward the scenes like I did. It's just not entertainment. Those who think it is would be great marks for the con artists.The biggest failure is the lame attempt to make an ""everyman"" hero, but even the ""everyman"" is just too well to do to stand out from the others. In fact, all the characters who are glamorized are meant to appeal to rich audiences. This is simple marketing 101, going after the audiences with the most money, but it makes for a poor movie.",2012
85,ptb-8,a recipe for disaster,7,13 November 2009,"Here is the recipe for the 2012 disaster as we now know it: Take one chunk of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, add NOAH'S ARK, some SODOM AND GOMORRAH, mix with an EARTHQUAKE, a shake of TOWERING INFERNO, some AIRPORT '75 cockpit grunts, some KARKATOA boom-box and flying island chunks, a serve of Yellowstone level VOLCANO and DANTE'S PEAK antics, two tsunami sized POSEIDON rolls, a SAN FRANCISCO shake up of LA instead, no-Hanks everyman family glue repair, some TITANIC vessels and a hilariously sloshy LOST HORIZON sequence with teapot monks and a monster 'plane skidding along a glacier, add $200million mix in some Teutonic severity about humanity and - DING - cook in the CGI microwave. The result is the over-baked catastrophe laden mega biscuit called 2012. For those who don't drown in destruction and can last the 158 minute apocalypse of suburbia slipping like cakes into the sea, you will marvel at the inhumanity of it all as everything we have ever known gets pushed over. My favorite bit? The massive Aircraft Carrier the John F Kennedy being washed onto the White House as Washington is drowned. Everything gets smashed in this movie. Those who survive are far from the best available too. ""What a mess"" might be the most appropriate reaction, as you brush the chewed popcorn from yourself as you stand to run from the cinema. The CGI destruction is too real for it's own good and would certainly give pre-teens horror nightmares.",2012
86,jaybob,A disaster film with a great sense of humor.,8,3 March 2010,"Roland Emmerich has created a comic gem in 2012. He not only directed, he co-wrote it, with Harold Closer,He was (as all good directors are) very much involved in the music & editing as well as the special effects.He fully realized that even tho the subject matter (global warming will eventually destroy us); a careful rational screenplay would not satisfy the the demands of an audience raised on special effects. He did create a screenplay full of humor & still had awesome special effects depicting the end of the world as we know it.There have been a few films over the years about an ensuing apocalypse, Most of them were plain stupid, & utterly without any feeling of enjoyment.NOTE: A DISASTER SPECIAL EFFECT LADEN FILM IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.We cannot take this type movie seriously.What you need is a cast of some familiar faces, some new faces and who are for the most part all likable people. PLUS one standout role.(preferably near the beginning of film).Woody Harrelson fits this role to a T. His role is a gem & it sets the the tone, of not taking the re of the film too seriously.I for one was able to sit back & enjoy myself,I knew many of these nice people (in the cast & some others) would survive & the world would be saved.The spirited, well acted & defined cast stars John Cusack & he is ably supported by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandie Newton,Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet,& Danny Glover, among others.The special effects are fantastic, as one would expect.The running time is a FAST 158 minutes., On the DVD there are a few good extras as well.

87,aharmas,A total disaster,5,26 November 2009,"It must be said that it will be hard to top the scenes where L.A. disappears because of the catastrophic events in the thin plot line. If only, someone had decided to put the care that went into the visuals, revising, editing, and maybe writing some good lines. It's possible. As we have seen before in the ""Star Wars"" films, many other action films, and even some of the many sources of inspiration for this project, there is more to a good film than just a lot of CGI.Watching John Cusack play action hero is always a thrill, especially when the poor man doesn't have much to say, and we have always appreciated him for being able to speak in more than monosyllables and present the most trivial of events and dialogue in quite a sophisticated manner. He's a thinking actor. In here, he benefits from the fact that we are always distracted by the disaster that is either happening or is about to hit the screen.It's amusing to see how much could actually fit in ""2012"" and somehow we were not completely exhausted by the end of the movie. I thought the iceberg was a little too much, but the crowds were happy...The film is not boring, but it's just a bit too much, after all a thrilling ride is exciting, but how much can we expect from a total disaster? from the end of the world? and did anyone catch how those people got on board. It doesn't give us much to hope for if anything like that ever happens.",2012
88,Enchorde,Why can't we have an end of the world without kids?,6,5 September 2010,"Recap: Dr Adrian Helmsley is invited to his friend and colleague's research facility in India. There he has discovered that the neutrino flux from the sun has changed and is irrevocably heating up the Earth's core. This in turn will lead to the destabilization of the Earth's crust, and practically the end of the world. Adrian, who is employed by the US government rushes this to the presidential adviser, and secret plans are made how to save humankind. The problem is, they can't save everybody. Jackson Curtis is a more or less failed writer, separated from his wife and two kids, who during a camping trip to reconnect with his kids stumbles on the secret. A race and fight to save his family starts with disaster striking all around them.Comments: Emmerich, the director, said that he wanted to make one final disaster movie, and that he wanted to pack everything in it. He did. 2012 is a spectacular disaster movie, that probably should be enjoyed at s big screen as possible. The effects are grand, a non-stop show of apocalyptic destruction. Floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, plane crashes, falling skyscrapers, I think we got most, if not all of the disaster movies covered. So, there is nothing new really, but just more of it, with to date unparalleled effects.Unfortunately this is a effects show through and through. The background story is regrettably also a complete reuse and repetition of older disaster movies. It robs the movie of all suspense and wonder of what is going to happen next. Who will survive is no surprise, but predictable from the get go. Why it was decided to include, no check that, to rely on a story of a absent separated father that finally comes through and saves his family, is beyond me. It is completely worn out, and something Emmerich himself has used before, but that's also the answer to why. If he didn't have to work on the story, all the focus could be put into the effects, which everything is all about anyway. And why not, when the movie is already saving the world and humankind, why not save the family unit too? So yet again we have a movie that suffers from the Annoying Kid Syndrome (which actually seems to be growing into an epidemic). To be truthful it doesn't suffer as bad as many other movies, but at key and crucial moments, the kid is either totally helpless and just screaming, or tries to be the hero and save them all, even if they're just ten years old. The most plausible outcome of that should be the demise of the kid, the family and in this movie a couple of hundred thousands more. Yet it is never so. Understandably, what writer or director would kill off a child? But leave them out of it from the beginning and problem solved! Because screaming and ten year old heroics are not that enjoying. But that may be because I got no kids of my own yet Besides the kid characters (I've got absolutely nothing against the kids themselves!) I found the cast good. John Cusack is a solid veteran that has been around before but especially Chiwetel Ejiofor is good, and underrated in general. Amanda Peet and Thandie Newton bring some known names to the cast, but their supporting roles are too small for them to have any real impact on the movie, which is very much male oriented.It is long, so make time for watching it, but it is rarely dull, even though predictable as a street sign. Sit back, turn of that brain, and enjoy the end of the world, that is the spectacular world of special effects.6/10",2012

While John Cusack's storyline was completely farcical and highly unlikely, I find it horrifying to see how realistic the cataclysmic events would be and how the people would react in that situation, because I can absolutely believe how evilly selfish and single minded people are. Can you imagine Trump if the world was ending? He'd deny it all, whilst locked in a bunker somewhere, with supplies to feed millions just for him and his closest friends no doubt!I also feel really sorry for poor Dr Helmsley, not only did he have to go through this, but he was also a slave for twelve years and he had to marry Kiera Knightley in Love Actually, I think he did a great job in this film though.
I'm not sure I would have chosen John as the lead, although I suppose he is a bit more of the everyday guy for a change, but his car and aeroplane escapes were all a bit far fetched for me.
This film can be very emotive in places, but I don't think it really gives you time to think about it all and perhaps there was too much going on making it such a very long film. Did they need to face so many challenges?? That said, it's a good film and the story isn't bad, most of the budget I would imagine went on some tremendous special effects.I only hope that when the apocalypse comes, that some government somewhere is more organised to save more people. I'm planning on a move to the moon if anyone wants to come with me as I seriously don't expect to be saved on any ark if it comes to it!",2012

94,Rob_Taylor,"Should be renamed ""2,012 daring escapes by aeroplane!""",5,12 December 2009,"First off, the best thing about this movie are the CGI effects. I take off my metaphorical hat to the people involved in the creation of the visual goodness on screen. They went to a great deal of effort and, without a shadow of a doubt, their work is the most creative thing about this film. Well done guys! The 5/10 I gave this film is entirely down to your efforts.Now the not so good. Where to start...Firstly, if you're expecting a drama about people coping with the end of the world you will be disappointed. This movie focuses entirely on one family and their efforts to survive. Of course, they are a dysfunctional family. That way the scriptwriters can perform what I'll laughingly refer to as ""character development"" in order to get the family back in order again by the end of the film.Apart from the family, the rest of the cast are limited to playing awful stereotypical roles such as Russian Oligarch, spoilt rich kids, noble scientist, holy man, crackpot conspiracy theorist etc etc. You get the idea. These other characters, unlike the family, are not ""developed"" during the film. In fact, their sole purpose appears to be to die at appropriate moments during the film once their usefulness to the family is at an end.Essentially, the movie is one long chase scene, with the family narrowly avoiding death (usually by plane) with increasingly foolish scenes of ""nail-biting tension"". But realistically, once you've seen them avoid death by taking off in a plane for the THIRD time, you begin to wonder just how flimsy the script was in order that they had to repeat essentially the same scene again and again.Oh yeah, call me nerdy if you must, but I imagine that, when the runway drops out from beneath your plane into a gaping chasm there would be a certain amount of suction trying to pull your plane in. Guess that one (repeatedly) escaped the physics advisors attention.Though the film trailers make a big thing of the 2012 Mayan apocalypse, this is only touched on briefly during the film. It's essentially a marketing gimmick designed to draw in impressionable fools. Likewise, the ""science"" explanation behind the cause of the disaster is only touched on vaguely and then forgotten. It's almost as if they were embarrassed to let the audience dwell on the absurdity of it for too long.The dialogue is also some of the most awful I've heard in a long time, but it's the lack of intelligence behind it that insults me the the most. For instance, in one scene the President of the US lets his daughter in on the disaster looming, telling her ""Only 6 people in the entire administration know what I'm about to tell you!"" Yeah, right. That would be the 6 people other than the tens of thousands of rich billionaires who are funding the project, apparently, and who all seem to know what is going on. Yep, that would be a really easy secret to keep.And whilst we are on the subject of who gets to go aboard the ships and all, just what chimp thought that one up as a believable scenario? That thousands of rich idiots would be the best gene-pool for rebuilding human society? If our species really was that shallow then we honestly wouldn't deserve to survive the apocalypse.So in summary, all I can say is, watch the movie (if you must) for the effects, but don't expect either good characterisations or dialogue, let alone a sensible plot. I recommend several stiff drinks beforehand, and probably it's a good idea to smuggle a bottle into the cinema with you, just to take the edge off. You'll need it before the end..",2012
95,bobbysing,Visually Stunning but scores low on content.,7,16 November 2009,"When you are going to see a movie which has already impressed you with its outstanding trailer, then it's obvious to expect something great and out of the ordinary. That was the state I was in while entering the theater to watch 2012. Excitingly waiting for the movie to start, I had many questions in mind about how the director will tackle the various ongoing problems of the world while showcasing the Ultimate End of our civilization? And majorly what will be his take on the famous religions of the world when the characters will be talking about their Final Moments? And to my surprise the movie took off from our part of the world in 1999, where an Indian Geologist religiously named Dr. Satnam, discovers that the Earth is heating up to an extent that is causing a shift in its tectonic plates. He passes on the news of this deadly discovery to his American friend Dr. Adria, who straight away takes it to the White House as an emergency situation. Coming back to the future in 2012, the movie plunges into the amazing graphical world where the earth is sinking due to the high density earthquakes and all the historical monuments are falling left and right like lifeless toys.Visually it's a fabulous portrayal of the End of the World from the director ""Roland Emmerich"" who is known for his mesmerizing work in his earlier movies such as ""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"". The moment you witness the first shattering sequence of the earth making a huge wide gap and everything falling into it, you get transported into a gripping enigmatic world altogether. The spectacular special effects unfolding every 15 minutes in the movie, just keep you glued to the screen with your jaws wide open. The disastrous happenings worldwide, the enormous water tides coming over, the burning volcanic eruptions and ugly tsunamis spreading over the world map just bring on the viewer to the edge of his seat.Hence, if you are in for some great Computer Graphics and want to see a few terrific nail biting scenes where the heroes are just climbing up before the earth sinks in, then this is the perfect choice to spend your valuable time.But if you are expecting a great movie, rich on emotional and futuristic content as suggested by the impressive body of work by its director, then you may remain quite unsatisfied at the end. In simple words, 2012, undoubtedly scores high on technical and graphical terms but content wise it falls short of the earlier disaster movies from the director. It lacks the emotional depth in its characterization due to which the viewer is not able to relate with any of the characters fighting with the unwanted situation. In order to cover more number of people on the screen, the script fails to develop any one character in particular, which as a result leaves a very cold kind of impact on the viewer. The movie also tends to become a bit slow at times but bounces back with every new destruction sequence on the screen.The entire cast delivers fine performances as required by the subject, but they are also handicapped by the poor characterization in the script. John Cusack is pleasant to see but has nothing great written for him in particular. Amanda Peet is just there to give her constant looks of amazement. Danny Glover as the president, Thandie Newton as his daughter, Oliver Platt as the president's chief of staff and Jimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam simply play their parts as directed. Only Chiwetel Ejiofor looks like more concerned about the humanity factor in the movie and makes an impact.2012 also tends to be repetitive in few sequences which strongly give you a feeling of ""seen before"". The movie even reminded me one of the early 80's disaster movies called ""Earthquake"". In fact this time, Emmerich also seems to be inspired by his own masterpieces from the past. He surely surpasses them all in terms of mass destruction of the globe, but talking about the rich emotional quotient of those Hit movies, 2012 comparatively scores quite low. Emmerich, intentionally skips many important questions related to various countries and religions practiced by different people residing all over the globe.The main drawback of the movie is that even though it revolves around the concept of end of the world and its civilization, still it is unable to frighten you with the scary thought. The movie keeps on impressing you with its exceptional execution constantly but at the same time, fails to take you in on emotional grounds. In a nutshell, it's a film very rich in the Cinematography and Computer Graphics department, but is also quite unimpressive in its content.Interestingly the movie ends with a clear message to the World and its entire population. It simply says that ""Now is the time that we all have to unite together at the earliest or else the nature will unite us deliberately in its own destructive way.""",2012
96,eric262003,This Will Not Likely Happen Two Years From Now,6,26 July 2010,"When I came to the theaters last year to see the disaster movie ""2012"", I came in expecting, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions and civilians facing their greatest fears in the ultimate battle for survival. An ideal overview of what could possibly happen on that faithful date of December 21st, 2012 when supposedly the end of the world will take place. I have a bit of mixed feelings about this movie. And the pros and the cons seem equally balanced. On the one hand, the acting was overall pretty good, for a movie that should've been released around the time summer blockbusters are released. But what was a turn-off mostly was that this movie's running time was too long. Perhaps some much-needed editing was in great need of desire. Certain scenes are greatly not needed and others scene just took too long to unravel. The special effects was absolutely spectacular. Director Roland Emmerich has been wowing his audience with special effects ever since his 1996 monster blockbuster ""Independence Day"". And once again, the explosions and blowups never cease to amaze me as it always leads to an exciting ride. The other flaw beside the overlong running time, is the script. There was not one believable scene that would likely happen in a battle for life and death. I mean come on, I can take the thrills and spills, but I assure you that that in 2012, there will be no planes going through flying buildings, or people jumping out of a cargo plane at rapid speed off a snowy mountain. The whole idea of this end of the world movie is utterly ridiculous. Whoever believes this these events are going to happen in the next few years are as naive as they come. And this has happened once too many times in an Emmerich film. He's notorious for hiring top performers in the industry, throw in some dazzling effects to keep us from leaving the theater, yet throws away all logic by enhancing exaggerated situations that will never happen. The settings of this story is quite global. The traveling is situated from the Vatican City to Yellowstone Park, to Washington D.C. and much, much more. The timing for release took place way too late in the year. It was supposed to be a summer movie but it came out in November. Makes you wonder, did Columbia Pictures deliberately stalled the release because it did not appeal to the summer crowd. Makes you wonder don't it? I expected the thrills of the movie and I knew what I was getting into. And If you are passive with some mundane dialogue along the way, then it is still worthy for a view or two. But if you go in thinking this will happen in the next couple of years, then you might as well believe in Santa Claus.",2012
97,Matt_Layden,We Were Warned.....About How Crappy This Movie Is.,3,5 August 2010,"2012 is a jumbled mess of a film. Roland Emmerich stated that for his last disaster flick he wanted to make it so that no other disaster flick could come after it. Well, mission accomplished because I don't want to see anymore. Upping the disaster scale to the entire world might do well for the special effects guys, buy not the paying viewer.2012 has a very thin plot. People must survive. Is that a plot? It's more of a story. John Cusack is one of those people and he is with his ex-wife, his two kids and their step father, whom he hates. He gets the word that disaster is going to strike when a crazy old hippie guy, Woody Harrelson (big stretch) tells him about the world crumbling beneath our feet. This happens and the poop hits the fan. It seems that every single person in California dies, except for this one group. Why might you ask? Apparently Cusack, who is not only a writer, but a limo driver, has the skills and the vehicle power (a limo) to outrun global destruction. Emmerich is not that bad of a director. He is often compared to Michael Bay for choosing big scale productions and not caring about story or characters. 2012 is the perfect example of this. In his earlier film, Independence Day, he gave us big explosions and aliens to shoot. Characters were lacking but the charisma of Will Smith, the character actor of Jeff Goldblum and Randy Frickin Quaid gave us something to smile at. John Cusack is wooden, Amanda Peet cries and a big Russian guy speaks with a thick accent. We are given zero, nadda, not even an inch of anything interesting to care about these characters. Why do I care if they live? Why do I want to spend the next 90 plus minutes with them. The answer is you don't. I wanted to spend my time with Woody I'm higher than a kite right now Harrelson. The film is really just an excuse for the special effects guys to do their thing. Yet this is also a hit or miss. Sometimes it's actually entertaining and interesting to see the world fall beneath your feet. Other times it's painfully obvious how fake everything is. Check out the grocery store scene when the entire store literally splits in half. It's like the green screen was done in the 80's. The big event happens while Cusack and co and driving through the thick of it. They drive through buildings, jump obstacles, get covered in human feces. You read that right.The children cry and are annoying. The older son doesn't seem to respect his dad, he calls him by his first name and not dad. Yet of course, because the world is about to end, he re- evaluates his outlook on his flawed hero of a father and calls him dad. He even risks his life to be with him. The daughter just tries to not wet her bed. The step father is a nice guy, yet for some reason who are told to hate him. The conclusion of his character is sad and a pathetic excuse to get the torn family back together. Am I really ruining anything for you?Danny Glover is the president...remember the last time Hollywood had a black president, I think there was a giant asteroid heading towards the earth. Is Hollywood trying to tell us that we are doomed the day a black man becomes president. I wonder when that day will come...oops. A side plot involving rich people being the ones who will be saved is tiresome. The film tries to villainize a rational man. 2012 tries to make you believe that it's a small world, all these people who meet at one point will meet again. This is suppose to be WORLD DESTRUCTION. There is another problem, too many characters to not care about. Are we really suppose to care about George Segal and the conflict with his son that lasts all about 3 minutes? 2012 is a blunder, a disaster of a disaster film. Bigger is not always better. It lacks the science, logic and intelligence it needs to be taken with any credibility. Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day are all entertaining flicks in my mind. Everything since has been crap, let's just name those films off shall we? Godzilla? The Patriot? The Day After Tomorrow? 10,000 B.C. God, I forgot that film even existed. 2012 was a film to see in the theatres for the loud sound and big screen special effects. Now that the theatre time has passed, there is no point in seeing it.",2012
98,moviewizguy,We Were Warned.,9,29 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich has given movie watchers several apocalyptic films in the past in INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and he offers another look at the end of the world in 2012.From THE FINAL DESTINATION to WOLVERINE and even WATCHMEN, there have been some disappointing movies this year. There's no doubt on that. Saying that, 2012 is not only the mother of all disaster movies, it may be one of the most satisfactory movies of this year, mainly because it delivers on what audiences expect and even more.Now we have seen disaster movies millions of times. We know the formula: You have a bunch of survivors who don't work well with each other at first but later become a ""family"" once they have been through the disaster, or, in this case, disasters. 2012 is formulaic to its core. It even has that dog that we all root for to survive, but it's a formula for a reason and when a movie works it so well, you can't help but stand up and cheer when the end credits roll.This is 2012. One big, major reason this movie is sooooo good is because of the effects, the CGI. They are AH-MAZE-ING. The details put in almost every disaster sequences is commendable to say the least. In one sequence, we can literally see tiny people getting crushed and killed by flying cars, falling towers, and Earth's shaking crust from down below. Remember that chase scene in THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW where that group of people ran away from frozen ice? Well, there's an earthquake chase scene in here, which I know you have all seen in one case or another, that makes that other chase scene look like a baby struggling to walk for the first time. It's just that good.Even the script is good. Sure, there are some laughable lines, but that's normal for a disaster movie. The characters are also very lovable. The film has a very diverse ensemble cast, with probably three main characters and many other secondary characters running around, and most of them work. John Cusack does a very fine job in his role, the great actor as he is. The character he plays is very sympathetic and caring. Chiwetel Ejiofor also has a main role here and does a great job with his role as one of the scientists.2012 is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, at times tear jerking, but, on top of all that, it's very entertaining from beginning to end. THIS is how you make a disaster movie. Of course, director Roland Emmerich should know that himself. He's, after all, the master of disaster. Sure, this may look like many other disaster movies you've seen, and it is, but you've never seen one quite like this. It gives you everything you want only bigger and louder and with some of the best CGI I've ever seen in cinematic history. If you go in expecting the mother of all disaster movies, you'll sure as hell get what you want.",2012
99,bob-rutzel-1,Woe is Us. Maybe,9,3 March 2010,"The earth is in the process of being destroyed due to extreme sun spot discharges on 21 December 2012. Jackson Curtis (Cusack) does his best to keep his family safe.This is just not a great disaster movie, it is also a glimpse of what many believe will happen to the earth on 21 Dec 2012. Throughout history we have been told about the possibility of this happening: The Mayan Calendar that ends on 21 Dec 2012 and many believe this was a warning to the rest of us, many cultures around the world have a similar foreboding, and, of course, Revelations in the Bible. I don't want to make light of something that very well could happen in 2012, but if it will all come true, kill me now. There will be no place to hide. In the movie, there were huge ships (read Arks). I counted four. And, those fortunate to go aboard have a good chance of surviving the catastrophe. The earth itself isn't going to be completely destroyed, it is just going to resettle itself. There will be Pole shifting. Maybe the South Pole will settle in a place like Leesburg, Virginia. See? You never know.I thought the movies Live Free and Die Hard and Beowulf had the best CGI, but this one is right up there if not being the very best. One couldn't help thinking that if it all came true, would we see and experience similar scenes of devastation. I choose not to dwell on it. It will be what it will be. Maybe. In real time and the Doomsday scenario aside, the first half of the movie was exciting, but the second half dragged somewhat because it dealt with the human condition of survival. Now, this too is somewhat exciting, but the scenes aboard one of the big ships (read Arks) where the doors can't be closed because something is clogging the gears went on for too long. I guess they needed something more dramatic at the end since no one believed we were too exhausted by the drama in the beginning. But, it went on for too long. This movie was very believable and if you don't think about what may really happen on 21 Dec 2012, you are already on another planet. If you look at this movie as just another disaster movie and believe all this is nonsense, well, good for you. Stay happy and enjoy the CGI and special effects. Now let me pose the question that we would all think about after seeing this movie: should I buy Christmas presents in Dec 2012? The other question I have is: Anyone know where the big boats (read Arks) are? Woe is Us. Maybe. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",2012
100,elliotjeory,Special Effects good storyline bad,5,1 March 2021,Good points about this film: excellent CGI and Woody Harrelson. Bad points: very corny story. Unrealistic scenes. It's too long.,2012
101,Luigi Di Pilla,Amazing and entertaining action movie,7,4 December 2009,I don't know why there are so negative reviews here but I and my friend enjoyed 2012 because it was very entertaining and amazing with full of real great special effects never seen before. I recommend you to watch it first in the theater because this kind of action movie is much more interesting to enjoy on the big screen. But I will buy it also on DVD when it will be out to add it in my best of collection. 2012 sets new levels and standards in this genre of apocalyptic catastrophes when I compare THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW from the same director Roland Emmerich. This one is the best action film of this year by far. What I liked the most were the eruptions of the volcano and the air plane scenes with the little jet and the Antonov. The dialogs are well packed in some good jokes and I laughed a lot as my friend. The rescue plan is perhaps fetched a little far away but it is a very original one. Thank you Roland Emmerich for this great ride. Final vote: 7/10.,2012
102,denis888,Farce,1,31 May 2010,"Mind you, Roland Emmerich is a great filmmaker and he can create a truly brilliant work - like my favorite The Day After Tomorrow, or Independence Day. These are really cool and compelling works. 2012 is not. Oh my, almost 3 hours of complacency, vapid jokes, caricatures and shallow images. The main hero? Sure, divorced. President of USA? Sure. African-American. Russian? Sure, fat bandit. Chinese? All cruel morons. Catholics? All die very soon. Tibet lamas? All light and grace. I am tired of those cartoon'd images. A real farce, especially think of the silly-looking Queen of England. Nothing here holds it together. John Cusack? Amanda Peet? Naaah, boring! The only light spot is Woody Harrelsson and his short role, pity, too cameo...",2012

104,jjnxn-1,Scrapping the bottom of the disaster barrel,1,12 May 2013,"There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. The almost total non involvement with the characters, the fact that the constant disasters shown are transparently models or CGI so who cares if they are destroyed, the horrible music score, the casting of an ever more annoying John Cusack in the lead, the fact that many good actors are forced to appear in this kind of slop just to keep working. On top of all that it is way too long. The film makers have obviously forgotten the basic tenants of this kind of film, to have people you care about be front and center and have the jeopardy be something the audience can relate to at least abstractly. If your in the mood for a disaster epic watch The Towering Inferno or the original Poseidon Adventure instead!!",2012
105,MartianOctocretr5,Will the end of the world really be this cheesy and ridiculous?,5,11 April 2010,"Eye-popping, cheesy nonsense. A vote of at least five just for having a good laugh at how dumb it gets. Production wise, it's a disaster, and I'm not referring to the earthquakes. A note to the writer/director: Earthquake faults do not chase people. Not even when they're driving on suburban sidewalks at 100 miles an hour. People do not drive through collapsing buildings or collapsing freeway bridges. Guys with two beginner's flight lessons cannot pilot anything, let alone giant specially designed Russian planes. There is no such thing as a ""countdown to tsunami impact"" device. No one, not even John Cusack, survives 50,000 life/death situations in a single day without getting killed a few hundred times or so. Nobody on this planet can climb out of an RV falling into a giant sink-hole, and then outrun an airplane on foot, and get pulled into it by the arm as it takes off. That's just a few of this film's outlandish moments. You expect exaggeration and chaos in a disaster movie, but 2012 just blasts you like an atomic bomb.Forget about the Mayan calendar premise. Instead, we get some nut who looks like a cross between John the Baptist and Howard Stern. He's hiding out with a mammoth radio transmitter in an old trailer in Yellowstone Park, and broadcasts his meandering conspiracy/Armageddon rants. Why nobody triangulate his signal, or notices him hanging from trees yelling at the top of his voice, is never explained. Yet Cusack listens to the guy's ravings from 1,000 miles away in southern California, and hopes to get some map from him. Other annoying characters: essential divorced father with brat kids. (At least the little girl was good in her role, really the only character worth caring about. But even with her, they introduce a useless sub-plot.) The Russian billionaire or whatever he was and his doggy-toting blonde bimbo? And don't get me started on those twins from a horror movie. Why all these fools? By the way, Oliver Platt is third in the line of Presidential succession, in case you didn't know. Just ask him. Character and story line clichés assault the audience mercilessly. The line ""Nothing should come between us,"" is sad. After all the explosions, they find a few last things to destroy, until there's finally just nothing left to blow up. Such a whimpering end would never do, so the film desperately resorts to utterly pathetic plot contrivances. Complete with hammered-in schmaltzy sentiment that'll makes your eyes roll so hard they'll hurt. This one is good as a joke only.",2012
106,DJAkin,The End of Days meets Woody Harlson,7,14 March 2010,"First of all, this movie was not meant to be taken seriously. There is no way that a person could drive a limo all over town while the world was crumbling underneath. That was a very unrealistic scene. I thought it was almost amazing when John Cusack drove his limo through a building and then somehow made it to the airport and took off while the Langoliers were closing in behind him. Yes, you hear me right. This movie reminded me of Stephen King's The Langoliers. Of course, Woody Harlson was the highlight of the movie as that person in Yellowstone where he was able to predict all of these events. I was shocked at the outcome of him. I was also noticing that when the Washington Monument crashed, a ton of ash and debris flew all over the place and landed on Danny Glover's face. He looked identical to his Predator Character in that scene. Speaking of Predator...that was a terrible Arnold Shcwartzeneggar actor pretending to be him.",2012
107,sme_no_densetsu,It's the end of the world as we know it,7,31 December 2009,"Roland Emmerich's ""2012"" is the latest in a long line of apocalyptic popcorn flicks with more reliance on special effects than on story. Here, major problems with the heat of the earth's core threaten to bring about cataclysmic earthquakes and related disasters. Naturally, world governments have decided to keep a lid on the problem until it's too late for the common man to do anything about it (though a few conspiracy theorists know the score). With this backdrop, the film focuses on a family trying their best to escape the mayhem.The cast isn't bad, considering the number of recognizable actors present. Chiwetel Ejiofor & Oliver Platt deliver the best performances but it's clear that the special effects wizards are the real stars of the show. The effects are indeed striking though they later take a back seat to the human drama. That wouldn't have been such a concern if the story was truly compelling instead of rehashing the usual 'struggle for survival' plot points (eg. self-serving actions for some, pleas for humanity for others, etc...).Emmerich's bombastic style is well-suited to the subject matter but the film's bloated runtime may tax the patience of some viewers. While the effects may be worthy of Oscar consideration there's nothing else about the film that's exceptional. The bottom line is that ""2012"" is a competent special effects extravaganza which offers little to distinguish it from others of its type.",2012
108,rivertam26,kinda awful but fun,5,13 November 2009,"Make no mistake about this film it is a gargantually...retarted movie. It may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in fact but I still managed to have a pretty good time. I know many of you will be saying well what did you expect it's from the director of Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Stargate, 10,000 BC, The Patriot and Universal Soldier. All for which I can say I enjoyed some much more than others. To me his films have always been fine tuned popcorn machines. The truth about 2012 is it's kind of a mess and I don't think he's ever really made a bad movie, this is a bad movie. If your not getting the jist of what I'm trying to say let's put it this way for those of you who had problems with XXX being unrealistic beware. Because this is the most jaw droppingly silly film ever made. What's it about? Basically the prophecy of world apocalypse from the Mayan civilization brutally ripped apart and dumbed down by the Hollywood machine. You don't care about any of the characters well except for Jimi Mistry, oddly enough. The acting is mediocre(John Cusack) to horrendous (Amanda Peet) and there are just some really weird ones thrown in (Woody Harrelson). The visual effects are striking at times and really cheestastic at others. The green screen is so majorly overused too much in this film. What the film does have to offer is an admirable devotion to its stupidity which makes the proceedings at times to be so extremely entertaining. In fact for most of the film I was pretty much on board. The LA scene outlined in the trailer and TV spots isn't really suspenseful but it's shockingly fun. But in it's ponderous last 40 mins it lost me mainly with an unintentionally laughable moment with a stereotypical Russian thug and a flying kid. And it's a moment that will be remembered forever. It's in that moment that I realized that nothing can really, truly redeem this film from it's obsurdity and length. So with that I say that I'm happy that I saw it and may peek again on DVD just for a few scenes but another full viewing the future does not hold. All in all not the disturbing impact you'd effect but if anything discourages any realistic fear aligned with prophecy altogether.",2012
109,Troy_Campbell,This is as fun as they come.,6,13 November 2009,"If you want the world to end then hire Roland Emmerich. He has alien spaceships at his disposal. He can turn on a global warming crisis that causes a modern day ice age. Heck, he even has a giant lizard to cause a bit of damage. If all of that wasn't enough the German director can now make the Earth's crust shift so much that cracks consume entire cities, Yellowstone park turns into the largest volcano in the world and tsunamis almost reach the peak of Mt Everest. Damn.Looking for bang for your buck? Look no further. Emmerich's latest in all things destructive is a spectacle like no other. What makes it so impressive are the remarkable special effects; if buildings and freeways were ever going to fall into mile long crevices in the ground, then this is surely what it would be like. The abundant use of CGI is not subtle, but it doesn't matter, because it seems so real and the gigantic set pieces that it features in are so bloody exciting. Of the multitude of adrenaline pumping sequences the plane taking off in L.A. is a highlight; seeing Jackson and his family fly between 80 storey buildings that are collapsing is a sight to behold. The U.S.S. John Kennedy aircraft carrier slamming into the Capitol Building is a quick scene that stands out as well.There's probably little point talking too much about the plot. Unsurprisingly it's a load of baloney, but the fact that you're not thinking about its implausibility and predictability due to the constant action is a feat in itself. The cast do well to provide entertaining pawns on the Emmerich chess board: the always likable Cusack makes for an easy hero to root for; Ejiofor gives his scientist a humanistic element; whilst Harrelson is the standout in his deliriously amusing role as the whack job who predicts the end is nigh.It may be slightly long – the final 30 minutes can't keep up the pace of the preceding two hours – and naturally there are plot holes galore, however this is as fun as they come. Recommend big screen viewing for optimal enjoyment.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",2012
110,dunmore_ego,And he'll have fun fun fun 'til his daddy takes the CG away...,7,29 August 2010,"As disaster movies go, 2012 is definitely the big one. I mean, how do you outrun the world? An inordinately large neutrino burst from the sun causes the Earth to break, and creates much employment for special effects companies. Also, the planets in our solar system have aligned (which doesn't really mean anything, considering the gravitational force they would exert is microscopic) and narcissistic humans who still can't shake the fact that the universe does not revolve around them, seem to think it affects tectonic activity on little old Earth. Also - Mayan Prophecy. Now there's something REALLY scientific that proves all this is true! The Mayans predicted that in 2012, Digital Domain would have the computer graphic technology to wipe out the Himalayas and New York with tsunamis. This they do, as well as other cool stuff like raining down the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier on top of the White House and the noble president, who is tending injured people on the White House lawn by asking them if they'd vote for a public option.In 2012, writer-director Roland Emmerich has balanced his admittedly masterful use of CGI with his usually prosaic handling of human stereotypes. All the stereotypes are still here - the Everyman (John Cusack), the young scientist with all the answers and the body to go with them (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the noble President (Danny Glover - being black is now less of a fantasy than the nobility he displays in staying behind, which is absolute fantasy), the wacky prophet (Woody Harrelson), the ambitious politician (Oliver Platt), the brainless automaton military - but they either feel more organic to the plot, or the trillion dollar promotional campaign which could have gone towards bailing out another crybaby corporation on Wall Street affected my Discernment Gland.John Cusack uses his knowledge that he is the Leading Man to narrowly escape Earth-splitting cracks and falling objects, while wife Amanda Peet does her job of looking hot and screaming a lot; while her New Boyfriend (Thomas McCarthy, who can't stop looking like Patrick Wilson from WATCHMEN) pilots all of them unselfishly away from danger, when he should be familiar with enough disaster movies to realize he has to fall down a crevasse or something soon because his salary is nowhere near the Leading Man's.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Emmerich, Chiwetel Ejiofor actually does some exceptional acting up against Oliver Platt, causing them to almost disappear into another movie with more credibility and less screaming.Amidst Roland's advertisement for a suite of outboard tools, there are some genuine touching moments: Chiwetel's father onboard a cruise ship that ultimately goes Poseidon; Russian pilot Sasha's (Johann Urb) camaraderie with fellow pilot McCarthy - that's not to say there's anything original about these moments. Apart from the Leading Man's relationships, the strongest emotional bonds are the ones set up to specifically destroy and target our Weeping Gland.Final scenes show desperate humanity trying to board gargantuan ""arks"" that billionaires have paid to have a berth on. Chiwetel curbs the inherent selfishness of the species by giving Oscar Speech Number 23-a, ""What is it that makes us human?"" rolling smoothly into importuning, ""What will we tell our children?"" and ending with the glorious ""We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!"" which amazes us at how much it makes our flesh crawl.Okay, so let's deconstruct.1) ""What is it that makes us human?"" Apparently, money. The people clamoring to get onboard the arks, who are in danger of being left behind on the docks - ARE OTHER BILLIONAIRES who already paid for a berth, whom the arks were leaving behind because tsunamis were almost upon them. Opening the giant doors to let them in was not an act of kindness towards homeless bums and underprivileged day workers - it was a contractual obligation to other billionaires! 2) ""What will we tell our children?"" How about, ""I paid a billion Euros to save your necks and you should be building a shrine to thank me!""? Now go clean out the poo in the gorilla cage.3 ) ""We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!"" Sounds kinda morally correct - but is demonstrably wrong. Firstly, you already HAVE a civilization built on cruelty. The passengers onboard the arks were chosen because their pockets were one billion Euros deep. What exactly happened to all the middle class personnel who built the ships and maintained the infrastructure while you collected your billion-Euro payments? Oh, that's right, after they complete their menial jobs, they're dead to you. At least, they will be when that tsunami hits 'em in their poverty-stricken asses. Secondly, Mr. Black White House Official, have you forgotten that America's ""civilization"" was built on the skulls of Native Americans and African slaves? It's a good thing no one is paying attention to anything except the special effects. Or we'd all be dead.",2012

This is relayed to the Prez of the U.S.A. (Danny Glover. A BLACK Prez? Yeah right!) who initially sez let's keep this on the low-low.Meanwhile Jackson (John Cusack), an author/limo-driver (now there's a winning combo!) picks up his two kids from the ex-missus for their Daddy-Kids weekend that is to be spent camping in a National Park Let me just zip through 90 minutes of not much by saying that after meeting a scientist who has the answers but ain't telling, and a pot smoking hippie played by Woody Harrelson (WHAT A STRETCH!) who claims to have the answers but who can trust a pot smoking hippie? Jackson, kids, the ex and her current hubbie end up fleeing the West Coast of the US as it crumbles and falls around them.The benefit of CGI is that they can be shown just evading certain death in dramatic fashion. The pitfall of CGI is when they do it 77 times over an hour constant near death becomes a little dull.Roland has the nous to show enough famous landmarks going under so that the audience can identify them and say ""Oh, we went there honey!"". This always annoys me but what can you do? In Independence Day it was the WhiteHouse, in The Day After Tomorrow it was the Statue of Liberty (Yeah I didn't see it but it was on the cover and trailer), and here it is a variety of well known locales and landmarks.It turns out the well-to do and those in the know are all heading to China where a Plan Z is in effect, so Jackson and hangers-on hitch a ride with Jackson's mega billionaire employer, a Russian mogul for whom he chaufferred and off they go. Once in China they realize that not all will be admitted and that sacrifices must be made so that many can survive. But do they need to all die or are some decisions made so that the wealthy have more legroom? There are weasely politicians who do weasely things, especially as the deadline approaches, good people who make the ""Big"" decisions and try to convince others of the ""right things to do"", and the usual coincidences that keep embroiling Jackson and co right in the middle of the action.The film is essentially a big SFX extravaganza like Titanic and Avatar, you can see exactly where the money went. Like Titanic it is an overlong film with near miss after near miss that gradually gets stale and loses impact, but unlike Avatar this just doesn't have the ""WOW"" factor that gets you moving around in your seat.Near the end I asked myself just how many near misses I could take before I started rooting for nature and natural disasters to take 'em out. Fortunately one of the redeeming factors is that the kids aren't just little smarmy sh*ts, in fact further to being merely tolerable near the end Jackson and son have a ""serious"" chat that was actually surprisingly effective Then something exploded, some people screamed and we were back to business.Final Rating – 6 / 10. If this really was the end of the world I'd want then to hurry it along. 2 ½ hours of disaster gets on my last nerve! The film is frustratingly effective for reasonable periods though.",2012
113,Sirus_the_Virus,Roland Emmerich clearly had fun making it. As we did watching it.,10,15 November 2009,"Director Roland Emmerich returns with his newest film, 2012. Emmerich clearly has fun destroying the world. He did it in Godzilla, The Day after tomorrow, Independence day, Do i really need to go on? Every year I go to the movies for my birthday. Lasy year I saw Quantum of solace and really liked it. This year I saw 2012, the best disaster film I have seen in a long, long time. There have been some real crap ones too. Like Godzilla, if you call Transformers 2 one, then it is, and The day the earth stood still was one too. I was intrigued by every minute of 2012. The special effects in this movie were great. There are a lot of good actors in this, the plot is believable also, and this movie is a ton of fun.The film mostly revolves around an author named Jackson Curtis(Played by John Cusack). Fpor years, the world has been predicting that the world was going to end in 2012. Because that is the end of the Mayan calendar. As I said, the film revolves around Jackson Curtis. When him and his kids go to Yellostone park he meets a wacko(played by Woody Harrelson) who is talking about this stuff about the apocalypse and other stuff. Soon, this wacko's predictions come true. And Jackson, his kids, his ex-wife(Amanda Peet), and her new husband set off to escape the destruction including volcanoes, floods, and earthquakes. They are trying to get to China, where the government(including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt) and the president's daughter(Thandie Newton) and others are there, and there are these indestructible ships that could save everyone.This may sound completely unprofessional for me to say this. But this is one of the best films of the year. I did not see a problem with this film. Critics are hating it though. Richard Roeper gave it 1 star out of 5 saying that it is the stupidest film of the year. But I had a good time with this movie I think he is dead wrong.I was a big fan of this years Knowing, and that is also one of the best films of the year. Both of these films had great special effects and were a lot of fun. I am hoping that the world doesn't end in three years. This movie scared me shitless. And it will do the same to you. This could probably be the biggest disaster film of them all. And the best in a long time.",2012
114,antoniotierno,thrilling and astonishingly entertaining,7,26 November 2009,"2012 is an almost 3-hour movie made near entirely out of spectacular visual effects set pieces. The film story is based upon on the notion that the world is going to end in 2012, as already foretold by the Mayans. The movie has first some short character introductions but most of all the delights of special effects supersede the drama (that is not so bad though). Thanks to a huge millionaire budget, visual effects are the most breathtaking I've ever seen. The destruction of LA, as well as of other spots (Hawaii in particular) is rendered perfectly and in a terrifyingly detailed way. As every disaster/catastrophic movie there are plot holes, many things are unlikely (luckyly for us..) but on the whole the viewer is caught by the events and never gets bored. Acting performances are good, though not excellent, but the main thing is the story working, gripping and arousing emotions, as far as I can see.",2012
115,classicalsteve,"Independence Day Meets Noah's Ark: Visually Stunning Epic Distaster Film, Entertaining But Lapses Into Rather Cliché Storyline",6,14 November 2009,"The writer Christopher Hitchens once said that cliché is simply writing what has been written before, and writers should avoid it. Afterall, isn't writing about creating something new? About two or three scenes into ""2012"" I started noticing how much it parallels ""Independence Day"". At the beginning there is a scene in which some scientists are contemplating something astonishing that we can't see and one of them says something to the affect of ""Oh my God"". Next the film quick cuts to Washington DC. In this case, someone says to someone else ""You're about to meet the president."" Then another quick cut to a suburbanite (John Cusak) in mundane suburban America where he is late picking up his kids from his ex-wife. Wasn't there a similar series of sequences in ""Independence Day"" at the beginning? When the film finally get's going and decides on which people it is going to focus, there are two main groups of characters coupled with a lot of little side characters from different corners of the globe. Doesn't this ring of deja-vu all over again? Like Independence Day, there is the US President and his adviser-officials (sound familiar?), a group of suburban American nobodies led by John Cusak, some scientist characters who discover the ""castastrophe"", and a few characters who know these characters. Of course all these groups of people are all interrelated, and the two main groups actually converge. Seems to me this happened in Independence Day, although I think there were three groups of characters instead of two. In both films, the groups come together at a single location.The basic plot is simple yet global. The entire earth is about to suffer a global catastrophe in which the continental plates of the earth will break loose and start shifting on a massive scale. This will be the end of civilization, including K-Marts, twinkies, McDonalds, Burger Kings, Bank of America and AIG. Not even the Trump Palace will survive. Is this a catastrophe or poetic justice? This is the largest devastation since a comet hit the earth 65 million years ago to end the reign of the Dinosaurs, or at least since the inauguration of the 43rd President of the United States. The governments of the world have known about this for 3 years (since 2009) and have enacted a secret plan to save some of the world's elite, but kept this undercover from the public. Of course the only guy in the world to figure this out is a crazy coot living in the California-Nevada desert, played over-the-top by Woody Harrelson as your quintessential conspiracy theorist. He has even made a little 2-D YouTube video that explains the whole cover-up. As expected, for the movie's sake, he's right. Harrelson was my favorite character of ""2012"".The real star of ""2012"" has to be the visuals. The destruction of the planet in different parts of the world is probably worth the price of admission, especially to experience on the large screen. The first to fall is, you guessed it, Los Angeles. They always obliterate Los Angeles in these movies. Maybe there's some poetic justice in this. Probably the best sequence is Cusak et al navigating a limo through the streets of Los Angeles, avoiding collapsing offices, government buildings, DMV buildings, IRS buildings, and Hollywood studios. Many other cities around the world have the same fate and it did get a little repetitive after awhile.When the reality of the disasters is fully explained, I thought the script took a bit of a downturn. Cusak is back with his ex-wife, his kids, and his ex-wife's boyfriend (you have a feeling that either Cusak or the boyfriend will survive but not both) trying to save his family. Some of the acts of heroism reminded me of several other movies I had seen. There's the main presidential adviser, played by Oliver Platt, being just as you expect him, the amoral adviser who willingly sacrifices millions for the sake of a few. There's also the high Russian dignitary whose not only vain but selfish and over-indulges his twin sons. And the scientist that every one takes for granted, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, was again a bit predictable. I thought one unexpected moment of the film had to do with the US President, played by Danny Glover.And maybe more unexpected moments is what this movie needed. Aside from the catastrophes and the plot itself which were very unpredictable, the characters never do anything outside the box of how they're defined. The likable characters, like Cusak, are heroic. If they are selfish or amoral, they get their just desserts. Only the US President and Woody Harrelson's character behave unpredictably. American movies of this type are grade A in the visual and effects department, but grade about a C in the character and storyline department. I didn't know where the characters would end up and why, which is good, but I always knew what they would do. And that made it too predictable. I just knew, somewhere in this movie from the get-go, someone was going to make a speech about humanity, using this film as a soapbox. Please not again.",2012
116,MrGKB,Emmerich nonsense at its finest...,3,17 November 2009,"...or worst, depending on your sympathies, ""2012"" is a well-polished bolus of a film regardless. Its only genuine merit is spectacle, which it admittedly delivers in CGI spades. Earthquake? Check. Tidal waves? Check. Volcanic mayhem? Check. Avalanche? Check. Airplane crash? Check. Mayhem and mass destruction? Check, check, check, check. Aliens? Ch---oops, he left out the aliens. No death rays, sorry, Charlie.This is popcorn entertainment for the brain-dead masses, no question. H. L. Mencken must be laughing fit to kill. Emmerich crammed in every disaster movie cliché he could think of. Kids in peril, miraculously rescued? Check. Beloved pet, threatened and rescued? Check. Broken relationship magically healed? Check. Absurd pseudo-science and routine suspension of the laws of physics? Check. Stalwart supporting characters slaughtered with abandon? Check. Incredible coincidences, serendipities, and synchronicities? Check. Characters the audience really doesn't care about? Check. Attempts at humor more disastrous than the events depicted? Check. Actors taking paychecks? Check, please! Words fail me, as they did Emmerich. I really can't be bothered; nor was Emmerich. ""2012"" plays like it was plotted by a 10-year-old, and not a very bright one at that. Harold ""I can write words, too!"" Klosar's score is formulaic in extremis, utterly forgettable. As I said, the only thing this wretched excess of a film can boast is its visuals. In fact, one might be best off wearing earplugs and watching the screen shenanigans in silence. This baby is as bad, if not worse, than everything Emmerich has done to date. The only scary and/or exciting thing about it is how much money it's going to make. What a sad commentary on the collective IQ and thoughtless tolerance of its intended audience, which is to say, us.Have I written enough yet? Check. Cue last reel coda. Roll credits.Edited to correct typo.",2012
117,vip_ebriega,"Now, about the 10 stars...",10,16 November 2009,"My Take: A big-budget guilty pleasure blockbuster with spectacular special effects. You get what you pay for.You can keep your TRANSFORMERS 2, and I don't even need to see G.I. JOE and even TERMINATOR:SALVATION anymore. Roland Emmerich's latest end-of-the-world blockbuster 2012 is my favorite guilty pleasure blockbuster of year, perhaps even for a long time. It's been a long time ever since I saw an end-of-days disaster movie. And come opening day, I invited a date, lined up to get tickets, bought a two tubs of popcorn and my date and I were lucky enough to get two front row seats. Anyone going out to see a disaster movie by Roland Emmerich will know what to expect: A wholesale planet-wide demolition derby filled with several stock characters and some clichéd situations washed down a potpourri of impressive special effects, top thrills and an all-star cast. So why, you ask, do I think the movie deserves a 10 stars? Simple: It was fun. Great fun indeed. And at several occasions, pretty funny too. 2012 isn't just a disaster movie, it's every disaster movie ever made before rolled into one, and maybe multiplied to 10. Not only does the film tips its hat to every major disaster movie of yesteryear's, from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, to EARTHQUAKE and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE; It also references every disaster movie cliché in the book.The plot is pure sci-fi hokum about solar flares slowly heating up the Earth's core, not too fortunately coinciding with the Mayan civilization's prophecy of the Apocalypse. Scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) warns the White House chief-of-staff (Oliver Platt) and even The President (Danny Glover) himself about the impending doom. But what every end-of-the-world disaster flick needs is that everyman character. That character is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a failed writer-turned-limo driver who must try to save his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new surgeon boyfriend (Tom McCarthy); as well as his their two kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) from a crumbling California and possibly take them to China, where supposedly the government is building ships to carry enough people in case of the upcoming deluge. Keeping up with his tradition of a ""small-end-of-the-world-after-all"", the characters' fates are intertwined. Coincidence? I think not. Wait, don't throw your stones at me just yet. 2012 does have its ridiculous moments, plenty of them in fact. The clichés are fairly obvious (Don't worry, dogs never have their bad days in any Emmerich movie). There's isn't a cliché in the genre that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser didn't embrace. You'll probably laugh at these clichés, and yet you don't really laugh at them, but with them. But perhaps what really makes the show are the special effects. Emmerich reportedly informs that this would be his last doomsday epic, and he definitely goes all the way here; the effects are par excellence here. Cities are ravaged by multiple earthquakes and tsunamis, active volcanoes appear and shoot great balls of fire, and in typical Emmerich tradition: national monuments are blown up real good (most of them, you might have glimpsed at the trailer). The story may be pure pseudo-science, but the effects seem to make the catastrophe almost too real. In one instance, when St. Peter's Basilica gets a shaky tremor, I had to lean over my date and jokingly tell her that it was alright and it wasn't real. 2012 is spectacular fun, and ""fun"" is the key word here. The effects are truly marvelous, and unlike some of the other ""great"" CGI these days, I actually had the time to absorb and marvel at how awesome they are. And for a movie that's built entirely of spectacle, the actors are surprisingly capable and sometimes believable. It may not be what the critics call a great movie, but for sheer escapism, the movie gives the audience what they pay for and will no doubt rake a lot of money in the box office. By the time the credits roll, my date and I had a good time and that's all that matters. And that's my 10 stars there. Take it or leave it, I loved this movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.",2012
118,SanteeFats,Okay at best,5,6 January 2014,"I guess this is based on the Mayan calender thing. You know, the one that didn't happen. The CGI is pretty good. I wonder how many narrow, almost but not quite gotcha escapes can one believe might happen? I have a big problem with the plot of this film. They sell tickets to the rich to finance the arks, the huge vessels (?) intended to save a remnant of humanity by riding out the enormous tsunamis that will occur. The world is ending, who cares about money, print all you need, who will bring you to task? If you are serious about saving humanity you want the best, brightest, young, fertile people you can find plus some experienced crew and scientists, not the old and rich or powerful. Then there is the scene with helicopters carrying elephants, plus the on board one showing several live animals. Why? Use frozen ova and sperm. You can store a lot more species as well as higher numbers of each type thereby allowing more humans on board. John Cusack does okay in the lead role and saves everyone on board his ark at the last second. Again to many close calls to be believable. After things settle down the surviving humans end up going to Africa to start over, where we began. Entertaining yes but not close to reality.",2012
119,adamscastlevania2,Cheesy bland popcorn flick,4,10 October 2014,"(33%) Largely a misfire from Emmerich that's so overstuffed that it crumbles under its own weight leaving only a bland popcorn movie in its place. The parts between all the action are mostly tedious and dull, with its half- hearted account of typical American life offering nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times before. The the world then goes to cock leading to some amusement park style effects ride as the family drive/fly through entire cities falling down around them in a manner that wouldn't convince a 5 year old. Then the focus is on giant arks created for the wealthy classes of the world to some how live on after these terrible events, but in reality no wealthy person will hand over any money for these super arks to be built because it's such a stupid , overly elaborate idea in the first place. Overall the movie is too silly to be taken seriously, and too long and dull to be fun.",2012
120,fwomp,Oh Look! More CGI!,2,17 April 2010,"Having very little to do with the Mayan calendar and its supposed threat of global doom in 2012 and more interested in being a CGI spectacle, this movie will most likely desensitize you to any impending crisis and make you wonder why you bothered watching it. Oh look, a CGI disaster. And another. And another. And ...oh look!...it's another one! Going to see a Roland Emmerich (director) film can be dicey at the best of times, and downright ugly if you're unfortunate. Arguably his greatest film was STARGATE which was spun off into a highly successful TV series on the SciFi Channel. But some fans are divided on others such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA and THE PATRIOT. Then we get into the ""bad"" category with MOON 44, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and 10,000 BC (I think a little vomit came up the back of my throat for that last one).If you've seen any world doom films in the past 15 years, you'll not see anything that'll surprise you here. Things like DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon are pretty much a dime a dozen nowadays. And so goes 2012 ...but with a really poor script and some serious miscasting.Although John Cusack was an early childhood favorite of mine, starring in such low-brow comedies as BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER, he's grown into much more substantial roles in subsequent years, shining in HIGH FIDELITY, WAR, INC., and the astounding IDENTITY. But here John appears to have gone after the money. Reading the script, one can't help but wonder why anyone would choose to be in it. It really has no viable characters and relies solely on its massive special effects budget. But the actors did come. And not just Mr. Cusack.Chiwetel Ejiofor (can anyone pronounce his name?) tries to give some additional star power but can't grab any traction, either. Too bad. He's become quite a versatile actor, going from the feminine KINKY BOOTS to the rugged SERENITY.Thandie Newton (CRASH) gives the film even more eye-candy as the attractive daughter to the President. But here she is more caricature than character, giving some of the worst lines in the entire film.Oliver Platt (FROST/NIXON) tries to play ""the bad politician"" and his lines, like Thandie Newton's, are so ridiculously contrived as to be laughable.The only saving grace – acting-wise – was the role of Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist, played by Woody Harrelson (ZOMBIELAND). He so over-played the character that it made him fun to watch and not a chore.So if you're looking for a good disaster movie, this ain't it. It has nothing for you to grab onto, except maybe pieces of the planet's crust ...and we see that more often than the actors themselves.",2012

122,juliankennedy23,Lenny Bruce is not afraid,8,21 March 2010,"2012: 8 out of 10: I love disaster movies. I love “good” disaster movies such as The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. I love “bad” disaster movies such as The Swarm and Independence Day. I even enjoy, if not love, “Horrible” disaster movies such as Syfy channel stalwarts Megafault and Magma: Volcanic Disaster.2012 is solidly in the “good” disaster movie genre. As I have stated before in my The Core review “Disaster movies always seem to do better when the disaster is local in scope. A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road.” 2012 dodges this bullet slightly by having neutrinos from a massive solar flare penetrate the Earth and cause the temperature of the core to increase rapidly. “Like a microwave” one scientist very helpfully explains. Of course why these same neutrinos don’t cause the oceans to boil is a plot hole that the movie delightfully ignores. Still compared to The Core or The Day after Tomorrow, 2012’s science is practically textbook.Now since the core is expanding this causes the earth’s crust to erupt in different directions (think a Jiffy Pop container). This allows disaster footage from all over the earth. And we all know where disasters strike first. That’s right monuments. Vegas, Washington DC, Vatican City, Los Angeles, Yellowstone, Hawaii, and others get their turn in the special effects blender. The set pieces are generally well thought out often with sly commentary attached. (A giant rolling donut in LA, A slick atheist “Where is your God now” rub at the Vatican.). The special effects are all magnificent.I will briefly talk about the actors in a minute (Generally speaking they all do fine) but the star is the effects. The detail work (as can be seen in the disaster porn pictures below) is simply amazing. Director Roland Emmerich puts his 250 million dollar budget on the screen. For once the buildings that collapse have people in them. The disasters do not happen in the rain or at night and the camera doesn’t jerk around as if directed by an epileptic sugar glider.Both the location work and the disasters are very creative. (Let’s face it a tsunami driving an aircraft carrier into the White House is imagination at work.) In addition, the story is a fairly grounded version of that old When Worlds Collide plot where all the smart, rich and good looking people get on a spaceship and escape Earth while all the less attractive people all die horribly.The movie halfheartedly tries to address the unfairness of “who gets chosen” but we really didn’t come for a civics lesson and honestly there are worse ways to go than just picking attractive rich people. We also didn’t come for the acting, but unlike many of its contemporaries, the acting in 2012 seems solid across the board.Some of the various side plots do fall a little flat (for example taking into consideration 2012's two and a half hour length, the old guys on the boat subplot should have been jettisoned in its entirety.) On the plus side Zlatko Buric as the Russian billionaire ex-boxer and Woody Harrelson as the crazy mountain man (doing his best Matthew McConaughey impression mind you) are the stand outs among an above average cast.Overall we came for the disaster porn and simply put 2012 delivers some of the best disaster porn ever seen on screen, and manages this feat with fewer of the bad acting and horrible storyline distractions that usually accompany such films. Bravo.",2012
123,rzajac,A perfect movie that shows what's screwed up about Hollywood,4,23 September 2014,"2012 is almost a textbook case of what's wrong with Hollywood.Why?Because it very, very neatly showcases a particular perversion of the Hollywood system: What you have in 2012 is a story with a lovely, grand overarching theme--which I'll explain below. But the important idea here in my review is that you could very likely miss this theme because it's been slathered over with a thick, nearly opaque faux-buttery coating of pop-thematics and staid disaster movie over-production.If the producers could have found it in their hearts to give the treatment over to a winning director whose sensibility (and aesthetic wiles) they could trust, some balance could have been struck and 2012 could have been a fine film.So, what *is* that excellent-but-buried theme? I tell people that when you pry off the crap, you have a story about ""ways of knowing"". And, in keeping with grand storytelling tradition, these ways of knowing are discrete, can be counted, and are THREE in number.

The only person who made any sense reviewing this film was Andrew Donaldson from China who said it was a diverting ""roller coaster ride"" type movie, nothing more and certainly not the ""worst movie ever"". I thought he was right to criticize that ""worst movie ever"" club. For one thing saying something is the worst EVER is hyperbole and superfluous. I mean EVER. I just saw 'Voyage To The Planet Of Prehistoric Women' the other night and that was a lot worse.People are never satisfied that's true, but the Hollywood mega budget turns audiences into scary demons that just want more and more and are never satisfied and are ridiculously over critical. This movie must have cost well over 100 million and some people still thought it wasn't enough. What are you looking for exactly? Personally I try to stay away from any movie that is over-hyped, cost too much money to make and is the movie that EVERYONE must see in droves. Those are all bad omens. If everyone goes to see something mindlessly in droves it's because they are the products of Hollywood Executives marketing. Executives ruin the artistic side of everything.OR DIDN'T YOU KNOW? Never bet all your money on just one horse. DIVERSIFY MORE. Just because everyone wants to see it doesn't mean it's good. Mass taste can make some very bad, soul destroying decisions.As for 2012 as a movie? The disaster flick has come a long way since the seventies and people should appreciate that. 2012 was much more imaginative than the disaster fare of yesteryear. This film probably had more in common with fifties SciFi like 'When Worlds Collide' than it did with actual disaster flicks. Even the remake of the 'Posiedon Adventure' was superior to the original.I don't even like big budget films so I don't know why I should be defending them, but if people don't either learn to diversify their taste amongst lower budget fare or at least enjoy the Hollywood behemoths they(yes they)the audience create, they damn themselves, the rest of us, and future generations to one big messy headache of cultural confusion.I also enjoy reading the reviews of people online more than I do reading professional critics, but unless everyone can follow Andrew Donaldson's example and be more thoughtful instead of sooo rash, I'll have to go back to reading the newspaper critics again.

Some of the parts are in this movie are pretty silly but its still fun.This movie is about a man who starts hearing about how the world is going to end. At first he does not believe it but starts to see signs and then as the beginning of the end of the world starts to happen he struggles to keep him and his family safe.This movie has a really low rating on this website but it is actually pretty entertaining. It is a little bit long though however running about two and a half hours,2012

131,kuarinofu,Surprisingly boring and stupid,5,9 January 2020,"I never thought I'd say this for a big-budget disaster film, but here I am:2012 is a long, boring and stupid movie. The creators have probably mistaken ""stupidity"" for ""melodrama"" since most of the supposedly melodramatic scenes are just stupid people doing stupid things and screaming.They dumped so much money on effects and there's still no feeling of real danger or immersion just because how stupid and comical it is. The characters are pure stereotypes, the science of the film is beyond me, even the decisions taken by humanity's best are childish (build arcs?, you know we have BIG ships, right?).I mean, could they at least try to write an adequate script instead of doing the same thing again?It's like Roland Emmerich really needs to see The Host (2006) to finally understand how to wrap a family drama in a disaster film.And the funny thing is that they are doing it again. They already have 150 mil budget for Moonfall movie. Here we go again.",2012
132,jdkraus,Roland's last disaster movie...a good one.,7,29 November 2009,"In my opinion, director Roland Emmerich has not had a good streak of movies lately, such as ""10,000 B.C."" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"". But on a day I had nothing better to do, I decided to go see his ""2012"" on the big screen just for the kicks and to my surprise, I enjoyed this movie, and not just for the visual effects. The screenwriters didn't just write page after page, ""big explosions"" and ""humans running for their lives"". There's some breathing room for likable characters and a somewhat interesting story. Yes, the story is unrealistic, but it is somehow believable, like it was in ""Independence Day"". And the fact that I cared for the characters, even feeling sad when many of them died, makes it a good film. But the one thing that this film made me wonder is, if the world was coming to an end, would our government tell us? Unlike in ""Independence Day"", where the nation's government is depicted as the leading protagonist in the fight for survival, they are depicted as deceitful liars who only care for their own skin. The protagonists in this film are a combination of ordinary people: a middle-class family, a wealthy Russian and his mistress, two Jazz performers, an Indian Scientist and others. I found this rather interesting, the underdogs are where our sympathy lies. Overall, ""2012"" isn't a bad movie. I wouldn't be antagonized by the 2.5+ hour length, for the film flies by. There are great action sequences, thrills, an interesting plot (though I think some more back story to the whole Mayan prophecy would've helped a bit), and the majority of the cast did a decent job. Each actor made themselves a character, and above all, they each express the fear of trying to survive and its uselessness against complete world destruction. My rating: *** out of ****Roland Emmerich says this his last disaster movie. If it is, it's a good ending.",2012

It took more effort to make this movie a total piece of sh*t than had they made the movie good.

Some of the films set pieces were so improbable as to be laughable.Compared to higher quality disaster movies like Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow this comes across as laughably amateur. The ending like most films of its type is predictable and dull.On the upside the scenes of destruction are well done and entertaining.Overall I expected a lot more but there is enough entertainment (just) to merit further viewings.",2012
138,virek213,"Doomsday, Roland Emmerich Style",7,16 November 2009,"The same director responsible for previous mega budget extravaganzas as 10,000 B.C., INDEPRENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, and the often-maligned DAY AFTER TOMORROW is at it again. This time, Roland Emmerich destroys the world with a specific date in ""2012."" The whole premise of the film is based around the ancient Mayan calendar, which predicts the date of December 21, 2012 as signaling a profound change in our globe. Of course, this gives rise to all manner of speculation and debate among scientists and theologians alike. But in this film's case, it involves a severe solar storm somehow affecting our planet's geological plates to the ultimate extreme, and the arks that are being built to house as much of what will be left of humanity as possible. Among those caught up in the calamity, and those the audience can feel some empathy for while the world is being swallowed up whole, are a failed sci-fi author (John Cusack) and his family, and the geophysicist (Chiwetei Ejiofor) who saw this Apocalypse coming in 2009. In the meantime, during the 156-minute running time of ""2012"", save for a typically Hollywood nut job role for Woody Harrelson (as a Manson-inspired conspiracy theorist), we are witness to every disaster possible in reality, and possible only because of the special effects.As his filmography shows, Emmerich is more in the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of super destruction than the more refined nuances of a Spielberg or a Kubrick, so nobody should go in with any grand illusions that ""2012"" is another ""2001."" It certainly doesn't have the poignancy of the earlier 2009 doomsday drama KNOWING. Still, the performances by Cusack, Amanda Peet (as his wife), Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover (as the last U.S. president), Thandie Newton, and, in a minor cameo, George Segal are at least enough to cover the frequent lapses in its credibility.In every sense of the word, ""2012"" is as insane a film as has been made in Hollywood in a very long while, and that's saying a lot. It's certainly not a masterpiece in the traditional sense. But in terms of extreme spectacle and CGI genius...well, it might as well be.",2012
139,timdalton007,The End Isn't Near...It's Here!,8,14 November 2009,"Though I admit to being a fan of Roland Emmerich's previous films I was skeptical about 2012. Not because of Emmerich but because of the subject matter: the supposedly prophesied by the Mayan's end of the world on December 21st, 2012. While I don't believe that the world is going to end, I did see the film. While it isn't a great movie by any means it is still a fast-paced, well-acted film with some jaw dropping special effects.Continuing an Emmerich tradition the film has an all-star cast that do well even with a script with issues. Leading it is John Cusack as struggling science fiction writer John Cusack who, while initially an odd choice to be playing the lead in an action film, proves to be up to the challenge and gives a fine performance. Joining Cusack as his ex-wife Kate is Amanda Peet who gives an admirable performance instead of a potentially one dimensional performance. Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor as the scientist who sounds the alarm on impending doom and becomes a voice of reason amongst the chaos. There's admirable performances from Oliver Platt as the White House chief of staff Carl Anheuser, Danny Glover as the President caught up in the greatest crisis ever to face humanity and Thandie Newton as his daughter plus a wonderfully over-the-top performance from Woody Harrelson as the conspiracy-theorist radio talk show host Charlie Frost. Then there's fine supporting characters including Professor West (John Billingsley) and Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric) amongst others. All that said 2012 features what quite possibly be the worst impersonation of Arnold Schwarzenegger ever committed to film though thankfully he appears very briefly and just long enough to be noticeable. Besides that this is a well-acted film.Now onto the other big thing about 2012: the special effects. Those who have seen Emmerich's work (Stargate, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow etc.) know his films are showcases of special effects and CGI. 2012 is no exception with some absolutely incredible CGI and special effects sequences that are, quite literally, jaw dropping and worthy of being seen on the big screen. They range from earthquakes to volcanic eruptions to tsunamis in as many different forms and settings as you can imagine. Many of them are quite unexpected and help to give the Emmerich cliché of landmark destruction some variety. Meaning that once again Emmerich has outdone himself with his biggest and best disaster effects to date.Outside of the effects the film also boosts some fine production values as well. This is especially true of the sets from Production Designer Barry Chusid who once again creates an incredible White House set (another Emmerich cliché it seems) and the fabulous interior sets of the Arks. The film is rather fast paced, not not terribly so, in the hands of editors David Brenner and Peter S. Elliot. Then, to add tension to the film, is the score from composers Harald Kloser (who previously did The Day After Tomorrow) and Thomas Wander whose score, while not a classic by any means, is as fine a score as any of those accompanying Emmerich's previous films. All together they help boost the film's cast and effects.Not to say the film is perfect of course. While it may be well acted and full of incredible special effects it is fair to say the script is rather lacking. It isn't just the use of the supposed end of the world in 2012 as a launching off point either. The film has quite a few pieces of clunky dialogue (especially in the President's lines) which thankfully the actors manage to do their best to make it sound sincere and natural though not always successfully. There's also the matter of the plot as well of course which requires quite a few leaps over some sizable plot holes to make work and without which there wouldn't be a script. To put it bluntly if, like me, you thought an alien invasion being foiled by a computer virus in Independence Day was a bit too much to swallow then don't try to connect the dots in this film. That said the film does have some nice dialogue (especially in scenes with Helmsley and Anheuser on the ethics of whether or not to issue warnings) plus some elements that hearken back to the disaster films of the past, especially George Pal's When Worlds Collide. While not a great script it is still a good one even with some of its issues.So where does 2012 stand then? Well it has a script with some issues (some clunky dialogue and plot holes) for one thing. On the other hand the cast make good use of the script to the point of some improvement, incredible special effects sequences and with plenty of fine production values to boot. It also hearkens back to some of the better disaster of the films of the past (especially the aforementioned When Worlds Collide) and actually makes good use of the 2012 end of the world idea. 2012 isn't a great film but as a tense disaster film with a fine cast and great effects it works rather well.",2012
140,gigan-92,When Will Roland Emmerich Learn??,4,19 April 2010,"When will Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin learn?? I guess when they finally run out of disaster ideas. They already ruined Godzilla, capitalized on global warming and had aliens take a shot at world domination. It's only natural that he'd hurry up make this film before a director with actual talent got a chance too. After watching those barely acceptable films, along with ""10, 000 B.C."" in all its maligned light, I honestly didn't have high expectations for this film. And what a coincidence, the duo presented audiences with a predictable and overly done action sequences.I can't lie say there aren't some captivating and mouth-dropping shots, but the humor seems to never let up. Even as the world crumbles to pieces and society is at the end of its rope. A perfectly good time to tell a joke or to, don't you think?? The same old formula of a divorced family getting back together after the step father is conveniently killed during the chaos is put to use, yawn.

Everything gets destroyed, parks, religious monuments, political monuments, cities, ships, airplanes, luxury cars, underground factories,...2. It has a large cast.

I accompanied my friends to this film since I had nothing else to do and at least thought that this would be an entertaining, brainless fun movie but it turned out to be utterly stupid and silly, even though I do remember locking my brains in the car when I left for the movie.The movie is very tiring , almost 158 minutes long, stretching into nothingness, because of which you don't care whether people are are dying or crying. I and my friends were cracking hilarious and vulgar jokes during the second half once we the movie had dehydrated us with its stupidity.Apart from the length, the movie fails at many levels. The script is flat, filled with dumb jokes filled at odd places. For example, when the main cast enters the Russian plane to escape from the catastrophe behind them, the boy suddenly gazes in wonder at the cars and exclaims ""Wow!"" and the Russian man who owns the plane says haughtily ""Its Russian"". For god sake, half the world is dying behind you and you are in utmost peril and you wait to tell about cars. This is one of the many 'jokes' in the movie.The actors too play complete stereotypes. For example, a failed, divorced author whose wife still has feelings for him but has another man in her life and the son who loathes the father but shows his affection during complicated times and the worst, an eccentric who somehow knows about what the government is planning ( How he knows about it isn't told) and keeps warning people in a crazy manner the world is going to end.Acting too is not great with John being too dull (lifeless eyes), the wife being forgettable and the rest of the cast aren't even extraordinary. But I didn't care much about the acting, since I know its a disaster movie.

See what I mean. You didn't get to see that. You only get to see one side of the family. Let's not forget all the other characters in 2012 - they were uninteresting. It's a disaster movie, but there are far better disaster movies out there than 2012 such as 'Deep Impact', 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'Titanic', so that's good to know. There are others, but these are some of the more popular ones available. Another one I can think of is 'Independence Day'. Just like how it was predicted, 2012 happens to be a time where things will come to an end. The world is getting destroyed by a series of natural disasters. It's a time where 'nobody' on the planet is safe wherever you are. You can run or hide all you like. Nothing will change. It's all the same for everybody. Can the people survive? You need to see it to find out. 2012 is the end of the world for all we know. The most interesting thing is how many people will die in 2012. You have to watch the movie to find that out.

Some reviewers criticize Emmerich's films as if he were Ingmar Bergman, complaining about the lack of realism or about poor acting or thematic weakness. Why bother? These things are made as escapist fantasies, and Emmerich delivers. I suspect that most of us who really like an occasional escapist disaster, be it the old San Francisco film where everything falls down just after Jeannette MacDonald sings the title song, to The Towering Inferno, where everything burns up,again in San Francisco, are expecting thrills aplenty, and in this department, 2012 really delivers, with the earth's crust crumbling and spewing lava and tidal waves engulfing both the West Coast and Tibetan monasteries; John Cusack, with his air of earnest befuddlement is The Perfect Dad whose family is endangered, and there are lots of delightful cameos from such folks as Danny Glover as The President, and Woody Harrelson as a hippie broadcaster.

149,Antagonisten,No more,3,25 January 2010,"Disaster movies is very far from my favorite genre. Ever since i first watched the disaster movies from the 70's as a kid i have had trouble with them. And watching ""2012"" i can't say that the genre has come a long way since the 70's either. Sure the movie looks better, but beyond that? So, what are the positives here? Well, the movie does have some pretty good special effects. Of course they are over-done and over-used, but that's the way you have to play it with a movie like this one. Also you have some pretty good actors doing their best with the material. I also found the movie quite entertaining until all hell broke loose...The negatives are, however, easier to point out. Honestly, Roland Emmerich is one of the most uninteresting directors of our time. He seldom makes anything interesting, usually it's just sentimental and clichéd, effect-driven movies. Not my cup of tea to say the least, and to top it off this movie is like regular Emmerich on steroids... The whole world is literally destroyed in this movie, entire cities ground to dust. And in-between the scenes of destruction are moral preachings and sentimental scenes that are quite hard to stomach. The movie follows a well trodden path and a strict formula, and how exciting is that? Not very.In the end i think this movie shows two things. Firstly that disaster movies are still unbearably boring to watch. Secondly that special effects can be used to do anything today, which ultimately make the effects less special. I remember watching Jurassic Park when it came out. I was completely mesmerized with the special effects, they actually made the dinosaurs come alive! But today, special effects are nothing to be excited about. They are everywhere and a heavy use of CGI is expected in every big-budget movie. And unless there is something behind all the effects; a great story or at least some substance, the effects amount to nothing. They days when i watched movies just because of the special effects are over.So hopefully this is the last cry of the shallow, special-effects laden Hollywood-movie. Now they have destroyed the entire world with millions of pixels and huge detail, so we have seen basically everything. Now they have to wow us with something else. And even as i write this i know it's not what's going to happen. Crap like this will be released next year too.But i won't watch it.",2012

151,phenomynouss,Sick stuff,3,3 November 2010,"This is no award-winning movie, with strengths in acting or story or the like. It's essentially the latest ""stuff blowing up"" movie by Roland Emmerich, who makes these movies regularly, for money.However, something about this movie makes it stand out particularly dreadfully from most others of the same genre. The introductory sequence of LA breaking apart is full of shots of people in cars as their cars are destroyed, people being killed as stuff knocks them around, and shots of huge skyscrapers crumbling and tumbling, and quick shots of people inside the wreckage, clinging to things helplessly.It's almost impossible for me to watch. It's too traumatizing, too sickening, and cannot be properly tempered by the fact that it's all just CGI fiction. The fact is, the shots of people bear a far too striking resemblance to the scenes from September 11th 2001, where we saw people jumping out of the towers to their inevitable deaths.But enough of that. On the brighter side, as I've noticed with ""10,000 BC"", Roland Emmerich is very good with broader story lines, and very bad with smaller story lines involving individual people. The concept of the Arks and everything after the initial ""stuff blowing up"" parts are decent enough, but the individual characters are one-dimensional archetypes you've seen in pretty much all his movies and others.Oliver Platt's character is the stereotypical ""bad guy"" because he's the voice of reason, taken to the extreme of cold logic and rationality at the expense of human lives---the Superego. He justifies the fact that the majority of those being saved in the Arks are the very rich, because without their money supporting it, the project would never have gotten started. There's Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, the opposite of him, the Id, who mopes constantly and contradicts the ""bad guy"" with emotion and humanity. There's the bumbling fat foreign guy and his trophy wife, whom he betrays and leaves for dead, only to be betrayed in turn by her later on. There's the dorky science guy, played in the exact same vein as Dr. Phlox from Star Trek Enterprise (obviously it's the same actor) by John Billingsley Amazingly (for a movie like this) there are inklings of contradictions in some characters---tendencies for them to act outside of their archetypes, but these are few and far between. Speaking of which, plenty of dialogue is stupid and cliché'd, like ""who would have thought the crazies with the cardboard signs would be right?"" and the scenes not involving the Arks or the ""stuff blowing up"" is largely boring and filler.Amazingly again, just a few superficial changes, particularly involving characterization, would have made this movie uniquely different from others of the same genre, and probably worth 3 or 4 stars out of 5.

156,t_atzmueller,The CGI-animations have more soul than the actors – and the animations aren't very good.,3,26 January 2013,"Let's not waste too many words on the hackneyed script, the plot-holes, inconsistencies or cheap CGI-effects that make this film near unpalatable; too many ranting reviews have gone down that path already. Rather, let's talk about the psychology of director Roland Emmerich: The more Emmerich products one watches, the more one gets the impression that Emmerich is somewhat of a misanthrope. How else could we explain that the director casting actors that are complete cardboard cut-outs of ""real"" people? Cusack, Peet, pretty much the entire crew with the exception of Danny Glover (who seems unable to play characters that are not amiable or sympathetic) seem like robots that mimic human behaviour. Or perhaps it's true that Californians are so shallow, that they have difficulties interacting like the rest of humanity, merely going through the motions.Each and every character is a crudely drawn stereotype, be it the ever-humble Indian scientist, the Dalai Lama-like Buddhist monk, the African-American president brimming with benevolence (and again, Glover plays the part way more convincing than the president who plays the part currently), the boxer-cum-super-billionaire Russian and his spoiled brood, the crazed, borderline psychotic blogger (then-again, Woody Harrelson has been reduced to that role for a long time), etc, etc, etc. Even Cusacks ""kids"" don't seem like real children but rather child-actors who've been bred for the sole purpose of following the directors instructions: ""Right, now open the eyes wide and gaze at the camera in shock. Wider! Act more like an adult; and then, play a little girl!"" The rest of the story consists 99 percent of Cusack escaping the end of the world (in other words: the grumbling floor) via cars, planes and, in the end, arcs. All this isn't even very exciting because we already know that this is a cut-out summer blockbuster where the hero and his family will escape, no matter what odds, save the day and, as certain as tomorrows sunrise, that there'll be a cheesy happy-end.The glee with which Emmerich ""destroys"" various US landmarks (and specifically California) leaves only one conclusion: the director would much rather be home in his scenic, idyllic Stuttgart (which is a city in Germany, in case you're reading this in the US). But, hell, money is money and money doesn't stink; and which other Film-Industry apart from the soulless Hollywood factory would give a director like Emmerich a budget to produce his template flicks? Is there a plan for ""Independence Day 2"" or ""2013"" already? Because if there isn't, have no doubts: there will be eventually.3/10 points.",2012

159,PyroSikTh,Swap Brain for Eyes,8,21 May 2010,"No seriously. Leave your brain at the door. No, further...further...further. Okay scrap that, don't even bring it with you. Leave it at home. Cool. Now you'll enjoy this movie.Roland Emmerich (let's remind ourselves that he made Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow here, just so we know what to expect) has stuck to what he knows, but blown it up (sometimes literally) to a bigger and more ambitious scale. The characters are paper-thin, the plot is unoriginal and linear, acting is average at best (even from Chiwetel Ejiofor, unfortunately), background is pretty much nil...Oh, did I say those were bad things? No, you've left your brain at home, remember?2012 is a disaster movie, and probably the most epic of it's type topping only other Emmerich disaster movies. There is CGI. Lots of it. In fact, half the film is made up of CGI. Bad thing? No, most certainly not! (I always wonder why CGI in films is frowned upon...) The effects are breathtaking and truly epic. I mean, who wouldn't want to see the White House get mown down by an aircraft carrier propelled by a 2,000ft tidal wave?! Why does this all happen, you may ask. The answer is simple; it's not important. Of course, there's some vague explanation to some of the events that makes some sort of sense, but really, it's not important. Remember, you left your brain at home. Apart from some paper-thin, but necessary background to ease you into the action, this film is pretty much non-stop eye-candy. Watching Yellowstone National Park erupt was a particular highlight. Also, keep in mind this is Hollywood. This is not real, so why should everything be realistic? Sure, it's a bit suspect that they happen to land in place X after suffering issues with problem Y only for group Z to come by a few seconds later, but again, this doesn't matter if you don't have a brain. So howcome he can fly a massive freighter plane? Doesn't matter, he just can. Also beware of time-wasting in an urgent crisis just to be sentimental and fairly obvious morals and messages, but they're endearing and make for a bit of happiness and joy in an otherwise bleak situation.To those who have seen the movie (no spoilers follow), would you really have enjoyed it more if it was more realistic? I'd presume not. A realistic apocalypse would be a horrible thing to watch on a massive screen for 2 and a half hours. The main characters would die in the first few minutes and it would be impossibly depressing, hopeless and serious. Which brings me nicely onto my next point. This film is not serious, in no way, shape, or form. It's supposed to be a bit of light-hearted fun! And you know what? It succeeds. No it really does!Me and my fiancée like our serious, deep, intelligent films, but we also like our mindless fun and eye-candy. We can leave our brains at home before watching a bit of entertainment. And you know what? We stuck this into our DVD player and we had fun. We were thoroughly entertained. You know what else? We regretted not paying to see it at the cinema when it first came out.Rating with a brain - 3 or 4/10, Rating without brain - 8/10Just have fun, yeah?",2012
160,CinematicInceptions,"Decent, but has plenty of holes",6,9 August 2014,"I would give this a 7.8 out of ten, but decided to round down. The characters are pretty good. Adrian Helmsly is easily the best. Charlie is enjoyable and the roles of Sasha, Jackson, and Adrian's friend there who I can't remember the name of. Then again, Jackson's kid Noah isn't that appealing to me and I feel like Anhueser's villainy is kind of forced. Beginning with the good, I was fairly moved by the scenes showing the deaths of the masses and felt like the whole issue is pretty interesting. The storyline was okay I guess, but sometimes I felt like things such as Jackson's strained relationship with his family detracted. The whole thing is a pretty good example of how human greed corrupts the world and how money is far too powerful a force in determining peoples' fate. Lastly, I think anyone in the mood for some weird humor should YouTube Charlie's apocalypse video because it's pretty entertaining. On the bad side, it's pretty predictable throughout. Gordon making three implausible takeoffs gets old, and you pretty much know that the Curtis family will all get back together by the end from early on. You can definitely see the same personality in this as in Independece Day, which is one of my personal least favorites apart from the performances of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Another annoying aspect of the film is how Jackson and whoever happens to be in the same vehicle as him manage to survive everything. I estimated that he and his family should have died about thirty-five times all total. So in a way, I'm kind of surprised at how much I actually like this movie, because I can't really find a whole lot to like about it. For anyone considering watching it, it's good if you want something emotional or something that is easy to laugh at when there is no intent of humor.",2012

Want exploding volcanoes? Check. Want earthquakes? Man, you are really sick! Tick. Instead of looking at every kind of disaster movie ever made, do yourself a favour and just watch this one. You'll save yourself a lot of time and money.Save your breath if you want to argue that the scenario presented in this movie is somewhat implausible. I'm sure it would be more plausible to have some of the events depicted in this take place over several decades or centuries. You gotta think things through better...you'd then need the central family (do you really want a name for them?) to have an extended lifetime due to medical or scientific advances and...who could be bothered? Just enjoy this for what it is...a great popcorn movie.Just by the by, I've heard how the more 'charismatic' Christian cults in America often had leaders who declared the end of the world. Get that prediction wrong once, then shame on you. Get it wrong twice, and as Dubya might say ""More shame on you"". Eventually these 'charismatic' leaders just gave up showing up for 'work' with egg on their face, so they just stopped making these predictions.Perhaps by the law of averages, ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEONE is going to get a prediction like this right. This movie is what it will look like when they do...if adherence to strict scientific theory isn't a major sticking point for you.An entertaining movie with terrific special effects, which doesn't get bogged down in the 'boring' stuff...like lots of backstory...when what you want is The End Of The World.Enjoy.P.S. the end credits make mention of this movie being inspired by the book ""The hand of God"".

It had to have been fun to do as many are wonderfully detailed and thought through. And that's where most of this movie's good times are. It's in the wildly lurid and imaginative scenes of mass destruction. All the leads and the supporting actors do quite well in selling the scenes and their reactions.

Excuse me, no one has televisions anymore and you want to address the country? Idiotic.It's too bad that John Cusack accepted this.

I could go on and on. Further, the ""Gremlins""-like touches of humor made 2012 go down much easier than the afore-mentioned films, which mildly insult by pretending to be plausible science fiction. I get annoyed reading the showy displays of ""brilliance"" by reviewers who point out that the events are ludicrous, melodramatic, over-the-top, etc. OF COURSE THEY ARE. So was King Kong in 1933. Such critics remind me of sullen adolescents who've just learned the moon isn't really made of green cheese.

True, it's not something to be taken seriously but at least they could've gave some background info on the proceedings leading up to the ""event"". I for one like end of the world movies with well-written stories and plausible scenarios. If you come into this film and expect to see plausibility on a global scale, you will be sorely disappointed. The special effects are pretty good, I'll give it that but take my word for this: There are many MANY times were you'll see characters make some illogical decisions and actions that completely make no sense whatsoever. It's also really sad to see some very fine actors like Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, and John Cusack being wasted in a vapid, lifeless screenplay written by an equally talentless and execrable team of screenwriters and producers.It's really amazing that the film eschews the most intriguing part of the film in favor of loud noise; the nature of the Mayan calendar which has so much more historical power and mystery than this entire debacle put together. Deep Impact, released several years ago, had much more scientific fact and intrigue and was far more plausible and dire in emotional impact. This film has emotional impact on the scale of a crying 3 year old boy to the tenth power. Bloated and cooked to imperfection is what I like to call this film. Do yourself a favor and watch the Discovery and History channel instead. You'll find much more scientific and historical fact than this steaming pile of turd. This is a piece of propaganda, forged from the flatulent fires of Roland Emmerich which despite it's title, serves nothing more than a sequel to his previous disaster film.Well, at least I saw it for free.",2012

Nah, just kidding, we all know that that won't happen, but if there is one good thing that has come from this whole 2012 doomsday phenomenon, it would be the 2009 Roland Emmerich film 2012.Let me just get this out of the way, I absolutely love this movie. Roland Emmerich is the kind of director that you either love or hate, all his movies are high-budget, special effect driven disaster films, and 2012 is no different. I went to see this movie opening day, expecting a film of action and special effects, and thats exactly what I got. I can't say its Emmerich's best movie, it's not as good a ID4, but it's definitely his 2nd best. Let's just get this out of the way, if you want a movie driven by a good story and good characters, then you may want to find something else. This movie is all about the special effects, and they are amazing. The destruction of LA had my heart racing at three times it's usual speed. Seeing this movie in theaters was the best theater experience I have ever had, sure I've seen better movies in theaters, and I've had crazier audiences, but this film just screams theater viewing. If you first saw this film on a small screen, I pity you. Don't get me wrong I still love the film, own it on blu ray, and still find it entertaining, but nothing compares to the first theater viewing.Now sure this movie is dumb, really, really dumb, but that's one of the things I like about it, I hated science class, so forget science, just make me laugh. Maybe I'm in a minority, bu I actually liked these characters, interesting story, the third time I watched this movie, I actually cried near the end, I don't know how that works.Sure the movie is a little too long, and in the last 20-30 minutes it begins to outstay it's welcome.

172,AishFan,Great edge-of-the-seat experience!,10,22 November 2009,"A die-hard fan of natural disaster movies, I had been waiting for this one for months. You can't help but admit that all the publicity from the History and Discovery channels, astrology sites, and scientific journals added to the hype. Whether or not the events in the film are possible is a whole another debate, but as far as the watching experience goes, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat! Even an ever-so-slight, infinitely small chance of this being true in just three years is a chance big enough to make the audience anxious to see what happens in the next frame. The special effects make your eyes pop out. My favorite show of these effects occurs in one of the first scenes in California (the one in the trailers) where destruction of a city is shown. Falling skyscrapers, collapsing freeways, cars falling through the earth's crust--each pixel of the large, panoramic screen screams of havoc and destruction as the end of civilization approaches.Another aspect of this film I particularly liked is that it gives importance to the rest of the world outside of the U.S. Unlike previous movies with similar themes such as Independence Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact, etc., all disasters--natural or extraterrestrial--seem to have their eye focused on the U.S. 2012 doesn't abandon this practice completely with everything starting in California, but it definitely shows a shift in global awareness, which signals a positive trend for the future. This can also be seen with the movie's massive worldwide release on the same weekend.Of course, the unifying theme of disaster movies--perhaps the main reason I like them so much (along with adrenaline rush-inducing special effects!)--is it forces all people--rich or poor, black or white, young or old--to come together in an effort to survive.",2012

When I saw the trailer, I was astounded for the first time since perhaps ""The Phantom Menace"". I remember the huge crowds on opening day of ""Independence Day"". The lengthy trailer for 2012 showed extended sequences that rivaled anything seen, even in ""TDAT"". But the question in my mind was, what else did the movie have to offer that wasn't already seen in the jaw dropping trailer? The answer is - zilch. I was appalled that they literally put all the money shots in the trailer, and had very little left to make us fork over the 9 bucks. Out of a 2 1/2+ hour movie, you get about 10 minutes of FX shots. No kidding. The rest is filler that is worse than the worst daytime soap opera. There are overlong and boring dialogue scenes of divorced parents and their kids trying to get along. Been there and done that way too many times. Yes, the end of the world is pretty boring. In 2012 sit in airplanes for hours upon end, or spend extended periods of time staring at computer screens with your cliché simulations and other mumbo jumbo. In ""TDAT"", you had Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum get all cute and cuddly, there is no such chemistry between Cusack and ex-wife, or between the President's daughter and the chief scientist.This movie could have taken a different perspective on such obvious material, but seemed obligated to give the standard speeches as we grapple with losing our loved ones. That's what also makes this movie no fun, there is an understandable but generally overly depressing chain of events, as no one gets through the big event without some downers. The movie this most reminded me of was the extra boring TV cut of ""Earthquake"". It has a similar arc, spending endless time setting up characters that are quickly forgettable. Then only to have the big moment come and go in just a bat of an eye. I am actually stunned that nobody pressured Emmerich to trim the film down to a more reasonable length. It would give the theaters more showings and the audiences some more of their lives back.",2012
175,dvc5159,"With 2012, Roland Emmerich is the new ""Master of Disaster""",6,13 November 2009,"Volcanoes. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. These are natural disasters which have movies of their own. In 2012 Roland Emmerich throws all three of them in, and then some. It is a roller-coaster of a movie from start to finish, and an immensely entertaining romp.The story is the usual ""group of survivors trying to survive"" type with the usual disaster movie clichés and pseudoscience (as if the 70's never happened), but what makes it special is the more human touch to it, thus making us care for the characters. Sure, there are some cringe- worthy and ""are-you-kidding-me?"" moments (more of the latter), but both of them are overwhelmed by the disastrous spectacles on the screen. The film may drag at parts but that's just a breath-catcher before an even bigger disaster occurs. Oh, and in each disaster people of all kinds are perished; men, women, children, elderly, religious and political leaders, EVERYONE. Very few people are spared.The movie has a strong ensemble cast who look like they're having a blast. Cusack and Harrelson are the best actors in the movie. Ejifor and Glover are care-able characters, especially the former. Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet are OK but I felt that their characters are given little to do other than to whine and act as a love foil. And Oliver Platt gives a very sleazy performance, that's what he does best.On a technical level, the film is near-flawless. The special effects are stunning and eye-popping (although overblown), and in my opinion topple every summer movie this year; ""Star Trek"", ""Transformers"" (admit it), ""G.I. Joe"", ""Terminator"", and ""Harry Potter"". I feel that it deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects and Sound Effects, even if it doesn't win. The action sequences are nicely handled. Emmerich knows that some parts of the action are over-the-top, so he handles it in a subtle tongue-in-cheek manner, making it even enjoyable. The intensity of certain scenes are there, and you can't help but feel sorry for the billions of people who perish. My favorite disaster scenes are the sinking of California and the Yellowstone eruption. In fact I think that Emmerich purposely filmed some disaster scenes as homages to the disaster films made or inspired by the previous ""Master of Disaster"" Irwin Allen; there's ""Earthquake"", ""When Time Ran Out"" and briefly even ""Poseidon"".Also, the music score by co-writer Harald Kloser and scoring partner Thomas Wander is perfect for the movie as it captures the true spirit and awe of the movie.In short, I think that this movie is trying to be the mother of all disaster films; while not exactly succeeding that, it does manages to deliver some of the most awesome destruction scenes ever on film. It manages to be a near-excellent disaster film, not just one of the best ever. You don't really need to understand the Mayan prophecy rumor to fully understand it, nor will you become a believer of it after watching it. What I can guarantee is, that you'll have a blast watching this Hollywood blockbuster. This is not to be missed on the big screen as the disaster sequences are worth the price of five movie tickets alone.Roland Emmerich, you are now crowned the new ""Master of Disaster"". If this is really your final disaster movie, congratulations, you have outdone yourself. He can be proud of this film. Bravo.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 6.5/10P.S. I think that Emmerich purposely camped up the tone of the film. Had it not became campy and instead became dark and brooding, the 2012 believers (and believe me there are a LOT of believers out there, some so die-hard that they are willing to kill themselves before the coming ""apocalypse"") out there will give us some more headaches to think about. So relax, check your brain (and pulse) at the door, and enjoy this blockbuster.",2012
176,gary-444,Retro Disaster Kitsch,4,11 April 2010,"With Director Roland Emerich you know what you are going to get. Explosions, tidal waves, crashing buildings and catastrophe are his lingua franca. He delivers. Yet as many have pointed out, this is a deeply frustrating film. The storyline is fine, and ambitious, and there is a budget to match. The actors are solid, and the ample two and a half hour running time is more than enough to get the story told, so why the carping? In short, the story is not told well enough.The trailers allude to Mayan prophesy of the destruction of the world in 2012, yet in the film it only just gets a mention. There is no sense of ancient foretold doom. When the world starts to ""turn hot"" the global meetings are little more than an excuse to provide location shots to sell the film in different countries, and a sub plot involving the state execution of whistle-blowers poised to reveal all to an unsuspecting public appears, then disappears, to little purpose.John Cussack is a convincing hero, Danny Glover is hopelessly miscast as the American President in a horribly written role and Thandie Newton is wasted as an incidental love interest for co- hero, Chiwetel Ejiofor. Woody Harleston has a bizarre cameo as a hippy dj who knows what is going on and has the secret map that reveals all, and appears to be the sort of person to keep the kids well away from.The action scenes themselves are tremendous, but there appears to be little holding it all together. Clunkily episodic, each scene seems riddled with cliché and seems to demand it's own disaster sequence. The characters get insufficient time to win us over and the human interest ephemera like the hero's daughter 's bed wetting are grindingly forced. Worst of all the biggest Disaster Movie Cliché of all – that the dog always survives, is alive and well.The climax of the film is grotesquely drawn out as man-made arks are launched to save civilisation. Incredibly this causes Emerich to then go into ""Poseidon Adventure"" mode, in an exercise of wholly unnecessary self indulgence. Inside all of this there is a decent film waiting to get out. The discipline, a word which Emerich does not know the meaning of, of delivering a 90 to 105 minute picture would have produced a much more satisfying, and impactful result.The end result is closest to 1950's style world disaster / Alien movies, but without the charm.",2012

This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.I watched it on DVD, I should have watched it in a big theater with a big screen. The special effects were purely amazing! One problem with this movie is its lack of Chinese people. After all, the ships were supposed to be built in China.

I say it because that city is almost mandatory in US (and other) disaster movies. Some more serious things: movie had a message, and I'm little surprised that no one wrote about it here. Of course, message is little shallow, but I really don't see it as bad, as whole movie is such. So, without spoiling it up, just some clues: there were some references about World (Earth, Humankind) today. About greed, rich people (countries) disregarding poor ones. Certainly that China is not chosen just randomly as place for 'ships'. Of course, there was a lot of more-less stupid, overdone scenes. Plane escape was interesting first time in Independence Day, but here almost same was repeated twice.

182,Greatornot,A Disaster of EPIC Proportions,3,18 July 2010,"This movie was too long for starters. There seemed to be way too much emphasis on showing one disaster after another, and showcasing special effects that quite frankly were not that special. The special effects resembled Cecil B DeMilles '10 Commandments', which was done over a half century ago. How sad. The acting was fine but I do not believe that John Cusack was comfortable in his role and for that matter , neither was Danny Glover as the president. They seemed kind of stiff, for lack of a better word. Amanda Peet was better than expected as John Cusacks ex-wife. Oliver Platt as the adviser to the president was OK. The best actor in this film had to be Woody Harrelson. He was terrific as an offbeat DJ ,broadcasting doom from his RV in the midst of Yellowstone. The film revolved around planet alignment causing natural disasters, wreaking havoc on the planet on Dec 21, 2012. The gist of the film was elitism vs. the common man, as far as seeking shelter from the inevitable. I saw this long film in 2 parts ondemand Starz. Took in an hr and half and than later in the day an hr., to finish the film. It gets tedious viewing this in one fell swoop. Just giving fair warning.",2012

The special effects are everywhere as suddenly the world is exploding and these guys stay one step ahead.Put your reality hat in the closet for this one guys, which is pretty much what you should have expected going in. At the end of the day, if you want a movie with no real plot, stupid banter, sub-par acting, and good CGI, well, you have come to the right place.

For almost 20 years movie is just like my favourite toy and for ""2012"" i give it a 4 out of 10, why? Let's spot through the weaknesses. First, it is the same director doing the same theme, three times if i am not mistaken, three. Secondly, the story is rather dull, no emotional touch and the actors and actresses couldn't cry, what they can do is just showing a 'fake' sadness on screen. Thirdly, the effects are ordinary, i mean, why don't you show a city underwater? or corpses? or maybe an afterlife?

It had a huge budget, the visuals were meant to be and are AMAZING, crazy good, as I would like to say eye-watering, BUT, at some moments, they were used to much, almost every 3 minutes which led to the movie losing depth, losing rhythm, losing logic. The casting choice was also mistaken pretty bad, especially with the leading role John Cusack, who, altho is one of the finest actors, brought to much comedy, without taking any matter seriously, which is not logical at any means, since the ground below him is dissapearing while he is making jokes about it.",2012

188,badajoz-1,"Over the top CGI - and that's all, folks!",4,20 November 2009,"The end of the world - and you get it, ten times over. In fact it gets a bit repetitive two thirds of the way through. Yes, mostly the CGI is very good - never very convincing, but then people put up with some wooden dummies in that helicopter shot of the 'Titanic' so we can't really complain! Having seen the trailer for 'Avatar' just before the film here, I was pleasantly surprised how good the CGI was compared to the Snow White/blue genie cartoon that Cameron wishes to dish up before Xmas. Unfortunately the in between dialogue pieces are pretty dire except for the odd gag - The Quenn and Prince Philip with the corgies getting on one of the arks! But let's face it, Jennifer Aniston and Seth Rogen comedies have some of the worst scripts imaginable, and they keep coming out, so why be so vehement about '2012?' The acting is unmemorable, and the San Andreas Fault seems to have the biggest acting role during the halfway stage of this overlong movie. Cut it down and it could work much better! However, Emmerich really does hide a lot of sly satire at Americans and the USA in his films that are a hoot on reflection. In 'Day After Tomorrow' the US had to beg for help from Mexico, while at the end of this Americans are going to have live in Africa! Hoot! Hoot! There should have been more of this but no, why bother, when you can demolish LA and Las Vegas, as well as the White House with a giant US aircraft carrier!

189,stormhawk2021,We were warned,6,13 August 2017,"At this point in history we are not going to discover Roland Emmerich and we are not going to get our hands on the head because of his way of conceiving what they call the seventh art ... but, on the other hand, it is fair to recognize that Emmerich does not deceive absolutely To anyone, that their creations are alarmingly spectacular, and that their products radiate honesty and sincerity as few.With respect to '2012', we can say that this film can be evaluated from two different perspectives: letting ourselves be carried away by the monumental circus of fireworks that is offered to us, or by valuing the film objectively as a mere cinematographic product. In this second case would come very badly, as expected ... then, let's see that offers us as a visual show capable of leaving the mouth open to the viewer.With respect to the above, the goal is more than fulfilled, because if other ""fantastic"" films have achieved a level of spectacularity and special effects almost insurmountable, there is no doubt that Emmerich exceeds that quota here, and In addition with much difference. Without going further than reality, the film is a constant roller coaster of incessant spectacle, without limits or concessions. The action scenes and hecatomb are captured on screen with a realism and veracity that, honestly, is not remembered if we look back. The truth is that '2012' is nothing more than a fun ""blockbuster"" of escape that does not bore a bit, since we do not give us a second of respite. Each scene is bigger and more surprising than the previous one, and this added to the terrible and deafening rumble that accompanies each and every one of the most striking sequences of the story, turn the tape into a true pyrotechnic ""show"" that keeps the viewer with the Eyes like dishes An attraction that does not leave anyone indifferent. '2012' is the 'mother' of all catastrophic genre films,In short: This festival of Roland Emmerich fulfills what it promises: earthquakes devouring whole continents, volcanoes erupting in unison, meteorites destroying everything there and for having, and tsunamis as incredibly shocking as unlikely. So do not look for anything more than an effective entertainment product, because you will not find it. But who wants to see the greatest destruction on a world scale ever told in a movie, this is the perfect product for it. Of course everything depends on the level of tolerance of each viewer.Pros: Their incredible and dazzling scenes of destruction and the amazing special effects!Cons: We are not going to complain about the absurdity of his script, the histrionics of some of its sequences, or the simplicity of its development ... but of its certain excess of duration.",2012
190,tburke85,2012 A Decent Disaster Movie With Some Flaws,7,5 March 2010,"2012 is a decent disaster movie with flaws which I'll get into later from director Roland Emmerich whose been known for making films of this genre like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day to name a few. Emmerich is admirable in making this movie giving audiences state of the art special effects with good performances from the cast for the most part. John Cusuak is solid as the lead Jackson Curtis a struggling writer and limo driver who tries to save his estranged family from the global cataclysm that brings about the end of the world. It has to do something with the earths core heating up because of solar flares from the sun causing massive volcanic eruptions unlike anything you've ever seen, destructive earthquakes that level cities, and giant tsunamis that destroy everything in it's path. The rest of the supporting cast are decent in their roles including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, and Oliver Platt. Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson make the best of their small roles in the film. Glover is convincing as the President whose faced with many difficult choices. I felt Harrelson went a little over the top with his character at times but he still turns in an humorous performance though. The serious mood of the film worked considering it's about the end of the world and there's some humor that could've been better but thats all right. There were many yeah right moments when Cusuak and his family were barely escaping one disaster after another within minutes of each other but I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the movie. As I mentioned before the special effects are pretty amazing even if you can tell it's obviously CG. The movie is nearly two and half hours which made it a little long, the dialog wasn't the best occasionally, and there were some predictable moments, but overall 2012 isn't that bad. For the first half hour or so Emmerich introduces us to the main characters developing some of them with strange things happening which foreshadows that the worst has yet to come. The last two hours I'd say is pretty much non stop action with Earth getting relentlessly hammered by earthquakes that take out cities in minutes, volcanic eruptions that shoot clouds of smoke and ash into the sky with massive fire clouds miles high, and gigantic tsunamis which engulf everything in it's path. The global cataclysms caused by the solar flares end up killing billions of people around the world with only a fraction surviving which does make the movie sad at times because you know none of them stood a chance against mother natures destructive power. If this does indeed happen one day I hope I'm not around for it because none of us would probably survive catastrophes like the ones shown in 2012. If Emmerich had trimmed the running time a bit, cut out some of the humor that didn't really seem to work with the serious mood, then I might have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall though 2012 was a decent disaster film but I wouldn't call it a classic. This film however is sure to please almost any fan of the genre. The movie has amazing special effects, plenty of action, drama, and good performances by the cast (Cusuak and Ejiofor) who make 2012 worth watching at least once if you can get past the overlong running time first.",2012
191,revival05,Wonderfully preposterous,6,30 March 2010,"I always find it amusing when people get angry with movies like 2012, saying they are an ""insult to human intelligence"" and so on. I guess 2012 really would be an insult to human intelligence if it had anything to do with human intelligence. It has not. To say that Roland Emmerich is the kind of director more interested in going for the direct visual impact is quite an understatement. Kind of like saying Michael Moore is a bit of a political film maker.2012 is a good Emmerich movie, a good disaster movie and a good piece of junk food cinema. There's nothing - I mean NOTHING - here for anyone interested in character development, realism or any other kind of adequate storytelling devices. I think this is pretty much the reason it works fairly well. It all boils down to keeping it simple. The more ridiculous and huge your disaster is, the less you can risk messing around with it. The world ends, lets keep it at that. The problem with some of Emmerich's previous movies were that they fell on their own weight - The Day After Tomorrow was preposterous, yet tried to carry some kind of environmental message, and Godzilla was moronic but would probably have been more acceptable with a more charismatic monster (not named Godzilla!).In 2012, nothing is in the way for the simplistic entertainment value. The simple beauty of it can be found, for instance, in a scene featuring Danny Glover as the US Preisdent actually presenting the news to the rest of the world's leaders, by simply saying ""The world, as we know it, will soon come to an end."" WHOAH! That's quite something. It's a wonder nobody gets the impression he has lost his mind.No, it's not realistic. Yes, it's silly beyond belief. But it doesn't insult your intelligence, because I believe the movie trusts it's audience to be clever enough not to take it all that seriously. It's not like Transformers 2, which was a fantasy movie that actually was in need of some kind of consistency but just decided it wasn't important, and Emmerich is Bergman in comparison to Michael Bay anyway. In 2012 we actually get at least 30 minutes of tension building and we actually get Actors as our cardboard characters. Nothing in the movie is plausible, but it does make (it's own) sense. It's odd to me that anyone would look at the premise of 2012 - mind you, this is a story of The Mayan Apocalypse! - and not see that it's impossible to make this movie without humor and self-irony. Good character development has nothing to do with a movie like this. In fact, I dare say it would just bog it down. In a movie where the world ends at a specific date in 2012, an actor like John Cusack is certainly more than enough.So we have a movie that works despite it's lack of any real conventional quality, since it's a campy roller coaster and that's really it. Does that mean it's a GOOD movie? Not really. Call me a snob, but under the circumstances these movies operate under I can't see how they would ever be properly good. On a star rating, I'm giving 2012 six out of ten. Giving it more would indeed be an insult to human intelligence.",2012
192,doorsscorpywag,Utterly appalling,1,16 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich movies are generally stupid but fun but with 2012 he has redefined 'idiotic' with his latest effects driven drivel about the end of the world. Quite what the Mayans have to do with anything is lost after about 5 minutes as the selling point in the trailer turns out to be a red herring but the film as a whole is a half dead slightly damp haddock. Considering that the film has gotten some half decent actors in it the level of acting on display would not even trouble an episode of the old Brit soap 'Crossroads' as pointless one liners and impossible dialogue is trawled out in a by the numbers journey from A to B with lots of explosions and buildings and even cities falling over. The idea John Cusack could have taken his family from California to China in the way presented is so utterly preposterous that even by Hollywood standards it beggars belief. Barely a frame is believable except for the premise that is central to the film. As ordinary people die by the millions live on video feed we see that worthless politicians have been selling places on the last ship out of town to the even more worthless rich, 'important', and the royal as the rats forget the rest of us and save their pointless asses as their people, who don't seem quite that important now, die in droves under earthquake and tsunami. For me as a Brit the sight of an 80 year old woman saving two corgis as she deserts the British people is far more horrifying than seeing LA fall into the sea. Instead of ensuring the human survival by filling the places with as many people under 30 as can be gotten on board we have fat Russian billionaires and old rich guys in large staterooms who bought their places with status they no longer have once the first quake hits. Now that bit is totally believable. As long as the rich, a stupid but very fortuitous family and a dog are saved we are supposed to feel fine at the end. Personally I was hoping that all the 'rats' got washed away by a tsunami and ended up dying horribly and we carried on as a race due to a few lucky souls on high ground. Hollywood surely has reached it's nadir with this rubbish as after this huge waste of money it is inconceivable that anything worse will hit the screens anytime soon.",2012
193,jonathanruano,2012: -- Review,7,16 November 2009,"Rolland Emmerich's 2012 is not a perfect film. The uplifting music inserted at the end is stupid. Moreover, you won't find any sympathetic characters, except perhaps the chicken whose head pokes up when she realizes that she might escape beheading. But you know what? 2012 is a lot of fun to watch.Here's why. First, the special effects which cost $250 million are great. Everything is destroyed, including Michaelangelo's ceiling at the Sistine Chapel. Second, the premise works because of course we want to know if Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his family are going to survive the end of the world. But that's not the only reason why I like 2012. Unlike most disaster films, the director, the producers and the writers did something clever: they did not rely on special effects alone. They recruited good actors and gave them fun characters to play. Take Woody Harrelson's cameo as the conspiracy nut who (as it turns out) was absolutely right about almost everything from the suspicious deaths to the date when the world ends. Oliver Platt is also wonderful as the amoral Carl Arnheuser. When deciding who to save from the apocalypse, Carl reflects that his wife never wanted to see him again. Well it does not take a genius to figure out what happened to her. And I can keep going on.Finally, even the scenes that don't work are funny. For instance, Jackson Curtis is introduced to us a loser who does not hesitate to take his children to the now dangerous Yellowstone Park, even though he is warned against this by a newly erected gate and a restricted sign. ""Don't you read the signs,"" his son says. And yet, Jackson is apparently a brilliant driver. How else can you explain how he is able to navigate through falling buildings, a collapsing freeway and god knows what else without crashing the car once? This guy can give James Bond pointers. And what about Gordon (Thomas McCarthy) who, in spite of having only two days flying experience, can navigate a plane -- which has Jackson Curtis and his family -- through skycrapers falling at both ends and a whole host of other catastrophes, again without a single scratch. Either this guy had a great flying instructor or he possessed a natural gift for flying ever since he was a fetus in his mother's womb. Lastly, I could not help overlook the fact that President Thomas Wilson (which was obviously modelled on Obama) was surprisingly old. Maybe, the economic crisis, the heathcare debate, the Afghanistan war, the Iraq war, Gitmo, pirates and now the end of the world placed such a strain on this guy that he ended up aging prematurely in a big way. Even his daughter was not immune because in three years she went from being 10 to 25.Now I don't want to spoil the rest. Suffice to say, if you want a fun night out with your friends after drinking a few beers, go see ""2012."" You won't be disappointed.",2012
194,basrutten,Bit more script would be nice,5,11 December 2009,"I am gonna admit it..I actually saw Transformers 2 AND this movie in one week. I probably never saw so much CGI in one week. And if these two movies prove one thing it's that pretty much anything can be done, and can be done believably, with CGI and enough money.These movies also prove that no matter how much money you spend on CGI, the movie is still not gonna amount to much if the money to pay for the CGI comes out of the script budget. While the effects are spectacular, once again the script is anything but.I do have to give the writers some credits though, since unlike the abysmal Transformers, at least this movie has some amusing characters (mostly Woody Harrelson) and some OK jokes.Sadly, everything else comes directly from the Big Book of Disaster Movie clichés. Relations get repaired, annoying characters get killed off in amusing ways, cute animals are spared since killing them would be too much for the audience, whereas millions of people die horribly for the sake of entertainment. And of course there are plenty of emotional scenes with bombastic music in the background that are so overdone, so badly written and so pointless that they become unintentionally funny.Yes, it's all very spectacular, it truly is. Never before have I seen destruction on this scale. It's a shame that the movie tries so hard to be spectacular that all plausibility is thrown out of the window. The amount of close calls, near escapes and utterly silly situations is so high that it becomes very hard to suspend disbelief. I can buy tidal waves that flood the entire world..I don't buy a group of misfits taking off in an airplane just in time no less than three times.""2012"" does have its moments, but it has a script that is so plagued with clichés, fake sentiments and overall goofiness that it becomes a bit of a chore to sit through, especially given the very long running time and the endless repetitions.",2012
195,galahad58-1,Combo of Movies,6,14 November 2009,"2012 is a great special effects film. If you enjoy good earthquake, volcano, tidal wave, and explosion scenes than this is the movie for you. If you are looking for story this is not the movie for you because it is a combination of every single cliché ever done in every single disaster movie in the past: the estranged family as the lead, the government officials that do dastardly things, the last second rescues, the last second or humanity will die rescue, and the star doing a ""suicide"" rescue at the end. The movie could have been better had the writers not included the government as the evil being (like always). The part that the governments all over the world sold seats to the super rich and hid everything from everyone got a bit over-dramatic and useless for this film. The part where the governments killed anyone who would leak information about what was happening was not needed and it had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Suspend reality also---to believe that John Cusack drove to an airport---went to Yellow Stone---flew to China---walked to the exact spot the government projects were in China---all in the ""small"" time frame before the world changed is very laughable. For the effects I would recommend the movie---and for that reason it is enjoyable. For the story---just ignore it and watch some nice effects.",2012

His intentions are honest however, despite this little clichéd characters.He also provides little context for the struggle going on with his characters. The explanations he has for all the explosions and destruction is a solar mishap any scientist could easily overlook. He has no reason for all of his destruction and we slowly grow numb in the minds as this plays out.It is the special effects that most people come for, but if you look at cinema as just being all special effects and no storytelling than that is a very limited experience.

197,gregeichelberger,A disaster film of epic proportions,1,15 February 2010,"It's the end of the world as we know it - and I feel bored.By now, just about everyone this side of Outer Mongolia has heard of the Mayan calendar and how it predicts the end of days on Dec. 21, 2012. But just in case you haven't, there's now a multi-billion dollar film to show us exactly how it's going to happen.From the director of ""Independence Day"" and ""Day After Tomorrow,"" (two other horrid motion pictures) comes ""2012,"" easily one of the worst written and acted movies of the Apocalypse. In fact, this makes ""Fools Gold"" and ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" look lucid and intelligent by comparison.Basically, it's nothing but a clone of every big-budget disaster film - ""Day After,"" ""War of the Worlds"" (new version), ""The Knowing,"" ""Twister,"" ""Poseiden,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Deep Impact,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" ""Earthquake,"" ""Evan Almighty,"" ""Speed"" and others all rolled into one with the decibel level cranked up to the power of 10.With the suddenly talentless John Cusack (what happened to such roles as ""High Fidelity"" and ""Eight Men Out""?) at the helm, this one goes into the crapper fast - just like the world as we know it. Cusack plays a failed author who now works as a chauffeur for a fat Russian slob with two obnoxious sons. His estranged wife, Amanda Peet, is dating a fairly decent plastic surgeon and his kids want nothing to do with him. On a camping trip to Yellowstone Park, he and the moppets run into a crazy guy broadcasting doom and gloom from his Winnebago (Woody Harrelson looking more like Nick Nolte's drunk driving photo than his lovable ""Cheers"" character).He also runs into a bubbling underground lake and is promptly escorted off the premises by the U.S. military. Needless to say, because the earth's core is heating to unsurvivable levels, the crust is becoming unstable and the world as we know it will collapse in a matter of days.Never mind that plate tectonics and continental shift are processes that would take thousands - if not millions - of years. In this movie, we get it right away, just like a fast food meal.Here's where the big-budget CGI effort goes into full effect. We see first California, then the rest of the nation systematically destroyed by various earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes as Cusack and his goofy family and friends escape time after time. Even Danny Glover as the President cannot save the day, although his Chief of Staff, played by Oliver Platt (whom we last saw getting oil rubbed on his paunchy stomach by Michael Cera in ""Year One""), does his best to save his own skin.Cusack and Co. then make it to China and discover the existence of several large ships designed to save what's left of Mankind and - oh why am I even bothering to explain ANYTHING about this loud, ridiculous mess that contains the worst dialogue imaginable, a laughable conclusion and plot-holes one could steer a small planet through?That, plus the fact this mishmash is almost THREE hours long. I saw it in 2009 and it FELT like it was 2012 before I got out of the theater.

John Cusack still gives an excellent performance as a family man trying to rescue his estranged loved ones (excluding the dork who has taken up with his wife) from a coming world cataclysmic event. The problem with these FX is that they go over the top: same as Twister, or the conclusion of Armageddon, where debris and rocks are swirling over the heads of our heroes, or smashing into their equipment but they escape--equipment intact--without a scratch. We can only suspend our belief so much. Here, in the early going, Cusack drives a car through a decaying city, miraculously evading destruction while buses, trucks, and buildings are crushed like paper dolls. (Give me a break).The other problem is that these 'modern' directors/screenplay writers have forgotten the basic tenets of cinematography: 1) a scene must develop character or advance the plot, or you discard it (invented by Disney) 2) preferably, do both at once. In 2012, the action stops with resounding CLUNK while we stop to discuss Cusack's marital problems or his relationship with his kids. HEY DIRECTOR: WE ALREADY KNOW THE WIFE GAVE UP ON HIM TOO QUICKLY, HER NEW BOYFRIEND'S A DORK, AND THAT CUSACK LOVES HIS FAMILY - HE IS RISKING HIS LIFE TO SAVE THEM ALL. so, shaddup and get on with the story, will ya? I wouldn't pay to see this film. If you can catch it on TV, and fast-forward the commercials, give it a try - once should be plenty.",2012

As spoofs go, this is top-notch, with almost continuous fast-action jeopardy and cardboard characters in every part. Cars crash & burn in every corner of the screen and aircraft plummet to their doom. John Cusack could never act his way out of a paper bag, but he's ideal as the frantic father trying to save his family from the relentless special effects, and here he shows his entire range of abilities from A to B, with dialogue never equalled in the proud annals of movie history. Seriously though, if you want your TV speakers to explode and your brain fried with non-stop action, don't miss this film. You'll have something to laugh about for years.

201,robert-710-767167,Wow,7,5 September 2010,"First off, I read many of the comments and I am amazed by how much you guys hate this movie.First of all, I am actually quite hard to please. Toy Story 3 made it only because it completed the trilogy.This movie was very interesting. There was a lot of action, a lot of suspense, a lot of tragedy, a lot of sorrow and a lot of emotion. A lot of films usually only have two to four of these. This film came with that and more.But I am not satisfied to the point where I will say it's a 10/10. Why? **Spoiler warning** The profanity. When the man says 'get in the f** car' when the town was being destroyed. It made sense that they would swear, but it's still something I don't like. Especially that middle finger flick.Also, during the one grocery store scene, the man who starts to get sexual with the women was disturbing. 'let's made babies'. Great. What I wanted to hear. Then he actually mentions what he does with girl's... things and how he 'uses' her's for free.**Spoiler warning** But all in all, the movie was great. I actually cried during one scene.So because of the sexual references and the swearing, it gets a less vote.",2012
202,mrcibubur,Entertaining blockbuster with great special effects,7,13 December 2009,"yes, its the film everybody wants to see and will see but its bound to disappoint if you are expecting a realistic interpretation of the mayan forecast for the end of the world in 2012. ready made for john cusack to play the family hero again, definitely overacted and very poor script indeed but the story does move along (literally) and we see parts of the North or South Pole in Wisconsin. the film did entertain and I am not disappointed because I saw what i expected - a combo of titanic, poseidon adventure, war of the worlds and day after tomorrow. Forget the rest of the world, just worry about America, nowhere else matters. the Noahs Ark thing was one of the best parts of the movie but I don't think it was explained enough as part of the story. Not in the same league as titanic or poseidon adventure but you will leave the cinema for sure with an adrenalin rush!",2012
203,Avwillfan89,Typical Hollywood cliché,5,8 January 2010,"The plot is that the Mayans predicted that in 2012, the world would end. So the protagonist and his family, like in almost every other disaster movie, survives, unlike thousands of others, by driving through an earthquake, a seemingly and visually impossible thing to do, has an amateur pilot able to fly them all out in a small plane with a huge explosion right behind them and the dad (played by John Cusack) who is late for the ride, manages to get in the plane just in time. Surely by now, all of them should have been dead, but they're kept alive just so they can find out that Savior ships (trying to imitate Noah's Arc) have been built to keep the globe alive.Of course all the while there's this sentimental stuff between separated relationships getting back together as the world ends and all that, that you can find in pretty much any movie. But in this case, it just makes the film more pathetic. Indeed, the special effects are powerful, like being on a roller-coaster, but as far as writing goes, it falls straight in the category of déjà vu Hollywood.If you've never seen this kind of movie before, the world destroyed by some kind of apocalypse and the heroes running for their lives, go and see it, but I bet you any money you've seen it somewhere before.",2012
204,j-lacerra,Wild and Crazy Ride!,8,12 August 2010,"Despite all the negative reviews here, or maybe because of them, I really enjoyed this movie. If I had not known what to expect I might not have enjoyed it so. But, going in, I was prepared for a suspend-your-disbelief special effects extravaganza. And that is what I got.When watching the Poseidon Adventure, did you really care about the individual stories and acting performances? Of course not! It was the action that kept you watching. Such is the case here. And all the coincidence that allowed the main characters to prevail over cataclysmic odds - well that's part of the deal.The special effects are excellent, and have really grown up since this director's terrible special effects in Independence Day, with its exploding matchstick White House. I only really spotted one glaring mistake: a dreadful mismatch of scale between the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the White House. The ship is not six times the length of the building!Cusack was good, Peet was pretty, the kids were, well, kids. The scientist was honorable, as we know they all are (in the movies). This movie borrowed from many other disaster flicks, not least from the Poseidon Adventure and When Worlds Collide. It's just a lot of fun!",2012
205,GirishGowda,What happened to the Mayan prophecy? Only one place survives in the whole world?!!,2,3 April 2010,"An epic adventure about a global cataclysm that brings an end to the world and tells of the heroic struggle of the survivors.This is what the plot is supposed to be, a heroic struggle & epic adventure. But, that was all only on the paper & not on screen. What you do get for your money is over the top special effects, with lots of good looking people having family crises & personal battles & they come together to save the world!! If you think Twilight Saga films dialogues are cheesy, this gives the word cheesy a whole new meaning on an altogether different bad level. You don't feel for any of the characters even when they are about to die. Every 5 minutes, there is a 'close call' that our heroes have to survive. How I hate myself for getting sucked into this garbage. What is more disturbing is the amount of success this film had. With the amount of money this film had riding on it, it could have given us a wonderful insight into the Mayan world & the present world when the catastrophes begin. But, it doesn't deliver. Even John Cusack, whom I like is bland. Everything about the film is boring & the special effects don't save the movie.I was aware that I should not expect much when in all the trailers they only showed things being blown up or cracked open. But, what I saw I couldn't even believe it, the characters are there only as an after thought to the effects. Ronal Emmerich's latest film had an amazing PR mechanism in place which drove herds of people in & many were tricked into believing that what they were seeing was actually good. This film was racist & idiotic. I am really glad this is Emmerich's last film. He seems to have lost his touch.Neither John Cusack's candy floss image, nor Amanda Peet's oomph manage to salvage a film that was meant to survive solely on mind-blowing special effects. What the makers seem to have forgotten is the fact that we've better video games today that allow us to create our own endings with similar special effects. Don't even think about watching this garbage even if its for free. I hate myself for paying to see this.2/10 -Girish, 20",2012
206,RichardSRussell-1,Starring: The Planet Earth; Special Guest Appearance by: The State of Wisconsin,4,13 November 2009,"2012 (PG-13, 2:38) — SF, biggie, formulaIn the end, they all die.Ha, ha, just kidding. Of course they don't ALL die. Disaster movies are the most formulaic of all formula movies; the formula is that there are about a dozen foreground characters, and only half of them die — you get to guess WHICH half — one at a time, in various colorful ways, usually with the token black guy going 1st. Meanwhile, massive, awful carnage is being wreaked upon all the folx in the background, but you're never invited to care about them, so you don't.In this film, it's hard enuf to care about the ones in the foreground, since they get so little screen time (despite the movie's whopping 2:38 running length) that they're hard to relate to as individuals. John Cusack plays the main viewpoint character, Jackson Curtis, Amanda Peet is his ex-wife Kate, Tom McCarthy is her new hubby Gordon Silberman, and Liam James and Morgan Lily play kidlets Noah and Lilly. Right off the bat, you know the kids are gonna make it; no director ever kills off the kids, no matter what the provocation (such as that little snot in The Day the Earth Stood Still). That leaves the 3 adults and assorted scientists, government officials, plutocrats, and oddballs as potential sacrifices to The Formula.30-40 years ago, the master of this genre was Irwin Allen (The Poseidon Adeventure, 1972; The Towering Inferno, 1974; Flood!, 1976; Fire!, 1977; The Swarm, 1978; When Time Ran Out , 1980). Director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 1996; Godzilla, 1998; The Day after Tomorrow, 2004) obviously wants to carve out a name for himself as Allen's successor. (But let me recommend one of his non-disaster films, the sadly under-appreciated The 13th Floor, 1999.)Unlike Allen, tho, Emmerich wants to paint on a bigger canvas — much, much bigger; planet-wide bigger. Thus the special effects, tho technically better than what Allen had available to him, tend to dominate the personalities. Working your way thru a skyscraper or a cruise liner, you've got time to get to know the people next to you. But when everyone's madly scrambling and screaming, with doom nipping at their heels, there isn't much chance for casual conversation.And scrambling is what they have to do, occasionally pausing for arguments, hesitations, and hugs just long enuf for the current disaster to ALMOST catch up to them. Not to fear, tho, they manage to stay a half-step or split second ahead of each grisly fate. Usually.Look up the original meaning of the word ""incredible"" to get a sense for how convincing the many narrow escapes are. Yeah, sure, a guy with 4 pilot lessons under his belt is gonna be able to tilt his 2-engine commercial plane edgewise to slip between 2 toppling buildings (inexplicably headed toward each other and not, as physics would suggest, in the same direction) — suuuuurrre he is, and never get whacked by any of the many chunks of falling concrete, either. And that deal about running out of fuel while you're still over the Pacific? No biggie, we'll just slide this handy continent under you.We learn in the early going that the proximate cause of all the problems is that solar neutrinos have inexplicably been undergoing a phase shift on their way toward the Earth, and now they're interacting with the Earth's guts to a much greater extent than before. This utter desecration of anything we've ever known about particle physics heats up the crust and precipitates the various resultant natural disasters — notably city-devouring earthquakes and mountain-climbing tsunamis — that form the bulk of the film. At the end of the movie, nobody ever questions whether the phase shift is still occurring and will continue to wreak havoc. The clouds all vanish, the Sun comes out, and everybody's all laffey and smiley, evidently having already forgotten the 6 billion rotting corpses they're sailing over. The Earth's gotten a good scrubbing, and everything's OK now, kids.Really good FX and several guest appearances by the State of Wisconsin move this by-the- numbers piece up to the bottom of my ""up to you"" range.",2012
207,freaky_dave,Roland Emmerich destroys the world again,7,27 November 2009,"Using the basis of a Mayan prophecy that says the world will end in December of 2012, Roland Emmerich brings us another mega special effects extravaganza that is about as good as most of his other movies, excluding Godzilla of course. The special effects are grand, as always, and the characters have their own humor which makes them more interesting. THis movie actually comes close to and reminds me of Michael Bay's first Transformers movie because it uses the same kind of sense of humor to keep your interest, and gives you a lot of special effects to chew on.THe plot is simple. December 2012 comes and the entire world is suddenly being wiped out by major earthquakes, volcanoes, and very gigantic waves that manage to reach the highest peaks in the world. A radio deejay, played lovingly by Woody Harrelson who we last saw in the humorous Zombieland, of course stated that all of this would happen. Most didn't believe, and those that did died, so that the secret would never be let out of the bag and cause major panic. Yep, you got it, the government assassinated them all, especially the US Government. Old Roland doesn't seem to much care for our government, as he has made the US Government look bad in just about every single movie he's ever made.2012 is mad fun, and the effects out do all the ones that the director has done before. THe characters have their own tics and are made likable for the most part, except for a couple here and there, but most of those couple die by the end of the movie anyway. Nothing surprising there, but there are millions upon millions of innocents that die as well since the entire movie is based around the entire world being destroyed and all. Just like all of his other films, Emmerich's latest movie ends with a feeling of hope even after the end has come and gone.THe build up to the film was nice, and when the disaster's finally hit there is no let down. The movie impresses in its own way, but it's a shame that we couldn't get much of a real story out of it, The ending does seem to drag on a little too long, but hey, the director does with the movie what was expected, and for that, it's a success",2012
208,jhmoondance,Great disaster movie,9,2 September 2018,An incredibly fast paced energetic movie from start to finish.Excellent cgi n special effects that are actually quite believable.Acting is good n the characters are likeable.The arks are a bit far fetched but add to the movie.The ending is fairly predictable but still good nonetheless.I recommend this film especially if you are into disaster/end of the world flicks.I knocked a point off for the cheesiness value that the movie has unfortunately.,2012
209,springsunnywinter,Finally a real apocalypse movie,10,13 December 2009,"There have been many movies with end of the world story lines but there never was a movie made where we get to see the apocalypse happening properly but now we do with 2012. I was really disappointed with Ronald Emmerich's previous film 10,000BC but now he is back on track. The story is based on the Mayan calendar theory that the world will end in 21st December 2012.Before I seen the movie I was wondering that how are they going to have a proper storyline for a 2.5 hour movie on just an end of the world topic but the movie revolved around many people such as a failed writer with family, the president and a geologist which made a really good 2.5 hour film & I loved the suspense that was building up towards the apocalypse. The best scene was the destruction at California. There were some comical scenes such that were really funny like the Indian man at the start said ""that felt so good"" and the chicken that was about to get headed also they did not ruin the movie because 2012 is meant to be a serious film.Overall 2012 was a really interesting, entertaining, funny, emotional and a blockbuster movie. The only reason why anyone would hate it would be because it's that good.",2012
210,helmutty,2 and an half hour of pure destruction,7,14 November 2009,"2012 is a thrilling and emotional ride. Scenes of the cities/countries are amazing, the CGI looks so real that almost convince you that they are really being destroyed. I am sure the CGI is the one that stands out in the movie. People would watch it for the CGI. There is also a lot of emotion added into this movie, the acting including the children's is quite good.The story: First, it starts off a little slow but when it comes to second destruction, that is where pace becomes faster due to the thrilling escapes of destruction. When the destruction comes, a lot of people die and become selfish. John Cusack plays Jackson who is a writer (John also plays a writer in the thrilling horror movie 1408) trying to save his family. That is usual in a disaster movie. They then meet some other characters and try to plan their escape. Everything is destroyed and not one thing is spared. The music goes well especially with emotional scenes.Overall: Even if you don't like the plot, you would enjoy the fantastic and realistic destructions of countries/cities. Even if you find the story lame, you have to admit that the CGI is really well done. Though the CGI stands out in the movie, I find that some emotional scenes are good as well. Like disaster movies, you would probably enjoy this. Cannot stand unrealistic plot including big goofs, you may not enjoy this.",2012
211,BigGuy,It's a disaster movie alright,5,15 November 2009,"I used to love watching disaster movies. They were all about the struggle to survive and making hard decisions. Now, they all seem to be about preaching morality, while shoehorning in a love story.This movie in particular manages to have just about every disaster movie cliché in the book. They even hijacked a few clichés from other genres. Sprinkle in an unusually heavy dose of Deus Ex Machina and you have this movie.This is a partial list (some items are ""spoilers""):Noble scientist who brings the problem to the attention of the government and serves as the moral guide, CheckSleazy politician who makes the unpopular cold blooded decisions, checkDivorced everyman who tries to connect with his children, even though they seem to like their stepfather (who is more successful) more, check Noble scientist who dies, but not before revealing a key piece of information, check Noble scientist love interest, check Sleazy rich man who tried to buy his way out of disaster, check Black president (seems to happen quite often in disaster movie for some reason), check Preachy monologue about keeping our humanity followed by a bold move to save people at the risk of other people, check Conspiracy nut job who ends up being right, checkNutjob finding the best place to watch the end/disaster and dying, check Aircraft carrier being carried on giant wave and crushing something, checkCharacter doing something that's suicidal to save others, check Character surviving a suicidal act, check Saving a pet from disaster, check Airlifting giraffes, checkBeing chased by an explosion and/or cloud of smoke only to be overtaken and then suddenly burst through, check Crazy disaster mitigation plan that shouldn't work but does, check Critical piece of technology breaking and it can only be fixed by someone doing something suicidal, check One leg of a love triangle getting killed allowing that bit of plot tension to be resolved without emotional baggage, check Author who wrote a book that only sold a few hundred copies, but happens to meet someone who actually read the book, check A child making an observation/comment that reveals the moral lesson, check Character having a slightly unusual name that ends up foreshadowing future events, check Bad science, check plus plus plus plus plus plus Deus ex Machina, check plusAnyway, if you have a high tolerance for such things, then you will probably enjoy the movie. There is some good acting by most of the main characters, although Danny Glover was awful.

212,colinrgeorge,"""2012""",4,6 April 2010,"Roland Emmerich gets his rocks off blowing up the world. Hey, whatever sinks your battleship. It's like the Tarantino foot fetish thing, you just have to shake your head and go, 'the guy likes feet.' But if destruction is Emmerich's erotica, then ""2012"" is a perverse shrine; it's disaster porn, a sweaty menage a trois of ""Dante's Peak,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Independence Day."" ""2012"" distinguishes itself from those films only in its unabashed one-upmanship: bigger, louder, and more marginalized story.The marketing admittedly piqued my interest, I think because it seemed so simultaneously silly and audacious. Highway billboards and movie theater stand-ups depicted iconic human art and architecture being pathetically splintered, smashed, or washed away. I imagined the lunacy of the digital disaster film coupled with an absurdist futility. I wanted ""2012"" to be genre satire, an unrelenting gleeful cataclysm without redemption. In retrospect, it was not wise to expect these things from Emmerich.If anything, ""2012"" is torturously formulaic, layering state of the art special effects over the writer/director's decade-old story template. A renegade scientist discovers an inevitable global catastrophe, meets our always-noble president, and clashes with an evil cabinet member--it turns out 2012 is a whole lot like 1996. But perhaps most disappointingly, by any action movie standard, Emmerich breaks a cardinal rule: he never tops his first act. The five-plus minute sequence that arrives roughly forty minutes into the film involves John Cusack and company speeding through a crumbling Los Angeles cityscape by limousine and airplane while earthquakes topple skyscrapers and split the streets, swallowing countless fleeing innocents. It would have made a fantastically over-the-top finale, but Emmerich isn't content to simply shake things up when he could drown or pelt them with fiery balls of magma.The majority of the disposable plot actually revolves around the struggle to reserve space on one of several 'arks' being built in China to house the lucky few chosen to repopulate the dying planet. The general public is never informed of their existence, but attention rich and famous: tickets can be purchased for just a few million Euro! The third act of ""2012"" then takes to the open water and devolves into everything I didn't want it to be, namely a countdown-clock movie in which the resilience of human ingenuity and spirit ultimately triumph over avers--I'm sorry, I dozed off there for a second. Millions of people die in this film, so forgive me if John Cusack and his fickle ex-wife, son, and hat-loving daughter's survival aboard a ship loaded with billionaires and bureaucrats charting a course for the inexplicably unflooded African continent to, I'm sure, politely explain the concept of manifest destiny to any weary native survivors, fails to move me. Emmerich's ending is worse than cliché, it's insultingly euphemistic, backwards, and schmaltzy.Actually, the more I think about it, the more apt that porn metaphor becomes. It's not difficult to tell which scenes exist solely to progress the plot, and which scenes set the stage for ludicrous action set pieces. Seeing a hanger full of Russian concept cars is like opening a scene in a porno with two girls on a couch. Come on. The film's primary function, as with feature length pornography, also makes the running time completely unnecessary. You know why you're watching.As pure spectacle, ""2012"" occasionally succeeds, with some well-choreographed action sequences that straddle the fine line of utter ridiculousness and competently address their directive to entertain. The plot, however, is at best derivative and at worst short-sighted and masturbatory.Can't wait for the sequel, Roland Emmerich's ""Seamen.""",2012
213,huh_oh_i_c,"After seeing it theatrically, I'm sooo gonna own this!",8,14 November 2009,"I thought it was kind of daring for a US movie to open up with two non-white, non-American characters, although that has been done before. What I think is new, is that the opening character REMAINS as a lead character, throughout the movie.A note to all the whiners and 16 year olds who suddenly discovered that a movie should have a plot, a storyline, developing characters etc.:!!!!! IT'S A DISASTER MOVIE!!!!!! No-one is saying this film should be aiming for any dramatic achievement, even though the acting is good and the story line not that implausible.So, to judge it on its merits as disaster movie alone, yes this is a winner. Does it out-do its predecessors? Yes, that too.This movie really moves you, literally. I was twisting in my seat as was going through every motion the characters were going through, I was just THAT much caught up in the movie.This comment page seems to have evolved into who ever can think up the most other disaster films this movie emulates. Get over it. Every detective/scifi/cowboy/rom-com movie has similarities to every OTHER detective/scifi/cowboy/rom-com movie, that's why it's called a GENRE.I for one found the government's role totally believable. It's kind of carefully sitting on the fence here: Private companies financed this for a billion euros per seat, but governments organized it, so government CAN get things right! This is completely against current American culture of hating government.There was a good realism vs idealism conflict at the end, where it turns out that OF COURSE the CIA or whoever killed anybody who tried to expose this, but that the Idealist eventually wins by letting the poor workers into to the ship.The best thing about this movie? I set my phone to come online after two hours, not knowing how long it would last. I was completely surprised when the 2 hours mark sounded. So much happens in this movie time flies by. This is an essential ingredient in story telling, by it via book, film or oral history around the campfire.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",2012
214,kunalkhandwala,Foreseen Devastation in typical Emmerich style,7,21 November 2009,"The Mayans predicted the advent of apocalypse in year 2012 and Ronald Emmerich shows us its preview in the dramatic Earth shattering extravaganza of a film that leaves little to fate, heroism, belief and humanity. After all, when the supremo of obliteration ('Independence Day', 'Godzilla', 'Day after tomorrow') decides to showcase the very end, you know the destruction will be ruthlessly spectacular!The adroitness of Emmerich in selecting a subject and showcasing what chaos it is capable of in its glorified moment is what sends the box office ringing. The rest, quite frankly, is either painstakingly dramatic or naively cheesy. He was never acclaimed for substance or depth in his films but always for the special effects and the destruction of several cities at a time. Such is the case with 2012, which brings the myth of the Mayans to reality with a combination of cataclysmic stellar activity to obliterate our world on a foreseen judgement day. Yes, the result is nothing short of spectacular. The Earth shattering and ground breaking sequences in California are breathtaking and so are those with the explosions of a violent Earth in Yellow Stone National Park. Vegas gets lost in the dark with Earth falling below but we could've expected more out of the 'strip' fallout.The most stunning bit though is the entire part in Tibet. As seen in the previews, gigantic waves have some stunning effect when they attempt to overcome the roof of the world while mankind's only hope of continuity rests in these lands. It may not be a very convincing end. In fact, the movie's premise itself may not be convincing at all but that is clearly not Ronald Emmerich's forte. He is concerned with mass devastation and we are supposed to enjoy that ride. Not the excessive drama associated with John Cusack's struggle with his ex-wife, children, ex-wife's boyfriend and his pathetic life. If that wasn't enough, we have Morgan Freeman and Thandie Newton in a Presidential melodrama that drags longer than Sarah Palin's election campaign. Yes, a human aspect is required in a catastrophe movie but the excess length of the movie caused by the drama could well be the downfall of '2012'.Perhaps an interesting perspective on the scientific background of the calamity, preparation of several countries for the apocalypse, approaches of different cultures and then the dramatic human aspect of a handful of families in different parts of the world could've been more convincing. Nevertheless, Ronald Emmerich manages to put enough destruction in the upcoming apocalypse foreseen by the Mayans for some explosive entertainment.8.2012 on a scale of 1-10.",2012

Suspend belief and you will enjoy it. Start thinking and questioning the science behind it and you wont. The acting is standard for a disaster movie, the only stand-outs being John Cusack and Chiwetel Edjiofor, who relish their respective roles and have a great time with them.

But for 2012, I don't know......If you are awed by the special effects in the trailer, well, you will be allowed to see the full version of those spectacular scenes with ""the whole world turns into sh*t"", but be warned that you already got the cream of the movie from the trailer. So very sadly this is another spectacle that was topped by its trailer.And please be warned that these sequences are not so thrilling simply because they are like ""on-rail"" sequences in a action game, that the main protagonist's vehicles are indestructible and always tend to go through some narrow places that lead the ladies on board to scream. But if you never see these in a movie before, it's worth a watch.On the humanity side, this movie is simply inferior to The Day After Tomorrow, and the story a little bit took itself too seriously that even Independence Day had some rich developments compared to it. Never mind......Though, after seeing all those holocaust in a movie, you'd thank God we're still alive and not insane, does it mean the movie is effective in some way? 6.5/10 C+ for visual effects.",2012

I've never really grown out of it. I love to see cities destroyed. I call it Apocalypse Porn. '2012' is the greatest example yet.So, the sun expels an unusually large number of neutrinos which somehow, against all the laws of God and nature, are converted into microwaves that boil the Earth's molten mantle to a level where the crust and tectonic plates start blowing apart. Well, so much for the 'science'. Over the next two hours, a Super Volcano rises up in Wyoming, Los Angeles disintegrates into a very big hole, the American Midwest ends up around the South Pole, tsunamis breach the Himalayas, and the President of the United States survives a toppling Washington Monument only to be taken out by the supercarrier USS John F Kennedy crashing down from the crest of a tidal wave. Yes, you heard me right - the Capitol is flattened by a massive ship carried from Philadelphia on a giant wave. Amongst the chaos, there's the usual story of a divorced father trying to prove his worth to his estranged children through increasingly insane acts of courage/stupidity, blah, blah, blah... There's an odd political subtext at work extolling the virtues of democracy at all costs. Oliver Platt, as Carl Anheuser (Karl Rove/Anheuser Busch/George Bush – get it), is the nearest thing the movie has to a villain, and his scheming persona is expressed through a desire to save only the greatest minds in the world. The 'good' and 'noble' characters, exhibiting a dangerous level of naivety, wish to open salvation to every mouth-breathing cretin in the nation through a national lottery. Personally, when it comes to the continuation of human civilization, I think a Nobel Prize-winning physicist kind of beats out Bubba from Georgia on the priority list, but maybe I'm as amoral as poor Carl Anheuser. The sight of a caricatured fat Russian leading the rebellion against a capitalist meritocracy like the Bolshevik hoards running at the Odessa Steps adds just one more layer of weirdness to the movie's political viewpoint. The story, as it should be, is the bare minimum required to get us from one spectacular set piece of biblical destruction to the next. The world has never before been consumed so lovingly and in such detail, and the results are magnificent. Personally, I loved the movie as Apocalypse Porn at its finest. I'm willing to concede that those who do not share my fetish and require character development and basic logic will, however, be far from satisfied.",2012
218,Siamois,Eat popcorn and enjoy the end of the world!,5,21 January 2010,"Knowing fully well that this was Emmerich project, I expected nothing more than a good old disaster flick and that is what this movie offers.Of course, with the rise of CGI in the last decade or so, most viewers are now accustomed to scenes of epic devastation, and with 2012, we get the impression the writers tried to up the ante once again with the disaster aspect. We get a mix of stuff we've seen in other movies, such as monster earthquakes, massive volcanoes and giganormous tsunamis. Protagonists do impossible stunts in airplanes, in cars and even underwater. Entire cities are wiped out. The whole thing is quite fun in that respect. The actual story? The characters? It's all very typical for that type of Hollywood entertainment. Ordinary people, scientists, politicians are all featured. You've got your typical ""good guys"" trying their best to survive and some ""bad guys"" showing traits such as greed and selfishness. Along the way, some characters live, other dies. Most get a chance to say the typical ""hollywood goodbyes"" and some even redeem themselves before they die.Emmerich never lets you dwell too long on the characters, or what it means for the world as we know it to come to an end. It might be seen as a shame but that's par for the course in that type of movie. I'll give it an honest five. I think it does a good job at entertaining. But if you are looking for an intense drama, or to see the laws of physics or reality carefully applied, this is not the film to watch. What you get here is a very good bunch of actors doing a good (not great) job in a CGI-heavy movie. You get a story that covers all the bases, but doesn't do anything brilliantly. In short, decent entertainment, if you are entertained by this sort of film.",2012

No more 1 through 10, but rather how many ""Oh, brother"" outbursts a movie receives. 2012, about what will happen when the world ends, got so many ""Oh, brother"" I lost count. First off, at 2 1/2 hours this movie is at least 60 minutes too long. Of course we have to have our resident villain (Platt) and our resident hero (Cusack). Now toss in every disaster movie ever foisted on the public, and of course a lot of special F/X (and really not that spectacular), and you get this movie, in and of itself its own major disaster. If you are scientifically minded, or just logical, you're going to exceed 100 ""Oh, brother"" in the first hour. If we had to see one more car or plane out-running some natural disaster we were going to squeal for mercy. And yes, we could have stopped watching this flick, but it was on our Movie Club List. Question: If the world is going to end, who do you stock the Ark with? Older, or obscenely wealthy (like money is going to be worth anything in a new world?), people who cannot procreate or contribute anything, or young, healthy people with knowledge and skills needed to start a new world?

220,headly66,Demolition Man strikes again,3,16 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich's '2012' is so over the top it becomes laughable by the end of this over long mash up of every disaster film ever made. I guess the director spent a weekend watching Airport, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure and decided to write them all into the most overblown eruption of CGI I have ever witnessed. Now don't get me wrong, I am all for a good ""forget your troubles"" movie where you can just not have to think for two hours. But the massive barrage of effects and the sheer overwhelming amount of chaos and destruction become a distraction and you find yourself constantly thinking that it could never happen in real life. There must be 20 narrow escapes in some incredibly built automobiles and tires for that matter. There is almost no real character development so were left with just the cartoon versions of real people we have come to expect from Emmerich. We also have all the classic clichés from the disaster movie menu like showing people in different countries react using what is obviously just news footage of recent events, having to show important landmarks get destroyed, etc, etc. Think of the great movies that don't get made by filmmakers who can't get the funding to produce a project, you could have made 10 good films with the outrageous amount spent on this bloated snore fest.A list of the offenses to our intelligence:1.Why is the Mona Lisa 3 times it's real size?2.Jackson comes home early from the camping trip driving through the night then says he is late for work even though he was not supposed to be back until the next day.3.How can a radio station broadcasting from a trailer have the power to reach L.A. which is 300 miles from Yosemite.4.Gordan says he had a few flying lessons on a single engine plane but then pilots a much larger plane through the most harrowing ordeals any pilot has ever seen with no problems.5.A projectile blows away the back of the trailer (where the gas tank is) but it is able to continue.6.The proximity of explosions and the massive eruption at Yosemite would have killed them all many times over.7.Why is the Russian bringing all his cars and why would his voice recognition to start the Bentley be in English?8.The incredibly impossible coincidence of landing just miles from where they needed to be in China even though the entire continent has moved.9.The Russian plane that was out of fuel explodes in a giant fireball.10.Most major cities have been destroyed and a giant Tsunami is hurtling toward the Indian scientist and his family but he still has cellphone service. 11.They are all stuck in the airlocks that are filling with sub-freezing ocean water that just passed through the Himalayas but they all look very comfortable wearing just t-shirts and jeans.",2012
221,WubsTheFadger,2012,1,9 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAt best, it's a nearly three-hour film packed with several tons of clichés whose best features are explosions and general destruction. At worst, it's a gruesome, depressing subject as viewed from the seat of a passing roller coaster.Disaster movies are usually very popular and have long managed to thrill plenty of people with their huge scale and awesome special effects. Since 2012 (which is tied to a much-debated Mayan prophecy that supposedly names that year as the one in which the world will end) is one of the biggest and most spectacular to date, it will no doubt follow suit -- and, in terms of visual effects and clear, exciting filmmaking, it is well done. And the impressive, appealing cast does its level best to read through the third-rate dialogue without too much eye-rolling. But anyone looking for character depth, powerful emotional content, intelligence, poetic images, or personal expression of any kind is advised to look elsewhere.Overall Rating: 1.3",2012
222,mgruebel,CA going down in chunks,6,2 April 2020,"Emmerich really seems to be in love with runways collapsing behind airplanes taking off. We get this three times in the movie. Probably once would have been OK. Same with buildings on precipices so narrow due to everything around having collapsed a mile deep, that it is structurally impossible.But of course this is a disaster flick, not a documentary. So we can't expect the slightest physical accuracy in megavolcano explosions, continental shelf sinking into the ocean, etc.If you just hit the 'suspension of disbelief button' and get into the non-stop disaster action, the movie delivers pretty well, hence a 6/10. Not worth seeing more than once, but with a beer in hand, it can while an evening away. And Woody Harrelson is always great as the insane guy.Oddly, the 'bad guy,' played by Oliver Platt is actually right: you do not open the slowly operating hydraulic door of a humanity-saving ark a couple of minutes before doom, thereby endangering humanity's survival; you do not, like Danny Glover's US President, dramatically remain on the White House lawn while a tidal wave sends an aircraft carrier tumbling your way. Hurray to Platt for being the only person with common sense and the courage to make very hard decisions in this film. That was rather odd: most films at least manage to make me root for the hero and against the villain, but not here.Fortunately, neutrinos are not that bad in real life, even when the solar flares get big. And luckily, (big surprise!) then end of the Mayan calendar in 2012 was just one more of those doomsday prediction/conspiracy theories that did not come true.",2012
223,axlrhodes,Roland Emmerichs 2012 is about as unimaginative as a film can get.,2,11 April 2010,"I agree with critic Mark Kermode. This film was written by accountants. Its the only explanation for the sheer tripe that we are presented with.I wont bore you with the setup,but needless to say,the world is on the eve of destruction from within.The film plods through all the clichés as our main characters go through the motions in a painfully uninteresting way.The CGI destruction of the world offers no threat or tension,it just happens in a really non emotional and tedious way.At no point in the film did i marvel or sit in awe of the spectacle of it all.Instead,i winced at the 2 hours and 40 mins running time and willed the movie to its predictable and boring climax.Some good actors do very little than pick up the paycheque,only Oliver Platt seems to want to have a go at having fun but alas,its all in vain.The film is terrible and Roland Emmerich does nothing to divorce himself from having a reputation for making terribly bloated and over sentimentalised garbage.",2012
224,blacklist-1,Amazing CGI and a script so cheesy and acting to go with it makes this a so bad it's good film.,7,14 May 2010,"2012 I have been looking forward to for a while and suffice to say Roland Emerich delivers again though it's just not on the same level as Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow as 2012 when it comes to the characters and the dialogue was very cheesy indeed and the acting was terrible (though the best performance I thought was Danny Glover who was OK) and wasn't on par with Emmerich's other films I've just mentioned.But the fact that it is so cheesy with all the usual disaster movie clichés is what made the film so entertaining as it was very funny like when Cusack's kid says to Yuri a Russian guy ""That's a big plane"" and he replies ""It's Russian!"" had me shouting with laughter. 2012 was a so bad it's good movie. Don't expect deep characterisation or an inventive script or even great acting because you won't get it. I don't think that was Emmerich's intention of comic relief however. It just sub-stained itself at the length of 2hrs and 40mins and the special effects are incredible to look at.If your in the mood for a really cheesy film that will make you laugh and you don't take seriously (but by looking at loads of reviews on this website that isn't the case) and jaw dropping effects, you'll like this like me.",2012
225,budmassey,At least the popcorn was good.,2,15 November 2009,"In case you haven't heard, ""2012"" is about the end of the world. Actually, that's the entire plot, so maybe this should be considered a spoiler.Estimates are that this movie cost about $260 million to make. I guess a quarter-billion dollars just doesn't buy what it used to. It's roughly twice what Roland Emmerich squandered on ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" which is apropos, I suppose, since ""2012"", believe it or not, is every bit of twice as bad as ""Day After."" I'm not even sure where to start, but writing is always a good launching point. ""2012"" is a careening, convoluted cacophony of practically every possible disaster movie cliché. We have the usual ticking clock, a common literary device, arbitrarily accelerated when the writer/director felt a need to heighten the tension. We have flat, transparent characters who end up being little more than placeholders around which to construct the endless, tiresome special effects. And, of course, we have the special effects, so shamelessly and randomly contrived as to render the destruction of the world tedious. I ended up wishing the world would hurry up and end already, but no, there had to be yet another, and another, and another, plot twist; inartfully conceived, predictably staged, and completely inert.The cast fared no better. John Cusak is one of my favorite actors, but he had no character to portray. Do we really need another hack writer, failed husband derelict trying to remain relevant in the lives of his children vis-a-vis mommy's new, rich husband? The kids were just two-dimensional cutout characters - mere props in the CGI scenery. Danny Glover, a passable character actor, was completely out of his depth as The Last President of the United States. Even George Bush seemed competent and intelligent by comparison. Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson - all fine actors, were lost within characters lacking even a hint of humanity or depth.The only thing this movie has going for it, although obviously not what Emmerich intended, is that it is pathetically funny. We laughed till our sides hurt as we called out each and every plot device before they were hauled out with all the subtlety of a train wreck and the unfailing predictability of an atomic clock. What's worse, each new twist was more ridiculous than the last until, as we roared with laughter, the entire Earth itself was conveniently shifted at the exact moment and extent necessary to start another cycle of completely absurd events.""2012"" is epically bad, monumentally stupid, and cataclysmically boring. At least the popcorn was good.",2012
226,Jakealope,You Get Your Money's Worth,7,11 March 2010,"I've seen all the other Emmerich movies about doomsday-in-America scenarios so I am well acquainted with his methods. This movie gives you plenty of destruction as well as interesting sets and locations. There is the usual plethora of characters from all walks of life and continents, but it is mainly centered around John Cusack's Jackson Curtis, a failed sci fi disaster writer (unlike Emmerich & crew) and his estranged wife, prissy Amanda Peet and two (Hollywood only) kids. There is the requisite rainbow set of scientists, big movers and shakers and a squeaky clean magical Negro White House and President, Danny Glover, who else, who sweats out saccharine, and the rest of the blacks who are uniformly heroic, intelligent and noble. Contrast them to his oily chief of staff Anheuser(Get it Busch?), played by Oliver Platt. Then toss in Woody Harrelsonas some low budget Art Bell dj who is on to the end of the world conspiracy-scenario. See the heads of all the world's governments & the elite know a few years in advance about this, so in Tibet, they build all these escape vessels, arks, for a select group, mainly people with money, 1,000,0000,000 Euros a seat. While the rest of the world is ignorant of this seismic event, caused normally benign neutrinos, emitted by the sun, melting the inside of the planet and crust, that until the crevasses swallow them up or volcanoes bury them in ash or lava, they are ignorant. But Jackson and family find out at the last minute and due to him meeting both the DJ and working for a fat Russian billionaire who has tickets, rushes to get to Tibet with his family in utterly Hollywood only escapes in various planes and vehicles only meters ahead of the collapsing earth surface or falling fireballs. The characters are not totally cardboard, but they are predictable and corny as well as they keep the story moving. There are lots of them including the Russian billionaire, who along with his beautiful Russian model and pilot, die just before safety, leaving only his two fat obnoxious kids to survive. But good old Jackson and his family pull through unscathed to an ending where at least the chosen survive to settle in the one last remaining chunk of land, South Africa. Okay, its corny, over the top, implausible but it follows the mold of hundreds of similar movies and does it better. The best thing is that it hardly touched on the Mayan thing but kept it pseudo Scientific.",2012

This is the movie that cashed in on that prophecy. It turns out that the world didn't end, nor did the Mayans actually claim that it would.The film is yet another Roland Emmerich blockbuster that boasts stupid CGI, pointless chase scenes with various vehicles, characters with melodramatic personal lives and mind-numbing dialogue (delivered by rather good actors, actually.)

229,Jonathon_Natsis,How to survive Judgement Day,5,1 February 2011,"From the master of disaster (films, that is) Roland Emmerich, comes the king of all world- ending movies, which is no meagre statement considering the man has churned out the likes of Independence Day, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow. For his latest endeavour, Emmerich rounds up Cusack, Peet, Ejiofor, Harrelon and Glover to help him convince us that we are, in fact, hopelessly doomed in some two-and-a-half years from now.Main character Jackson Curtis works as a limousine driver and part-time writer (two crucial qualities needed to survive a natural global catastrophe, by the way) who's findings regarding an ancient Mayan prophecy predicting the end of the world as we know it in December 2012 set off a mind-numbing yet adrenaline packed 150 minutes as the last of the Earth's inhabitants try vainly to survive imminent destruction. As far as big, dumb blockbusters go, this film sits on top of the heap, exceeding prior expectations in areas that define an enjoyable disaster film, but noticeably lacking in those that define a quality film in general.Without doubt, the foremost positive to come out of 2012 was the immensely impressive CGI. By this stage in his filmmaking career, the next project by Roland Emmerich constantly begs the question: 'How does he plan to destroy the White House this time?' I sense an underlying social agenda, maybebut as an apolitical man that isn't important. In seriousness, though, there is some heavy-scale destruction in this film that actually looks real. Of course, it is ultimately nothing short of gratuitous, but one cannot help but be impressed with how far epic genre filmmaking has come as a result.An honourable mention must also go to Woody Harrelson. A well-rounded actor who has proved he can be successful (both critically and commercially) in a multitude of genres, he clearly relishes the opportunity to play the token conspiracy theorist. Using a script inarguably lacking in any sense of originality, Harrelson does his best with the material in front of him, and it is a shame to see him used as sparingly as he is in a film that otherwise accommodates his character.In an effort to pack as many mind-boggling visuals onto the screen as possible, Emmerich does away with anything that could even be considered close to a cohesive screenplay. The dialogue and general interplay between characters is barely engaging at its best (and atrocious at its worst), plot holes appear frequently in the First and Second Acts and any scenes centred around relationships or an attempt to develop a character arc feel rushed and only really serve as some sort of causal link between one action scene and the next. This is not a poor film, but it does fall far from being a memorable one. Where some will argue that this is the type of film to be simply sat through and enjoyed without picking away at its inherent pitfalls, I feel that contradicts the very notion of being a film critic, and I think that's been echoed in my above points fairly clearly. It delivers exactly what is expected, and occasionally throws in some well-directed scenes of suspense, one of which must be commended for its depiction of claustrophobia. Still, you may find that the two-and-a-half hours don't exactly fly by like you expected them to.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

230,vip-danii,Nowehere Near As Good As Expected...,4,25 March 2013,"My main problem with this movie was the fact that it was just so unbelievably unrealistic, full of clichés and seedy propaganda.I found the scenes when the disaster strikes to be an insult to human intelligence. I mean, do you expect anyone to believe that, while the earth is destabilizing ALL AROUND AT THE SAME TIME, and we see hundreds of people and cars go to waste, the protagonist and his family have this magical ability to dodge every bullet, and they're the only ones in the whole city unaffected by the disaster and manage to get away safely while building are collapsing and the ground in moving? Right! How lame and unrealistic is that? It's so predictable and cheesy... there's no suspense whatsoever, and you are not simply bored, but also disgusted and offended.I mean, the protagonist is a writer/limo driver, but he is portrayed as someone with almost superhuman powers. The ground is destabilizing under his feet, but he manages to save not only himself, but his whole family and the car + conveniently get to a plane and successfully board it while everyone else in the city dies.And everything else about this movie is equally bad. Never ending clichés, bad dialogue, and disgustingly predictable action scenes. Of course, the US president has to be black. Of course, there is a dysfunctional/estranged family that will be brought together by the disaster. Of course, religious propaganda is involved. Of course, there are wealthy Russians and Arabs. Of course, there's a dumb blonde. Of course, the bad guy turns good in the end. Of course, you know right away who's going to live and who's going to die -- you even know when and in what order (yes, it's THAT predictable).Honestly, it's just really boring a lot of the time. Like I said: zero suspense and zero originality.Unconvincing, boring, lame = the three words that summarize it perfectly.I thought that the President, as well as his adviser (the scientist) and his daughter were HORRIBLY miscast. None of these actors should've been in the movie. They're VERY unconvincing in their roles. Most actors in this movie are just really, really, really bad.I hated the soundtrack, too.I admire John Cusack; he's a splendid actor, but he couldn't save this disastrous mess. I think it's below his dignity to be associated with such a stupid excuse for a movie, so I have no idea why he agreed to star in it.To add insult to injury, they brought in a Paris Hilton look-a-like (who plays a rich Russian dude's lover), and she gets a lot of screen time -- without actually serving any purpose (just like actual Paris Hilton). The movie seems to put a large emphasis on how important it is to save Paris Hilton and her purse rat. I'm not sure I understand what this is about.I never really had high expectation for this film, but, turns out, it's worse than I thought. A huge disappointment.",2012
231,saarvardi,The ultimate disaster film!,10,7 November 2009,"I've recently watched 2012 during a press screening in Ramt Gan, Israel - and it's everything you can expect from a movie like this. The special effects are top notch. So breathtaking, intense and gripping that at times I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat. The main premise is the usual mix, with a family, a scientist and the president of the United States all struggling to make it through the end of the Earth. The latter two stories are filled with clichés and very predictable. However, I did feel emotionally connected to the angle regarding John Cusack and his on screen family's struggle to survive - and since they were the main focus of the story anyway, it worked well in my book. Also, throughout the film there is an incredible sense of urgency, which contributed greatly to the build up.The story is your basic end-of-the-world chaos thingy. This time around, the Earth's crusts are shifting - causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions on a global scale, followed by unfriendly tsunami waves. The governments of the world have some sort of a solution, in the shape of giant ships located in China (not spoiling anything here, this is said from the beginning of the film and is indicated in the trailer as well), and the movie follows the family's journey towards their destination, en route to China. As expected, they manage to flee and escape most of the horrific events happening around them and stay intact. Meanwhile, we get to see most of the world's biggest iconic monuments get destroyed in vivid ways - including The White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil, the Vatican in Rome and many many more.As indicated earlier, a main reason the film worked for me was the emotional connection I felt towards some of the characters. The cast here is top notch, including some recognizable actors like Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet - and of course, John Cusack. The cast seemed as if they were having a great time shooting this film, including some necessary tongue-in-cheek implications. Never the less, many philosophical and emotional elements of redemption and survival of the fittest were also added into the mix - making 2012 a better film than it had the right to be. Sometimes, one might even forget that the chances these events will all happen at once are small at best. Now, if only the clichés were a bit less over-the-top and the premise less predictable, this could have been one hell of a masterpiece. But then again, even when 2012 doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, it's still one hell of a roller coaster ride – and an excellent winter blockbuster to close the year with.",2012

The movie is all eye-candy, and then you're done with the ""box"" after almost 3 hours. The movie should've been called by its full name: 2012 - A Bucketload of Coincidences.I'm not even going to provide context in a well-written manner for the horrible parts in the film, so here it goes: Let's start with John Cusack, who plays an author with marital problems, but he must have ESP or psychic abilities to foresee that everything about the near future is dire and in need of escape. He jumps fences which just happen to be controlled by military forces that know of his famous book. He just happens to have written about a mythological topic which seems to be unfolding before his eyes. And his physical abilities to take on these world disasters is amazing. Let's jump to the bad visual jokes, like the one when the couple are in the supermarket, saying ""Let's never split up"" and then a ""small"" earthquake literally divides the two hand-holders. It splits the Sistine Chapel in half, right in between where ""Adam"" touches ""God"" in the painting. Every escape is near-death and impossible to pull off in real life. Around the end John Cusack seems to possess gills or at least lungs like a fish for as long as he was underwater, as does his son. The music was forgettable and generic, even during the flash-bang explosions of fire and lava and other pyrotechnic crap they threw on the screen.Then come the questions: in the end, they get away alive on vessels set sail for...wherever. What do they use for fuel after everything's demolished. Or food? What does that giraffe meat taste like, and how soon before Cusack degrades into cannibalism? The ships took in a lot of water...why did they not sink? In fact I was more curious about their outcome after the credits started rolling than I was in the relationship between Cusack and the new step-dad, or any other part of the movie. So everything's destroyed...now what? Good luck.The best part of the movie was the hilariously-bad animation of Woody Harrelson's character explaining the 2012 concept on his computer...that's it. And that's all of the explanation you'll get about why 2012 was devised by Westerners to be a year of disaster. I was hoping for a real-life, Apocalypto fashion-setting to tell the story of the Mayan calender.Well, Roland Emmerich said in an interview that it would be his last disaster film, so good riddance to that director of this played-out genre. I hope someone picks up the torch to make a film about the setting after the ships set sail, though.All in all, its 2009's best comedy, just behind The Hangover.",2012

Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn't really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It's not real? Isn't a movie ""not"" real by definition? Writer/director Roland Emmerich sacrifices dialogue and depends on an almost comical story line to wow viewers with mega destruction. Sure the CGI, sound and special effects will sell a lot of popcorn and soft drinks. Even word of mouth will put people in theater seats. Just leave any semblance of real intelligence at the box office, lean back and hold on...and let your eyes feast on the powerful scenes of devastation.A geologist(Chiwetel Ejiofor)has the facts and figures that prove validity in the ancient Mayan belief that the wold will come to an end in 2012. He at first will have trouble convincing the President's(Danny Glover)people of the pending doom; but a novelist(John Cusack), who just so happens to have written a book about the lost Atlantis, is an easier believer...and the story line has him and his family out driving and flying the massive earthquakes and tsunamis.

They encounter one natural disaster after another, yet emerge unscathed without fail. What are the odds that they could keep barely surviving time after time after time? A number of good actors are cast, but they have little to do other than either run from special effects disasters or pause to speak solemn platitudes.

Added to that is the most corny, pointless, dull, cliché ridden soap opera scenes the world has ever been exposed to. This film is completely devoid of any realism or emotion; it's over long and completely boring and pointless. I will give just some small example of pure nonsense: Aircraft taking off just before the whole airport and area is about to be destroyed, yet the tower keeps telling the plane they are no authorised to take off!!! 2 seconds later the tower is destroy, why would they be in the tower and why would they try stopping the flight. Mobiles phone work all the time even with no land, towers or electricity for miles around. The wife, who has just been stuck on a boat for x weeks/months still has lovely make-up and new clothes on, even on a packed ship. Animals are flown in one by one, by helicopter in the open air. Not in boxes and not on trucks and not well in advance, hours before departure. Why do all planes fly 1 inch off the ground at all times, rather than bothering to actually climb over any danger.I could go on and on, this film is simply brain dead nonsense with no redeeming qualities. Even the green screen FX are awful and poorly done.",2012
236,chelano,Not gonna happen,3,3 August 2010,"OK was this movie a joke? I can't believe they still spend this much money and write such crap. I will give the film two good points. The CG was pretty good. When the world is being destroyed, the CG makes you really feel a chill thinking that is what it could look like. The other thing was the cast. All the cast members were good. The lines they were giving to read were not. Wait, there was one actor who was not that good. It was Woody Harrelson's character. They really could of made a really interesting character for his role and what he plays in the movie. But they made his character a crazy person and for some reason, Harrelson could not pull it off. The biggest problem in this movie was the writing. Everything was so predicable and cliché. It got to a point where I started to laugh because it got so cheesy. The last movie that made me laugh like that was Dragon Wars. Also if I had a dollar for every person who wanted to stay behind in this film and die. Speaking of dying, a lot of people did die in the film and it seemed like no one really cared. Someone would die and they would be like, OK; time for the next scene. The ending of the film was not even exciting enough to even care about and they could of added more, but the film was running long enough. I just didn't feel like seeing another hour of special landmarks getting crushed or blown up. If you took those scenes out, the movie would be 30 minutes long.",2012

Sure the special effects are top notch, although overdone at times. The story is nothing new, and well and truly over used in Hollywood. The lame and tame family drama story line is over powered by the special effects, but seeing that it has made over $600,000,000 who I am to say it's not good entertainment.If you want over the top effects, and a lame story line then this is for you, but I myself need more then that, and found it a boring waste of time.A 4 out of 10 for me.",2012
238,cadillac20,All The Stops Have Been Pulled Out For The End Of The World,7,14 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich, has, over the years, established himself as a king of disaster films. No matter what you think of his movies, there is no doubt that this man has put quite a bit of thought to what it would be like if the world came to an end...in several different ways. But if you thought his previous films, like Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow displayed a world falling apart, you haven't seen anything until you've seen 2012.Let's get this out of the way first: this film is exactly what you would expect it to be. Yes, there is a story, and it does have a few heart warming moments, but these moments and the story serve as fodder mostly for the massive action packed disaster scenes that plague the world. That's not to say it's bad. John Cusack is enjoyable, as are most of the cast. They don't serve up stellar performances, but they are certainly serviceable, and that goes a long way in film that puts most of the attention on L.A. falling apart, literally, and Yellowstone becoming a massive volcano.With that being said, this is the kind of film you expect in the summer. The special effects are massive, and this is a popcorn flick through and through. If you enjoyed Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow, you will certainly enjoy this film. Others looking to kill some time with a somewhat brainless film about destruction will enjoy the plethora of destructive scenes here. And Emmerich pulls out no stops here. Only a few are safe here as we either witness the destruction of many well known areas of the world, or get to see their after effects. Either way, everything here as far as disaster films go are upped. And nearly every disaster plays some part, from fires to tsunamis to earthquakes. The film boasts gorgeous cinematography as well, with some shots that are, dare I say, breathtaking.With that being said, don't expect anything more than pure entertainment here. It's certainly worth seeing in the theaters for it's scale and enormity, but the film does run a little long. Not that it takes too much of a pause to let you check your watch, but by the end of the film, you'll no doubt have. If you're expecting anything deeper than the entertainment the film provides, you'll be disappointed. But take it lightly, and enjoy it for what it is, and you will find a worthwhile time at the theater.",2012
239,pepekwa,thoroughly enjoyed movie,8,31 July 2010,"Unlike many on here, I didn't watch this movie thinking it would be a documentary about the end of the world or a realistic assessment of what could happen in a couple of years. This is a popcorn flick where you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours and so what if John cusack defied the odds in escaping from near certain death a few times, its an end of the world flick at the end of the day, the premise needs to be a bit far fetched. Some of the CGI sequences where pasadena/LA are being destroyed are breathtaking and are a credit to the special FX industry. There are obvious comparisons to director Roland Emmerich's previous blockbuster independence day and while this movie is not of that standard it is still a thrill a minute action piece where you see the full gamut of human emotions in the face of the Apocalypse. If you need to park your brain for a couple of hours to enjoy this, so be it, I took this film at face value and loved what I saw",2012
240,enochsneed,Roland Emmerich 'jumps the shark',2,21 March 2011,"I have enjoyed Roland Emmerich's earlier films, so I felt this was worth looking at. I only wanted entertainment, not high art. I did not expect to be so disappointed.'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' at least had a premise (alien invasion, climate change) which, however absurd, put the story on a firm footing. All we had here was some mumbo-jumbo about the Earth suffering a catastrophic change every so often. The ancient Maya had apparently cottoned on to this and worked out 2012 was to be the next scheduled terrestrial hiccup, but this was just thrown away in the general noise.Despite the routine spectacle and thrills with collapsing cities, last minute escapes by the central characters (to say nothing of the dog) and the usual roller-coaster ride Emmerich gives his audience, '2012' is an oddly slow and sluggish film compared to his earlier work.Another major difference is that in the earlier films the characters overcame challenges using existing technology and their own intelligence and determination. Here we are asked to believe that a fleet of high-technology arks have been built in the heart of China, in less than three years. I am not an engineer but even I know the feasibility and design study for a new passenger jet takes longer than this - it took 17 years for the Airbus A380 to get into the air from its original inception.In a strange way '2012' is both too much and not enough - too much CGI, too much of a credulity gap; not enough character, not enough real story. With more balance between these factors, it could have been a much better film.",2012
241,widescreenguy,truly gawdawful formulaic pap,2,10 June 2010,"the computer generated action crew sure got a workout with this one. problem is they displaced huge chunks of the plot line by the wayside.how many 'outrace the falling debris' chases does it take for viewers to finally get the message? and it is very realistic *looking*; problem is the events depicted NEVER HAPPEN in real life. ever. (spoiler)for example, the part where the cruise ship is capsized by the tsunami? hellllooooo! tsunamis only heave up out of the water when they hit shallow shore line and the energy catches up with the wash. (kinda like sonic booms).if you're looking for a deep philosophical question 'how does mankind handle an abrupt end of the earth' to be posed and answered, skip this waste of 2 hours. if you want 'here's an assignment CGA class, make a movie about end of the world; heavy on car chases and buckling crust' then this will satisfy your morbid tastes.",2012

243,jazza923,Just another disaster movie.,6,21 March 2010,"58/100. I was so hoping that this film would avoid all the disaster movie cliché's and at least have something original to offer. It apes everything from Earthquake, Airport The Towering Inferno to the Poseidon Adventure. My hopes for this were dashed rather early into the movie. Indeed the special effects are impressive, the acting is adequate. It's a shame the filmmakers didn't take more risks and try something more original. I knew everyone who was destined to die, the usual cities were destroyed, it was so very very predictable. It's all special effects and melodrama, it lacks substance and originality. On the plus side, in spite of it's extreme length, it did hold my interest.",2012
244,MetalGeek,Abso-frickin-lutely LUDICROUS,5,4 May 2010,"How many times has Roland Emmerich destroyed the Earth now? The man behind ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" puts the final nail in the modern-day disaster-movie wave with his latest epic, ""2012,"" in which our beloved planet is destroyed in yet another series of fiery cataclysms sparked by a dreaded planetary alignment that occurs every 600,000 years or so. The earth's core heats up (?), causing shifts in the tectonic plates upon which our continents stand, huge earthquakes occur, tidal waves destroy entire countries, and a whole lotta people die. Caught in the middle of the chaos is John Cusack, an unsuccessful writer who's now stuck in a dead end job as a limo driver for an unlikable Russian billionaire and his two snotty kids. Desperate to save his own estranged children and his ex-wife from the apocalypse after getting the ""straight scoop"" during a chance meeting with a crazed talk-radio host (Woody Harrelson) at Yellowstone Park, Cusack barely has time to throw them all in his car before the proverbial poop hits the fan. From then on, increasingly ridiculous narrow escapes from certain destruction are the order of the day as the group globe-hops its way to China, where the proverbial ""two percent"" of humanity (i.e. the rich and powerful) have secretly set up a group of giant ""ark"" ships that will allow them to ride out the disaster and thus repopulate the Earth when it's over. If you're thinking ""sounds ridiculous"" by now, you're not alone. I'm not sure how scientifically accurate any of this action is (if I had to take a wild guess I'd say ""not very""), and I'll admit that it's fun to watch various world landmarks get vaporized for a while (the special effects are excellent) but by about the halfway point the spectacle of ""2012"" simply becomes overkill. The performances by Cusack, Amanda Peet (as his ex-wife), Thandie Newton (as the First Daughter) and Danny Glover (as the President) are about as good as you'd expect from a movie such as this, in other words, there's not a lot of real ""acting"" required except to gape open mouthed in shock as yet another ridiculous scene of destruction unfolds. Maybe if the script had more going on than the usual assortment of disaster movie clichés, we might care more about the cast of characters.""2012"" starts out as a fun, mindless popcorn movie that unfortunately gets bogged down in its own sense of self-importance the longer it goes on. It's got tons of talent and plenty of pretty special effects, but not an ounce of soul.",2012
245,jonnyfendi,Mega Apoclypse from Master of Apocalypse,7,17 April 2010,"It's just like I predicted before, ""2012"" will be a controversial movie. If we talk about the end of the world, the issue about religions is avoidable. Thiz movie itself starts with significant Box Office worldwide. People come to the theaters to fulfil their curiosity, to see how the world will end. Thiz is totally just theme victory. The Director is Roland Emmerich, who I called ""The Master of Apocalypse"". Before ""2012"", Emmerich has several times brought the topic about the end of the world, just like in ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004) and ""10.000 BC"" (2008). The movie is starred by John Cusack who finally gets his big budget movie. The other Cast members are Chiwetel Ejiofor, Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover. As we know the genre like thiz will be a spectacular Special Effects exhibition. The most powerful scene is when John Cusack's character is driving his car and chased by earthquake. The great thing about thiz movie is some scenes bring out the humanity theme as well. On the contrary, I'm surprised that ""2012"" is lack of environmental issue. Previously, I thought they would put a lot of environmental issues into the movie. ""2012"" just delivers a great description about the end of the world. The truth is nobody knows when it will happen, except our Creator.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",2012
246,piratecannon,Apocalypse Anyone,3,26 December 2012,"If I had to select one person to crown the undisputed king of the disaster movie, it'd have to be Roland Emmerich. With such films as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow under his belt, not many can go toe-to-toe with the German king of CGI. While I'll be the first to admit that I've got a little bit of a soft spot for his 1996 alien invasion blockbuster, I really didn't like his 2004 treatise on global warming (which, in one particularly harrowing scene, had its protagonists running from an advancing cold front). In any case, here is Mr. Emmerich testing his destructive know-how once again, trying desperately, I'm sure, to salvage any semblance of a reputation he has in the wake of the atrocious 10,000 B.C.John Cusack (playing the role of Jackson Curtis) takes the lead in this latest effort. He's an aspiring author—to be fair, his first novel had 450+ copies published, so ""aspiring"" might not be the right word—whose day job is that of a limousine driver. When he's not shuttling wealthy Russians to and from LAX, he devotes his time to his children. This is where things get sticky, though, because Jackson is divorced; his wife, Kate, is now dating a yuppie plastic surgeon (Gordon) and his kids think this guy is, well just tops. So, one weekend Jackson decides to take his young-uns to Yellowstone National Park for a little father-children time. What he didn't expect on this trip was to run into a conspiracy theorist (Charlie Frost, played by Woody Harrelson) who broadcasts a radio show from his Winnebago. This guy is a real nut job who spends his time mourning the state of the U.S. government and predicting the end of the world, which, according to him—and, of course, the Mayans— will occur on December 21, 2012.Still with me? Good. Let's take a look at the story we've been presented with so far: a fairly level-headed man who's trying to hold his family together—and who has absolutely no background in science (or any reason to be interested in it whatsoever)—has had a strange encounter with a hippie living in an RV full of shoddy evidence to support a theory about the end of the world. Reason would suggest that Jackson would dismiss this man's ramblings as the byproduct of a strained psychosis, right? And, in fact, that's exactly what he does the first time he runs into Charlie. Not fifteen minutes later, however, he witnesses a fault line rip through a Los Angeles area grocery store on TV and he's lapping up this guy's commentary with a spoon. The instant turn around in his opinion of Charlie is shocking, and it's painfully obvious that it's nothing more than a plot device instituted to speed up the Biblical destruction we've paid so dearly to see.Honestly, I wouldn't normally think this is a bad thing. I knew going into this one that suspension of intelligent thought was a prerequisite; Emmerich knows this too, and, for whatever reason, he decides to test his audience's patience by stacking one ridiculous scenario on top of another. In a Crash-like convergence of fate, eventually a sea of characters (with their own plots and subplots) come together in completely unbelievable ways. On top of all this is a syrupy coating of sentimentality that feels out of place (and, at times, just plain embarrassing). Patrons are paying to see mountains topple and familiar monuments crumble in a maelstrom of fiery, bass-heavy destruction. We go to 2012 because we wanted to be beaten silly by unchecked chaos. What we don't want from these characters—who repeatedly worm their way out of impossible situations—are forced emotions.Static characters are given minimal backstory and then thrown into situations that are specifically designed to manipulate our pathos; which, by the way, just about all of us—whether we're aware of it or not —decided to check at the door. How many times can audiences tear up at the sight of family members embracing one another in the shadow of a mile-high tsunami? It worked surprisingly well in Deep Impact, for example, but, at this point in the history of disaster movies, it's a played out tactic. Really, it comes across as incredibly insulting.But what about the computer-generated bedlam? Is it as good as the teasers indicate? I'm here to tell you that it's vicious and unrelenting. This is great, but there's one problem; it's predictable. You'll find yourself actually becoming bored as plane after plane barely rises above a crumbling runway. Employing a little creativity in the disaster scenario department, it seems, could've done wonders for a film whose sole job is to ""wow"" us with multimillion dollar effects. Though there are some memorable bits here, they're far from mind-blowing. In fact, we've seen pretty much all of it before, and often done in better ways.Where 2012 falters most is in its lack of urgency. Since this is the end of the world, you'd think that we, as viewers, would have the nagging sense that there's a lot at stake. Any chance the movie had of generating such feelings is instantly shattered, for example, when we see a fru-fru dog we couldn't care less about prancing across a high- wire as a dramatic score bombards us with what I'll generically label ""rising tension.""If 2012 pulls in the mass audience studio execs are banking on, maybe we can take it as a sign that the end of competent filmmaking is very, very near.",2012

But... its well made, the actors do a good job, it entertains and enthralls.
The premise is way too far fetched, the Neutrinos from the sun, suddenly have weight and are causing the core of the earth to heat up causing a mass extinction.
Once you get beyond the bad science and just enjoy the disaster movie for what it is, it has had a lot of money spent on it to make it look and feel excellent.
Woody Harrelson is wonderful as the cookie conspiracy nut who thinks the world is about to end and thinks the super volcano under Yellowstone park is about to erupt, guess what, for the first time, hes right. Plenty of fortuitous meetings lead them inexorably towards the possible salvation.

That is really the only way to see it as the special effects looked awesome on the big screen. Also, going into this I did not have faith that they would be able to make a film like this interesting to watch for all of two and a half hours, but I was pretty entertained for the duration of the film.Although the reason that I can't give this film a positive review is because there were just too many stupid, outrageously unrealistic parts in it. I did not expect complete accuracy or even a 100% realistic plot, but it was just too over the top in ""2012"". Multiple times during it's run I laughed out loud at how stupidly far fetched the action was. One good example is when Jackson is driving away from the earthquake destruction in California. I could list many, many more, but I don't really feel like typing out the plot of the entire movie.If you want to see some cool effects and nifty images, check it out in the theater.

250,BigWhiskers,The special effects are the only thing good about this movie.,5,14 November 2009,"The eye popping special effects involving earthquakes , monstrous tsunamis and other catastrophes swallowing cities and destroying famous landmarks are awesome. Other than that , the movie stinks. Let's start with the convoluted explanations of why the earth is going to end - the movies goes off in all different directions and the reasons implausible and ridiculous. We also have bad acting bordering on annoying along with one too many stupid scenes having people take time to argue while the earth is collapsing right behind them.Some times i wished for the protagonists to all die especially Gordon,Carl and Yuri along with Yuri's 2 spoiled evil twin sons who looked like the kid from the omen. The character of Gordon was so annoying - a first class whiner who just needed to STFU and fly the darn plane . Carl - a fat lard bucket windbag who needed to have his butt kicked and shutup - he was such a jerk. Yuri and his 2 kids -- a rich scheming scumbag and his kids evil to the core - if anyone deserved to die it was them and im glad one of them does die- i wont say who though.The ending of the movie was disappointing to me and somewhat of a cop out as if the writers couldn't come up with something more than a we survived now let's go to disneyland type finale. 10/10 for the special effects ,everything else is a 0",2012
251,brandon_lee420,Pretty disappointing!,5,26 March 2010,"2012 Review The highly anticipated disaster film by Roland Emmerich, 2012, was yesterday released at my local video store and without checking if I had money to buy it, I raced down to the store and brought myself a brand new copy. The presentation, cover and back, is fantastic and the picture surely looks interesting as a Buddhist faces a big-a*s flood. Roland Emmerich's previous disaster films, The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day, were enjoyable to watch and both of them had stunning special effects. The same could be said for this movie, maybe more, because it has scenes where you are completely blown away, like the time when they were in a limo and were avoiding cracks in the grounds, and it was at that point that I really came to love the special effects in this film. The flood looked so real that it had me scared as I thought about myself facing it head-on. Some parts of the film did not look so interesting because you could clearly see that it was all CGI. The story surrounding this motion picture is good but at times they stuff it up with unnecessary scenes that I can't remember. The dialogue is all right but I really expected more out of it. The film does not portray what would the characters would really say in a real-life situation but, hey, isn't that what you would expect out of a movie like this. The characters are easy to get along with, especially Woody Harrelson's character because he is a brave and crazy guy (too bad he had to squashed by a rock), but, again, some of the characters didn't hang on to you as much as you would have liked, it would have been better if they died during the middle of the film. John Cusack surprised me at the beginning but then started to descend down to disappointment. His character should have died after removing the thing jamming the engines. I hated it when he came out of the water, breathless. Stupid movie! The two Russian kids are so annoying and what's worse is that they are twins. They act like all those other stupid obese rich kids who always have to treat the less-fortunate bad. Danny Glover was not too bad as portraying the President of the United States. The cut on him really added more emotion to the film. I hope that whenever Roland Emmerich tries to make another disaster film he should at least make the audiences happy when they go out and not all sad and disappointed like me. The film was not better than The Day After Tomorrow.The film starts out as Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor) travels to India to meet a friend who has just found out that the earth's core is heating up rapidly. The earth's crust is unstable and if they do not save a fraction of the planets population, mankind will be doomed. Helmsley passes on the information to Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) who then passes it onto President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover). They decide to keep the information a secret so humans do not overreact (it's the end of the world for God sakes!) and that's when Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) comes in. His funny little comic strip is hilarious. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his son and daughter, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), trespass and camp out somewhere near a dried up lake only to be escorted out of the compound by the military and that's when they meet Charlie. Charlie tells them about the government keeping a secret from humans about the end of the world and at first Jackson doesn't believe it but starts to when the first signs appear. They have to find a way to get on one of the Arks, big ships built to last through the apocalypse (WTF!), and survive. From then on it's a ride through cool special effects and heroics. (Sounds a bit like a synopsis).Chiwetel Ejiofor was the only magnificent actor to star in the whole film because his role as Dr. Adrian Helmsley was really captivating. The theory of humans coming from Africa became a fact at the end of the movie as the remaining survivors go there. Oliver Platt was a big fat meanie. The film will definitely appeal to the younger ones and maybe to some older ones but the ones who are hard to trick will definitely have a bawl (Cry)! My two favorite scenes in the film have to be: When they are in the limo, desperately trying to avoid the mini earthquakes and the part where Charlie shows them his animation.There is one thing I want to ask before I stop and that is: How could they survive the God-forbidding apocalypse which every religion says is inevitable?:)",2012

He was a leading man back in the day, one of Hollywood's most promising up and comers. He was even in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Now, here he is in a bit part as a musician on a vacation cruise liner. He's all craggy and old now, but it's good to see him alive and well and ....Uh, I guess we should talk about the movie. The world goes blooey! The end. Actually, there's more to discuss, but that's the whole plot in a nutshell. If that's not what you want in a movie, better steer clear.This movie should have ended showing 500 people all taking a bow. That's the army it took to bring this CGI catastrophe epic to the screen. Think of all of them taking their families to the opening and being able to say, ""See the part where the tsunami tosses the aircraft carrier on top of the White House? I had a hand in that."" The kid replies, ""Gosh mom, you rock!"" I've always heard about the earthquake where one day California slides into the ocean. It's clear the filmmakers said, ""Everyone has heard that California one day will slide into the ocean. Let's actually show it."" And they do! If you see this movie you will see Malibu (or maybe Venice Beach) tilt up and slide right into the waves.In the trailer, you see all these gigantic catastrophes and might think you're seeing the end of the movie. You are not. That all happens about halfway through. The first half hour of the movie is set-up. It all begins in 2009 (whoa, the same year as the movie's release!). Scientists discover things going on deep underground that ""just can't be true."" Warnings are sounded. Governments are put on alert. Then 2012 arrives and fissures appear, the surface of the earth begins to collapse, buildings fall ... It looks like mankind itself will not make it. But ... and then comes the second half of the movie, which I will not reveal. But I'll hint — the species survives.What do you see get destroyed? Southern California, of course. Las Vegas. Yellowstone National Park. East India. Washington, D.C. Tibet. What am I leaving out ...Star John Cusack has a movie family. He's estranged from his wife. His little son and daughter have issues. Mom's seeing the plastic surgeon neighbor, who ends up a key character. Woody Harrelson (Hi Woody! Loved Zombieland!) chimes in as a crazy hippie prophet who gives info to Cusack so he's one step ahead as events go south. There's a superrich Russian oligarch (the movie's more or less bad guy). A brave Russian pilot. A sympathetic Russian bimbo mistress (whose fate is shamefully glossed over). There's also the president's chief of staff played by Oliver Platt who's basically doing a take on Henry Kissinger at his most Strangelovian.Roland Emmerich, all along you've been the guy who when Hollywood comes around and says, ""Roland, will you take all the money in Switzerland and make the most eyepoppingest movie imaginable?"" has always modestly said, ""Why, yes.""

Tidal waves that can crest mountains and earthquakes big enough to makes cracks visible from space. Lots of awesome visual and sound special effects.The story is OK...humans trying to survive. Concentrates on a divorced dad trying to fly away from the disasters and can drive on earthquake, lava ridden earth like an Indy 500 racer.They loose some points for the artificial drama injected (the saved are the rich and powerful, not the lottery system like in Deep impact). All though makes you think...time and time again it has been shown the rich and powerful save themselves at the expense of the under classes. (AKA Titanic syndrome)It is like a geology students dream movie...lots of props for those who study rocks and cracks in the dirt. Not that often that an earth scientist is one of the main characters in a movie.ANYWAY...movie has lots of cool special effects...This is one of those movies you MUST see on the BIG SCREEN. Like Independence Day and Armageddon.Worth the matinée price.",2012

255,mattrochman,"Way too long, terrible script, pathetic acting",2,2 December 2009,"If I was to point out one major problem with this film, I couldn't. There are simply way too many major problems to settle on one! But possibly the over-arching problem is that it used way too many end-of-the-world formulas and plot devices. In fact, it strived to ensure that none were left out.We had: 1) An last second escape as the world is collapsing around them.... Well in fact we had that about nine times. Worse still, I think they took off in a plane while the runway collapsed three times in total. 2) A madman predicting the end of the world, proves to be right and plays a role in the survival of others. But the question remains: what was Woody thinking signing up for this crap ?3) An unsuspecting hero.4) The hero back helping his ex escape just as disaster strikes and winding up back in a relationship with her at the end.5) A lovable cuddly character who dies tragically. (Yuri)6) A pet that was unnecessarily saved. 7) A completely unnecessary dramatic emergency right at the end where our hero survives a suicide mission and saves the day.8) An expert no one would believe until it was almost too late.9) A president with no first lady (aka ID4 and Deep Impact) who is overly sentimental and pulls an enormously patriotic act.10) Interconnecting characters - notice how so many of the characters intersect before disaster strikes.11) An almost semi-evil, overly ruthless government player. Oliver Platt's character traits were unnecessary and the stand off he has with geological expert in front of world leaders at the end was cringe worthy and embarrassing. 12) Implausibility - with days of warning, we expect airforce one to be loaded with fuel. But the president stays behind, the vice president is caught somewhere at dies, the speaker of the house...well... he's running late.. So that of course, leaves the world in the hands of Oliver Platt. 13) Father reconnecting with children despite the relationship being rocky at the start.The only different thing about this film was that the film makers had no issue killing off certain characters you would expect to live and keeping alive those you thought would die. The should have drowned Platt. Yet I was expecting the survival of Yuri, the Russian pilot, Yuri's little blonde chic. I also expected the ex-wife's new boyfriend to survive, though I suppose it make it easier for the hero to get back together with his ex-wife if the current boyfriend is crushed and squashed between two rotors! By the end of the film, I wished those two rotors crushed and squashed up the producers, scripwriters, actors and any other significant film maker involved in this pile of utter crap. And lord almighty what was way too long. I don't think any of that film ended up on the cutting room floor. To be honest, most of it should.",2012
256,MovieZoo,2012: Mayans knew 2012 would be the disaster film to end all disaster films,8,13 November 2009,"Once I saw the first trailer, I knew the movie was going to be exactly what the trailer told us it would be. One disaster after another with people dying and certain people just escaping death by a hair. If you really expect to see a mystery then forget it. On second thought, go anyway, this movie is fun for fun's sake.I can't even remember if the Mayans were mentioned, but they may have been. There! There's your Mayan fix. The Mayans were mentioned. Now sit back and enjoy the long wild ride.A spectacular film, the lucky ones only have to keep running and dodging. You have to hold your breath longer than is humanly possible while the actors do all the work. Images of concrete and glass flying all around while intense audio nearly blasts you out of your seat and grabs your attention and shakes it til your bones rattle. Family tragedies are used as a buffer to slow things down a bit but not for long. 2012 is one excellent fun film. But it is not for fans of great acting.I have no problem with any of the acting because even though none were great, none of them distracted from the movie. 2012 is like but better than other tragedy films in a big way. Compare it to Poseidon, Day After Tomorrow, Deep Impact if you want, but none come close to being as fun and spectacular as 2012.A free from thought movie, I give it an 8",2012

259,Caps Fan,One of the laziest films I have ever seen,2,25 November 2009,"I always try to begin my film commentaries with something positive, so let's start here by saying the special effects are magnificent. Unfortunately, that should be a given these days, so it doesn't count for much in the movie's favor.In every other respect, except financially, this movie is an abject failure. The story is basically a rerun of the same director's (much more entertaining) ""The Day After Tomorrow"", with another disaster, general environmental disintegration, replacing the new ice age of that earlier effort.This might not matter too much if the story were well handled, peopled with engaging/plausible characters, or well acted, but it is none of those things. Instead, we have a number of cardboard cutouts going through the motions of interaction, using worldwide catastrophe as an opportunity to work out their personal issues by babbling the most jaded of clichés.The most infuriating of these scenarios is between the trio of our ""hero"" Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and her new man Gordon (Tom McCarthy). Jackson redeems himself in Kate's eyes with heroics of the kind towards which he has previously shown no inclination. Gordon is then conveniently killed off and, seemingly, completely forgotten within minutes. A pity really because at least McCarthy seemed to be making an effort. Cusack in particular barely seems to be awake much of the time and Peet is just plain dreadful.The only actor who emerges more or less unscathed from this mess is Woody Harrelson. His comic turn as a kind of apocalyptic shock jock, killed while watching the Yellowstone caldera erupt as a giant volcano, breathes some much needed life into the early scenes.I haven't mentioned the music, but it isn't really worth mentioning. All in all, then, it looks like Roland Emmerich just called up the script for ""The Day After Tomorrow"" on his computer, changed a couple of the selections, then filmed whatever came out. The result is awful to contemplate.Rating: 2/10.",2012
260,DrTuvok,Puts the disaster into disaster movie.,1,9 June 2020,"Okay, spoilers here. The movie starts out okay, with the world ending, everyone's going to die, etc. It starts to feel like the ultimate disaster movie, if a bit corny with all the neutrinos and Mayans. (Also, count the number of sequences where John Cusack is in a vehicle moving really fast with all the ground behind him breaking up as if saying, ""So long, you won't be needing me anymore!"").Then.After two hours, in one of the most flagrant displays of Chinese butt-kissing in an industry currently rife with it, we learn that the clever Chinese have built giant arcs to save humanity while the rest of the world was flailing their arms and wailing in panic. The main character (John Cusack, somehow looking less washed-up then he really is) and his family, who have already witnessed everyone they know get killed, weasel their way onto the difficult-to-get-onto Chinese arks and it's here when you start pleading ""No, Roland Emmerich. Please don't do this.""Too late, and he does. The Chinese arks, after a lot of meaningless drama, save everyone who could afford them, and they all has a happy ending. Except for the innumerable people killed before, yeah, they suck. What makes this even worse is that all the people who live at the end, (John Cusack excluded), were specifically depicted as those who were able to buy their survival. This is beyond despicable at worst and fairly annoying at best. Saving a couple of Chinese workers in the process does not fix the fact that this movie makes a spectacle of helpless people getting squashed and swallowed up by earth and then expects you to cheer when a bunch of billionaires survive.Wait a minute, that's not my main complaint. THE WORLD DOESN'T EVEN FREAKING END IN THIS MOVIE!! Even Knowing was better than this! Looks like the Mayans were pretty silly for predicting the end of the world only for Africa to stay undamaged. (Wakanda probably had a little storm, maybe a tornado.) And wait, how exactly are all the billionaires going to cope with survival afterwards?",2012

262,TheSeaLion,A disaster with every element,1,6 August 2013,"Isn't it poetic? A disaster film is itself a disaster. ""2012"" is another end of the world/destruction movie that Roland Emerich has become infamous for. Even though his films before were not that great, they did not feel like they had to be force fed to the audience like this film did.While it has amazing visuals of an earthquake breaking up Los Angeles and several thousand foot tidal waves that toss around Air Force One and the U.S.S John F. Kennedy, the disaster is also with the characters and the story.The characters are laughably one dimensional and boring. The expression of the family is the same as ours when Gordon or anyone else dies. We're left sitting there going, ""Okay, he's dead. No big deal."" They expect us to be sad for characters that were more of semi-antagonistic characters and to just be okay over the death of a character we have spent the whole time watching.The story is nothing more than a coincidence after a coincidence. Yes, other films have coincidences in them to move the plot along like C-3PO and R2-D2 being picked by the Lars Family in ""Star Wars"", but coincidence is the whole reason for the family's survival. They get a plane and Gordon is luckily a pilot. They fly to Las Vegas where they meet up with our main protagonist Jackson's boss Yuri who will not bring them with until he finds out he needs a second pilot so he has to pick Gordon. They are going to crash land but the earth shifts several thousand miles so they crash right by where the arks are being built and run luckily find a family whose son is on the arc who decide to pick them up. Then, Jackson can luckily hold his breath for ten minutes to dislodge an object that got stuck in the ark's door gear which was preventing the ark from turning on.The acting is awful as well. Not much else to say with acting but on another note, there is no tension in the film. The escape from Los Angeles basically destroys that because we see how invincible the family is. The second they pull out of their driveway, the earthquake is right behind them and there is not one second where they almost fall into the cracks. The second they leave the road to get around a car with stereotypical slow old ladies driving, the road in front of them falls apart. They manage to dodge a bunch of falling cars and get through a collapsing building with it barely scraping the roof of their car. The closest thing to tension that there is is the plane losing the landing gear in Vegas and then them crash landing because for one second, you think the plane might survive. At least there was about forty-five seconds of tension in the film about the all out destruction of earth.To add insult to injury, one of the worst lines in cinema history is uttered right at the end of the film.",2012

Like some others, I rented this for sheer kicks. I got kicked, all right. From John Cusack - apparently Hollywood's poster boy for divorced, cynical writers who come through at the end - desperately trying to stay afloat in absolutely horrific dialogue (yes, his ex takes a moment as the world is ripping apart to remind him that he had 'blocked' his family), to Woody Harrelson's awful acting as the crackpot who knows the truth - and you just know he's howling with glee at having been paid a lot of money to do this junk - to pseudo-scientific rationales that choose to utterly ignore how the erupting of Yellowstone alone would plunge the Earth into years of darkness, to insulting racial stereotypes like you would not believe, to the ultimate infuriation of the leads embracing in meaningful relationship babble as seconds remain to fix the ark before everybody's doomed...it's all one extravagant and unwatchable mess.

I sometimes like conspiracy theory films, such as films like the X-Files.This film started out like Independence Day meets The Day After Tomorrow, films that are way better scripted than this. I felt as I watched this I was witnessing great actors such as John Cusack, Oliver Platt, and Danny Glover take a step down from how great they are. I really don't understand how and why they would take this role, I truly do not understand it.On a positive note the special effects were astounding, the only downside was that the effects were tied in with unbelievable writing. We watch Mr. Cusack hire a pilot to avoid the catastrophes, then when they arrive at the airport to take a plane to get away from it all, the pilot is dead or knocked unconscious. Now left to save Cusack's separated family is the new boyfriend of Cusack's now estranged wife to save the day. This man states that he had only a couple of flying lessons, but manages to fly around crashing skyscrapers and flaming balls of molten rock. Wow I wish I was that good! Finally, this film is a great ride if your into unbelievable situations preformed by normal everyday people. If you believe the world should of ended in 2012, then why am I still here in 2013? This was a great money grabber for Hollywood. It had great special effects with a bad script and excellent acting from the main stars. This recipe is destined for a disaster so to speak.The film is filled with American bravery from the President staying with the sinking ship of the United States of America(ya, right), to such laughable scenes of normal people going through the rat race of California streets collapsing around them. I think personally James Bond wouldn't even of survived this madness of a film.The score of the film was below par and done before, the shots of the film we have all seen before, the story seems way too familiar and beaten to death as we view this end of the world scenario. I will never watch this again, and will never recommend it to anyone. What a waste of actor talent and time. Disgusting. 2/10 for me, and the two stars go to the effects people and the actors. The writers should be fired from making any future motion pictures ever again.One last note: When trying to save humanity from the end of the world make sure your you don't drop your drill in the gears of the ocean vessel your trying to save. Because this one thing is the reason why everything could end, all because of one hand held power drill. What a joke! Tears are streaming from my eyes thinking about destroying Hollywood writers. This film is a mess. I also feel bad for Mr. Woody Harrelson, hoping he at least got a good paycheck from this load of cow manure.",2012
265,das417,Melodramatic movie that is everything it promised to be,7,13 November 2009,"The end of the world is upon us again and this time humanity's greatest enemy happens to be the sun, the earth's crust, and some tsunami waves that have the power to destroy entire countries. 2012 is the latest mega disaster movie using the best special effects centered upon a melodramatic plot that is everything one expected it to be. While this isn't necessarily bad, it doesn't make a great movie.Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is another dad struggling to come close to his kids Noah (Liam James), and Lily (Morgan Lily), even though they now live with their mother Kate (Amanda Peet) and her new doctor boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy). The relationship between Jackson and his estranged family is what one would expect between a father trying to do the right thing and a mother hoping that her ex will at least remember to pick them up when he's supposed to. Jackson himself is a struggling writer whose lack of fame and books sold has only further weakened his already low self esteem.As if Jackson's problems weren't enough, it turns out that humanity is facing its final days. Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Washington politician Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) discover that the world is going to be destroyed through a series of solar flares and massive weakening of the earth's crust. Helmsley, ever the humanist, sees a chance to try to help everyone while Anheuser sees only the possible diplomatic problems and financial problems that trying to save humanity would bring. They are two sides of the same coin facing a problem that threatens the whole world. The solution, it is hoped, is the construction of a series of massive ships that will contain the best (that is the rich enough to afford a seat) of humanity and remaining animal life. 2012 never explains how such a low number of survivors, especially those who are rich and spoiled, could save humanity, but it works at least for this kind of plot. 2012 follows a predictable plot with scenes of cities being destroyed, floods wiping out entire continents, and massive amounts of CGI death. While impressive on a big screen, the plot itself wears thin half way through. Of course we know that Jackson will reunite with his family and that there will be a spectacular ending that of course will defy all logic. The amount of scientific nonsense during the first half of the movie was enough to make one think that 2012 really should have been a cartoon. The fact that Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser both decided to focus on father trying to redeem himself to his family during the end of the world is less than original. Focusing on the struggles of Dr. Helmsley at least would have given some more intellectual and moral depth to the plot. Not a bad movie, but 2012 isn't more than one would expect it to be. In reality, the only reason to watch it is because of the CGI and not because of some deep scientific or moral idea. A disaster movie yes, but nothing really more.7/10",2012

Sometimes a film is so bad, it's good. Sometimes a film is so bad that it is painful.This film was so bad, that it was good. It was absurd, preposterous, over the top, and absolutely without any merit of intelligence what so ever.The gags were repeated for the sheer fact of filler space because of the lack of any real content. Literally, Three different death defying car/chase sequences with three totally different cars. Three death defying chase sequences with two different airplanes. And one death defying chase scene with a boat.One idiotic cliché after the other, silly little sight gags and about 45 minutes way too long.But you know what? In the end we laughed our collective @$$es off it was so funny. And in the parking lot the best that could be said was that it was better then the made for TV movie ""Aftershock"" done by Hallmark.A movie like this you certainly don't go for the intelligence, you go for a brain stew.

A lot of people have bombed on it, and now I understand why.Setting aside the special effects (which were great, I admit,) we must turn to the special defects, primarily the ocean of trite, sentimental mush. Parents are separated, dad's distant because he's busy with his career, wifey has found a new guy, the kids are as distant to their birth dad as he is to his family (in order to force this point down our throats, the son routinely calls dad by his first name, just so we won't imagine they're close or anything.).Then things start to fall apart worldwide. There is a lovable radio-talk nutcase who is, of course, right about everything that's about to happen; the family (including dad 2, who possesses invaluable skills) are swept-up in these terrifying events, and by the end humanity is kind of sort of saved, dad 2 is nobly sacrificed to open the role of paterfamilias to the birth dad, and the family unit is back together, all huggy-wuggy and ready to embark on the bold new adventure ahead!Of course we have the obligatory ""what makes us human we can't leave all those people to die"" speech and a scientist involved in a secondary romance; we also get the seemingly heartless politician who, in my opinion, is really the voice of common sense.I hate this film, and I won't be watching it again.

The story is mediocre as it was a little bit predictable and it didn't feel strong enough. The setup for the movie is basically ""run over there, oh no disaster, escape, run over here, oh no disaster, escape"" and doesn't really change for about two to three hours. The acting was alright but I thought that it could have been better in some scenes. John Cusack played his role as writer Jackson Curtis very well and Woody Harrelson was fantastic as Charlie Frost. However, there were a few scenes when the other actors weren't very convincing as their characters, I thought they could have done a better job. The characters were poorly written, they could have definitely been written better as you didn't feel so involved in the movie to care for them enough. The script was quite cheesy and the writing felt a little bit like your average disaster movie and nothing special or out of the ordinary. The cinematography is brilliantly done and the direction is very good from Roland Emmerich but it's nothing like Independence Day. In saying this, it's quite good fun.In the first half an hour to forty-five minutes, the movie was running smoothly and was great to watch but then slowly after that, it just turned into a CGI-obsessed movie for me. It just screamed ""Look, we're not going to follow the story but here's some amazing CGI!"" in my face. Don't get me wrong, I thought the CGI was absolutely beautiful to the eye and terrifyingly realistically detailed but if the movie had a great story as well as the CGI, then this movie would have been more memorable. The only way I will remember this movie is the CGI and not for the acting or the characters or the story. I must admit after watching the trailer, I thought that 2012 would be a mind-blowing experience but yet again, it's a case of 'the trailer's better than the movie'. Yes, the CGI is fantastically mind-blowing and could be impressive for some people but for this reviewer to be impressed, it would have to have a great story to grip you. It should also have plenty of nice twists and turns that you wouldn't see coming, 2012 unfortunately didn't really deliver this as I found most of the story and the ending to the story predictable. In saying this, it's worth watching for the CGI and the action scenes as it really is stunning and probably makes up for the lack of story.",2012

I can hardly fault them for what was written into the script but a barf bag should have been provided for stunts like the President suddenly deciding to stay behind and the science adviser risking the survival of the human race for what was a drop in the bucket group when billions had already died.Worth seeing for the utterly spectacular disaster special effects, even if many of them are tongue in cheek as when the novice pilot flies a plane through the collapsing buildings of Santa Monica.

272,DeanNYC,The (Somewhat) Intentionally Comedic Apocalypse!!!,4,25 December 2009,"If you have seen any of Roland Emmerich's previous work, and based on the box office numbers worldwide, you likely have, you know what to expect with a film from him that promises ""The End Of The World."" That's plenty of visuals that look like places you know getting destroyed by water, fire, lava and/or earth. For that, ""2012"" earns 3.5 of the 4 stars I gave it.The rest belongs to the comedy which I think was intentionally sprinkled throughout the script, guaranteed to keep this from ever getting too frightening. The idea here is a roller coaster ride, not a cautionary tale. As we follow the story of Jon Cusack's failed novelist, his ex wife (Amanda Peet) and his family, it's hard to take anything here very seriously, this despite the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as the competent and good-hearted lead scientist working to salvage what he can of the planet.The film first claims a palpable threat: the earth's core is suddenly heating up at a microwave rate and Ejiofor and his tiny group of scientists and some other officials in the money rich countries are fully aware of this. For something that is supposedly so top secret, quite a few people know what's happening, some are apparently killed passing this info around, and a failsafe system to prevent extinction of the most precious objects (like DaVinci's Mona Lisa) and most precious creatures on the planet (like giraffes and multi-billionaires) has been created by some secret coalition of nations.There has to be a ""town crier"" and Woody Harrelson does a cute job as some lunatic fringe radio talk host explaining exactly what is about to happen, but nobody believes him because he's simply out of his mind. The rest of the movie is just all of his unlikely predictions coming true.The film features plenty of sight gags, like the apocalypse chase scene with Cusack and family outracing the world's biggest sinkhole in his limo, and later in a tiny plane. And there are lots of winking references to other disaster films, like ""Titanic,"" when one of the massive ""arks"" designed to preserve the lives of humans and animals carves a sidelong cut into another one, effectively sinking it, ""Jaws,"" when Cusack says ""We're gonna need a bigger plane,"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" when he has to swim down and dislodge a rope, in a scene reminiscent of Gene Hackman's role in that earlier film among several others of this sort.Oliver Platt as a sketchy cabinet member mugs his way through this slog, a mix of jovial and menacing, Danny Glover as the President doesn't add much besides a calming break from the barrage of earthquakes and floods, and actresses Thandie Newton as Glover's First Daughter and Peet have practically nothing to do except react to what's happening, when they have any screen time at all. But, for a nice change of pace, we don't see New York City getting destroyed, typically the first choice of every film of this genre.The movie tries to make some statements about the value of life and family, and the importance of caring about each other, but that gets swept away by a tsunami of silly as we watch all of our man-made and natural creations, and the people we've crossed paths with along the way, getting taken down like so many bowling pins. Conversely, when you have characters as uninteresting as everybody but Woody's conspiracy theorist, you might start rooting for the disaster to take them all! Forget EVERYTHING you know about the Mayan calendar and/or anything you know about any of the life sciences, try to focus on the funny and you'll likely get at least some enjoyment out of this cataclysm.",2012

One moment it turns sickenly family values and the next funny as hell. What was the purpose of those slick comic lines, maybe relief so what audience was still watching would stay in their seats.On a science level this whole high tech Noah's Arc non-sensible flick was an F-. Neutrinos do not interact with matter much less cause a planet's core to melt.This movie was intended as entertainment for the not very bright and the not very old. I'm sure they would rate it at least a 7.The country and western music at the end which came way too late, tells what kind of audience the director was trying to reach.And by the way, if the world ever did end we could not be building arks, we would be building small space capsules with encoded DNA records for the life now all extinct.

But despite that, I still enjoyed this movie, its not a bad movie, it just could have been so much better than it is.I am a Science Fiction writer, and there were several things that I would have down sooooo... different.for one, I would have given this movie a proper movie title that would've given it a shelf life beyond 2012. I would have named it ""The Great Cancellation"" or something like that.secondly, I would have those Ark ships as Space ships (as the movies has us to believe until they actually find them)...yes, I would have made those space ships. Then I would have ended the movie with those space ships blasting off into space, the survivors would've watched from space as the Earth's crust melts into liquid magma.... then I would've ended it with those space ships floating through space towards destination unknown......If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with ""2012"" a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities.

275,the_bernie,This is just another run of the mill disaster movie,5,17 April 2021,"Looks like the Mayans were right. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is starting to put two and two together. Yep sunspots, neutrinos, and planet alignment spell kaput for the world. However, wait doomsayer Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) finds the governments of the world have found a way out. Can Curtis same his estranged family and the doctor/pilot that usurped his wife and half a dozen of other assorted characters? Alternatively, do they learn what dust to dust means? We hope this is not one of those wimpy movies wherein the end the people of the earth hold hands and sing Kumbayah.I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, you are treated to a seemingly endless Blu-ray and BD live commercial. Then you are bombarded with choices that have nothing to do with the film.

276,kevjfarrell,Worst disaster movie to date!!!,1,22 September 2015,"Shame on John Cusack for taking on the main role in this movie - must have needed for money!!! The storyline is ridiculous enough, but the CGI is really just laughable. I would like to think this movie was made as a spoof of this genre, but horrifyingly it wasn't!!! Every cliché in the book was featured in this movie - including risking personal life for the sake of a beloved dog!!!The acting is pretty dire from everyone! The movie really is an insult to most people's intelligence and should be avoided at all costs. I thought Jupiter Ascending was bad, but I'm not sure whether this one outdoes that!!!!! Personally I'm not going to waste my time pondering that thought!",2012
277,Manal1987,Utterly disappointed!,4,17 November 2009,"Have you seen Independence Day, Armageddon, or The Day After Tomorrow? Then there's no need for you to watch that one, unless state-of-the-art special effects really draw you in! 2012 is a typical apocalyptic movie, adding absolutely nothing to the myriad of movies tackling the same theme. Even the ""moral lesson"" that Emmerich forcibly interjected in the movie is cheesy, worn out, and naively delineated. The plot line drops more than once, and it is doltishly patched up; inexplicable events take place, characters weirdly behave, and Jackson Curtis (Cusack) miraculously survives deadly situations! Watching John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt and Thandie Newton was quite amusing,not because of their performance in the movie, but because they are good actors always fun to see on screen. Woody Harrelson and Thomas McCarthy were remarkable though; they managed to really stand out with their rib-tickling yet noteworthy performance.2012 is certainly not a waste of time, but it's not a movie to remember as well.",2012
278,urthpainter,entertainment above all else,8,10 February 2019,"2012 is a AAA Blockbuster, a popcorn eating summer film, a movie one watches for a single reason: Entertainment. 2012 immediately establishes a visual style that can transition from ordinary scenes to special effects sequences nearly flawlessly. Pace is very well managed, and all the scenes follow a logical tempo - depending upon the nature of the given content. In other words this film is well produce and well directed.2012 is a highly kinetic, outlandish natural disaster movie - that easily could be considered the best of this particular genre. The absurd, over the top nature of the special effects sequences has to be seen to be believed, and even more recent films like San Andreas are 2nd class compared to the audio visual display in this film.Casting and performances are way better than one would expect in this type of movie - for all the action and spectacle? The characters carry this film from scene to scene, with no weak links. There are some stand out performances by Woody Harrelson (short but sweet) and Tom McCarthy (who's strait guy act in insane situations is so convincing, it's easy to overlook his excellent performance throughout the film).While I'd consider this a movie the whole family can watch, there is an element of darkness in the content. While this movie isn't violent, implied violence occurs as a result of the disaster, regularly. Even the main characters face consequences, which is necessary to maintain the films tension.I'm a huge fan of the overall morality of this film. It overtly maintains an optimistic attitude, while tragedy occurs in every major scene. Perhaps this is because this isn't a serious film, but it is an interesting dynamic regardless. The film clearly takes sides in any science vs religion debate - taking the side of science, which is perhaps ironic? Because many very basic scientific principles are regularly broken in order for this film to work stylistically. Not to mention the title of this film presents mystical prophecy. Regardless, I appreciate how this film presents this argument through storytelling, right from the opening scene.I would say this movie gets off to a fantastic start, starting the tension off with big ideas. The first act is by far the best part of the movie. It's punctuated by (imo) one of the greatest special effect sequences ever created for the big screen. It relies heavily on computer graphic effects, and I think many viewers simply can not suspend enough disbelief to fully enjoy this scene, but if you can? Strap in! and enjoy the ride!There is another noteworthy action scene that lives up to the first, but other that that - the effects come when needed to show the spread of destruction and chaos. This would be my one major critique of the film. The best scenes are in the first couple acts, then the final act is more about individuals being brave in much smaller scale scenes. While this allows more focus on all the main characters, I'd rather have the mother of all spectacle scenes to end the film, actually trumping the scenes earlier in the film.But that may be a bit of a harsh critique, when really? This movie doesn't make any huge mistakes. The story is complete, characters are developed, and spectacular large scale scenes unfold in (somewhat) of a believable manner.One more comment on the special effects. In all of the large scale scenes, the way water, chunks of earth and buildings crash against each other? It looks... realistic! I mean, if a 5000 ton chunk of a mountain was thrown a mile in the air and landed 100 meters away you in reality? It would probably look and sound something like the special effects in this film! While this movie relies heavily on computer graphics, all of the CG has an actual depth, and the consistency of the lighting in the CG that is combined with live action shots? All I can say is the visual style of this film is quite the achievement.2012 was made for 200 million (quite a bargain, really) and made 150 million in the US and 550+ million overseas. So in a way 2012 is one of the movies that can be blamed for insipid AAA films that, attempting to gain the largest world audience, end up being an unwatchable mess to seasoned fans of films. But I would argue that movies like this and the original Charlies Angels had such great overseas success not because of universal appeal, but because they are examples of quality AAA films that emphasize entertainment above all other qualities. Great filmmaking still needs to occur! Emphasizing entertainment may cut some corners with logic and force an audience to suspend disbelief... but you can't make trash films like the Transformer sequels and then just expect they will succeed! And this is why I really appreciate 2012, and feel it holds up to multiple viewings. Regardless of its ridiculousness - 2012 contains a ton of quality film making.Entertainment! 8/10",2012
279,uncsbuddy91,Really good,7,17 April 2020,"The special effects were phenomenal. There were some parts that make you think, ""It wouldn't likely happen to that extent, but it's still really cool."" Would Jon Cusack's character have survived everything he did? Probably not. However, they put enough emotional intensity that you're able to look past it. I would say their biggest ""realism"" faux pas is outrunning the pyroclastic cloud. Those are very hot and very fast. Far faster than a human could run and faster than a plane that size could fly. The heat would probably have damaged or destroyed the plane even if it got off the ground. Jon's character might have survived the water submersion if he quickly found an air pocket. The kid cheered under the water, but still remained under for that long? I had to try to look past that. I'm sure there are other unrealistic parts, but those can be ignored for the sentiment of the story and the quality of the effects graphics.",2012
280,williamsonandcompany,Hard to watch anything with Cusack,5,23 August 2021,"When these actors get involved in politics and lose their minds of reality, it's hard to watch them act in anything. But this movie lack many things, including terrible acting on Cusack's part.",2012
281,cyclone259,Guilty pleasure,8,4 March 2010,"This movie is what it is, a terrible mess of CGI, overly dramatic schmaltz and has the honor of being an absurd, high-handed morality play. It's all of these things, but it's great fun. If you want a film with brilliance, depth and well-crafted dialog and a good plot, look elsewhere.I realize that watching a disaster movie like this, you'll probably be knocked down a few IQ points, be disbarred from Mensa and end up wearing a bib from all the drool, I still enjoyed it. Roland Emmerich is also responsible for other great fiasco's like 'Independence Day',' The Day After Tomorrow' and 'Godzilla' all of which had their fair share of cheese ball, over-the-top effects, throwaway lines and mostly forgettable characters.There's obviously a market for these types of films, because the movie-going public has been watching the world end in various ways for more than six decades. Up until the last 10 - 15 years though, the effects were usually not the centerpiece and they relied more on the localized, stark emotional after-effects of a major cataclysm than the huge, grand scale of it.If 2012 was trying to be anything else other than a 'popcorn' film I wouldn't be able to forgive just how unapologetically tacky it all is. Personally, I feel that this was step backward for John Cusack's career, but after seeing other projects in the future, I'm not sure that this was merely one step in a long march into the manure pile of b-movies and/or anything by Uwe Boll.",2012
282,MsMovie,How did they take the Mayan calendar paranoia and turn it into this awful movie?,6,14 March 2010,"I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because it really doesn't have a great story, I mean, the Mayan calendar ending in 2012 is a great story in itself and you'd think with that for inspiration this would have been a very disconcerting and scary look into the future. But no, it is just a bad disaster movie.SPOILER ALERT How many time can a person outrun the earth shattering and quaking beneath them? Apparently, John Cusack can do it about 6 times, and on the 3rd time he was in a plane that just narrowly made it off the ground and just narrowly missed buildings that were collapsing around it, well, I was talking to the screen by then and saying ""seriously? again?"" And can I just say the special effects weren't that great either, I have definitely seen better, and once you have seen one city crashing to the ground and one tidal wave, it's time for something new.I love John Cusack too - HE was the reason I wanted to see this movie, and to be truthful he was the only reason I watched until the end because his character (2 dimensional though it was), was the only one I actually cared enough about to see what happened.George Seagal (spelling may be wrong here!), but he was actually in this movie - no idea why, he had a trivial little part as an entertainer on a cruise ship. SPOILER COMING NOW - the cruise ship is in dock (right at the beginning of the movie), and it starts to rock wildly and in a very scary fashion before it leaves harbor - why would you not get off the boat? Seriously, no one in their right mind would stay on the boat after that, but no they stayed. There was some other trivial little aside where George calls his son who he doesn't speak to, but who really cared at all about that, it was inconsequential.SPOILER AGAIN - they wiped out LA at one point, but there didn't seem to be too much concern in other parts of the USA at that point, or the rest of the world, so it was all very emotionless at times, and that isn't what a good disaster movie is supposed to be about.In Independence Day we cared if the darn dog made it into the side tunnel - we cared about the crazy drunk crop spraying pilot - we cared about the president, etc.Danny Glover was wasted in this movie, as was Oliver Platt - they were almost cartoon like, cardboard characters with no depth at all.They should have concentrated on John Cusack's character and had him find out about the conspiracy theory (Woody Harrelson's cameo side story), find out about the arks, work at it that way and give you small pieces of the rest of the story and show the horror from his family's POV as they saw what was happening to the world.Instead, what we got was a hodge podge of set pieces, with so-so special effects (nothing we haven't seen before), a groan-worthy script, and a whole load of great actors who got hung out to dry by a director who seemed more concerned with destroying buildings, and blowing stuff up to make loud noises for the Dolby sound, than he was concerned about making a darned good story.Deep Impact was not a particularly good movie, and unfortunately 2012 is on the same par. I don't blame the actors, it's all Emmerich's fault and I hope someone else comes out with a movie about the same topic, since it is still relevant, and makes a real attempt to construct a story that will at once be terrifying in its possibilities and thoroughly entertaining.This is one movie definitely more deserving of a Redbox rental than a box office ticket!",2012
283,midge56,Exciting! Edge of your seat Thriller!!!,9,11 March 2010,"SPOILERS throughout! I don't know what movie the rest of these brain-fried people saw. I'm sure glad I watched the movie before reading their 3rd grade diatribes.This was one of the most excellent, thrilling, action-packed disaster movies I've ever seen. There's not a boring moment in the entire movie and has you on the edge of your seat every moment.It was a pleasure to finally see a disaster movie which is truly packed with disasters destroying the entire planet and every identifiable landmark instead of wasting time with ridiculous side stories. Most of the movie is through the viewpoint of global scientists, leaders and the struggle of one family to survive. I watched it for the disaster storyline, not their personal stories. When people complain about the lack of depth for the family, this is a disaster movie, not Sleepless in Seattle. If they had spent a lot of time on the personal issues of families, it would have ruined the movie and impeded the flow of suspense. I'm thankful they kept to the main core of the plot ""The destruction of the Earth!"" The entire movie was a fresh concept for global destruction. I was surprised to learn that these were not spaceships... although I think that would have been neat as well. However, it did not make as much sense for the two leaders which stayed behind, as it might have made if these had been interplanetary vehicles.While I understand the concept that no gov't would inform the population of such a cataclysmic event due to global panic and violence which would ensue from the very type of people who wrote those ridiculous critiques many could have survived via ships or high altitudes if they had known planetary flooding was the main issue.You can also bet the wealthy, famous and chosen few would be the ones to get the seats. It isn't pretty, but unfortunately, realistic (as was the elimination of anyone who threatened to spill the beans). However, I doubt the escape ships would have all been in China. Each country would have had their own assembled at their respective black ops sites, under their control.It was obvious the person in charge of the plane flight scenes had no knowledge of aerodynamics or piloting. Planes simply cannot fly like that and would have stalled and crashed within minutes. However, it did not make it any less exciting. Having had about the same amount of flying skills, I did share Gordon's horrific predicament at being expected to fly a plane he had never trained for. That part was realistic but I doubt he would have managed that well under those conditions. However, it didn't dampen the excitement of the scenes.Same with the unbelievable driving scenes where no vehicle could survive the bizarre destruction sequences. Yet, no less exciting even though we knew it was over the top. We were still on the edge of our seats all the way.On the ""divorced family being saved by the part time dad"" issue it has been overused from Day after Tomorrow and War of the Worlds, so the theme is too repetitious. I would have opted to save Gordon in this scenario since he was the one who earned the family's love & respect.You can also bet that the cell phones and electricity would not be working and there would have been in a lot more panic. But our beloved media & political circus would have certainly been making jokes chastising everyone for making a big deal out of nothing (as depicted) while the planet was disintegrating beneath their feet. Have to keep the masses calm no matter what.The officials also seemed to be unreasonably blind as to what was occurring globally when they had access to hundreds of orbiting satellite systems. It took these survivors a month to find out that one of the continents had not flooded, (despite the supertech ops center they had?) I would have opted to flood all of the continents. I would not have left any landmass untouched because that really changed the dynamics.I would also have also opted for a simple discovery of the father alive on his ship without the alternate ending discourse. Tsunami's are not as bad at sea as they are near a coast, so it is likely large ships out at deep sea would have faired quite well. The film's research on realistic effects was a bit thin.Opening the gates of the ships at the last moment was in poor judgment. If they had done so earlier, it would have been OK, but to wait until the tidal wave was on the way was most definitely not the smartest thing to do with humanity at stake.It would have been better with the president all the way to the end. The SS would not have left him. They would have taken him by force if necessary to save him and the continuity of gov't.Even with these improvements I would have opted for, I still loved the movie. It was a great disaster film! Don't listen to these brain-fried low brows who were probably dragged away from their favorite sports game and beer, etc., by their families and forced to watch the movie. Their lack of education and mentality are obvious just by reading their mindless attempts to attack the director and film to get revenge for missing their TV sports; It was obvious just by the time of year this film was released. The reviews improved as soon as football season was over. That should tell you something about the hostility & validity of those holiday reviews.",2012
284,scheelj,Hold onto your popcorn,6,14 April 2012,"See it -This epic disaster flick has some of the most impressive special effects you will ever see. There are multiple scenes that will make you jump off the couch and spill your popcorn. Dare I venture to say it is even a ground-breaking film? Sure, why not. This film is made up of several different disasters, and each one puts its reigning genre kingpin to shame. For instance, the volcano scene is better than ""Dante's Peak,"" the flood is better than the ""Day After Tomorrow,"" the tidal wave is better than ""Poseidon,"" and the earthquake is better than, well, ""Earthquake."" Sure, you may get a little annoyed with the number of near-death experiences the characters miraculously escape from time after time, but this movie entertains on such a grand scale that it is a must-see for everyone at some point in their life. 3.5 out of 5 action rating",2012
285,Mr_PCM,Bonkers,8,15 January 2011,"Overblown, over-dramatic, ridiculous, and absolutely ludicrous – this is probably the best way to describe Roland Emmerich's latest offering. It is a sentiment that even NASA agrees with, as 2012 was named as the most absurd science fiction film of all time. Comedian Dara O'Briain has taken the opportunity to poke fun at the lunacy of the plot and science behind it. North Korea even banned the film for ridiculing such an important year for the country. Yet if you just accept the madness, then 2012 is a tremendously fun and entertaining film.The 'plot' stems from some scientific idiocy which isn't worth explaining, and leads to the planet pretty much blowing itself up, with multiple volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis devastating the world. What follows is the typical mass panic, and everyday people stepping to the fore. John Cusack stars as Jackson Curtis, a novelist turned limo driver who races against the planet exploding all around him in order to save his family and get them to safety in China. At the same time, the governments pontificate about what to do and try to look heroic and selfless while doing it. Yet Cusack is not outdone by his costars, including Danny Glover as the heroic President, Chiwetel Ejiofor as the scientist trying to warn the government, Amanda Peet as the hero's ex-wife, and the ever-watchable Oliver Platt as the slime-ball chief of staff trying toseize the opportunity. All the characters you would expect. Nothing complicated about it.But for Roland Emmerich, it is not the plot that he likes to complicate, but the special effects. For it is this that really makes 2012 such a viewable and entertaining film. Emmerich has always liked his set-piece detonations of landmarks (White House and Statue of Liberty in Independence Day, the Hollywood sign in Day After Tomorrow) but he really raises the bar this time, with some quite mind-blowing special effects scenes that make his previous efforts look like small-budget indies! Volcanoes erupting and causing entire continents to shift and fall into the sea is ambitious, even for Emmerich, but the scenes are exhilarating and spectacular; genuine 'wow' moments that are what the cinema was made for in the first place. Obviously at the same time you will be screaming 'as if!' at the screen, or rolling your eyes like marbles as various forces of nature propel vehicles, people and landmasses across the screen, but that all adds to the fun. It is simply wonderfully stupid!However, while the dialogue is corny and clunky, the characters are stereotypical and one-dimensional, with little interesting about them, and the plot, for all the wonderful explosions, is predictable and by the numbers, it is surprisingly edge-of-the-seat. Much fun could be made about the frequent 'just in the nick of time' nature of escapes, and lava moving at a very convenient (and strangely variable) pace, but then realism isn't exactly the film's strong suit! If you enjoy typical average disaster films then 2012 is certainly worth seeing, as it is a disaster film that is above average, particularly visually. The film has no pretensions about what it is, so audiences should certainly not be disappointed. The lack of depth to the characters make it difficult to fully engage and invest emotionally in the film, but in terms of visual thrills, 2012 is brilliant, adrenaline-pumping fun.",2012
286,movieman89-2,"Great fun, especially on the big screen",8,27 November 2009,"I went to see this not long after it came out. I saw the trailer and thought it looked really good. Also I found out it's by Emmerich, so I thought I've got to see it. After seeing it thought it was plain good fun.The story is interesting and still keeps you connected. A bit of a slow start, but it does kick in soon.To be honest I thought it lacked character connectivity.There was a few scenes which I thought was very cheesy and a bit daft. They should of cut down the car jumping scenes. Also they shouldn't have put in the large plain taking off at the last minute scene.Overall, its good film for excellent special effects and action. I wouldn't say it was as good as The Day after Tomorrow but still a good watch if you like disaster movies.",2012
287,JRmf,Not bad but certainly not exceptional,6,26 February 2010,"The main thing which attracted me (a SF addict) to this movie was the prospect of seeing the Earth crack open BIG-TIME like a nut, as depicted in Greg Bear's novel ""The Forge Of God"", the entire surface of the planet ultimately turning molten with only those escaping to space surviving.As usual I was misguided - movies which literally depict the wholesale destruction of Planet Earth probably do not go down too well with movie studios or audiences - and instead was treated to some severe fracturing of the Earth's crust, much worse than any earthquake to date I concede, but not at all like what I envisaged.Certainly the special effects depicting the above were first rate. The overall story was reasonable though nothing especially memorable. What did get me though was the number of narrow escapes from being crushed by collapsing massive structures or colliding therewith, surely defying the laws of statistics and probably physics. This spoilt the movie for me as they made it impossible to ignore the fact that one was simply watching CGI and virtual happenings within a computer, completely divorced from reality.Anyway another SF yarn for the collection 6/10 (at best)",2012

The acting, granted, was a little rusty and you could expect better from the talent involved; the little girl Lilly, played by a very young Morgan Lily was probably the worst of the bunch, the girl can't act and was constantly getting on my nerves, coming across as a spoiled brat.There were probably better actors to take on the lead role of Jackson Curtis rather than John Cusack, but he did his best and gave what I believe to be the finest performance of the whole film. On another note, what's with the name Jackson Curtis, sounds more like a rapper! Overall the film felt rushed, but that isn't exactly a bad thing, when the world is coming to an end and everyone's dying except for the privileged few, every last thing in that world is going to be rushed, everyone is going to be at panic stations not knowing what to do for the best; so the quick pace of the film and the action added to the tension and realism. I put 2012 up there alongside Independence Day as my favourite disaster films, it really is fun to watch, so ignore all the pessimistic reviews slating the film for one reason or another, and just sit down and enjoy 2012 for what it is.",2012

OK, there are possibly used almost every special effect available nowadays. Quite large number of special effects were actually pretty good. But why is it still so awful? Let me tell you, it's just so stupid. The way the main characters always get away at the last second, while everything destroys around them, is just too much 'oh-my-god-how-lucky' stuff. But the worst thing is the out of nowhere taken so called 'jokes'. These weren't even close to funny. Totally out of context. Like you drink hot tea while you are in the beach on a sunny day. It just don't match.The acting is horrible here. Why, John Cusack? You're much better than this crap. I just say that you are warned. Avoid 2012. Not the year, but the movie.

I hated Independence Day and feared this would be worse, happily enough i left the cinema feeling moderately entertained. The special effects are the selling power of this film. Although Danny Glover was pretty good as the President. John Cusack was actually good as well. The tidal wave sequences are quite frightening (just like in the teaser trailer) and the earthquake sequences are fantastic. In terms of action its about survivors escaping disaster after disaster until suspension of disbelief is at breaking point. You'll like this film if you liked The Day After Tomorrow, but personally if given a choice id rather go and see Earthquake on the big screen.Cal",2012
292,garyvanhorn,I generally dislike disaster films and this is no exception,3,12 January 2011,"Perhaps I'm not being fair to this piece of crap, but really, blowing up the planet is getting old. Sure they tacked on a different explanation and change the faces but the movie might as well be a clone of every other disaster movie. If you like things blowing up in spectacular fashion then you might be OK, if you want anything else from your movie, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I'm also curious just how many near-misses and lucky coincidences I can reasonably be expected to buy in a 2 1/2 hour film (we couldn't have sped up the destruction of the planet just a tiny bit?). As far as physics goes....well light still seemed to work like it's supposed to, but other things, like inertia and gravity, seemed to have been turned off for this film. Sometimes disaster movies are actually watchable and even enjoyable, this film was neither. Dear Hollywood, stop blowing up the Earth and go back to burning skyscrapers, capsized ships, and tornadoes for more meaningful and believable disaster films, Love Gary.",2012
293,rogerdob,Worst Movie of 2009,2,13 November 2009,This is indeed the worst movie of 2009. The only thing going for this film is the special effects and even those get tiring after an hour. There is no logic used in this film...everything thing happens just because the director and writer want it to happen. Yellowstone Park is only 8 hours away from Los Angeles...everyone one on the east coast is calm while the entire Pacific coast has met unbelievable disaster...cell phones still work even though most of the world is destroyed...our hero constantly outruns every disaster that is facing him. Nothing is believable in this film. And it is 2 1/2 hours long! There are several subplots that could have easily been deleted from the film to make it 90 minutes. Nothing makes sense in this movie. The director of this movie should never be allowed to make another movie!!!,2012
294,andro-dolic,Effective but not enjoyable,6,14 March 2010,Director of Independence Day made more one disaster movie . On first sight it is maybe some classical adventure but it isn't . once you see it you don't want to see it next time . Great effects can really be outstanding but you can see that it is only part of movie . Movie isn't boring but you cannot enjoy in every scene . The problem in this movie is that it hasn't got soul . It is empty in some parts and you maybe won't like it because of its plot which is not connected . Movie is full of some parts which I can't stand . I know that many opinions about this movie will be very different but I cannot say it is great but I really liked visual effects . They are my best part of this movie. Reason because I wrote that it is enjoyable that it is exciting but in wrong way . Sometimes I think that it is not enjoyable to watch this movie more than 150 minutes . This is fact which is making me nervous about this movie .,2012

This movie had such a great potential but they managed to ruin it quite successfully. The Jackson Curtis character was actually the most ruining factor from my point of view but I didn't find the story convincing as well. Especially, escaping from tectonic crack was pathetic, the airplane scenes were ultra unrealistic and the flood was certainly not studied well. How on earth a flood can reach Everest. Hello, tsunami and flood are different things. Even if you shut down your brain and try to enjoy, the plot is drifting from one little irrelevant point to another. A shorter version with less characters and story from the eyes of Adrian Helmsley character could have been much better. I am sick of this crazy genius author who has the most advanced intellectual skills as well as the physical strength of a super hero character. Hollywood needs to find another way of story telling.

I didn't expect much of a Roland Emmerich movie in terms of story or character depiction. But this is just ludicrous, even for his standards. This movie only lives of its visuals, why did he bother to include any story at all?! The worst is, that the characters are pretty much recycled from ""The day after tomorrow"" with only minor changes. The different nations are portrait in a horribly stereotypical and clichéd way you'd only expect an American director to do. And the dialogs... Oh god, the dialogs! My favorite was the quote of the chief of staff of the white house criticizing the climate expert with ""Do you want to responsible for the extinction of humanity? Can you live with this?!"" That line was either a genius easter egg of the writers or simply the irony of bad writing. We'll never know.If you can bear your intelligence being insulted like this, go and watch it.

I guess just to say I got through it.I knew it would be idiotic, but I thought at least it might be fun, and it could have been if they'd kept it to a reasonable length. They didn't have enough ideas to fill a two and a half hour movie, so they just ended up repeating things: cars driving over crumbling roadways, planes taking off from crumbling runways, big waves coming in, etc. There were really only a handful of things that kept happening over and over again. The special effects were considered pretty impressive when the movie came out, but less than ten years later, they just look cheap and fake, and the whole thing feels like you're watching someone else play a video game. Too bad to be good, and too full of itself to be ""so bad it's good"". Just a waste of two and a half hours.",2012
300,brownah18,Highly spectacular and the most exciting end of the world movie I have seen yet.,8,17 November 2009,"Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) goes underground 1100 feet in India to be shown by his good friend Gurdeep (Raj Lal) to find out there is major sizemic activity. The water goes down six feet and has started to boil also. Helmsey then goes to Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) an adviser of the president to show him the activity. Anheuser then tells Helmsey he reports anything he finds to him and him only. The President of the United States Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) then begins to talk to the leaders of the other countries about six months ago he was aware of activities happening which is so devastating that it will bring this world as we know it to an end. Throughout the world people are preparing for the worst including making plans to keep their family safe.Destruction of the world is a frightening thing and is a really devastating thing when you bring families and friends into the scenario. When life is very important in this situation, everyone goes a little chaotic as shown with the character Carl Anheuser. The person I didn't expect in this movie was Woody Harrelson who shined in his short but important role in this movie. Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor had the main leading roles in this movie and was exciting to see them in this one. The special effects are off the charts in this movie, the last time I saw something like this was in The Day After Tomorrow which this movie definitely outdoes that one which is the same Director actually. It could not have all happened without the great work from Ronald Emmerich who has also directed other action packed movies The Patriot, Independence Day, and 10,000 B.C.",2012

If you're making an end-of-the-world movie, maybe just forget the comedy and stick with believable special effects and building your characters a little bit. They really threw everything in this mess which wasted what could have been an epic disaster flick. The whole family dynamics thing was just too cliche, with the disaffected son who learns to love his real dad again and the wife who comes back to the poor writer dad, even though step-dad is a good guy himself.

And a planetary alignment will not break apart the earth's crust. Rifts are actually quite harmless. But as usual it follows the formula. Mass destruction, bad acting and some random White American family survives. 2 and a half hours of this kind of gave me a migraine. I still like the effects though. Thought it was pretty cool. Honestly you could tell that 90 % of the shots were CG so the actors had no clue of what they were actually running away from, hence the bad acting. To get the true sense of the film, if the kids actually saw the city cave in, they would be leaking their pants. Now that would be an Oscar performance.",2012
304,mrspasm,"2012: If climate change doesn't get you, the future will!",6,7 January 2010,"It is a well known fact that some idiots believe the world will end on 21st Dec 2012. This is due to an age old series of prophecies written by the Mayans of South America. Now, they were a crazy bunch alright, crazy smart. Better mathematicians than Carol Vorderman, better space staring guys that Patrick Moore, smarter physicists than Stephen Hawkwing. They understood the galaxy and time, dates, calendars. They knew which day certain galactic events like eclipses etc would take place, hundreds of years before we could work it out. They built massive buildings and pyramids dedicated to such practices- buildings which on a certain hour of a certain day, in a certain year sunlight would penetrate and create wonderful shadows and pictures. Naturally with all these skills it is believed they could predict future events. As we live in a time of fear and nonsense one out of every one fools believes that the world is going to end one way or another, and probably soon. The Mayans say 2012, and some say every prediction they have made has come true. Of course the predictions themselves are as follows: 'When the smiling Devil Bird has turned 58 thousand times the grass will eat the land, and the Jaguar will have a corn bride'. Naturally this can be translated as the rise of Hitler. I have been to various temple and have spoken to many Mayan who now practice Christianity and laugh at such claims. The only prediction they made to me was that I would give them 5 dollars for a fertility statue. They were wrong. I have recently been making a few generous predictions of my own which I am confident will come true. Read into them what you may: Somewhere, some time on the 14th February 2014, there will be an episode of The Simpsons shown on TV; Madonna will be dead 150 years from now; When the Spac Twins reach four figure viewings on Youtube there will be a great cheer of despair; this film will make more than 137 Dollars at the Box Office on November 15 2009.Of course such fairy tales make for great films- and by great I mean balls. Roland 'The Rat' Iamrich has taken another end of the world scenario and turned it into a special graphics laden affair- their will be giant CG tidal waves, giant CG explodings, various famous world landmarks will be destroyed, and at some point the fat, nerdy one will make a quip which no-one will find amusing. About 3 hours into the movie the hero, his girlfriend, and his father/son will realize that they can save the world and restore all this ungodly destruction in a matter of hours by some simple natural/scientific solution that had previously slipped their minds. All will be well. I wait for the day when someone makes a film about the moon smashing into the earth- and is simply 127 minutes of explosions, people screaming and dying, and The Moon encroaching on everyone's personal space. It will surely be the greatest film of all time- by which I mean balls.Best Scene: I predict the best scene will be when a CG animal (Tiger/Wolf/Polar Bear/Rhino/Hippy) which has mysteriously blown across several continents to America chases our heroes until it eventually gets crushed by rock.

305,changmoh,Almost the Ultimate Disaster Thrill Ride,7,10 November 2009,"WE WERE WARNED: Roland Emmerich's '2012' would be the disaster movie to  end all disaster movies. We sneered a bit, but we believed. Emmerich  has been vying to be Hollywood's Demolition King since his  ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Godzilla"" (1998) and ""The Day After  Tomorrow"" (2004). Now, with the aid of superior CGI, he seems to have  done it.  Basically, ""2012"" is about the Earth melting at the core! The ancient  Mayans knew about this and researchers say they have even pinpointed  the date to 12-21-12 - or December 21, 2012! Scientifically, though,  mutant neutrinos have boiled the Earth's core like a microwave, causing  quakes, spilling lava and shifting the Earth's crust. That's right.  This means our land mass moves about so violently that we may find  Wisconsin right on the South Pole!   A few people are privy to this info about the imminent end of the  world. One person who stumbles onto the truth is writer Jackson Curtis  (John Cusack) and he goes all out to get his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and  kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) to safety. The authorities  (represented by Danny Glover as the US President, Oliver Platt as the  Chief of Staff and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Adrian Helmsley, the American  scientist who alerts the White House) must use the time they have to  prepare for Doomsday - and a Brave New World!   What can I say about a disaster movie that has all the best bits of all  the other disaster hits like ""Earthquake"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"",  ""Airport"" and ""Armegeddon""? The CGI effects look so real and involving  that they keep us on the edge of our seats. Those, plus the Indy  Jones-type escapades of Cusack's Jackson who always manages to be just  inches and split-seconds away from danger and mayhem. Some of these,  like the underwater bid to undo a mechanical problem (a'la Poseidon  films), may be old stuff but they mainly keep us occupied for the  two-and-a-half hour roller-coaster ride!   The subplot about Jackson's family set-up is engaging enough but many  of the plot turns and situations are utterly preposterous. However,  Emmerich makes it clear that he knows how silly they are - by showing  some of them in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It is all a theme park  extravaganza - a thrill ride through one spectacle after another. I can  imagine the fun Emmerich must be having, demolishing national icons  like the White House (for a second time), the Christ statue of Rio and  even St Peter's of Vatican City.  It's no great cerebral fare, but as an End-of-the-World flick, it gets  you there! - by LIM CHANG MOH",2012

I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more ""serious"" theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so.

308,MVictorPjinsiste,"Entertaining, Forgeteable.",5,23 January 2021,"Well, from the start, this is an Emmerich movie, which implies heavy CGI, many explosions, jingoism, poor dialogues, and, well, stuff Emmerich is known for. One gets exactly what he expects here, and there's nothing wrong with that.However, here the final impression is somewhat lessened, in comparison with the shocking ID or the more empathic DAT, two other disaster movies of Emmerich make. The casual mood and lack of depth of the charaters contribute to a dulling of the senses and empathy when joined with such high scale destruction; The world is coming apart and there's no satisfactory farewell to human civilization apart from some tepid sitcom comments of the utmost banality. This movie's got no soul.Otherwise, the visuals are, of course, as great as money can buy (it still is something to actually film a tectonic plate shift), great actors, with some of them able to match the CGI fest.

Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE ""what if"" on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.The two main actors in this movie (John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor) stole the show, portraying the two main protagonists in this story about the truth behind the Mayan calender ending on December 21, 2012 that proclaims the end of the world is coming. The one character/actor that should have won critical appraisal for his role was Oliver Platt as the main antagonist; he believes the needs of the few surpass the needs of the many, which doesn't sit well with others.Overall, with great CGI, decent to good acting, pretty good story, and some likable characters, 2012 is a fun and entertaining ride into the end of one world and the beginning of another. The big question that haters should ask themselves when reading this is, ""What would you do when the end comes?"" What i know is that you don't know what others would do if it did come. Therefore, the actions of the characters in the movie are plausible (except for some of the incredibly close calls).",2012

But, I took away 4 stars due to an over-abundance of scenes, characterization, and dialog that could be considered cliché - reminding me of some less than memorable disaster films of the past.Between the two parts above, the average came to 8 stars. However, I took away 1 star for this:THE TIMID - Roland Emmerich has said publicly that he decided not to destroy any Muslim holy sites in his film because he was worried that some cleric might issue a ""Fatwa"" against him. And before you begin to think that I wouldn't have done it myself, consider this.Remember the British teacher who was jailed because she and her students (in Sudan) decided to name a teddy bear ""Mohammed?""

This film tells the story about how the world will end in 2012. This film is extremely long and is almost agonizing near the end. There is a lot of cool effects particularly the destruction of LA. The actors mainly just scream, run and appear to be upset because of all that is happening around them. The film tries to put humour in it through a variety of characters such as a Russian Billionaire who buys a car that's voice activated. The ending seems to take forever as the main characters are trying to be saved by ""arks"" made by the Chinese in order to save as many people as possible from the disaster that will strike the world. Of course there the whole reason why more people get killed but it doesn't seem to bother them near the end of the film.

Unfortunately the film didn't live up to its billing and was instead a disastrous ""joke"" of a disaster movie. There are a large number of spectacular special effects throughout the movie and they are fantastic! For those we were truly grateful. And there's some great acting as John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt are all terrific.But while sure, there's potential devastation if something like what's premised in 2012 occurred. The ridiculous story line with the ludicrous number of over the top last minute escape sequences and close calls that even Indiana Jones couldn't survive make this film very hard to swallow.There are too many preposterous calamities and forced ""sit on the edge of your seats"" events like telling a plane that they don't have clearance to take off while the airport is being annihilated is foolish.After all the buildup 2012 is very disappointing",2012

Awesome special effects and awesome disregard for science, script, originality and simple common sense.My boyfriend and I must have looked like Al Jolson as we sat simultaneously open mouthed and rolling our eyes at the astonishing CGI and the laughable cod-science on offer, including mutating neutrinos, underfloor microwave heating (but no apparent increase in the air temperature!), dodgy political shorthand and grand larceny from every disaster movie from The Towering Inferno onwards.The effects are preposterously over the top and fantastic, with no road left uncracked, no plane able to fly higher than danger, no city too big to upend and slip into the sea like a punctured lilo. The destruction of LA is wanton and wonderful, with palm trees and piers disappearing before your very eyes, and the downtown area immeasurably improved by falling into a large hole.Then it's on to Vegas, and one can't help thinking there's something of the Sodom and Gomorrah in the glee of both cities' total annihilation.Similarly, the only moral of the story - if one can be found under the rubble - seems to be 'Plastic Surgery is Bad', as everyone involved in a particular boob job comes to an unpleasant end.John Cusack is a great actor and without his inclusion this movie would have been even more stupid, but he always manages to inject a bit of intelligence and humour, even into the Apocalypse. Good on yer John! There's an extraordinarily hackneyed 'plot' about a hopeless dad reconnecting with his kids during a disaster - a role already played once to good effect by Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds. Sadly it seems that nowadays - according to Hollywood - it takes Armageddon to make men grow up and take a bit of responsibility. The moral maze created in this particular instance (where the caring, loving, hardworking stepfather meets an unexpectedly unjust death merely to facilitate rekindled romance for Our Hero) is too tangled to be tackled in a mere review. Along with the patchwork science, it really needs a thesis to do it justice. Suffice to say, you've seen it all before, just not as big or as loud or as clichéd.The script has a few funny lines (mostly from Cusack) but they are overwhelmed by many hundreds more which were predictable, familiar, and downright dumb.The unintentionally hilarious moments include someone yelling about a job being 'a SUICIDE mission' - right before a ten year old boy manages to pull it off with a torch and a deep breath - and the brilliant geologist volunteering to fix a stuck gate on a trillion-dollar ship because, of course, scientific and mechanical knowledge is 100% interchangeable.Anyway, you get the picture.

Will the movie's story or actors be any good? Doesn't matter, because the special effects will be awesome! That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw this summer's Transformers sequel, and I was wrong. The movie, despite its superlative effects, was bad enough that it did matter. But that's okay; hope springs eternal, and I used the same argument as my excuse to see 2012. Fortunately, this time around I wasn't disappointed.Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a government scientist who travels to India when a fellow scientist tells him there's something there he must see. Helmsley is floored by the data revealed and he rushes back to Washington where he promptly advises his boss we—the whole earth—have a problem. Helmsley's boss, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) recognizes the importance of what he's told and promptly takes Helmsley directly to President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) himself. Big decisions are quickly made and secretly set in motion. Meanwhile...Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is an unsuccessful novelist who pays the bills as the chauffeur of a wealthy Russian businessman. But at the moment, he's far more concerned with picking up his children from his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new husband (Tom McCarthy) for a trip to Yellowstone National Park, something it's all too clear the kids don't want to do.Once at the park, Jackson arrives where his memory tells him he should be, but things look different, and the area is literally crawling with scientists and soldiers. After a brief conversation and a warning, Jackson and the kids are released. They've set up an uncomfortable camp and the kids are complaining about mosquitoes when Jackson hears something in the woods that turns out to be local conspiracy theorist, Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson). After sharing a beer or two with the man, Jackson escapes back to his own camp and his disgruntled children.Jackson's vacation is suddenly cut short when he gets a call from his ex-wife asking him to bring the children home. A spate of earthquake activity in California has her spooked, and she wants the kids at her side. Jackson does as she asks, but his mind is starting to spin and he tries to connect the dots between all of the odd things that have happened and that he's learned over the course of the last few days. Of course, it's right about then that all hell breaks loose.John Cusack isn't, by any stretch, my favorite action actor. But he was oddly perfectly cast in this action movie. He somehow has the ability to play ""everyman"" on screen which makes us all relate more closely to him no matter the extremities of the circumstances in which he finds himself. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, and Thandie Newton (as the president's daughter) are also just fine (although I did find the supporting roles of a Russian businessman and his mistress to be caricatures). But the scene stealers here are Woody Harrelson (nobody can do the lunatic better), and Oliver Platt. In particular, it's impossible not to loathe Platt even as part of you secretly not only understands what he's doing but even approves just the tiniest bit.2012 was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. Despite his reputation as an action film director, his history is a little uneven. 2012 fortunately puts Emmerich back on the positive side of movie-making once again where he does a credible job both writing and helming the film.As you might expect from the trailers, the special effects are superlative. There are a couple of moments (if you blink, you'll probably miss them) where you can see the handiwork of a computer programmer, but the remaining 99.9% of the effects are utterly fantastic. To me, the only real shortcoming involves the science. And don't even get me started on the speed of the results of those suppositions! I frankly found that distracting. But only for a second!BOTTOM LINE: 2012 is about 2 and a half hours long, and I was stunned at how quickly time passed.That might have had something to do with the fact that I spent most of my time in the theatre trying to relax all of the muscles I kept tensing as I watched the action unfold in front of me. Forget all of the other things you might consider before you decide on a movie, and tell me this: Isn't that really why you go?POLITICAL NOTES: Do I believe that the government would keep things, even deadly serious things, a secret from its citizens? Oh, yeah. In fact, I'm pretty sure it does that kind of thing on a regular basis. And did I appreciate the nod in the film to the Communist Chinese as being pretty much the only people that could have accomplished what they did as quickly as they did? Sure, largely because it's the truth. I also found it bizarrely believable when I was confronted with the methodology the government chose to determine who would go where and when. I can't go into detail here without spoiling certain things for those who haven't yet seen the film, but suffice it to say that not all of these things are good things.FAMILY SUITABILITY: 2012 is rated PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and some language. I'd have to agree with that rating, and add one more limitation of my own for the younger set: Remember that lengthy run time!",2012

319,Raptorclaw155,A Lot of Dumb Fun,4,15 January 2020,"I might be called crazy for saying this but if I had to choose between this or Emmerich's more popular film, Independence Day, I'd choose this one every time. That's not to say that this film is without its issues, however.There are a number of problems with this film. There are a number of characters who we know for almost the whole movie, or a significant amount of it, that are killed off for either no reason at all, or to make room for another character. The biggest example of this is Gordon Silberman. We know his character for the whole of the film. At first we are led to believe that he might have a character arc where he is able to establish a stronger connection with his girlfriend Kate until he's killed off at the end. It seems so bizarre that he would die and it seems like the only reason he did was because the writers wrote themselves in a corner and needed to find a way to get Jackson back with his ex-wife who just so happens to be Kate. His death is probably the most jarring of all of them. Tamara's death is also a bit strange mostly because we don't have a reason to feel one way or the other about her death. Maybe she could have ended up with Gordon at the end since they already knew each other and Tamara's boyfriend, Yuri, very readily left her for dead? Her being killed off seemed to be played up to be more significant than I think her character had any right to be.What was probably the biggest missed opportunity in this film, however, was the ideological conflict between Carl Anheuser and Adrian Helmsley. Both Oliver Platt and Chiwetel Ejiofer put on some of the best performances in this film, but it's really unfortunate that their conflict never really gets anywhere. Anheuser always comes off a a D.C-type jaded misanthrope who only cares about the government and his own political career. He does have a moment of humanity where he speaks with his mother over the phone for the last time. This does not last, however as the scene is cut off by Anheuser doing a 180 saying ""we need to bring people who can contribute."" He's framed to be something of a villain in this film and I think it's a bit unfair to his character since, while yes he does have some social Darwinist views, he does have an important role in saving whatever he can of humanity- just the same as Helmsley. Maybe instead of being a callous person through the end, maybe he could have been slowly swayed to see things in the more optimistic light that Helmsley sees it, or maybe a more nuanced debate through the film could have taken place between them and they both convince each other to finding a middleground between them. While, yes, not everything Helmsley touches in the film is always the 100% correct thing, Helmsley is always more level-headed and empathetic whereas, despite being sometimes right, Anheuser is always angry or yelling which makes his character much less sympathetic despite the near-equal fallibility between both himself and Helmsley.There are also some weird lines in the film. This is particularly so with Lily. When she sees the house collapsing in the huge earthquake that takes out LA, she yells ""My house!"" Despite seeing the house collapse and seeing the whole destruction of the city she lived in, she asks her dad, Jackson ""When are we going home?"" Granted, I'm not an expert on child psychology, but I think a kid her age would be smart enough to know, after going through all she has, that she would know that the ""home"" she knew is long gone. And then after that she whispers ""no more pull-ups"" as if that aspect of her character was something that was important. Is that supposed to be her character arc?Something I also noticed about the film, in a broader sense, is that I found myself enjoying the first two thirds of the film significantly more enjoyable than the last third. Once the Antonov crash lands in China, the film begins to lose my interest. I guess it's much more difficult to follow up the action sequences in the first two thirds of the film- the escape from LA, Yellowstone, and Las Vegas- that the action sequence in the hydraulics chamber of Ark 4 is much less thrilling or interesting.Some of the comedy in this film can hinder the tension of a scene or action sequence. A good example of comedy in this film is when Jackson is driving away from the eruption of the Yellowstone volcano in Charlie's RV and he tells Lily to look at him and ask her if he looks scared in a way to make her feel better, only for her to nod ""yes"" that he does look scared. That was genuinely funny. Then there's the scene where Jackson, while attempting to save Gordon, Kate, and his kids at the beginning of the first big earthquake, he backs into Gordon's Porsche and knocks it down a ravine that formed in front of the garage. Gordon looks at Jackson in the same way Josh might look at Drake in the TV series Drake & Josh when Drake does something stupid. That joke had me laughing at the movie at how ridiculous it is. Then there's the scene where they are trying to escape the Antonov and they all get into the Bentley. Jackson can't start the car with the key so Yuri tells everyone to stop yelling (shut up) and says ""engine start"" to which the car immediately responds by starting the engine. That felt like an ad for Bentley and led to a moment where there was no real tension at all which hurt the sequence considerably.The character whose arc I found to be the most surprisingly well-thought-out was Yuri's. Yuri is played up to be a cold, callous businessman that only cares about his own self-preservation. When he receives the notification to commence the boarding process, he immediately leaves behind his favorite boxer and his girlfriend so he can begin getting ready to make the escape for his life. He keeps everyone around him except for his two sons in the dark as to where he's going and what his plans are until there is no longer any need to do so. He strings his girlfriend along because he knows about her relationship with Sasha (his pilot) so that he can have an easier time getting away. Once Sasha dies and thusly outlives his usefulness to Yuri, he immediately ditches everyone, including his girlfriend whom he had not bought a boarding ticket for and leaves with his sons to board the Arks. On the surface, his character seems to be another villain, but as it turns out all of his actions are recontextualized as the only reason he was willing to shell out the 3 billion Euros for Ark boarding tickets was to save his sons. The giant mob he leads the charge for Ark 4's gate ends up being so that he can ensure the survival of his sons. This is sort of foreshadowed on the Antonov where he talks with Jackson about how much his sons mean to him, asking Jackson if he would do the same for his own kids. He then sacrifices himself in the end to save his second son, tossing him up to the closing gate of Ark 4 and subsequently falling to his death.As I alluded to before, I found the over-the-top action scenes to be quite enjoyable save for the one at the end. They are fun, thrilling, and nice to look at.Not all of the CGI has aged so well, especially with the large drill tower at the US Army location at Yellowstone. It looked incredibly fake back then and has only aged worse over time.For some reason, I really enjoy the segment at the beginning of the film where it builds up to the title card. It provides a sense of urgency and the level of the stakes of the situation that is about to take place. There's also a bit of foreshadowing in the opening shot of the film that, having seen the film so many times, I find in-your-face, but is actually quite subtle.I also enjoyed every scene that featured the conspiracy nut, Charlie. Every time he offers Jackson a pickle or a beer, I laugh. Woody Harrelson's partrayal of Charlie is excellent. Charlie is crazy in a likable way and he really steals every scene he's in. At the end of the day, his only function in the film is to spout exposition but the way it is handled is done so surprisingly well. There is a point where Jackson offers Charlie to come with him, but Charlie decides to stay and watch the volcano erupt from up close. While I find his character likable enough to wish he took Jackson up on his offer, I'm also glad they decided to kill him off there since he had nothing else to add to the film. I'm not sure if it was done intentionally, but they did this character very right.There is so much I could say about this film, but I've gone on for so long already. There are a lot of problems with this film that I didn't cover in this review that make it, objectively, a below-average one. But I still believe there is a lot of value in the character banter and the action sequences that make this film still a fun one to watch. Whenever I think about a ""popcorn film"" this is the first one I think of. Maybe Independence Day is a better-made film, but I found myself enjoying this one much more. That's why I recommend it for anyone who is interested in just putting on a fun movie for a family movie night or a movie date or something.",2012
320,nealvan557,Who knew this movie would have predicted 2020????,6,26 December 2020,"It is free on Amazon Prime as I conclude my 2020 Christmas Day. Although how the world was supposed to end in 2020 because of incorrect interpretations of the Mayan Great Calendar and it's Great Cycle. The date of the world ending was 12-21-2012. The day after my birthday. When nothing happened, I was the only one who was upset the world didn't die. I have been looking forward to a world ending disaster. In this movie the global population, in part, is saved by China as the location where the arks have been built. However, this specific location is somewhere in Tibet which China has been trying to forcibly takeover in today's world. Plus, in today's world, it is China, specifically the CCP government, has purposely let loose a highly contagious virus known as COVID-19 (Coronavirus). This act was biological warfare which in the original creation the UN, this type of war act is a war crime and all involved with its release are supposed to be held accountable and put on trial. The irony is incredible. As far as the end/begin date of the Mayan Great Cycle is about the movement of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun as well as it's tilt. This is what the Mayans had seen/predicted is to happen, and it has. Check the weather patterns around the world and how it has drastically changed since 2012 to present day. I'm posting this on Christmas Day 2020. This is just the beginning of the new Great Cycle as we are only 8 years into a new 5,000+ year cycle to reach the next Great Cycle.

322,lethalweapon,2012: A space for the ditzy,7,4 December 2009,"End of the world predictions have been around ever since the the world had lunatics... and that's basically since the beginning of time. As predictions go, Earth has been subjected to the R.I.P. monitor on a periodic swing... The predicted cause of complete human doom has been postulated across meteor showers, volcanic doom, tidal waves, machine conquests, God's interventions, planetary collisions, overheating suns, underheating suns, alien invasions, nuclear holocausts, mafia dominion, ecological collapses, economic meltdowns, and, of course, my favourite... zombie takeovers.The new and improved doomsday alarm for humanity is set for the year 2012. This time, the nuts are REALLY sure about the date, because this is predicted by the ancient wisdom of the Mayan civilization. For some reason, these guys are seen to be the final word on stellar predictions and global collapse. And yet, somehow, they were not as great about predicting the inbound invasion that eventually wiped them out.But there's no dispute that there WILL be a handful of doomsday scholars out on the streets with cardboard warnings. And there WILL be money to be made from the pseudo-fear. Hollywood has marked the first major milestone with the release of director Roland Emmerich's latest blockbuster, 2012.The most refreshing aspect of the movie is that they categorically refused to put efforts in a plot whatsoever. The official motto seemed to be ""Plot schmot. Let's just blow stuff up."" Any time wasted on the plot is time they could use to blow up another global landmark. The movie was just as enjoyable as it was ridiculous... and that's saying a lot. They used and abused all possible combinations of CG... From the floods from ""The Day After Tomorrow"" to the exploding landmarks from ""Independence Day"" to the cars spinning on the road from ""Bad Boys 2"" to the volcanic eruption and ash rain from ""Dante's Peak"" to the drowned earth from ""Waterworld"" to the flight-among-explosions situation from ""Air Force One"" to the upturned ship from ""Poseidon"" to the shattered buildings from ""Chain Reaction"", to the lottery selection of survival candidates from ""Deep Impact""; they're all here. Now you can see why there's no room for a plot... and why you don't have time to miss it.The protagonist is Jackson Curtis, a rare combination of a limousine driver cum science fiction author, who stumbles on to a hush-hush government project that basically tries to save the genetically gifted and the fantabulously wealthy from the impending doom threatening mankind in 2012; A hush-hush government project that involves around 300-400,000 people in the loop; Talk about disasters waiting to happen...But of course, there's no time to ponder over that, as Jackson rushes off to save his ex-wife, their kids, and the wife's current boyfriend. This is where the roller coaster ride begins. Everywhere they go, the ground starts falling apart; buildings crash, the earth opens up, explosions flare, and general pandemonium follows them around for the rest of the movie.And, of course, all of the action happens around two inches behind the protagonist, as he flies, rides, climbs, swims, and skids across an unrelenting Earth. If he walks across the road, the road would collapse; if he jumps on a plane, the runway breaks apart, if he flies to China, the country disappears... Seriously, if he ever passed wind, it would light up. Danger was always that close... and you still don't feel tense.There is almost no real tension throughout the movie... Even as skyscrapers collapse and cities get wiped clear off, you just sit there and take in the CG works, marveling at the advancement in graphics. Cos you know, even though the death toll is literally in the billions, that by the end of the movie, the hero would just brush his hair, dust off his jacket, and flash a smile at the camera. Except John Cusack doesn't really smile very much, does he?Anyway, storm the theater. Enjoy the thrill ride. Pump more cash into Roland Emmerich's pockets. Live out the 2012 hype and get it out of the system, cos when the real 2012 comes in the picture, things are going to rather fizzle out. By that time, of course, Roland would be rolling in a filthy stinking sea of thousand dollar bills stacked a mile high, giving off high pitched squeals of laughter. Roughly, 2012 will be neither more nor less spectacular than any of the years preceding it.But then again, some insidious politicians are speculating that Sarah Palin would be contesting the 2012 presidential elections...Hmm... Maybe the Mayans DID know something after all...",2012

The special effects are among the most incredible seen in film, however that alone does not rescue it. At 158minutes it is much too long and the so called emotional element misses the mark completely. There are some really awful moments where I suppose we are expected to care? The lead actor is just dire and Woody Harleson's character is just a stupid edition to all the other characters we quickly could not care less about.

325,joshfedderson,It's the end of the world as we know it,9,28 July 2017,"I have to say this movie is very tense. The disasters in it make you think, will the world really end this way? It's one of those films where it gets your mind thinking about the world around us and how natural disasters can and will happen. The reason I give 2012 a 9 is it is a film where it makes you think, it makes you think about being prepared for disasters great or small, basically it's a movie about reality but its fiction. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying. They do say it will erupt again in the future, but they don't know when? as for the earthquakes those are real, the shifting of continents? I guess a major event like that can happen? It did millions of years ago. I for one liked the action in it, I also liked the fact that there was humor in it to break the ice of all the seriousness and drama. All the cast does a wonderful job, Danny Glover was excellent playing the President of the United States. John Cusack was good, but I feel they should have put a more action packed actor in it as the dad who saves his family, Cusack does not have action in him, but then again like I said he did a good job in the movie. My favorite character was the crazy guy that was obsessed with the Yellow stone caldera, he made me laugh so much. But then again he was completely crazy and lost his life because of it. I feel like Gordon played by Tom McCarthy should have had a better ending to his life, like to save someone. The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings? If we were on three boats, trying to survive, would we open the gates and let others in? Or leave them? Makes you think about your compassion and humanity.2012 is a thinking movie, it will not only make you jump out of your seat but it will get your mind moving about things. Makes you want to get emergency prepared as well. I give 2012 a 9.",2012

Repeat.Cusack apparently needed the paycheck (no problem there: John needs the work), and Oliver Platt shows once again why certain actors are always worth seeing. Danny Glover hasn't had a decent role in a really long time, and getting the chance to be Morgan Freeman in Deep Impact would have been interesting, but here he is a milquetoast Peter Sellers' Merkin Muffley (he deserves better). Amanda Peet was ... well, she's Amanda Peet, and after that I really don't care.Bottom line: plot line? Sburg. Character development? Sburg. Deeper understanding of the human experience? Sburg. Cinematic genius? Sburg.Sburg, sburg, sburg, sburg and then sburg.Hey, I don't get on a roller-coaster to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, I get on for the ride, throw my hands in the air and give off a whooping sound.

327,eckhouse24,Check Your Brain and Enjoy,7,1 December 2009,"There are some movies that you go to see because of the acting, or because of the story, or because it is an Oscar favorite. This is not one of them. This is a movie where you just need to check your brain at the door and be ready to be entertained.2012 is another one of those End Of The World Disaster films where the Government has a plan and our hero is a common person trying to get by and somehow we know, that both the government and the hero will meet up somewhere. I expected that going into the movie and that is basically what I got, however, I enjoyed it this time around. Sure, the story is predictable, and the characters just seem to get lucky every time around. Some may even say that this is an insult to ones intelligence. But what film is not predictable, and what film does not have convenient situations. I mean, doesn't every romantic comedy have that All is Doomed moment right before the couple reunite and fall in love for the final time. Doesn't every slasher film have that final confrontation with the Heroin and the killer. We as an audience know what to expect but we continue to see these movies. And I am OK with that. It's like going on a roller coaster. We know their are ups and downs, and their is always that final drop before everything smooths out.2012 is like that Roller Coaster ride. It has it's ups and downs, and we know that most people will make it to the end. We know that cities will fall, landmarks will crumble, and there will always be that All is Doomed moment where you think it's all over.John Cusack was actually pretty good in his first major action movie since Con Air. He's a likable character, much more then Dennis Quaid in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (Also directed by Roland Emmerich.) The destruction scenes were pretty entertaining as well. From the fall of L.A. to the site of an all ready fallen Las Vegas, I enjoyed the chaos around everyone.Now, this movie was not without it's flaws. Every film has an annoying kid who won't listen to his parents, and this one also had the annoying kid. Also, Danny Glover's President of the U.S. was uninspiring. Sometimes, the cgi did get in the way.With all of that, I still believe this is one of the better ""End of the World"" disaster films and one worth the money to see in theaters. It is entertaining, it's fast, action packed, and in the end, I think you feel you got your money's worth. So what if there is no Oscar worthy performance. It is all right to see a movie that lets you take off your thinking caps so you can just enjoy without asking questions.",2012

330,lekgolah,One of the best disaster films in a long time,7,11 June 2010,"2012 has received a many mixed reviews since it was released but this is by no means a terrible film. It however does feature things that will annoy people such as a character risking their families lives to run back to a burning vehicle and clichés that we have seen many times before but if you watch this knowing what to expect, you will enjoy it.In some ways this is the disaster film to end all disaster films. There is so much destruction that the special effects crew have had to work incredibly hard to show cities being torn apart by earthquakes. Those who do not like special effects in films and prefer practical effects will not like the film. 2012 overloads on the amount of special effects completely but without it, the makers would be restricted to what they could pull-off.As mentioned earlier the story is clichéd and generic. You know how it will end but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the film. I do however wish that they added something supernatural about the film. At the start it mentions that there has been a mass suicide where many hundreds of Mayans have killed themselves. After that there is no other mention of it again and 2012 becomes just another disaster film. They could have made hints that aliens were involved etc but we are forced to forget that. Had they of tried something different, this could have made the film more exciting and interesting.While the film is not perfect, it is enjoyable and Chiwetel Ejiofor does another good performance adding to the human element of the film in how we must stay together during tough times.

There are things that will happen in this film that are just impossible to take seriously, you just have to deal with it. It's a movie. The bright spot of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. He also happens to be the heart and sole. Without his presence, the film would struggle for that emotional connection that is paramount in any disaster flick. Chiwetel Ejiofor has been in some very good films including Children of Men, The Inside Man and American Gangster. He is an actor to keep an eye on. In the end, if you are the kind of person that has trouble separating fiction from reality, then you should probably stay away from 2012. On the other hand, if your a sucker for disaster movies and just want a fun time at the theater for the price of a ticket and some snacks, then 2012 is where it's at. Enjoy. The end is near.",2012
332,Argyle302,"Should Have Been Named ""502,012""",2,16 February 2021,"Yet another liberal Hollywood global warming, climate change disaster movie. Yes, there is global warming and climate change going on with our planet, but just not at the speed in which they portray in this movie. Radical liberals Roland Emmerich in Hollywood love to fear monger their viewers into believing their radical theories that the earth has only 10 more years before it all collapses. When in reality, the pace for this to happen will probably take another 250,000 to 500,000. Heck, it might be 1,000,000 years before our earth will succumb to uninhabitable conditions for life. The truth is, nobody really knows if our planet has an expiration date or not. Liberal Democrats in America, and other liberals across the globe, are just profiteering off of global warming and climate change, fear mongering people into believing that if we don't do something drastic in the next 10 years we will all die. And while they push their radical agenda, the rich globalists get richer, while everyone else funding their efforts get fall further into poverty. Global warming and climate change theories are just a money grab, and a power grab for the elite globalists around the planet. It might make for decent Hollywood box office sales, but don't believe what these idiots in Hollywood are telling you. While they want you to adhere to their climate change rules, they go on with their lives jet-setting across the globe, like they don't care about climate change or global warming, because deep down, they don't. That is because they know that the world is not coming to an end. All they are, are hypocrites.",2012
333,user-543-975655,"A Great, But Eventually Drawn Out Movie",7,26 October 2013,"The movie 2012 had heaps-of-hype around it, and I finally got to see it after 4 years. My friends who had seen it said it was absolutely fantastic, and since they have pretty much the same taste as me in movies I trusted them. I rented it from my local library's movie section and watched the next day, after watching It. It started kind of slow, with all the bits and pieces, and eventually it just got boring. Soon after, though, the real stuff started happening. Explosions, People dying in horrific ways, buildings falling - all that jazz. For the first 90-100 minutes the movie was enthralling, and that was the beginning/middle, and eventually it just got to a point where it was still good and entertaining, but got kind of old after a while. I was hanging on until I got to the end, though, because I knew with a movie like this, the end must be awesome. I was right. I'm not telling you what it was, though. There were absolutely astonishing visual effects in the beginning/middle of the movie, and they looked oh so very awesome. Nice job, Mr. Emmerich and VFX team! Anyway, there were very few scenes in the beginning/middle/end of the movie that weren't awesome. Except in the end, I got kind of bored because it was long, and drawn out. Was it intense? Yeah! But it was just one of those movies that you really really like, but just want to end about 20 minutes earlier. The end was, hover, a subtle retelling of Noah's Ark, and that's really all I can tell you about this movie's end. There were some real shockers, too, and they will probably leave you in disbelief, if you are interested in the movie. By the way, only a 1 or 2 of my reviews have spoilers in them, so you should go check those out, too. The acting was everything you would want to have in a disaster flick, screaming, yelling, and tears, and everything else. You can really feel the emotions of the characters at times, especially with Harry who has a small role played by Blu Mankuma, a very skilled actor. The end was where the tired wall really hits you. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I really wanted to shave off maybe 15 - 20 minutes of the run time. My apologies if this is a bad review. I'm kind of out of it because I just went jogging, and before that watched a 158 minute movie that I'm reviewing right now. Anyway, I do recommend this movie to you if you like good movies, disaster movies, or are in the mood for some good, old -fashioned explosions. See ya!",2012
334,uroshnor54,Not Roland Emmerich's Best Movie,2,10 July 2016,"I generally like Roland Emmerich's movies. They're not great but they're fun. I thought Stargate, Independence Day, and even Godzilla, were decent movies. But I didn't particularly like 2012. There's really only one reason I didn't like it but it's a big reason: the film gives you no reason for you to care more about the main characters than the billions of other people who die. Yes, tons of innocent people die in other disaster movies, like Independence Day and Dante's Peak (probably my favorite disaster movie), but the vast majority of the human race isn't killed in those. I didn't care about the family. I did care about Gordon (he was the one who flew them out of danger in the first place, after all) and he's crushed in the gears of the ark. In fact, quite a few of the people who are responsible, both directly and indirectly, for saving the family are killed, like Woody Harrelson's character, the Russian billionaire and pilot, and the astrophysicist. And I think one disaster movie cliché that needs to die is how a dog is given more attention than all the people who are dying as if an animal's life is more important than a human's. Again, Independence Day and Dante's Peak are also guilty of this and I didn't like it in those movies either.",2012

And yes it really is a terrible movie if you have any - ANY - expectation of seeing something you can think about. I think for anyone with any intellect at all the only way to enjoy it would be to turn off the volume and just fast-forward thru the truly awful ""sensitive"" scenes (that made me yawn heavily) and admire the CGI - and really you don't need much of an intellect to do that - however it's a higher level than where this movie is pitched. It's actually a low grade soap opera with stunning special effects - so thoroughly ""American"" right down to the divorced father, disaffected son (in fact I counted 5 father-and-son subplots) and the mindless blonde with a dog (although she was supposed to be Russian) that the movie was really about the end of American civilization because no one else got a look in - but no - wait! It wasn't the end of American civilization because all the dweebs who were spoiling the movie by their unbelievably corny dialog and 'life values' ended up being the progenitors of the new planetary civilization. Horrifying thought right there. That is the real disaster but the movie ended before that could be explore in any meaningful way. Too bad. But as i said - the cinema was full...",2012

The only thing that sustained me through 2 1/2 craptastic hours of bad acting, sadistic and preposterously clichéd writing, and overblown CGI effects was the knowledge that, now that Emmerich has destroyed the planet, he's done in the disaster-movie business. I mean, where do you go from there- Viggo Mortensen blowing up space Maybe now he'll be forced to make movies about real human beings in everyday, real-life situations, with honest dialogue and credible acting...nah, bring on the exploding Martians!!",2012

338,cpbadgeman,Great campy fun,6,23 November 2009,"It was pretty much inevitable that someone would make a movie based on all the 2012 hoopla. Nor is it surprising when that someone is disaster maven Roland Emmerich. His latest effort adheres closely to the formula established by his earlier films ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""- in other words we get to watch a typically flawed-but-lovable American family (headed by John Cusack and Amanda Peet), along with a range of supporting characters, attempt to survive the end of the world.That's all there is to the basic plot. The real stars of the film are the truly spectacular special effects. Emmerich really pulls out all the stops and creates some truly awesome set-pieces of destruction. In order to ensure that the main characters have endless perilous situations to escape from, we get to see a bunch of natural and man-made wonders get totaled by Mama Nature. Highlights include Los Angeles falling into the sea, Las Vegas being swallowed by the desert, and the Himalayas being submerged by tidal waves.Improbable? Definitely. Ridiculous? You bet. But none of that matters since ""2012"" is exactly the film it was intended to be- a great big popcorn movie that offers big laughs, big thrills, and a lot of good old fashioned fun.",2012

While the (mostly computer generated) special-effects are impressive at times, the chaotic script and the laughable acting-performances are nothing to write home about.2012 has all the ingredients of a traditional disaster-movie as we know it, and like I said the special-effects are good as you come to expect from a movie this recent. The only significant difference with this movie is that this time the disaster takes place globally. The movie suffers from overly dramatic scenes that drag on far too long and have no appeal what so ever. I think they could have easily cut out a good 30 minutes or so of soap-opera esq scenes.The acting in this movie is very below average, to the point that its almost embarrassing to watch. No matter what the situation, the cast always seems very unenthusiastic in their roles and the sometimes plain uninspired dialog doesn't exactly help either. I think the movie would have worked out a lot better if they would have taken a more adventurous approach with the story. Now 2012 turned out like a movie that relies too much on special-effects. But if its special-effects you want, you will be pretty bored with this movie as well I think, because 2012 has little other redeeming features to offer.Director Roland Emmerich said that 2012 will be his final disaster- movie, and frankly this is a very good thing before his movies turn out even more disastrous then this movie. 2012 is a very mediocre and in the end forgettable film.",2012

I was actually looking for Wiley Coyote during the disaster scenes.

This movie did not disappoint, specially with the visual effects. But the story line was a little non-convincing for the actor John Cusack always as a close shave with death and survives, the other reason was there is only a mention of the Mayan Prophecy.As we all know it, the world is coming to an end, and how will one survive. The best part to this is that the prediction was made by an Indian played by Jimmy Mistry. This was the opening scene in the movie, of course India, didn't look like India in the movie. The other thought that i had was, would it be possible for the movie to customise the story for each country.Other than John Cusack, there could have been a better and known actors and more believable and achievable storyline. Not like the one, when all the buildings are falling down, airport runaways going down, water is rising, volcanoes are erupting, earthquake is highest on the righter scale; the hero always is the one who is unhurt, unscathed. The other side of the story has to how mankind survives is because of a country called China, this is enough of the movie given away. You have both Indian and China, being mentioned in the movie - India discovers, China invents, Chindia saves the world.If you are special effect crazy, looking forward to Armageddon, this movie would not disappoint you.",2012

I had very low expectations for it, but the movie has some intense, action oriented cinematic moments from beginning to end. If you a fan of action flicks and heart pounding action, then this movie is for you. Now for the obvious sides of the movie. If you are a scientific person like myself, you will probably hate this movie and bash the crap out of it. First off, most, if not all of the action sequences, are unrealistic. Crazy car driving scenes with the ground crumbling around the vehicle, planes taking off before they fall to their doom, it gets very unrealistic. Top that off with a relatively poor story line and inaccurate scientific facts about how the world is going to end, it can make some movie goers sick!Just to end it, 2012 has some good action sequences, and the average person will most likely enjoy it.

344,phatdan,Monotonous Effects Fizzle,4,14 November 2009,"I dislike criticizing movies, especially ones that I know are not to be taken seriously. This film starts out fine, but crescendos into disappointment. It struggles too hard to out-do itself from one scene to the next and its climactic final writhes in predictability. What should have been exciting to watch becomes tedious. I actually began to nod off three fourths of the way through. The effects are great, especially in the beginning, but the story fizzles with the generic divorced-dad-saves-ex-wife-and-kids gimmick. Can the hero ever be happily married? Yes, it's just a popcorn movie, but unless the popcorn is really delicious, this flick just ain't worth 3 hours, advertisements and coming attractions included.",2012

Look at the director, all he does are crazy action movies. So going in I knew what to expect and it delivered on most levels. The only real problem I had was how it got all drawn out and preachy near the end, I was like COME ON, get over yourselves. So they could've easily shaved off 10 minutes to this already long film and in the process made it way better.Its really a very ridiculous movie but the special effects are enjoyable and both John Cusack and Amanda Peet are capable actors so even if you find the other subplots unbearable (which some of them almost are) you will still like them. The action sequences did make this worth watching on the big screen, big explosions, earthquakes, tsunamis and so forth are trippy. Just don't go in expecting a bearable plot or highly intellectual dialogue. There are about 10 blatantly obvious plot holes but who cares.I'd say this film is slightly better than most of the crap showing in cinemas currently.",2012
346,chimera-4,"At best, totally by the numbers....",4,13 November 2009,"I don't know what I was thinking going into 2012. I guess I hoped it wasn't as generic as the trailers made it seem. Every trailer I'd ever seen for the movie made it look pretty much exactly like The Day After Tomorrow and it pretty much was. Famous landmarks getting destroyed, mass destruction, hero outrunning/driving/flying mass destruction, family rifts that get healed up at the end, Inconvenient spouses offed and then completely forgotten about/ignored for the sake of reconciliation with exes. All the cliché trademarks are all present and correct, doing their duty by merely showing up. To be fair it's a competent enough, if silly, disaster movie which offers no surprises whatsoever while laying on more (admittedly impressive looking) empty spectacle for the sake of empty spectacle.It felt way too long at nearly 3 hours and at least half of that was the build up. Predictable and seen it all before buildup at that. We've all seen it before. Strange geological anomolies. Nerdy tech guys coming up with unbelievable numbers that mean bad sh*t is gonna be going down. Officials that don't buy it then eventually do, the crazy survivalist dude that everyone thinks is nuts that really knows what's going down (here played by a very entertaining Woody Harelson, probably the best thing about the movie) etc.You can pretty much go with your impression of the trailer for this movie. What you get here is what you expect to get from what the trailer shows you.At best 2012 is totally by the numbers and at worse absolutely ridiculous, cliché and even a bit insulting really.....",2012
347,PippinInOz,Unrelenting,3,3 January 2011,"Firstly, I can see what one of the reviewers here is getting at when they write of seeing this on the BIG screen. If this is how I watched maybe - and it is a BIG maybe - it would have been a lot of fun. But I didn't.Tried to watch this last night and yes, the special effects are great. However, after 45 minutes I had this feeling of being at an endless New Year's Eve party - go go go go! Let's have fun! Don't let the punters get bored by taking a breath and actually giving them some half decent story telling. I like end of the world dystopian survival stories - perhaps to the point where a shrink might have concerns about my state of mind, but this got, well, just boring to be honest. Cardboard cut out stereotypical characters - you will have seen these cut outs in many a big block buster before. For example: Groovy, but faintly useless absent dad whose kids are being brought up by a sensible professional - Check.Ex - wife who still loves him really - Check.Young son who loves his mobile phone and his step father - Check.Young cute daughter who adores her dad - Check.Groovy but faintly useless dad who has to rise to the challenge of being a hero - Check.Lots and lots and lots of NOISE - Check.Overacting 'comic relief' character - Check. (Woody Harrelson - well, let's just say I cringed) If this is your bag - and clearly a lot of people love these kind of films - then go ahead and enjoy it. Just don't expect anything of the calibre of say '28 Days Later.' If you want characters who are vaguely realistic and therefore making their attempts to survive all the more riveting, then give this a miss. Like me, you will not only get bored but will feel a migraine coming on....As I say, this is only my personal opinion. You either enjoy this kind of film, or you don't.

That's pretty much all I can accept because the rest is horribly bad. The acting would have been OK if the dialogue had at least been mildly interesting - Woody Harrelson's portrayal being the exception, and at 158 minutes there is way too much of the boring dialogue to be had - they could easily have cut an hour.The action sequences are completely over the top which is expected in a disaster movie, but here the characters aren't on a cliff's edge the whole time they are for the most part over the edge yet somehow survive.Adding to the calamity is the fact that the internal logic is deeply flawed. There are systems that we have been told are gone forever that suddenly work just to create another emotional scene - of which there are plenty, but none that works. Cusack's character is hailed as a hero for nearly killing everybody. They try the emotional President speech but Danny Glover doesn't pull it off due to both the writing & acting. If you still feel like an over the top disaster action film after this outpouring then go rent ""the day after tomorrow"" by the same director which is a superior film in every way.",2012

Others include a tsunami hitting Washington DC, a building in the Vatican topples, and the tsunami over the Himalayan mountains.Some people say that the movie lacks a plot and it supposed to do something with the acting.It's one of the best blockbuster movies of 2009.

It sucks as an action film, it sucks as a drama, it sucks as a family film, and it sucks by existing. With that out of the way, the one thing thing it does well at is un-intentional comedy. I have never, and I mean never, laughed so hard in public. I was on board with the seriousness until I saw a subway train come hurtling out of the ground and barely miss a small plane. At that point, I literally laughed so hard, I actually sprinkled! I got lots of dirty looks from some of the other people in the showing, but I just could not take anything in this film seriously. It's one big joke from start to finish, and it's hilariously bad. Not one person ever acts believably, except for the incredibly annoying daughter. She shrieks and sulks her way through it all with amazing consistency, and I just wanted to shoot her in the face after five minutes. Speaking of mercy-killing, the black scientist is the next one I'd take out. (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Seriously, this man has zero concept of what ""survival of the species"" means. When he sees the room which has been prepared for him, he freaks out ans gasped ""You could fit 10 people in here!"" Yes,probably, but that's not the point. This moron would rather have an ark jammed with starving, disease-ridden humans instead of a few clean, healthy ones. He seems to think the human race would be better served by letting a huge, panicked crowd onto a ship which is literally minutes from launch. If I had been in charge of the mission, this man would have been shot in the head the moment he opened his mouth about what it means to be human. Next, I would have found the stow-aways and killed them too. The mission would run as planned, and no crap about selfless brotherhood would enter anyone's mind. I have to agree with the Joker when it comes to human nature: ""These people are only five days from eating each other at any time."" For proof of this, look at what happens in any area hit by disaster.This movie wants us to think we would all put aside our differences and work to our mutual benefit. I call bull on that one. The secret program would be doomed from the start, because every nation would want to control who got on the ships and who didn't. In the end, the various governments would just start a massive nuclear war to kill most of the population off, and scrape whoever was left in the bunkers into the ships. That way, there would be close to zero competition for any remaining resources, and no question about who was in charge.

So just sit through this inevitable 15 or 20 minutes and the big fun of crushing everything will start.During the first 40 or 60 minutes this movie follows this general idea. It is really great fun. Yeah, no sense at all, but a lot of beautiful destruction. Most of the time done pretty convincing.But hey, it IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to take this plot serious. There is no need to take anything serious. However, you get the full load of pseudo deep family story. Divorced dad and son saving, well, a lot of people. A strong appeal to acting very moralic. The notion included that politicians are free of any moral.And that makes the movie fail ultimately.It starts as a tongue in cheek show with only one goal: Destroy almost anything in the most spectacular manner. And that would have done fine. Yet there has to be some heroism, some moral and some good an bad.

357,LarryBrownHouston,Good movie watered down by some strategic mistakes,8,7 December 2009,"Overall, great, I'll give it an 8. It's certainly worth watching. Sadly a few strategic mistakes on the part of the director and writer watered the movie down.The destruction scenes are awe-inspiring. I actually got goose-bumps watching some of it, a first for this 50 year old viewer. The scope, complexity, imagination, and excellence. I'm an expert viewer but to me it looked really realistic, I didn't see anything I could recognize as computer animation even though I know that's mostly what it was. Had I been the producer and the creative team came to me with a plan for what they wanted to do I would have thrown them out of my office: ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? Stop wasting time and put something down that we actually have a chance of completing in less than 10 years."" Also at least one of the destruction scenes (the one were they drove through a sky-scraper) featured various sight-gags and funny content that I enjoyed and laughed out loud. However this came at the expense of lightening the tone of a scene in which thousands of people are supposedly dying.The soundtrack was awesomely detailed, at least at first. During the scene were Cusack showed up at his ex-wife's house and then an earthquake hit, there were all sorts of interesting sounds happening and they sounded good and clear. One neat sound was timber creaking as the house gave way. In later scenes I did not notice that detail.A surprise was the many big stars. Danny Glover, John Cusack (with less and even no (!) guy-liner this time), Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson.Woody Harrelson's character provided the comic relief and it was good. It came across well and also funny, but they avoided the mistake of making him annoying or too silly, also he moved the plot along. It was good but it could have been funnier. It would not have been as much fun with an unknown actor, so Woody carried the character more than the dialog.The drama was good but not good enough so that this movie could have ever made it to 10 status. A little trite and pedantic during the speech section near the end.No, I repeat NO Mayan content. Only a brief mention and one watermarked shot of the Mayan city of Tikal. They mangled the word ""Quiché."" It's pronounced key-TCHAY (like touché but it's a hard ch like tch, not a soft one like sh), they pronounced it ""quiche"" as in ""I'll have the quiche Lorraine, please."" That was unbelievable. They also mispronounced Tikal, which is pronounced Tee-KAHL. I forget what they said but it was something ridiculous like ""tickle."" Anyway it doesn't matter because other than that one line of dialog you could watch the entire movie and never realize that Mayans were involved. I think this was an odd and poor choice. Other movies like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Star Gate,"" ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and ""National Treasure"" make good drama with quasi-factual archaeological content. In this case there was some real and really interesting factual content on which to draw but they passed. The movie would have been a large notch more worthwhile had they thrown in some tidbits. A little hieroglyphics here, a little pyramid skulking there, a few fascinating facts about ""El Gran Jaguar"" (the main pyramid in Tikal) or ""El Mirador"" (possibly the world's largest pyramid, located in Northern Guatemala), it could have been done without bogging the movie down.The tone was too light. I mean the world is ending, millions of people are dying, but the overall tone was light and a little upbeat, focusing on the few that were making it out alive. In particular, the scenes in the plane were way too light, especially Cusack's ex-wife. They would just barley make it out with their lives with the world crumbling right beneath them and entire cities sinking into the ocean, and then once air-born she would look up almost smiling and just go on with her dialog like nothing had happened. It was almost like ""Oh wow, I'm glad that's over. We made it! Is my hair mussed? Oh well, what's next? Is it lunch time yet?"" For me those lines were so misplaced that it was a distraction.The biggest strategic mistake of the director was evenly spacing the action out over the entire movie. It was like drama-action-drama-action-drama-action. The voltage varied constantly throughout from high voltage action back to low-voltage talking heads. The early action scenes had major impact on me, later ones had a ""more-of-the-same"" effect and my reaction was ""Oh, we have to do more action now? Ho-hum, OK, let's get it over with."" The movie would have been much better if they had adopted a more conventional pacing, put most of the drama and character development up front, then launch into the action and continually build to the climax. Had they done it this way the movie might have been a 9, but without a better dramatic story it still would not have been a 10.Larry Brown",2012
358,robnels2000,Nothing less then 1 *? Too bad,1,13 November 2009,"To start out, there is no Mayan prediction saying the world will end in 2012.Their calendar just ends on the year 2012, no disaster, other than this movie. I guess 2000 years on the calendar was enough at the time.Disaster movies and horror movies are the most predictable crap Hollywood puts out. Save your money on this movie and watch Earthquake, Poseidon Adventure (the original not the remake), Knowing or even that crappie Day after tomorrow, they are all the same, bad science and over done special effects.This movie is like every other disaster movie made since the 70s. All the stereo typical characters are here. 1. The common man hero that saves his family against all odds. 2. The cute kid that you can't help but love, and is smart beyond their years. 3. The government plan to save a select few, and of course the hero is against the idea.",2012
359,mattbaxter72,"Just watch the trailer, skip the movie",5,23 November 2009,"You've seen the trailer for this movie, right? John Cusack and a bunch of B-actors driving through a city that's disintegrating around them, driving through a collapsing building, under a falling freeway, dodging falling cars, debris and people left and right? And then taking off in a plane as the runway collapses beneath them - it's not a sequence you're likely to forget. I thought the whole film would be pretty much like that - cataclysmically stupid, of course, but a hell of a fun ride. Sure, there would be boring bits of horribly inept characterization, terrible, terrible dialogue (and someone really does say 'But that's IMPOSSIBLE!' quite early on, which was nice) - but those boring bits would be just the filler, a breathing space between huge, insanely entertaining action scenes.Nope. Not really. The bit from the trailer is by far and away the best action sequence in the movie - there's another couple of bits in planes, and the White House gets wiped out by a flying aircraft carrier, but the rest of the movie mostly consists of those bad, bad character and dialogue scenes I had been dreading. We're supposed to really, really care about these guys, and while the actors are up to the job - except for the kids, who would have been greatly improved by taking a lava bath - they're all playing such clichéd, one-note characters that it's impossible to give a damn. I really wasn't expecting Shakespeare from this movie. I was just hoping for two and a half hours of dumb fun, but instead I got about 20 minutes of fun, and the rest was trying - and failing - to be serious, and just ended up boring. Note to Roland Emmerich, if he's reading - you aren't any good at serious or deep. Do fun, shallow and demented instead. That's what this movie should have been, but in his ambition to create something more, Emmerich just produced the dullest end-of-the-world movie I can remember seeing.",2012
360,bestactor,This Cast Deserved to Die!,1,19 July 2010,"I cannot believe how terrible this movie is. I've usually enjoyed Roland's disaster epics, but this has precious little to recommend. The disasters start looking the same--not much variation for multiple earthquakes and tidal waves. There is an enormous deficit of imagination so the disaster effects become extremely boring. Not even a Titanic collision with Mount Everest deserves attentive watching. The digital effects are professional, but still lack any creativity in the design and set up. After the wide variety of vistas Roland created in Day After Tomorrow, this is simply BORING!The script is another complete disaster, and not the fun kind. I have never wanted to throttle a lead character so much as I do Dr. Adrian Helmsley. In fact, most of the characters of color are written to portray completely pathetic wimps who know much but are ineffectual in dealing with the crises. These characters pretend to project altruism for humanity, but it's nothing more than self-satisfying, egocentric sentimentality. They don't have the integrity to make the necessary hard decisions. The only truly altruistic character is Jackson/John Cusak. It would have been more memorable if he had given his life to save the others.",2012

This movie was awesome.Maybe I was easily pleased because all the negative reviews here (and dismal 6.2 rating) got my hopes down. That may have helped. But this movie had all the big effects and action you hope for and expect.Also, kudos to the producers and advertising team for not ruining every twist of the movie. Sure, the ads showed a fair bit of the action, but not everything. There were cameos, good one-liners, action shots and pay-off shots all *not* revealed in trailers. Good stuff.When our viewing ended, the audience applauded the movie. We were pleased. 9 stars from me.",2012
362,lomaran-1,"Really Big ""Disaster"" Movie",3,19 March 2010,"Roland Emmerich clearly has a fascination with disaster movies. They make up a hefty chunk of his repertoire. ""2012"" is easily his most ambitious big-budget, large-scale disaster film yet. It may also be his worst. As is the case with most films nowadays, story, character, and just about all of the other ingredients vital to a good film take the back seat, making way for implausible scenarios that allow for maximum use of CGI. Needless to say, the graphics were top-notch. But as for the actual meat of the film, well...Perhaps the biggest disaster in this film was the story itself. It goes something like this: an unexplained increase of neutrino emissions from the sun is steadily cooking the earth from the inside out. As the earth's crust destabilizes, government agents from all corners of the globe must work to keep the whole situation a secret from the public while they move to protect the human race from extinction.The film is appallingly predictable from the get-go. Our star, John Cusack, plays an author who has separated from his wife: a detail that not only has no real bearing in the film, but, after having been done so many times already, is also obnoxiously predictable. While on a ""family outing"" to Yellowstone with his two annoying kids, he meets up with a wacko (Woody Harrelson), who believes the world is about to end. Of course, Mr. Wacko is exactly right, and John Cusack must race to save his family as the entire state of California slowly crumbles into the sea. The computer-generated devastation that follows is so mind-blowing that this viewer quickly realized the entire film was made just for this one scene.The remainder of the story becomes steadily less interesting, as the film's ""plot"" comes to bear even less resemblance to an actual ""plot."" Roland Emmerich manages to rip off just about every disaster film I can think of, including ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""Earthquake,"" ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""Titanic,"" and even Emmerich's own ""The Day After Tomorrow."" The film is clearly a vehicle for extravagant CGI, as every other scene involves a ridiculous and predictable escape from yet another collapsing city.Character development is left wanting, as I expected. John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor were likable, but they were the only ones who were. I found Cusack's ex-wife incredibly annoying and really wanted someone to slap his kids every time they shot him that oh-so-typical snotty look. His ex-wife's new boyfriend isn't much better. Mr. Wacko is kind of fun, for the short time he's on screen. The Russian boxer/billionaire and the president (Danny Glover) were okay. None of the others really stand out enough to comment on.The film doesn't lack suspense, though. Oddly, even though I knew the hero would triumph, there were a few scenes that had me hooked. A few of the main characters (to avoid spoilers, I won't say who) die in the end, which did actually surprise me. But in between this, you get pointless scenes to fill in the gaps, which are supposed to develop the characters but will really just put you to sleep.""2012"" is big, predictable, and disastrous in more ways than one. When it was over, I was actually a bit disappointed that Cusack didn't die. If he had, at least I'd have felt something actually happened.Thank goodness for Netflix. I'd never want to pay good money to see this ""disaster"" in the theater.",2012
363,okieindian,too much of a good thing,3,4 March 2010,"The movie is based on the old old old prediction that California is going to fall into the ocean (not much of a loss if that happens!) but expands to the WORLD. I love special effects in movies, but there is also too much of a good thing. If half the special effects were edited out, reducing the movie by an hour, or more less, (from 158 minutes down to say 90 minutes) the movie might not turn into a marathon of boredom. It just goes on and on and on... and on and on and on and on.. I don't mind wasting my time watching a bad movie, if it is acknowledged as a bad movie, but some folks in Hollywood must think this is a good movie, or it is just another grab the money and run production that seems to the norm..

365,tripxyde,2012 & the Not Too Serious Apocalypse?,6,13 November 2009,"Most of Roland Emmerich's movies have been mostly reminiscent of the 70's disaster movies like The Towering Inferno or Poseidon Adventure. These disaster movies are essentially survival horror, wherein we are introduced to main characters that we are supposed to root for and follow as they try to survive a peril or perils that could kill them. This movie more or less combines all of it for something which can be referred to as the ultimate disaster movie because this one deals with the end of the world. As what the movie portrays, 2012 is the year wherein changes in the Earth and in the overall atmosphere of the planet (that's as far as I can understand about the scientific aspect of the movie) will cause the Earth to experience global cataclysms and destruction, and basically may be interpreted as the end of the world as we know it.The doomsday theory of 2012 is one that is very paranoia inducing. Unlike the doomsday conspiracies of the year 2000 or previous end-of-the-world theories which were more religion-based or literary prediction-based, the 2012 concept is based on the Mayan calendar which is regarded with some degree of accuracy. That is why it is very interesting to watch a movie like this. On the other hand, do not expect to go into details on the Mayan calendar detail because there is only about half a minute of reference of that concept in the movie. Everything that is explained is more on the science aspect. In addition, the science aspect is laid down, but never dwells on the explanations. If you plan to walk on this movie and expect to delve into the deeper and more thought-provoking issues about why the world is about to end or how this prediction has come to become real, you may not be satisfied because it really focuses more on the plight of our main characters to survive the cataclysms. Most of the movie is focused on running from earthquakes, running from lava, running from flood. Even the drama takes a backseat.The movie felt like it needed a couple of more minutes of character development. There are pretty good characters here to work with. The old friends in the cruise ship, for instance, the movie needed more quiet moments with them. Every time the scenes simmer down, and you think there was going to be some character development about to happen, a great big special effect all of a sudden steals the moment and makes way for another destructive scene.It was not easy to walk into another Roland Emmerich movie, after his previous movie ""10,000 BC"" (pattern-wise is also a movie title referring to a date in time, one that he ignorantly altered by his fictionalized interpretation) made itself as one of the worst movies ever made, in my opinion. But it was a good thing that 2012 was not as bad as I feared it to be. In fact, it was really worth my money, and if I may add, a movie I recommend for the big screen. The visual effects are awesome and the stunts were exhilarating.The thing about this movie is that it takes this serious plausible concept and quickly turns it into a roller-coaster adventure. And that is one of the things that have given me this dual reaction; first I was upset with it because it takes this concept of paranoia and a plausible global cataclysm, and does not treat it with a very serious approach. It was a bit hard to swallow some action scenes which injected some humor because at one hand we are being shown scenes of extreme disaster and calamity, naturally the scene implies the horrific death of millions, yet elements of comedy are making its way unto it. If this was sci-fi involving alien invasions, it would have been forgivable to mix apocalyptic scenes of mass death with a sense of adventure.But on the other hand, by the middle of the movie, you realize that the light, somewhat comedic, moments were needed to be injected to please a wide audience. Otherwise, we could have ended up with a movie too serious and too depressing that, by the middle of the movie, may have caused people to walk out in just sheer displeasure.If you are one of those people who even remotely considers the 2012 doomsday conspiracy as plausible, this movie is indeed for you. It will both amaze and horrify you. Although it is indeed so ironic to refer to Emmerich's movies as a form of entertainment. I guess many of us Filipinos will be affected by this movie emotionally because of our experiences in recent unusual cataclysms. Many might hate it or many might relate to it.The concept of the end of the world is the ultimate horror movie concept to work on. Emmerich could have made the ultimate horror movie. I would have been impressed if such bold approach was made. But I could understand him not doing that and opting to make an audience-friendly movie instead. I just hope that this movie would have something similar with his other movie ""10,000 B.C."" and that is hoping that this will purely be all fiction.",2012

The only comment I would like to make, though, is how obvious and how telling some of Hollywood's strategies are being displayed here. Since storytelling has been invented by a couple of apes coming out of the Cro-Magnon era, the main, almost the only common factor in all narratives is Family. What is Cinderella but the story of families protecting and promoting their DNA? What is the Iliad and the Odyssey but competing families struggling to get their genes to procreate? What is the Sopranos... You get the point. 2012 is the history of a failed family (a divorce) getting back together after the new husband has been properly dispatched in a submarine turbine. The End.

To be honest, there are very few characters in 2012 that you really care about. The rich Russian guy named Yuri reminded me of Jabba the Hutt. At least he talked like Jabba. No tears were shed when he died in the movie. 2012 was 2 and a half hours too long. It could have been trimmed down to 2. John Cusack was good as a writer and divorced father but he was able to escape one too many destructive paths. It was like watching Rambo or John McClaine from Die Hard. Well, I guess you can't expect too much from the director who made Independence Day because he did make 2012 as well. And honestly, aside from the effects, I didn't much like Independence either.

It was impossible for me. Glover is movie enjoyment poison for me. There is no nuance, no depth, no feeling to the viewer that he even connects to the character he is playing.

But still, I had actually liked one of Emmerich's earlier movies, Independence Day. At least that had charming characters you rooted for.This one was simply a CGI fest, and not too good also I felt. Somehow the effect of the world getting destroyed was just not there. This is what too much of CGI can do. Or it probably is just a vindication of the fact that no matter how much special effects you have, you cannot replace a good script and good acting.I don't want to give the impression that I'm some sort of art house fanatic or that Cusack and Ejiofor are bad actors. I loved movies like the recent Star Trek and The Dark Knight. Its just that these guys were plain cheesy and over the top in this one. For starters, why the heck are we rooting for Cusacks family when the rest of humanity is going under? There is hardly any connect with the characters, which is required in this kind of flick which focuses on a group of survivors. I can get past the clichés of Cusack and co. escaping from every danger in the nick of time with hardly plausible scenarios. But this was plain bad. Even the supposedly ""deep"" scene between two monks near the Himalayas somewhere seemed laughably funny. Something about emptying your head and all. Yea, makes sense, if you want to enjoy this movie.I guess I should not be ranting when it was pretty obvious what will be in the movie. But it is sad when these kind of fare make hundreds of millions and genuinely felt movies hardly rake in anything. I think I will be giving Emmerich's movies a break for some time now.

(Except for the major Hollywood budget.) One of the only highlights about this film are the state of the art special effects that are used. Apart from that the narrative was slow, and the characters predictable. As always with this genre of film, there are several underlying romances, which take away from the main storyline, and drag the film into depths of corniness, which no self-respecting film fan would ever enjoy. This in turn just makes the film even more unrealistic. Not to mention the amount of near death misses the main characters have - if it was the end of the world do you really think John Cusack would survive?I only wish that if they want to a do a disaster film of this extent, the storyline should be able to withstand on its own, and not be secondary to the effects in hand.

Is that all Emmerich's has to offer in his portrayal of the legendary myth of the globes demolition?,4,21 October 2012,"Roland Emmerich brings the eminent conspiracy of global calamity in the year 2012 to life, providing us with a over-elaborate solution, saving only the rich and our protagonists. Considering Emmerich is the predominant for the disaster movie by an international freezing onslaught in The Day After Tomorrow (2004), placing a colossal lizard in the city with Godzilla (1998) and the extraterrestrial incursion of Independence Day (1996). Astray from his catastrophe movies, as Emmerich unquestionably finds contentment by inflicting deadly causes onto the realm of the planet; we have seen appalling exertions such as 10,000 BC that have deservedly injured the filmmakers' reputation. His career has been structured by the reliability of CGI and supervised editing by the ignition of buildings and the collapse of mountains.This addition plays no significance. It's over exuberant and carelessly predictable. Although Emmerich's favoured genre has been ever existent since the birth of cinema, Independence Day (1996) indisputably became a revelation to audiences as it is accepted that every household clutches onto a copy of Will Smith's big break in their DVD collection. Alas, additions such as The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, whilst aesthetically sound, lack efficiency therefore creating unavoidability for conventional ennui. Therefore, it seems Roland has lost his touch, although his enthusiasm to encapsulate the viewer continues to be at the vanguard of his creations. Here, the prime issue relates to the scenery itself and how it seems to look impractical. Some of Emmerich's preferences seem a little uncalculated, persuading us at first that the splendour of CGI is of unreal proportion, but on second viewing certain blips steer this effort towards generic filmmaking, thus the audience lacking in fervour for the heed of the picture. These glitches range from improbable escape routes for limousines and outbound flights escaping the fall of the ground into the earth's crust.Largely, although 2012 carries a heap of stimulation, deplorably after a while its impact is rather molecular, although significant to the allegory tale surrounding the year 2012 it fails to consequently demoralise our emotions. Prepare for a few huffs and puffs as you will become rather fatigued whilst chasing our leads in their hunt for survival.",2012
378,jwtrox08706,I'm not even surprised this made number one...the public eats $hit like homemade ice cream these days,3,17 November 2009,"Another apocalyptic movie to remind me of my own mortality. This time it's in your face: 2012. No need to ask what the plot is, or if there is one. You know from the earliest teaser that this film was going to be another one of the movies where Hollywood's flexes it's muscles in the special effects department. I'm tired of the movie scene these days. It's so bleak. We need a new George Lucas to make a movie that has the same effect as Star Wars, at least emotionally (Lord knows there's really no where else to go with advances in special effects). I like John Cusack. I find him to be a very talented actor, but he was seduced by the dark side of the force with this movie. Hey, Hollywood, get your heads out of your collective @$$ and start making movies with more meaning to them and stop making so much eye candy. It is my hope that this film will blend in with the rest of the eye candy that's been made in this decade and soon be forgotten. Maybe it'll have a cult following in 20 or 30 years or so and get remade.Plus this whole 2012 concept has been shoved down my throat, regurgitated and shoved back down over and over again to the point where I'm wishing we could just get to that particular date in the year 2012 and get through it and into the year 2013 so I can laugh at everyone who worried and fretted about it like everyone worried and fretted and blew out of proportion Y2K.",2012

Also, the devastation sequence and idea is pretty darn preposterous. However, this film has enough action and special effects to make it worth watching. I enjoyed it anyway. It's not Cohen Bros, it's not Tarantino ... but it's entertaining. Buit, am I the only person who thinks the storyline is VERY (and I mean VERY, VERY) similar to Ben Elton's classic first novel Stark?

380,adam_uk09,An excellent film spoilt by a few details!,8,28 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich does big budget disaster flicks as well as Dairylea does cheese, but in recent films, critics who say he relies too heavily on special effects have challenged his prowess as a director.Unfortunately, those critics better look away now, as his new film is the biggest yet.2012 takes place, well, in 2012 and features an array of big Hollywood names attracted none the less by the huge box office forecasts for the film. The premise is simple; here comes the end of the world and god should we run! With a reported budget of over $200m which is more than Michael Bay spent on his worldwide smash Transformers: Revenge of the fallen, Emmerich was certainly able to splash out on some eye popping CGI.2012 reads like The Day After Tomorrow on steroids, which is no bad thing, but that film was hideously underdeveloped so it would be a tragedy if the same thing has happened here.Thankfully, there is a back-story and it comes in many different forms. Thandie Newton and Danny Glover play president's daughter and president respectively, a great deal of emotion has gone into writing these two characters and their on-screen chemistry, albeit a small amount, is wonderful.John Cusack and Amanda Peet play divorced parents Jackson and Kate, only united by the love they share for their two young children and perhaps later on in the film, a few deeper emotions. Unfortunately these two share no chemistry and their on-screen scenes are flawed as a result.2012 doesn't have a huge deal of character development but it does improve on what was seen on The Day After Tomorrow and more recently, 10,000BC, with a deeper understanding of the characters. It ultimately succeeds in making the viewers share compassion for even the heartless characters in the film.Moving on to the saving grace of all disaster films; the special effects, fans of major cities being destroyed are going to be pleased here with some eye-watering action pieces really showing why perhaps Emmerich is the king of destroying practically every well known landmark in the world. There are a few questionable scenes, which look rather less than realistic, but this is a small point that doesn't need to be taken into account.Whilst all this may seem excellent, it all feels familiar, it's all been seen and done before, so in reality 2012 adds nothing new to the genre which is unfortunate because it really is an excellent film.Overall, 2012 is a mouth-watering treat in cinema engineering, apart from some lapses in scientific accuracy and some shaky special effects; it surpasses The Day After Tomorrow and similar disaster films by sheer depth. On the downside it adds nothing new to the formula, but if you want sheer popcorn entertainment; look no further.",2012
381,DirtyStarling,All Effects. No Substance.,3,5 December 2009,"Really the only thing I can recommend about this film is the special effects, especially a spectacular sequence of the destruction of Los Angeles. That part of the film is a technical masterpiece (and it's what they showed in the trailer for good reason). The first half of this movie is watchable just because of the special effects. Once you get to the halfway point, the effects start to slip a little bit (I felt the ice and water effects weren't that good) and once the effects go, the film goes.The story and characters are all bland clichés. You've got a several people trying to save their broken families and coming together or saving each other at the end, which has been done a billion times. You have the passionate scientist who cares about people against the dickish politician, which has been done a billion times. You have a bunch of landmarks getting destroyed, which looks cool, but it's been done a billion times. And you have arguments of humanity vs. survival which have been done a billion times, and much better than they're done here.When there are no special effects, there are one of two possible things going on. The first is broken families trying to survive (yawn). And the second is politicians arguing. Because when I think cataclysmic destruction of the world... my first thought is C-SPAN, and all the excitement of... watching senators, scientists, and yes-men getting annoyed with each other, making veiled threats, passionate speeches about what the other guy is doing wrong, and yelling about principles and matters of procedure which no one else really cares about.In all, I was really bored by this and the political BS just got on my nerves. It's really not an interesting movie. And I did start to nod off towards the end when it got REALLY stupid (they have the happy ending that defies all logic, just to have a happy ending).I could go into more detail, but I really just thought it was boring, especially after the half- way mark when the special effects started to look a little shabbier.3/10 - If you want to see some cool effects sequences, give it a look. Otherwise, it's just really dull.",2012
382,SebaZava,A cheesy yet entertaining end-of-the-world film.,7,30 November 2009,"2012 is not a particularly hard movie to review - that's because it belongs to such an specific sub-genre - the disaster/end of the world film - that it's almost impossible to be disappointed by it. That is, of course, if you watch it with the right expectations. One doesn't watch a film like 2012 expecting thorough characterizations, believable drama or exact science. All I expected from the movie was likable characters, amazing special effects and lots of destruction - and that's precisely what the film delivers. Because I went to see it with the right frame of mind, I enjoyed it. Granted, it isn't a good film by any means, but it's ridiculously entertaining, cheesy and visually exciting. And unlike films like Transformers 2 - which has very little redeeming value -, I didn't feel like my intelligence was being insulted. It simply wasn't required.2012 follows fiction writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), who is on holidays in Yosemite with his children, until an earthquake warning makes them return home, but not before he meets a seemingly-crazy guy named Charlie Frost. (Woody Harrelson.) He warns Jackson that the end of the world is coming on December 21st, and although he may seem to be talking rubbish at first, his theories - based on the Mayan calendar - eventually prove to be true. Anyhow, Jackson arrives at his ex-wife's (Amanda Peet) house, just as the destruction of Los Angeles is about to begin. And this is where all the special effects start appearing, and also when our protagonists have to start fleeing from all sorts of disasters in the most seemingly-inane ways possible.If there's one reason why people have flocked to see the movie, it is the special effects. And yes, these deserve a paragraph of their own because they are, simply put, amazing. Not credibly, mind you - these kinds of visually awesome disasters are almost impossible to make credible, and if they were, I'm sure they would be really boring - but interesting, tense and awe-inspiring. I'm not too sure which scenes involved a mixture of techniques and which ones involved pure CGI - well, maybe the more obvious ones would be the giant tsunami scenes -, but they all look breathtaking. Mind you, this is the end of the world we're talking about, so not only do they look incredible, but they also convey a sense of terror and desperation very hard to find in cheaper, lazier disaster films. The destruction of L.A. would be my favorite scene - not because you see lots of landmarks and recognizable places been destroyed - the city is pretty generic - but because it's a tense, pulse-pounding sequence that feels almost like a roller-coaster ride.Now, don't get me wrong - although that's the best scene, it is not the only one involving chaos. Unlike other disaster pictures - including director Roland Emmerich's own The Day After Tomorrow -, 2012 doesn't involve a couple of cities - it involves the whole world, and it involves a whole variety of disasters. We get floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, ash rain, volcano eruptions... well, you get the idea. And although the main focus of the film is on the U.S., we also get glimpses of Brazil and even the Vatican getting blown to smithereens. It's all very entertaining and also very visually dynamic, and the variety of it not only left me in awe, but also made me realize I was watching the ultimate disaster film - it will be very hard for any filmmaker to top 2012.And what about the actors? Emmerich, surprisingly enough, managed to get a very impressive roster of character actors - John Cusack, Amanda Peet and the amazingly insane Woody Harrelson I've already mentioned, but we've also got Chiwetel Ejiofor as a scientific adviser to the U.S. government, Danny Glover as the President, Thandie Newton as his daughter - and a potential love interest for the aforementioned scientist -, Oliver Platt as a somehow tired stereotype of the overambitious, selfish politician, and even Chin Han (""Mr. Lau"" from The Dark Knight) in a small but significant role. They all fulfill their roles adequately and without looking too ridiculous but, most importantly, they understand that for both the filmmakers and their audience, they are less important than the special effects and the thrills the film has to offer.The conclusion is silly - and has a very sci-fi feel to it - and there are some very fatuous, ridiculous moments, but the overall package is satisfying, if not completely successful. The screenplay is unapologetically cheesy - and some of the lines these respected actors have to say are simply terrible, but in a hilarious sort of way - and the direction is as over-the-top as it could be, but the amazing special effects and the whole grandeur the filmmakers convey more than compensates for it. And unlike directors like Michael Bay, who don't seem to know how to hold a camera still or how to maintain a shot for more than half a second, Emmerich allows his audience to be amazed by the special effects, providing with many epic ""money-shots"" and competent action sequences. 2012 may not be a ""good"" movie in the traditional sense of the word, but it certainly is lots of fun. Yes, cheesy, over-the-top and even a little long, but fun.",2012
383,sugar_daddyo,Special Effects Extravaganza,6,2 December 2009,"Every so often Hollywood manages to up the ante when it comes to special effects. Assuredly, the thrill of this movie comes in the moments spent wondering how will it look when the world ends. Emmerich doesn't disappoint.John Cusack stars as an everyman who doesn't save the world a la Randy Quaid style in Independence Day, but instead as an example of ""nature choosing her own from among her own."" This rather unique element lends the story a sense of credence as one imagines that is just how the apocalypse might play out: random nothing short of miraculous survivors alongside the wholly undeserving. However, the impersonal becomes personal at the conclusion as unlikely survivors are snuffed out gratuitously and cruelly.Makes one wonder what 2022 will be like in 10 years.",2012
384,whatever_123,Wow.......,2,16 November 2009,"I've said it once, and I'll say it again, SPECIAL EFFECTS DO NOT MAKE A GOOD MOVIE. Obviously the director, producer, and everyone involved in making the movie didn't know that. This is what too many of those directors out there think a movie is. They are all wrong. May I also say that I'm disappointed in the people who wrote good reviews for this movie. Let me explain. First of all, the acting was terrible. I loved Liam James (mostly because he is in Psych, the best TV show ever) and the little girl was adorable and the crazy guy who had that radio station in Yellowstone National Park was fun to watch, but other then those three, all the other characters were just plain boring to watch. Also note that I don't even remember half the characters' names. Anyway, the actors' facial expressions weren't very convincing, and the way they delivered their lines was robotic. Another thing, the characters were not memorable, and it was hard to connect with them. I didn't care about the characters who died at all, because I felt no connection with them at all. Second of all, the situations the characters were in were absolutely ridiculous! One minor character in the beginning calls another character, talks to them about something that has nothing to do with the plot that I could tell, and his car randomly blows up. It had nothing to do with the story, and was completely unnecessary to see. At another point, one major character is stuck in a bus looking for a map (of something that wasn't explained very well) and the back of the bus is on fire because a meteor hit the back. A crevice opens up on the ground and the bus falls into it backwards. The family all think he's dead, until he climbs back out of the crevice with barely a scratch on him. Totally ridiculous. In another scene, the family is driving their car crazily through the streets that started undulating and heaving upward. Thousands of crevices open up, and buildings are falling everywhere. The car crashes into stuff, and even flies over a huge crack on the ground. After this chase, the car is crushed and the doors fall off, but the people inside are unhurt, not even shaken at least. Good Grief. Third of all, for a movie with explosions and disaster scenes, it sure had slow, dull moments. There was too much of ""Should we run toward or away from the danger?"" and ""Should we rescue the important people only, or everybody?"" I wanted to yell at the screen, ""JUST RUN, ALREADY!!!"" Also, they focused too much on the main family in the movie. I sat through too many scenes where they are just doing normal, boring stuff, like talking about the whole divorce thing that must have been going on (but it wasn't important at all to the plot). Last of all, this movie, like too many movies these days, is a showcase of all the fancy, realistic (well, not really) wonders that can be produced by modern computer technology. The only reason I sat through the movie was so I could see buildings crumble and collapse, volcanoes explode, and huge tsunamis crash onto millions of screaming people. I didn't care for any of the characters, as I've said before. When characters died, I felt no sympathy. I didn't even think, ""that's too bad"". I just said to myself, ""Okay, is this thing over yet?"" Two good things about 2012: The action scenes were mildly thrilling (note: I only said MILDLY thrilling) and it didn't end like Knowing did (with ALIENS). Don't bother spending twelve bucks on this disaster of a movie (Hahahaha). You're better off staying FAR AWAY from it.",2012
385,WilderMovieReviews,As a disaster movie it doesn't get much better than this.,9,19 March 2012,"Roland Emmerich has done it again. He seems to get a kick out of bringing out humanities worst fears and putting them on screen in all its glory. After destroying a large part of the world in Independence Day: ID4, and trashing New York with Godzilla, he decides to go the rest of the way and change the face of the earth forever and in the process kill off most of humanity. What is the enemy this time? Aliens? Nope done that. Monsters? Nope also done that. Bad weather? Once again done that. What is left? I know lets have the sun spit out solar flares that heat up the earth's core and destabilize the planet! Whatever his problem with humanity is, it translates well on to film. This is an epic disaster movie. No part of the world is safe and there is no magic quick fix here.The film itself is simple, massive destruction minimal plot. But in this case it really works. With amazing effects and a great cast that includes John Cusack, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover and the story is played out well and the acting is good. It is not too over the top except the stand out performance from the great Woody Harrelson. He is your go to guy when you are looking for crazy, and once again he pulls off the crazy guy effortlessly.I really enjoyed this film and I think it has been given an unfairly hard time by critics and movie goers alike. I don't understand what people expected from this film. It is a disaster film not The Shawshank Redemption! I expected disaster and destruction and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't expect award winning performances by the actors (many of who are award nominees and winners), and I didn't expect a plot more complicated than oh s**t, we are going to die what can we do? Many viewers and critics must have forgotten the other films by Roland Emmerich when viewing this or they were comparing it to other films that were released at the same time. However I judge a film on its own merit and not comparing it to films that are in a different category. As a disaster movie it doesn't get much better than this.",2012

But despite that, I still enjoyed this movie, its not a bad movie, it just could have been so much better than it is.I am a Science Fiction writer, and there were several things that I would have down sooooo... different.for one, I would have given this movie a proper movie title that would've given it a shelf life beyond 2012. I would have named it ""The Great Cancellation"" or something like that.secondly, I would have those Ark ships as Space ships (as the movies has us to believe until they actually find them)...yes, I would have made those space ships. Then I would have ended the movie with those space ships blasting off into space, the survivors would've watched from space as the Earth's crust melts into liquid magma.... then I would've ended it with those space ships floating through space towards destination unknown......If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with ""2012"" a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities.

It was totally unnecessary for Gordon to die. I was pretty mad when it happened...ruined the movie for me quite a bit. I mean...the kids loved him, his girlfriend loved him, he saved John Cusack's character and his (ex-)family 3 times while flying the planes (even a AN-225...while he was only familiar with one-engined planes :) ). He was a fun character and should have ended up with the kids and girlfriend. Maybe John Cusack's character could have ended up with the Russian girl. Other characters that didn't have to die...the Russian girl. The frickin' dog survived it again...boehoe :( That big Russian guy. It was such a strange character...he seemed like a good guy...had a couple of funny scenes...and than suddenly he turned bad for a while...ah, stupid.

388,Apemangalore,The very definition of dumb fun,5,15 November 2009,"Based on Roland Emmerich's previous disaster films, I was expecting nothing more than a campy, yet occasionally fun, and visually stunning experience, upon going into 2012. And wouldn't you know it, Emmerich came through, unintentionally delivering one of the best comedies of the year.As expected, the visual effects in 2012 are absolutely stunning, with the first major sequence - ironically - being the most memorable one. Due to the stupidity of many of the characters actions, however, that sense of awe is somewhat diminished. Also, I think the reason why I found the first destructive sequence to be the most spectacular is because all of the ones that follow are essentially repeats of that: Mother nature throws literally everything she's got at us, we just barely manage to escape, then land at a safe zone for a brief period of time.The acting in this film, surprisingly, isn't half bad. While both John Cusack's and Chiwetel Ejiofor's characters are boring, to say the least, they still manage to come across as relatively likable. Oliver Platt also does a fine job, delivering what are easily some of the best lines in the film. It seems like Woody Harrelson is the only one who understands what kind of movie he's in, and as a result, makes the most of his short performance.2012 really is one cheesy, melodramatic, cliché-ridden piece of cinema, but personally, that's where I found the film to be rather funny. Those who are only searching for sheer spectacle should not feel cheated by paying to see this in a theater, as 2012 is also the very definition of dumb fun.",2012

As with most disaster films that threaten the world, this one is right out of the rule book and only happens in America. Turns out the Mayan civilisation many years ago worked out the world would end because of a solar flare. The same solar flare disrupts the workings of the earth and the crust moves about a bit. Great special effects. Typical divorced family unit where the father forgets everything and they get back together at the end when the mothers boyfriend is killed (wont say how as it will spoil it) So with the earth now moving about a bit, the north pole ends up where I wonder? oh yeah Wisconsin right slap bang in the middle of the US as these things only happen to the US. Getting to the bit where I nearly left; the president sits down in the white house (or whats left of it) saying ""my fellow Americans this is the most catastrophic event to happen to our nation"" Right what about the rest of the world? Are we all lying in the sun having a smoke and a beer? I was actually expecting this after watching other of Mr Emmerich's creations and he delivered. Disaster movie, only affecting the USA, minor glimpses of the rest of the world, might end up somewhere that we don't see. If this does happen, I'm booking my holiday (vacation) on the US/Mexico border for Christmas 2012",2012

The story line is not so effective. Direction was OK in the first half of the movie, but later all the focus was just on the Giant Ship and the unnecessary climax scene in which the ship's door was stuck due to some hydraulic failure. The great savior of Hollywwod style goes inside the water to remove the cable from the stuck wheels and so on. When the whole world is dying John Cussac character becomes so important that he should not die and a lot of focus given to this one particular guy. American president is dying that's no problem, but this Limo Driver is so important.Armageddon will happen. But the world will Not End so soon, I hope so. Human souls will not get relief from pain and pleasure so soon. Jesus Christ will come before the end of the world. And he will establish Islamic reign all over the world.

392,phaylen,What Entertainment is About,10,21 November 2009,"2012 was one of the most sophisticated, high concept speculative pieces of film making in recent years. Big budget ""Event"" films are always panned by critics because they have garnered a stigma for lacking substance and relying on special effects to rake in the box office dough. Sometimes this is true. In the case of 2012, however, it is absolutely false. It reminded me, as someone who hasn't been to the movies in a couple of years (I tend to be indifferent to recent titles and wait for the DVD)what entertainment is about. It reminded me that films don't have to be super-serious art house dramas to be enjoyed - or at least to be confident in admitting We enjoyed it.I spent a roller coaster ride in a darkened theater for over two hours. It was intense, thrilling, emotional, and SHOCKER - it even compelled the audience to think. 2012 never tries to pretend it is anything more than exactly what it is - An adventure thriller that speculates the end of the world. It introduces us to relevant characters so the story is not simply one special effect after another. You develop an investment in their plight - rarely do big budget films allow you to make that connection with fully realized characters.This is more than just a disaster film of epic magnitude: Although Roland Emmerich has rightfully earned the title ""The Master Of Disaster."" It is the perfect film to lose yourself in for awhile, and leaves you with great tabletop conversation afterward. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys great character driven films with high octane visual spectacles!",2012

I am a big fan of John Cusack and this is a comeback make him more rich movies..I like him on the screen and as an actor. It was very lengthy and just lingered on...it took you on an visual effects roller coaster but when the ride was over then came, but just a lot too late was the seriousness of selfishness, some who had the money and those who didn't and would have been left which is in general America at its fineness...so the effects ride was a high only to come crashing down to a more important somber subtext.Thandie Newton..her role was not needed at all...I have never seen her in a kissing or love scene with a non white leading character, (and don't say Crash, Matt Dillon was up her skirt, not Terrence Howard!) so I am sure this role was new for her too...and just think her mom is African! Danny Glover...like him very much too..we could have done without the ""ash white face on Mr. Glover"" may have be realistic but it just looked like old 30s typecast films.I also found an error in the President's name...during the movie he was Wilson but in the end when the Geologist was begging the Captain to allow all on the ""Ark"", he said President Obama or something similar..big flaw...and of course seeing John Cusack escape all the turmoil and perils was just a bit tooo unreal. And the same old hasbeen ex husband and wife seeing or married to a more upscale and wealthy suitor...bland!!!!...Woody Harrelson had the move important role in the whole movie and he role was big dill pickle!..if he hadn't not explained how we came to 2012 in his cartoon..we would not know why 2012....but the major inaccuracy in the movie is the world will not end with water or flooding ever again, Noah obeyed God and God promised in Genesis to never to destroy mankind with flooding ever again..it should be fire the next go round...so the fireballs made more sense....Oh and I couldn't end without saying and Cusack's son helping his father to get the door latch shut under water for how long???? and then when Cusack fixed the problem, the boy ""under"" water yells ""Dad!!""...wide open mouth, under water ..holding his breath for a good 30 mns or more it seemed....how unreal...So as we know, no need to discuss, criticize or complain at this point, it will make mucho money and only because all have heard and receive a taste of the effects in the trailer and secondly all are still trying to guess when the world will end....",2012

It's a sad state of affairs when we watch films about the end of the world, and we have no emotion towards the outcome.Oliver Platt plays once again the moral slime-bucket that he's done in previous films. Danny Glover feels like a night custodian at the local hospital than he does as President, and Woody Harrelson delivers a performance so misguided and buoyant that I thought he was channeling a retarded version of Hunter S Thompson.

The little girl is more upset about losing her hat than the concern that all her friends might die. (and that's bad considering she isn't shedding a tear for that hat...) In fact, you wouldn't even be able to tell that these kids has any friends. I couldn't even figure out if the boy had a single friend in the movie. It's never brought up anyway, because the parents are too busy bickering. There's nothing likable about these characters, they are completely void of any personality and there is literally zero character development. Early in the movie we are shown that the girl wets her bed at night, but it seems to magically go away. Let's face it, it would take away the focus on the CGI by dealing with this personal issue, so during the disaster she doesn't wet herself a single night. Convenient.The mother comes of as a really cold-hearted queen B, just watch the ending and see how grateful she is to her new boyfriend who has risked his life several times for her children and in general has been there for them every single day for what I assume is the past couple of months. Her boyfriend was really the only character who I liked in the movie. He was kind, risked his life for the kids and despite not liking her ex he still risked his life for him also. Yet he is treated like the most evil villain of all movies because he is the only obstacle for mommy and daddy getting together again. That's it really. And when he gets hurt, the mother and kids barely care. It made me feel disgusted!The story is very forgettable and just doesn't seem very logical. I mean sure, since the characters are so void of any form of concern and care for others, then I can see why it would be realistic for the world leaders to not even attempt to help the citizens from this disaster. They have what... 2-3 years to prepare? Do they even attempt to get people moved to an area least likely to be hit? No. Do they try to reinforce places to allow people a chance? No. Do they let people know in advance of the disaster so they can mentally prepare for the unavoidable? No. Let's face it, that would force the characters to have emotions, personality and character development. And that would be a disaster for this movie! So all the world leaders in this movie are scumbags. And since there's such a big focus on these scumbags, you have yet another set of people you could care less about and is forced to like. Ironically, this makes ""Big Impact"" seem like a masterpiece in comparison. At least there the president was concerned for the citizens and made sure people were prepared if the world was going to end.The only good thing about the movie is the CGI. Outstanding special effects, which unfortunately, is not enough to endure the torture of watching the rest of the movie.",2012
397,c-conley90,Same old Emmerich baloney re-packaged as 2012.,1,19 September 2012,"Yes, you've seen it all before people, the same disaster movies in countless other films. Better films, Earthquake, Volcano, Dante's Peak, The Poseidon Adventure, Armageddon, Emmerich's own The Day after Tomorrow. Yes, Emmerich rounds out his over 2 hr flick with stock characters from War of the worlds(Spielberg version), and other disaster movie clichés in a truly boring turkey of a movie. And when it gets to the original part, the whole oh let's put the rich people on an ark crap and let the poor normal people die in the disaster. Never have I seen more of a elitist,somewhat racist plot point ever. And you know, John Cusack and his little annoying boring family will live, there's no suspense for us. There's nothing, but a really elitist, clichéd pile of garbage disaster movie to sit through. Were Emmerich should have just forgone special effects and put in stock footage from better disaster movies. It would have saved money on special effects. And I thought oh, Emmerich couldn't get any worse after shamelessly using the issue of global warming as a front liner for his next disaster spectacular. But here he is after so many awful movies from him, this the just crap. You know, Godzilla was bad, and so was day after tomorrow and 10,000 B.C. well let's not even get into that, but this is much worse. This so worse than Transformers 2, I mean at least Michael Bay put something in the movie that wasn't the same old cliché, hell he almost killed both of the main characters in the movie off. At least his characters weren't total cardboard cutouts. And it had at least better special effects than this. Oh don't see this movie, please don't watch it on TV, when there's nothing left on. Run, run for your lives and when 2012 comes and goes, laugh at this movie for it's outdated title and stupidity. And please someone stop Emmerich from directing another movie.",2012

399,drnrg31,John Cusak is Superman,5,20 November 2009,"I give this movie a 5 because of Special Effects. They are spectacular, but I also reserve some points for actor John Cusak. Not only is he fastest human being ever, but he can defy gravity, withstand explosions and apparently is a better driver than the Indy 500 racers. I will not spoil the movie, but there is one scene I must tell you about.*Spoiler* he is apparently outrunning flaming fires in Yellowstone Park to get to a camper where he must find the map to the location of the arks of salvation. Naturally he finds it in time, but just as the ground opens up and swallows him and the camper up.....but wait, that's not so..no,no,no, somehow he held on to the concrete(even though it must be smoldering hot) and managed not only to climb out ,but to muster up enough strength to catch up to his family in the plane. But here is the best part..His clothes were picture perfect. Not even a little dust. Mind you this was the same clothes he had on when he apparently almost fell to his fiery death. I'm convinced John Cusak is Superman.If you enjoyed this scene, then there are about 10 more on the way.If you are a John Cusak fan; like me, then you will enjoy his performance, if not, then you are in for a crappy time, because the rest of the movie was just an unbelievable, cliché filled, emotionless, disaster movie. Way to go Hollywood.LOL!!!!!",2012
400,nethlyn,Too little film for too great a cost - but it will be the 2nd best Blu Ray test disc to date after Avatar...,5,6 December 2009,"In fact I'm wondering if the Blu Ray will end up gold-plated for the amount of money thrown at the screen. I gave it half-marks because you can at least see where that cash went just by watching it.The main spoiler, is that there is no plot to spoil. The upside is you get 40 minutes of general setup but only for 4-6 characters, then it's a destruction-fuelled roller-coaster ride to the end. The problem is, we've had September 11th for real, the telephoning and saying goodbye to loved ones and total lack of hope happened for real eight years back so it's overtly cynical to manipulate the audience that way - 2012's emotional blackmail makes Spielberg's trademark sentimentality look ice cold.Also I can see the general subtext here, the most featured deaths along the way happen to people who've had affairs or let down their family in some way without any attempt to fix it, though there is the standard Hollywood ""Redemption by Act III"" for one unpleasant character in the party of survivors. The pace of the destruction lets you forget that you're getting variations on the same death scenes, but the whole end feels tacked on and boring.So if you have Blu-Ray player and a flat TV of 37inches and above...you could probably pass on 2012 bar maybe a rental.",2012
401,jhuni_x,Too many mindless escape from disaster scenes,5,26 June 2010,"The movie was off to a good start, Helmsley was introduced to the impeding disaster and the audience was presented a decent explanation of why this disaster is going to happen, which certainly helps. It would've been insulting to the audience's intelligence if they just said here is the disaster, it is happening, with no explanation as to why. Then there is an interesting build-up and we get to see some interesting and thought provoking scenes.But then the disaster starts to strike, and Jackson has to escape from it and at this point the producers expect you to go into mindless mode, stop asking questions, stop thinking and just watch our expensive and fancy special effects in a series of disaster escape scenes. And there is just to many of these escape scenes, they start to get boring. This movie goes on two and a half hours, they could have seriously cut out forty or so minutes by just getting rid of some of these mindless escape scenes, then the movie would be far better.They just introduce the audience to the idea that the poles are shifting and the world's plates are being rearranged without any satisfactory explanation, and there is immense flooding and they only spend a couple minutes talking about why this is happening. Cut out some of these action scenes and put in some more content explaining things.This movie contains a copious amount of biblical references, for example the boats are called ""Arks"", there is an immense flood that these boats escape from using their advanced technology, and there is a reference to Mount Ararat in the alternative ending. These biblical references are not explained and they assume the viewer has prior knowledge of the bible. These biblical references do not belong here.Additionally, I felt that the Yuri character did not belong here, but then again he may have been useful in conveying the point that only very rich elites will have the power to escape a disaster like this one. Overall I give this film a 5/10. This film isn't that bad, it has some relatively nice special effects but it relies on them too much rather then investing in a good thought-provoking plot.",2012

403,TomCruiseFan99,I loved it!!! What else do you need to know?,10,9 December 2009,"Firstly, I love disaster movies. Titles like Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Core, The Day After Tomorrow, etc... sure, they won't win awards for acting or plot line, but their aim is to entertain.They all follow a certain formula: scenes of destruction; humans in danger; our heroes always making lucky escapes and happy endings all around. Does this film follow that same formula? Yes and no. The destruction is on a much grander scale, unlike any disaster movie you've seen before. Roland Emmerich this time sets a new bar for CGI effects, and the film is really a roller-coaster ride after the build-up of the first 15 minutes.The acting performances were better than expected in my opinion. It helps when you got ""more-than-decent"" actors in the lead roles, such as John Cusack; Chiwitel Ejiofor; Oliver Platt, etc. And while the plot may seem to be clichéd, it does manage to spring a surprise or two along the way. And don't be swayed by those who claim this movie is ""unrealistic"", well duh, it's about the end of the world, what were they expecting? An art-house human drama? 2 and a half hours of pure, non-stop thrills and close-calls. I love it!!!",2012
404,omahonyjason,Predictable Disaster Movie without Characters to care for!,5,3 December 2009,"This is an epic adventure about a natural disaster and the struggle for survival in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, callous politicians and a media interested only in the money shot, personal misery be damned. Sounds like the lot of the all too many flood victims either in New Orleans in 2005 or in Ireland in the last few weeks but it's actually the premise of a new movie, 2012.Roland Emmerich, its director, has brought us a whole slew of apocalyptic movies in the past, including INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996), which I loved, GODZILLA (1998), which I hated and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004), which didn't make much of an impression one way or the other.His latest comes to the theatre with an Oscar-calibre cast, including the always watchable Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover and Amanda Peet and the seldom less than wonderful John Cusack. So I was hoping for a film as laugh out loud enjoyable as INDEPENDENCE DAY, a witty, roller coaster thrill of a movie, with all the visceral spills in all the right places. What I got, unfortunately, was closer to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, a film which, while by no means as dreadful as GODZILLA, never really scales the heights, happy to just float along, a piece of flotsam and jetsam in the ocean of disaster movies, not good enough to break through the clutter but not bad enough to be remembered for being truly brutal.The basic premise is ridiculous, but that in itself is no bad thing. The Mayan's, apparently, believed the world would end in 2012 and so, as is the way of such films, out comes the dodgy science to explain the apocalypse. The sun's activity is ramping up and a new type of nuclear particle has been formed. The new particles act in a similar manner to microwaves and are heating the earth from within and, as the core heats up, the crust is becoming unstable, leading to a series of earthquakes and tsunamis, which will, eventually, overwhelm the entire planet.Humans, of course, being clever little buggers, have cottoned on to what's happening. Well, some scientists have and a few eccentrics, like the hilarious Woody Harrelson. The scientists are well on the way to building 'ships' with the capacity to save a tiny fraction of the population, along with a number of important art works and a selection of animals. John Cusack, though a series of coincidences that are so wild as to almost beggar belief, finds out about the 'ships' and sets off to rescue his kiddies and his childhood sweetheart, Amanda Peet. As the movie progresses it delivers on what was promised in the trailer, but that's about it. All the best bits are in that, and, while it's fun watching well known landmarks disappear in a puff of smoke, the movie doesn't really have enough, either by way of plot, character, set pieces, or truly outstanding special effects to sustain it for its close to two and a half hour running time.Given the immediacy of global warming and the disastrous floods of recent times, surely a movie like this could have wonderful characters that the audience can empathise with, a horrifying story and amazing special effects? Now wouldn't that be something to see? A movie with characters you genuinely care about while things are falling down and blowing up! Or they could just give the $200 million that this cost to make to the victims of flooding but I suppose that's too unbelievable a story-line for even a movie.",2012
405,rajandey,Deep Impact + Great SFX = 2012,5,3 December 2009,"2012 had so much potential, it had everything from a big budget, the catastrophe director Emmerich, a nice cast.. and above all, the actual hype about 2012.Still, the movie has failed to impress me, why? I'll tell you why, this movie is a lot like a movie called Deep Impact, which released like a decade ago, everything I saw in 2012 resembled DI. If only they used spaceships in stead of the Arks, that would make it different. Roland Emmerich uses the same special effects, as he did in The day after tomorrow, repetitive SFX though still nicely executed.Acting wise, John Cusack stood out along with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Amanda Peet. The Russian dude was quite funny. All in all, I am very disappointed with the outcome, commercially this movie might be doing well (because of the hype of course), but critically I believe this movie fails in the eyes of a lot of its customers.I am rating this movie 5 out of 10 solely for the SFX and John. Avoid this movie if you are looking for a nice story, go for it if you want a nice popcorn flick with good SFX.",2012
406,hendry-robert,It was the PC undertones I didn't like,6,15 November 2009,"Great thrilling disaster film, no doubt about that.But for me (as I expected) it was the overbearing leftists and PC undertones all the way through the film. Their not serious or even obvious but they are there. All black and Asian characters were portrayed as noble and righteous along with the women and the kids. Not so for the white male characters. An assortment of selfish no gooders, crazies, greedy Russian oligarths, and failed writers and fathers. The majority of the audience would never notice it, but those like me who see politics in almost everything (which is fact) will spot it instantly. I just wish mainstream film makers would quite the self loathing stance because its rampant in the mainstream. Just a bit of balance would have been nice.Still, its a pretty decent couple of hours to spend watching the spectacle so I would recommend it from that perspective whole heartedly.",2012
407,drakula2005,And the Oscar goes to...,7,14 November 2009,"I have just came back from a screening of the movie, and i have to admit i liked it.Something you should expect from Roland Emmerich is the good SFX and of course...well, the disaster type of plot.And the plot is obvious-the world comes to an end as we all know it, the people try to save themselves and etc. , etc...But this time it was a little bit different.I don't know if it was, because of the effects or because of the cast(especially Woody Harrelson-hilarious as ever!), the movie managed to give me something, i haven't seen or felt since ""Independence"".There weren't any Oscar performances, but the cast really made the binding and the chemistry between them.That helped improving upon Emmerich's last tries(especially 10K B.C.).The rewards they might and will receive is in the SFX's zone of the movie.Looked from this angle, the movie was one hell of a roller coaster ride!The intensity was great, not too slow, although there was a place for more improvement, which could've made the movie even a better ride for us, moviegoers. After all the characters were likable, we received a different, new angle of the end of the world type of movies, and it was entertaining and epic enough.THE Master of the end of the world/disaster movies won't disappoint, because 2012 is THE Ultimate Disaster Movie ever made!!!It's an epic journey, won't disappoint!!!

That about sums up that movie.Well, at least it is honest in a way - in fact the only ones to survive a global catastrophe would be rich people. No fun watching that.Okay, if you are a rich Hollywood director you may find that somewhat entertaining.I don't. The audience in the cinema shouted ""Die, die, die"" when seeing all the rich entering the ark.Didn't help that they put in some ""little people"" to wrap the crappy story around.

409,metallipowerman5000,Couldn't make it half-way threw !!!,2,20 December 2009,"Okay let me just be clear here, I NEVER turn movies off in the middle. This movie was SO HORRIBLE, I actually took notes to describe exactly WHAT is so bad or inaccurate about it.First, when John and his children walk into the dried up lake area, the military comes out of nowhere, along with a helicopter! How original! It's not like I haven't seen this in 8 THOUSAND other movies before!So I figured, okay maybe that was a fluke, every movie has something cheesy about it.That was..... Until I started noticing the one character with the stupid Indian accent, that really took a very short time to get annoying, because OF COURSE the director of this movie has to literally flood this movie with cultural diversity.... Otherwise people might accidentally confuse him with a racist somehow..... The movie was also loaded to the ceiling with stupid catch phrases, cliché lines and totally obvious moments, that every 5 seconds you swear you've seen this movie somewhere before! Not to mention the bad acting ALMOST makes you forget about all of this.The one thing that really got on my nerves was the continuously lame attempts at drawing out little dramatic moments. For example, whenever there was a silent or boring moment in the film, out of nowhere comes a military chopper sound just screaming for your attention! And of course then you see the helicopter fly right by the screen or in the background! How original, I bet he stayed up for endless nights and lost massive amounts of sleep coming up with that million dollar idea!The movie is also loaded with tons of unrealistic sound effects, like when the floor starts to crack in the supermarket, you hear a "" tearing "" noise.....hmmmmm...... The only way I can explain this logically is, the director is completely deaf, or just doesn't care.Danny Glover is in this movie, which is great, but his assistant needs acting lessons and might want to step into a NYC comedy club once in a while, since he obviously has forgotten what a ""joke"" is, because he is not funny.... Basically I'm not even going to make a joke about him, because I'd probably feel like I was making fun of a retarded person.This movie had an excellent idea, take an actual apocalyptic scenario from Myan carvings, and put it into action.... And since the Myans actually believed the world would end in 2012, their calenders ended at such date. It's sad such an original premise of a movie had to come to such a silly fate at the hands of this so called director.Another thing I noticed was, when they were driving off in the limousine trying to escape the ground shattering beneath them, was the fact that his limo sounded exactly like an 1980's Ferrari GTO....... Instead of.....maybe a LIMO!And when they try to pilot the plane, they find that one guy who says the Oh-So-Popular Hollywood line......."" oh not me! I've only taken a few lessons!!!"" Please don't even get me started on that one.And WTF is up with the plane scene in general!? I was actually confused as if I was watching a pathetic action movie, or Star Wars! I seriously almost died laughing at how STUPID that scene was.Besides, they pull the plane up to a frigging gas station and just fill up, like it's there moms Honda accord! That plane required Jet A, NOT gasoline! Not to mention, that plane would NEVER be able to fly on regular pump gas, even IF it was a piston aircraft. Piston aircraft require at least 110 LL octane just to fly. Obviously the highest octane the average stations carry is 93 octane, which would still be extremely dangerous to do.But every story has a surprise, and mine is no exception.The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars, was because of Woody Harrelson. He was THAT funny.....This movie is the attention-whore of Doomsday Action movies. It does absolutely nothing short of sell itself out to bad acting, ridiculously fake action sequences and incredibly dull humorous moments.This movie is horrible, period..... The only reason I wrote this review was to warn others of how bad this movie is.",2012
410,yarik83,Yet another one of those ones,5,1 November 2011,"Film, the final frontier. Movie makers boldly go where no other movie makes have gone before... or do they? It is not a secret that apocalyptic movies draw crowds and that they sell because they cover ""what if"" questions that public raises but cant quite visualize. MOvie 2012 has a lot of potential with respect to material it can cover. In the end, however it delivered just like ""day after tomorrow"" did. Its a movie that when you are done watching it you quite literally say... ""yeah OK I guess it had an entertaining value to it but I will never watch it again"". Movie covered the obvious.. end of the world as we know it in 2012. They went into what could be classified as a preseason that established facts of early occurrence detections. It also went into talking about how rich are the only ones to go and of course it associated probable with some scientific observations. It is interesting that they chose to feature yellowstone but they did not give it enough place and time to sink in. It is interesting that they chose to use tsunamis that came in the end of the movie but again they almost did not make sense because significant portion of this earth (well inland portion) is located higher than even 1 mile high elevation. It would imply that even with tectonic shifts you would expect to see a lot more land available especially a month after tsunami hit. I like how they used earthquakes to kind of bring it all together but a few things were flawed with the movie... err take that back.. just about everything was flawed with the movie except the beginning. #1 choice of actors... OK fine but did they really need to make 90% of cast cheezy? #2 CGI. It was so bad that they made entire movie look like it was done on a home computer. Yes it was detailed and yes animators had some fun but we barely get to see any of it because director thought it was more appropriate to concentrate on filming cast faces 90% of the time. Most of the elements of what was happening were very unrealistic such as flying airplane while all kinds of debree is falling all around it but not on the plane itself. Then we have world's largest airplane maneuvre like its a cesna while flying over the city. #3 the arcs... really? In the alternative ending they were shown to be about 100 times bigger than a huge cruise ship which takes 3-5 years to build. Logistically speaking it would be impossible to build 1 such ship in 3-5 years.. let alone 10 ships or however many there were. More importantly if it was possible to build such ship then it would have to be next to where water, factories, mills, work force et cetera. Delivering bazillion tons of construction materials to top of tibet mountains is physically impossible in 3 years time. #4 the arcs. Umm.. why wern't they built to be submarines or submarine like? Would it not be easier to wait out tsunami and surface unscaved? #5 Transportation of animals to the compound. It is unbelievably cold at that altitude and no giraffes or elephants or any animal for that matter would survive the wind chill while dangling on a piece of rope. #6 aftermath. OK if crust has shifted.. what happened to spewing lava? I thought that because of crust shift land would be deformed since it is destablized. If land was deformed then water would get to where magma is and either evaporate or seep down and not randomly rise for eternity. #7 Satellites should have been knocked out. Supervolcanoes should have showered entire globe with ash and fallout. As such temperature would drop dramatically and water would ether be really really cold or frozen. This is one of the movies that tried to do too much too soon too fast. Maybe today's teenagers do have a short attention span but there are people older than that who would like to have seen creativity put to use the right way.",2012

Do they get paid per minute of unrealistic, ridiculous and overblown special effects while completely ignoring science? The claims that mutated neutrinos could be causing the core of the earth to melt is a complete joke. In order to cause the earths core, a massive ball of iron, to melt would have required so much energy that life would have been extinguished long before the core would melt, especially in the 3 year timeline given in the film.This movie had some of the stupidest effects I have seen in a long, long time. The limo scene was beyond dumb, especially the gigantic wave following behind. As those sorts of waves travel at around 3000 metres per second or 10,800 Km per hour (around 6000 miles per hour) then I think they would have had a hard time escaping.The speed at which the buildings and the bridge they drove under collapsed was ludicrously slow.The bit with the loaded Antonov An-225 climbing like an empty airliner at an air show was laughable.A tsunami would not have produced a surface wave of the size shown in the middle of the ocean. Tsunami's travel along the bottom, only showing once the tsunami hit the continental shelves.The scene where tropical animals were being transported over a glacier, through frigid high mountain air while slung under helicopters showed that the director had not given even the slightest thought to what would happen to those animals being transported that way.Another laughable scene was the bit when whole flooded hydraulic chamber scene. Considering how high they were and the fact the waves had traveled through the high mountains, the water would have been frigid. Those people trapped in it would have died from hypothermia very quickly.The captain was not being able to start the turbines till the door is closed? Why not? And when the turbines finally started a big cloud of smoke, suggesting that the turbines were burning diesel or some other liquid fuel. Yet we are expected to believe that this fuel would last for a minimum of two months.I was almost falling of my seat laughing during the Everest collision. A multi-thousand ton behemoth like that vessel hitting Mount Everest would have caused a massive ice slide. Yet all that happened was a couple of ice blocks fell and broke a window. And later we see the front of the vessel and there is absolutely no sign that it had run into the side of a mountain.What can I say about the dialog other than how many 7 year old kids did they get to write it. The dialog was lame. The screenplay was a joke, with the good guys getting out of yet another inescapable situation at the last millisecond in the most improbable ways.Yes, the special effects were spectacular and yet it was quite clear they were there to cover up for an incredibly lame, dull and boring screenplay.I am glad I did not pay to see this joke in the cinema. I would have been demanding my money back.",2012
417,maryszd,"A Bad, Heartless Film",1,19 July 2010,"It's hard to elaborate on the deservedly scathing reviews 2012 has received; it's not only physically implausible, but it indulges in the worst kind of racial stereotyping. And naturally, it's the Americans who run the show and get to survive for the most part. We're meant to identify with a self-centered family group from Southern California that indulges in soap opera dialog with each other even as their friends and neighbors (even eventually their good-guy stepdad) are slaughtered. The only thing that's supposed to matter to them is ""family."" The African-American President's wife is dead as is the mother of the African-American scientist protagonist. The fact that the middle-aged black women are dead before the movie even starts speaks for itself since there's a lot of discussion about who ""deserves"" to survive the catastrophe. An elderly Tibetan woman gets to live (even though she doesn't speak English, a major character flaw in a film like this) because she can virtuously save the white protagonists (who probably wouldn't do the same for her if the tables were turned). The CG effects are dramatic, but pointless because they're designed to be sensational and nothing else. There's a protracted water scene (that I fast-forwarded over) at the end of the film that is somehow supposed to do with re-uniting the John Cusack character with his petulant son. The earth has been destroyed, the majority of the world's population has died an agonizing death and we're supposed to care about this? Eventually the (mostly white) survivors set out to repopulate the lone inhabitable continent, Africa. Colonialism begins again. Every single moment of this film is truly and bizarrely bad.",2012
418,jonjonat,Prepare to Die,10,24 November 2009,Awesome Movie! Never seen any movie so good like the new disaster movie 2012! It is a bit quirky at times I know (some of the special effects were really out of place) but the acting was fine and the storyline was pretty good. The dialog wasn't the best but I thought the whole way through the movie just blew my heart away. The best part was when the crazy radio reporter committed suicide and got crashed by volcanic rocks and when the Chinese hut got crushed by the flood. Oh yeah of course I shouldn't spoil any of it for you but of course you go see this movie and believe me you might want to Prepare on that very year 2012. The end is near 10/10,2012

The visual effects were pushed to the maximum in this one. But the movie had a lot of lagging moments especially in the middle parts. And I was happy to see someone putting out a message like ""We are the children of our Earth"" in a movie. All in all..this movie must be a relief for emmerich after his debacle 10000 BC.

This is a proved formula to entertain people.However, the plot here is the other way around. I watch earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis which have to 'struggle' to overcome their most unbelievable enemies : a group of die hard people.No matter what kind of disaster is being thrown to them, they can overcome it with just minor scratches. The story stop for me when a continent moved to save their poor asses. Can't take it anymore.I switched my mind off and just waiting for breathtaking CGI scenes to watch. Don't even care about all the conflicts, heroic speeches, act of bravery etc in the finale, since these people are NOT ordinary people anymore. Definitely, they'll survive from anything.Luckily the special effect is top-notch, so I'm not really wasting my >2 hours time for nothing - not include my effort to get the ticket.Gave 6/10 because the special effects.

This was usually because I thought a film was so bad that I just felt compelled to share my opinions. My comment today is quite the contrary.I have to say that this is one of few films that I have liked in recent past. It wasn't the greatest I've ever seen, and many of the escape scenes were highly implausible. However, what this film did do was keep me on the edge of my seat. Action and suspense were the true highlights here.Everybody played their role well. There were a few characters that I might have picked differently for their parts. But again, not bad.Effects were spectacular. The end of the world looked quite real. As morbid as that might sound, the effects were great. This is one time I can't complain too much about CGI.Some of the events were a little too convenient or again implausible. But I repeat, not bad. It's expected that with a film like this, imagination needs to stretch a little bit to work in the dramatics. I believe that this film has just about all the right ingredients to make it worth while.One thing here, and I have to say that I appreciated this... Blood and guts were not the focus of this work. If you expect to see a lot of death and dismemberment with blood all around, you are in for a let down. You won't see much of the carnage up close in this film. The focus here is more on the survival of the main characters and civilization along with a race against the clock.So all in all, I give this film a rating of 7/10. I'd see it again and will be awaiting its release on DVD. Hopefully it's only fiction!",2012

Like John Cusack and finally liked Amanda Peet in a movie and the kids were great. 3.) I did like like Oliver Platt and the way they handled the attempts to keep the secret. 4.) I want to be Charlie (Woodley Harrelson's character.) That was a good role for him and he played it perfectly. Iagree that there was an Indiana Jones Adventure feel to the stunts chases and such, but that's what made it fun for me. I think it was headed for a 5 or 6 rating until the end action moments and they picked it up to a 7, although I liked it more than a 7, I don't think the movie as a whole is better than that. The cheesiest moment came towards the end with the not open/do open door speech.Overall, it was good cheesy fun, which may not be what you want in a world will be destroyed movie, but it tries to take itself serious at times.",2012

428,evilresident097,A pretty acceptable big budget behemoth.,7,16 November 2009,"Of all of Roland Emmerich's bug budget disaster pics, this one takes the cake, or planet actually. It may be one of the most expensive, but it's one of the most action packed films of the year.In case you never watched the trailers, or TV in general, it follows the ancient Mayan prediction that our world gets destroyed on 12/21/2012, described as a cause of solar flares, increasing the temperature of Earth's core and causing worldwide crust displacement. It is actually discovered 3 years early by Dr. Adrian Helmsley(Chitwetel Ejiofor) and soon the government begins building ships meant to withstand the effects of 2012, but tickets to these arks are $1 billion, each. Then, inevitably, the disasters happen. The earthquakes and super volcanoes and tsunamis, oh my! In the midst of this is Jackson Curtis(John Cusack), a failed writer turned limo driver who stumbles upon the impending disaster by mere chance. Driving like a madman, he treks to L.A. to rescue his ex-wife Kate(Amanda Peet), kids Noah(Liam James) and Lily(Morgan Lily), and Kate's boyfriend Gordon(Thomas McCarthy). We see they're daring escape in a spectacular 7-8 minute special effects feast and after that, they decide it's off to the Himalayas, to where the ships are located. Many more disasters ensue.The best part of 2012 is the most obvious: its effects. In my personal opinion, this is the best effects Ememrich has given to the world. The best of this is shown in the L.A. Escape scene in which our hero and his family outrun a gigantic quake in a limo and in a private plane, they dodge subway trains and towering skyscrapers. This film has a definite nom for the Best Effects Oscar, and may even be good enough for the win. And Emmerich knows star power. Aside from Cusack, Platt, and Ejiofor, the A-grade cast also includes Woody Harrelson(as comic relief conspiracy theorist/nut case Charlie Frost), Thandie Newton(as the president's daughter), and Danny Glover as the president of the U.S..It's faults are easily identified though. The script is atrocious and very familiar, at its peak in a scene where Ejiofor's character gives a 2-minute swan song speech telling everyone to stand together. It's also incredibly long, clocking in at over 2 and a half hours. They didn't even really need most of the first hour.But overall this was actually a good piece of Emmerich's film-making. It's brilliant cast and mind-blowing effects almost completely make me forgive Roland for 10,000 B.C. and Godzilla. But he still needs to hire a good writer for once.7 out of 10",2012

The bombardment of clichés is overwhelming. There has to be a checklist somewhere in a Hollywood vault that displays the requirements for any disaster movie. The main protagonist has to be a divorced or separated dad whose life is in disarray but who is redeemed by the end of the movie. The step-dad must be devoid of all personality lest we start caring when he is inevitably killed off so the main character can move in on his ex. Any antagonist in the movie (who is this guy supposed to be anyway, the Secretary of Defense? I don't think it ever says, but I easily could have missed it, as I started zoning out) MUST be white and secondary protagonists (the President of the United States, the geologist, the doctor from India, the Tibetan man who helps the main characters and the President's daughter) must be minorities. Murphy's Law must apply and everything that could go wrong, does. However, since we know everything will turn out fine at the end anyway, there is no tension whatsoever. Finally, there should have been a disclaimer at the beginning that read: ""WARNING: In the following movie, product placements will attack your senses at every opportunity"". I guess when your budget is a quarter of a million dollars, you'll take any money you can get. I get that this is a movie, but some plausibility would be nice. Is Jackson Curtis secretly Aquaman?

John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, and Danny Glover are not compelling actors. Cusack, as usual, plays the weary sad sack. Harrelson's attempt to channel Dennis Hopper's maniacal character in ""Apocalypse Now"" is embarrassing. And Danny Glover's role as the president of the United States is an insult. In his ""real"" life, he despises America and praises Hugo Chavez, the thug that runs Venezuela and its drug cartels. Putting that aside, Glover's pulse can hardly be measured.Child actors. Oh, if only we didn't need them. They are almost invariably portrayed as rude, contrary, and sullen. And the parents put up with it. But, never fear, by the end of the film, they are cuddly little teddy bears that have brokered a reconciliation between their estranged parents.The adult characters in this movie are not believable. They are either cads, unlikely heroes, or holy men. Adults in authority almost always have bad motives. The chief bad guy is supposed to be the president's chief of staff, Anheuser, but in reality he is the only guy that knows what he's doing and is devoted to his duty. That doesn't count much, I guess, in the prevailing culture.The story begins with some excitement, but eventually devolves into an overlong, overwrought cartoon. It's ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Krakatoa-East of Java,"" ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Bible,"" and ""Airport '75"" on steroids. Too many anguished characters, too many anti-heroes, too many noble savages, too many plots and subplots, no coherence, and virtual chaos.Such is what passes today for entertainment.

When I saw that Danny (Hugo Chavez Loving) Glover was in the oval office, it was a big turnoff for me, but maybe a little bit of an ironic casting choice when you think about it. It also irked me somewhat that China plays a major roll in the attempted salvation of mankind. That was another odd choice if you think about their record on human rights. Also, the science, or lack thereof behind the cataclysm was pretty thin, and I had trouble suspending my disbelief. There are probably a bunch of other things I could slap this movie around on, but I must say that the special effects were AWESOME! I had a little trouble getting emotionally attached to the characters like I did in Armageddon or Independence day. It's too bad because 6 of the 7 I'm giving this are for the special effects.

Take an all-star cast, a notable director, a few amazing scenes of raging disasters and some cliched emotional scenes thrown in and you got 2012. Like The Day After Tomorrow, the film follows quite a few story arcs, but the main one is about a not-so-well-known writer named Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) trying to get his family into a huge ship created by the government to ensure that the human race will continue.

Did I like it? I must confess that like most epic films of this genre, I adored it, lurved it, crave more. Perhaps I should explain...John Cusack is the most charming screen star since James Garner, and if the world was ending, as it is in ""2012"", I'd definitely sit shotgun next to him. Does he take this role too seriously? Well what would you do if you had to deliver your family and their likable new step dad to the mothership? I expect you'd demonstrate the necessary derring-do required to win back the respect and love of your former wife.Disaster films reflect the overarching and epic qualities I usually associate with fine opera. Villainy is as clearly defined as virtue, and the tragic hero always wrestles with both. Everything is big, big, BIG and while there are few surprises, that is the most delicious and salient quality of the disaster film genre. We know that the world is ending, and we know that the bad guys are going to lose, and we also know that the good guys are going to triumph. We watch so that we can weep with the survivors and cheer when they overcome predictable plot points.""2012"" offers every spectacular obstacle that ever existed in its genre. It culls from classics like ""Earthquake"", ""Posieden Adventure"", ""Independence Day"" and ""Airport"" to provide every conceivable dangerous complication. Collapsing bridges, erupting volcanoes, and tidal waves compete for screen time while Cusack and company overcome the collapse of capitalism and greedy free marketeers from ""other"" cultures. Now, I may have laughed more often than I should have, but I celebrate the genius of lines like ""Why does it take the end of the world for us to realize..."" Familiarity doesn't necessarily breed contempt after all.I don't know yet if I'm going to add the DVD to my collection. ""2012"" requires a screen as big as director Roland Hemerich's ego, and a sound system that might rival ""High Fidelity""'s Rob Gordon.

First, there's a finite amount of water on the planet, so there's no way that sea level can rise everywhere so all land is submerged. Second, The final scene is a year later, when the water is receding and the continents are starting to re-emerge.

441,TheFilmFreak1,Spectacular Effects... and a Spectacular Waste of Time.,5,9 June 2010,"Roland Emmerich, the mad German sub-genius behind such mindless imperial crapulence as Godzilla and Independence Day, has concocted another deathly disaster brow that he has imaginatively entitled '2012', an under whelming roller-coaster ride of explosions, abysmal acting, generic action music, subversive physics, pedestrian dialogue, and infantile intelligence.The 'plot' of this stupid and quintessentially American film is that, in accordance with some ancient Mayan calendar, the earth's crusts are very nearly about to try to recapture the glory days of Pangaea because of because of something to do with solar flares and subsequently fulfil a misanthropist's ultimate fantasy of killing a lot of people, all of whom like to spend most of their time running around aimlessly and together barely have the collective IQ of the members of the Flat Earth Society. It is then up to a lot of cantankerous civil servants, hammy world leaders, and idealistic twits (otherwise known in the Emmerich-verse as scientists) to ""ensure the continuity of our species"" by building three modern-day arks in China to preserve the fittest (or, in other words, the richest) Homo sapiens on the planet, all the while making sure that the international prole populace remain blissfully unaware of the impending Armageddon. As is the tradition for this kind of trash, the film is told primarily from the perspective of a customary 'everyman' Jackson Curtis (played with understandable indifference by John Cusack) who has the hereditary family problems (or rather 'issues') that include a nagging ex-wife called Kate (played by a surprisingly unattractive Amanda Peet); a son who belongs to a long-line of disaster film pre-adolescent/adolescent urchins who have a chronic phobia of calling their fathers 'dad'; a nauseatingly-naive daughter who can't keep her fluids to herself while engaged in REM-sleep; and a smug rival for Kate's affections called Gordon who ""doesn't do Lipo on Fridays"". Through a series of fortunate – though for me unfortunate – contrivances, Curtis manages to not only learn of the imminent destruction but also of the existence AND location of the supposedly top-secret arks courtesy of a derelict lunatic (Woody Harrelson, playing himself) who just happens to be associated with a great many reputable academics and geologists. From there, Curtis, his family, and the slimy Gordon (who is conveniently a natural-born pilot) desperately try to reach China before the arks, and civilisation, are cast off.The film of course possesses many subplots that are bland and uninteresting – and often completely unnecessary –, but they are nowhere near as riddled with cliché and idiocy as the main one. Indeed, the second main story threat of the film – the truly original and innovative perspective of the US president (Danny Glover doing a cheap Morgan Freeman impersonation), his daughter, his chief of staff (performed with villainous veal by Oliver Platt), and some science guy called Adrian (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, likely the only 'actor' in this film who can be deservingly called such) – is actually sincerely poignant at moments, though still horribly theatrical at other moments.Addressing the film's mise en scene, one cannot deny that the special effects are good. I tried to, but they really are quite spectacular. It really was a joyous experience to watch Los Angeles (aka. Purgatory) fall apart, not to mention seeing the aforementioned conspiracy nut get crushed by a tree, but that really is all the film has to offer in terms of entertainment and art. The script is poor and predictable; the cinematography is extremely unimaginative; and the editing is very leisurely and lethargic. While I was not expecting Citizen Kane (you'd have to be mentally ill to have such expectations for this type of fare), or even Deep Impact, there could have at least been a greater attempt by the filmmakers to take a more earnest and intellectual approach to the material than that which can be seen in the film, especially after Emmerich's previous foray into the disaster genre, The Day After Tomorrow, had heralded such solid results.Watch it only if you have a few extra brain cells that you wouldn't mind getting ride of.",2012

What 2012 does is, takes both the halves, fast forwards to 21/12/2012 and presents a highly stylized and dramatized version of what is likely to happen if the former half is proved right. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is the protagonist of this dismal tale. He leads a melancholy divorced life as a writer. Doomsday is approaching. Despite being warned, humans naively believe it to be a farce. About then, the Mayan's get mighty angry and the end of the world begins. There are meteorite strikes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, pregnant Yetis going on a rampage - absolute mayhem. Through this detritus rises Mr. Curtis.

And just as in Alive in Wonderland, they leave on a slightly more dangerous adventure dodging skyscrapers, flying airplanes and narrowly missing death 40 million times.With all the destruction, demolition and chaos, most of the movie plays like a final destination ploy. Then it proceeds to become an apocalyptic survival-adventure flick with feeble attempts at comedy. And therein lays the problem.Though all the effects, near-death escapes and the idea of Doomsday actually arriving does entertain you, the movie has no substance to back it up. With no solid plot to carry it through, it seems hollow as a bone without the marrow. There has a plethora of movies with such spectacular execution that a plot seemed unnecessary (Kill Bill Vol. 1, Shaun of the Dead) 2012 doesn't execute it very well either. There is a lot of adrenaline pumping stuff, but as the ending credits roll in you can't help but ask an unsatisfied 'What? That's it?'Nothing extraordinary should be expected from the cast; they aren't the focus of the film. The characters are puppets to be tossed from one misfortune to another. Cusack adopts his trademarked deer-in-the- headlights-of-a-car act that works so well with members of the female contingent. He is the stereotypical heroic front-man, full of kindness, ever the brave-heart and probably smelling of strawberries. You don't want him die for those reasons. The rest of the actors are just there. They bring more to the role than the role brings to them. All of them are just trivial playthings in the larger scheme of events.Big budget films are usually a visual delight. 2012 follows the trend. The special effects are adroitly done. They seem realistic and instill fear in you. That is probably the highest praise you can attribute to them. The tumultuous adventurous sequences are exciting, but overdone. The main characters people are nearly-killed too many times to seem plausible. It is almost as if Lady Luck and Cusack have a relationship of some sort.Director Roland Emmerich doesn't seem to be very fond of the Earth as it is. After making Independence Day, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow, among a plethora of others, he strikes back with another 'the world is dying and we are dead meat' movie. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to have learned from his previous mistakes. Though the latter half of the movie drifts away from the main picture, the apocalypse that is, the movie serves its purpose well – spread fear among paranoid people. Viewers were already making wills by the time they left the theater. On pragmatic thinking, it does beg a question. If the world is going to the end in 2012, it seems highly unlikely that the film-makers would have spent all the time, effort and money in making a movie about it.",2012
444,Aldri7,not very memorable,4,25 November 2009,"You would think that something as cataclysmic as the end of the world would be memorable (that is if you were to somehow survive it). But I'm sorry to say 2012 is not a movie I'll be discussing for weeks and weeks with my friends and family. That is because mostly its a rehash of recent epic disaster flicks, especially ""Titanic"", where the question of ""how to survive the sinking of a luxury liner"" is replaced with ""how to survive the sinking of a continent"". But I better not go into any further detail without a spoiler alert here.....Anyway, the movies starts out reasonably well, and there is tension from the start. I think both the senator and Woody Harrelson's character worked quite well. There is trouble brewing beneath the earth, and only geologists and conspiracy freaks have any clue as to what is going on. Not a bad premise for a movie there, but then enter John Cusack and family to contribute the ""human element"" and things start to go seriously awry. I mean, the world is coming to an end, and do we really want to spend most of the movie experiencing the pain, sadness, loss and heroism of that spectacle through the eyes of this insipid family? And is their harrowing journey to China really an act of heroism, or is it an act of narcissism? Well, its not heroic if you are only out to save yourself. Meanwhile, as city after city crumple all around them, Cusack and son are joined by a host of wealthy people from across the planet who will carry forward mankind's presence on earth. And herein lies the main problem with the movie: There is no personal story nor tragedy amid the ruins and decimated parts of the planet itself. There is only a story of escape from that, and an escape facilitated by wealth. I mean, the wealthy few were never shown to represent mankind at all. There was no formal selection process nor endorsement from the multitudes, no official send off. They just sort of snuck away, figuring no one would be around anyway to mind that they alone, through the power of their wealth, had the means to survive. So this was sort of like a ""Titanic"" theme only in reverse. Imagine celebrating and cheering on those lucky Titanic passengers who managed to bribe their way onto lifeboats while leaving thousands behind to die? So, but I don't know if this movie even deserves that much analysis because it just doesn't seem like a whole lot of thought went into it, period. The special effects weren't bad with LA's destruction the hands down winner in that department. But I was actually ready for more, and would have gotten a kick out of seeing NYC go down in similar fashion. But no........we have to take care of the rich people instead, and show the world how important it is that they survive above all else. The fact that the last hour or so of the film contained almost NO scenes from the decimated and destroyed part of the earth was especially bothersome. The vast multitudes had their coffins nailed shut with barely a tear shed. Contrast that to the amount of time spent later on exploring whether or not some fat cat's poochy would be saved, and you get my point. Towards the end, I found myself flashing back to movies like ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseiden Adventure"" as well as ""Titanic"". In each we had wealthy people surrounded by disaster and tragedy. But only here were those involved IMHO undeserving of any support or emotional connection on my part.On occasion, though, I did feel moved while watching this spectacle, especially when there were helpless old folks on the telephone from far off places. After all, telephone calls to loved ones is something you could easily imagine taking place during such a crisis. But I did not tear up while watching the contrived and ""hearfelt"" scenes later on. It could have been compelling - the survival of mankind in a cataclysm such as this is a story worth telling. That this movie succeeded in totally trivializing that experience by making it dependent upon the ""heroics"" of a ten year old kid and his dad is quite a cinematic blunder.",2012
445,stevehoyland,The USA saves the world - Again!,3,28 March 2017,"Okay, so let me begin by saying that,despite being Scientifically laughable,the special effects are, to be fair,quite Impressive....and that's about It! Once the s**t hits the fan,John Cussacks character manages to stay a constant 3 feet ahead of a crumbling and exploding earth as It seemingly picks on him and follows him around the world. We have the ""Independence day""-esque scenario of the ""Pilot""....only this time, Instead of an alcoholic crop-sprayer learning to expertly fly a state-of-the-art fighter\Bomber In a few hours (Due, apparently, to the sobering effects of a few cups of coffee),It's a guy (with 3 flying lessons In a Cessna) who manages to expertly,Indeed acrobatically, manoeuvre a twin-engined turbo-prop airplane through collapsing skyscrapers,followed soon after by his co-piloting of one of the worlds largest (Antonov)cargo aircraft! Oh, come on! Strangely, the 2012 end-of-the world Scenario(as apparently predicted by countless civilisations,contemporary Scientists and a nutty guy via his radio station)turns out to be wrong - the Earth and many of It's Inhabitants survive, everything goes back to normal rather like after the Biblical flood, and we're left with a (reasonably) happy ending with lots to look forward to on our partially re-shaped planet Earth. As for the colossal $200 million budget, all I can say Is - where? A gut-wrenchingly ludicrous script (the mobile phone-call from a mountain wilderness gave me Indigestion)but I give It a few points for both the effects and the(unintentional)fun factor.",2012

This movie had me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2.5 hours and I had mild chest pain at the end I was so wired up. The graphics of the utter destruction of the earth is unbelievable. Don't wait to see this on DVD. See it on the big screen. I gave this movie a ten but I have to admit that the first 30 minutes were great but a bit over the top. The movie became more believable as it went on.

Great job of showing what the apocalypse will be like. Go see this movie!",2012

448,KrazzyDJ,"The Trailer was a Masterpiece - The Movie, not quite",6,17 November 2009,"When I first saw the Teaser for this film (way back in July), I had a feeling that this could turn out to be a masterpiece. The second trailer released later only seemed to strengthen my beliefs. It's only when I saw the five-minute clip that I started having my doubts - after all, I was seeing a scene play out from the movie (almost) exactly the way it was meant to be seen. My doubts were confirmed as I watched this movie today (as a matter of fact, I'm writing this review just an hour after I saw the film).There's very little of a premise or plot here (which, though expected, is disappointing). An American scientist learns from his Indian friend that the Earth's crust is heating up and proceeds to warn the White House about the same. The U.S. President, together with the heads of the other nations chalk out a plan to assure the survival and existence of human species. Meanwhile we have Jackson Curtis, a writer cum limo driver who is going through a troubled relationship with his wife and kids. After some initial build up (as is the case with all of Emmerich's disaster films), the world starts coming to an end.From here on, the film becomes more of a CGI spectacle with Curtis and his family escaping one disaster after another. And therein lies one of the fundamental flaws in the movie. The family manages to make many nail-biting escapes (as is visible in the five-minute clip) which, after a while becomes a bit tedious to watch. Sure Emmerich tries to make up for it by killing off some characters (which I would rather not reveal) but by then, you've already lost most of your interest.Also, there's not much of a back story behind the doomsday and build-up to the D-day becomes a tad too predictable. It would have interesting to have got some more insight into the end-of-the-world prophesies. It almost feels as if the actors are trying too hard to be serious while none of it transfers to the viewer.The performances come across as average although I really liked John Cusack as Jackson Curtis as the writer - limo driver. The effects are quite well executed and although at times you can make out it's CGI, I believe it is still the main reason why most of the people are seeing the film (and it better be the only one).On the whole, although I liked the movie as a whole, I really hoped for it to be better (at least as compared to Emmerich's previous disaster flicks). Perhaps Roland's insecurity after 10,000 BC prompted him to cram this movie with as many effects as possible which makes it nothing more than an apparent excuse to make a disaster flick. So I suggest those who can be quenched by VFX alone, go for it. Expecting anything different would only be a disappointment for you.Score:6.0/10",2012
449,luciakristina,Awful,1,16 November 2016,"A typical Roland Emmerich movie - I expect his next oeuvre will feature special effects only and dispense with characters, story line and actors altogether. They certainly were undetectable in this one! Dumb and dumber was a celebration of wit and character development compared with this tripe. It seems that computer technology is sufficient for producing a blockbuster nowadays - I'm sure it made many millions.No spoiler alert as the ""plot""line and photos tell the whole story. What on earth were John Cusack and Woody Harrelson thinking? Bet they look back on this one cringing furiously...I remember watching the original ""Titanic"" and ""Poseidon Adventure"" a long time ago and they both seem like in-depth documentaries in comparison - and that's saying a lot!

I say it is worth a 7, not the best film I have seen but good entertainment, with a good script, good players and yes just a good watch. Not for those seeking an in-depth movie but its a 10/10 compared to the shark movies that adorn the screen these days.

453,SnacksForAll,"Really, what were people expecting?",8,28 November 2009,"""2012"" is a fine film, well-acted, tightly scripted, highly entertaining, and good old American edge-of-your seat fun. But going in, we must remember two things: One, this is a ""Disaster Film."" Two, it is directed by ""Roland Emmerich."" The first would have been enough to warn any movie viewer that the sole aim of this film is to ENTERTAIN; the second should have further reinforced that fact. And yet, there's a lot of snobbery and what I think is a bunch of people refusing to let themselves have a good time, all in the name of...well, I'm not really sure. Pretentiousness? Look. I love film. Real film. ""Cinema."" And I also love ""movies."" To me, there is a distinct difference between the two. ""2012"" certainly falls into that latter category, and the reason I'm giving it 8 stars out of 10 is due to the fact that this disaster flick achieves what it set out to do, and with flying colors at that. The characters are likable and supported by a stellar cast of acting talent, the story never slows and the action sequences are incredible.Sure, we run into those annoying ""we're almost there but someone's gotta go below decks and sacrifice themselves because of this last- minute problem that seems to have conveniently popped up or everyone dies in 15 minutes"" moments as well as a few repeated ""escape"" sequences, but once again: does ""2012"" do it well? Absolutely, and probably the best I've ever seen a big, dumb Hollywood vehicle do it. This is disaster schlock at its finest.On the brighter side, as a fan of science fiction, I couldn't help but enjoy the ""Ark"" elements of the film and how world governments are portrayed attempting to preserve the human race. It's decent speculative fiction, and gives the overall story of 2012 a little more meat. My point is, 2012 is a big, glossy Hollywood epic. But it's not without its merits, and it's worth seeing as long as you don't go in expecting high drama or an exploration of fate vs. character a la Shakespeare. Sometimes, the simple act of watching a film can get one's mind off life's troubles, if only for a little while. So, by all means, go see 2012, whose sole purpose is to distract us. What's the harm in that? Have FUN, and take delight in the destruction of the earth!",2012
454,vic-232,Surprisingly Amusing,6,21 November 2009,"Given the awful reviews, I was expecting 2012 to be on a par with those Made-For-SyFy-Channel travesties — but, instead, I was both entertained and amused. 2012 never takes itself seriously, and despite the extinction of most of the human race, it really is quite funny! The acting is better than average for a movie of this sort, and the special effects, although a bit cheesy, are adequate.Mind you, had I paid ten bucks to see 2012, I might not have been quite so amused — but if you can get a free ticket, or if you're willing to wait for it to reach cable TV (probably a month or two), it's not a bad way to kill some otherwise unoccupied time.",2012
455,The-Kissable-Writer,"The most realistic effects in a disaster movie ever and a strong cast are wasted in an overlong, poorly written and cheesy film.",4,14 November 2009,"2012 is the year the Ancient Mayans predicted the world would end. Perhaps they should have scheduled the film for 2012, because the CGI is ready for this story but the director most definitely isn't. Inadvertently hilarious fact number 1: the Mayan theory about the Apocalyps is a tiny footnote in the story. Number 2: The Academy Award for most appropriate tag line of the year goes to...: ""We Were Warned"". Yes we were. Some of Roland Emmerich's previous movies were fun but very very guilty pleasures, one I'm still not ashamed of loving the - in my social circles anyway - popcorn classic ""Independence Day"". Lesser entries in this veteran disaster movie maker's career include ""10,000BC"" and ""Godzilla"".It would've made a great radio contest to give away a meet-and-greet with the cast or something of the like if you could guess the budget of this CGI orgy. The right answer: $260,000,000!!! To get a scale on this, the disaster movie ""Knowing"" from earlier this year cost $50,000,000. This certainly makes you look at the controversy about the budget of ""Titanic"" back in 1997 in a different light, the sum of that 7-time Oscar winner: a ""measly"" 200 million smackers. I don't think the Oscar to budget ration will be quite as high with this disaster of a disaster film.This was a film of a great many surprises, surprises in every department except where it matters: the plot. Considering the genre, the acting throughout the entire movie was without exceptions great. Should actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor, John Cusack or Oliver Platt receive an Oscar just for keeping a straight face delivering the script's epically cheesy lines? Another bright spot were the effects, the only fleshed out character of the film. The world sort of implodes and it's quite a treat to watch on the big screen. For me the scenes of the plane crash and the burning forest in ""Knowing"", or the rolling head of the statue of Liberty in ""Cloverfield"" were far more unsettling than the destruction of the White house by a mammoth of an aircraft carrier. And the final scenes of ""Knowing"" were far more emotional than any of the goodbye's in ""2012"", there's one exception where I almost felt sincerity: the part where Cusack and Co have to land in the Chinese Sea and the kids realize that they're going to die, I have to credit the great acting of Cusack and the decent child actors for that moment. There's one scene that looked incredibly fake to me: the part where Cusack's running to catch the plane after the exploding Yellowstone volcano, you can clearly see he's standing still and just moving his knees up and down. Overall, these remarks are pet-peeves and the effects of this disaster movie are a landmark achievement. The less pleasant surprise: what a tediously bloated film. 150 minutes! 150 minutes of a story that spans 70 years and takes us all over the world such as ""Benjamin Button"", that's entertainment! 150 minutes of cheesy dialog and paper cut-out characters is torture. This is not a joke: this was the first film since Savage Grace (well over two years ago) that I would've walked out of if I wasn't with company. How scary are tsunamis still when you've already been overexposed to destruction of whole cities, the Eiffel Tower, the Christo Redentor statue, and Woody Harrelson by way of a giant fireball. At one time they travel on a plane and talk for about half an hour, a journey that could and should have been cut shorter. When they finally encounter a helicopter that can rescue them, they don't have the right pass and the script takes us on an unnecessary detour for about twenty minutes. That's about an hour right there, begging for the cutting room floor. This is such a waste of deliciously cheesy potential. This was an attempt at the disaster movie to end all disaster movies, and that's admirable. In other ways it's just a redoing of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" with better actors and a bigger budget. The last thing I want to do is come across to the reader as elitist and humorless. I have dozens of guilty pleasure action flicks such as Lethal Weapon, The Last Boyscout, Mortal Kombat, Independence Day, Bad Boys, Speed, Wanted, etc. I'd like to see a 90 minute fan cut of 2012 realized but this theatrical cut is an hour too long and will never find it's way to my screen again.",2012

The rest of a very talented cast are just slaves to the green-screen and it shows.The story progresses at a nice pace up until woody harrelson exits the movie (and the destruction begins), and after that it is nothing but one 'huh...wtf!?' event after another. The vague attempts at humor, personal tragedy and emotions, or a humanitarian message all fall flat.And truth be told, the effects are not so good either, even if compared to Roland's own movies like independence day. And these movies are usually all about the effects! It is one thing to exaggerate and accelerate the progress of natural calamities to fit within the limited time of a movie and to keep the pace intact, but another thing altogether to insult the viewer's intelligence by random meaningless important-sounding dialogue and events just for the sake of it. And that's exactly what this movie does.",2012
457,mac-hawk,Pure Hocum,6,17 November 2009,"Well, if you've read the reviews you'll already have an idea what this is all about. The ultimate disaster movie? I think not, sure the special effects are good as is the surround sound but the plots pretty thin and very predictable. The characters create little sympathy and at times you just wish they'd all die. Whilst the film tries it's best to 'internationalize' the ensuing catastrophe there's little doubt that it's the good old US of A's players that will ultimately save the day. The casting is nothing special and the acting similar. Woody Harrelson gives a good OTT performance as the obligatory weirdo who sees it all coming but Danny Glover is oddly unconvincing as the President of the USA. It's, well ..... okay - if you can put your brain to one side for two and a half hours and like CGI & lots of noise then you'd probably enjoy this.",2012

Not only for me.When I first saw the trailer for 2012, I thought ""Damn, this will be a good disaster movie! Look at those special effects!"" and then I thought that I had similar expectations after seeing previous Emmerich's blockbuster - 10.000 BC, which turned out to be.. eh.. that's not the review. Let's go back to 2012.So, apart from the effects I saw in the trailer, the cast didn't look bad - John Cusack and Amanda Pett (funny.. I just saw the Identity the night before), Danny Glover, Thandie Newton and... Woody Harrelson. The acting in the movie is decent, but nothing amazing.... only Harelson gives a great performance being also most colorful character of the plot.As the plot goes, it's Emmerich - so the great Americans are saving the whole world once again, the president is black and everything is ultra-politically-correct while every single piece of the story i surprising and as far from being original as it's possible.So what is good, you may ask? Well.. the effects! I have to say, no matter what people say about this movie, it might be just heaven for hardcore disaster movies fans. Of course, the CGI is nothing compared to Avatar (it's still perfect though!) and such, but that's not the point. The SIZE is the point. The destructions are amazingly big, perfectly shot with clear, realistic CGI and some scenes are easily breathtaking. And even though I gave the movie a 6, it's basically for Harelson and... the destruction. And still, I wish I had seen it in the cinemas.Trust me, the disasters in the movies have never been so powerfully huge and enormous yet!",2012
459,Mackiatoe,"Could be better, but not the worst film in the world",6,17 February 2012,"OK, before you watch this, forget any ideas of realism, accuracy or any of that. This film throws them away.If you want an action packed thriller with incredible CGI, a pretty good storyline and some quite epic destruction scenes then this is for you.I'll start with the problems. 1)It's really, really cheesy. There are some very bad jokes, impossible scenes of survival and much more. 2)The acting... isn't the best. There are a lot of repeated lines, you can't really emphasise with the characters and they're all quite bland.Things that are good though: 1)It's absolutely epic. Watching Los Angeles fall into the sea while someone flies through falling buildings is pretty cool. It's also got some really, really good CGI. It's exactly what Roland Emmerich does. 2)The story is pretty good. A single father who comes in to save his wife, children and their step father and flies them to China with a Russian billionaire is unusual, but cool. Roland really tries to describe how in a situation like this, everyone becomes your family. 3)It's a thriller. If you just want to watch an action packed, end-of-the-world film then this is the one. There are no soppy love scenes, nothing is off topic, it focuses entirely on '2012'. Basically, it just works.So, there is a lot to be improved. But, if you love films such as Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow, well this another one you need to watch.",2012
460,theredraylives,You aren't important enough to survive the apocalypse.,2,16 November 2009,"Seriously, why does Emmerich even bother casting actors? Just show stuff blowing up. That's all he cares about. Watching this is like seeing any number of faceless human traits and personalities in human skin. There's not a shred of acting going on here, because everyone has a one-line definition of who their character is and what he does. John Cusack? Writer and terrible dad. Woody Harrelson? Crazy government conspiracy cook. Danny Glover? Selfless president. Chiwetel Ejiofor? Intelligent scientist with all the answers. Roland, next time, just blow stuff up. Save the money you'd be paying actors and just blow more stuff up.The effects were all that you would even care to look at here. There was nothing redeeming about this utter pile. The action is so over-the-top and excessive that you can't even tell what's going on half the time. That, and how many times do we have to see the SAME ACTION SEQUENCE? How many times did a plane fall off a crumbling runway in this movie? How many times did John Cusack (aka the world's BEST FRIGGIN' DRIVER EVER) jump over cracks or fireballs or chasms in his vehicle? Seriously, John Cusack is not Superman. Although he can apparently outrun the pyroclastic flow of a FRIGGIN' SUPERVOLCANO. I'm not kidding. Roland Emmerich just took science and not only wiped his rear end with it, he dropped a deuce on its chest and hit it repeatedly in the face with a shovel.But the most ridiculous part of this movie is the film's ""theme"" and how it plays out. Cusack's character is a writer who wrote this book about how human beings need to be selfless and think of others and save each other. Actually a really decent theme, right? Especially with the whole world-is-ending thing.Well now let's apply that theme to the movie at large. It's like 2010 and the government figures out that the world is SCREWED, so they get together with the rest of the world's governments and they get their stuff together and they're gonna save humanity. They are coming up with a plan, damn it, and screw you 2012 apocalypse, MANKIND WILL LIVE ON. Hmmmmm... that's pretty sweet actually. Can't complain about that at all. Mankind will be saved. ASSUMING THAT THEY HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS! That's right. Mankind has to be selfless and love one another, ASSUMING YOU'RE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HUMANITY or that you HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS *PER SEAT* to buy a ticket on an ark. If you're just Joe-nobody or Jane-nobody, you can basically go get screwed, because the government has no interest in saving you because you're worthless.But they'll at least tell us that doom is impending, right? They'll let us know. I mean they gotta, THE WORLD IS ACTUALLY GOING TO END AND MOST OF HUMANITY WILL DIE. Either that or they'll completely ignore telling us and say nothing for years, and only finally tell us after the Yellowstone SUPERVOLCANO erupts and we're all screwed anyway. I dunno, I just like to think that if the world was going to end, they'd kinda let us simple folk know. In the movie they even said that they ""didn't want to cause anarchy."" WHO CARES?! The WORLD IS GOING TO END. WHO CARES if there's anarchy? You already don't care enough to let us know that we're gonna die, or to include us in your grand ""save humanity"" plan because we're not important enough to you - so who gives a crap if we tear the world apart before mother nature rips the entire Earth a new one? I'll tell you who - really rich and important people, THAT'S WHO! Numerous people are murdered simply because they dare to try to tell people that the Earth is going to flush them down the planetary toilet, and that the world's governments knew AND lied about it, and have a big ""save humanity"" plan that they casually forgot to mention to most of the 6 billion of us living on the planet.I'd like to think that if the world's governments got together in 2010 and said, hey, in 2012, the world is really gonna die, we've got proof, but we've got a plan to build ships and save humanity. We'll need a lot of resources to complete this, do you care? I think a tax hike to pay for a few dozen or so of these big arks to save mankind is a pretty decent reason to take some of my hard-earned money. Granted, they would have to let it be known that not *EVERYONE* could be saved, but hell, at least take the children? Let a new generation have a chance at survival? Nope. Apparently the only way they could afford to pay for the arks is to have really rich people do it, so that really rich people were the only ones who would get saved. I'm sorry, WHAT? It's great to know that honestly, in Emmerich's world, Paris Hilton could be saved from utter destruction of humanity while so many people with at least some kind of intelligence will be left to die in an unholy torrent of hell and fire and DEATH. To top it off, the movie has the arrogance to play its theme at the end when they try to leave a bunch of these way-more-important-than-you people behind, and we get a big impassioned speech about how we have to be selfless and help our fellow man. You know, like the 5 or 6 billion of us you just let die because you were too busy being elitist pricks to tell us the world was going to end or to ask us if we wanted to pitch in some cash to build some live-saving arks.Avoid, avoid, AVOID this movie unless you want to be insulted and told that you'll never be as good or important as the rich and powerful elite.",2012
461,stormhappy106,Pretty Ridiculous,8,6 January 2015,"Surprised that Hollywood would bother to make a movie about the Mayan ""curse"" prediction of the end of the world--First, because there really is no prediction about the end of the world, and since its past 2012 now anyway, the whole premise seems pretty childish.The other problem is the black lead actor with the ridiculous name--First of all, he's too ugly to be in a major motion picture of this magnitude, its quite distracting--Also he's not a very good actor, and for those 2 reasons is why his career, such as it was, died. Idris Elba would have been a MUCH better choice, a black actor who has some class, as well as being British.Otherwise, most of the other actors were fine and the CGI/Special Effects were great.",2012

463,SocalSam,"Emotional, but unsatisfying",3,25 November 2009,"I liked Independence Day, and expected some of the same kind of fun out of this movie. Didn't get it. Lot's of special effects and emotional playing around, but it didn't tie down the idea. After spending a lot of time on developing an interesting idea, the movie fails to generate the archetypical ending of ""Worlds in Collision"" that is: People get left behind and the Captain of the ship is the guy in charge, not civilians.Spoiler here: An absolute deadline is coming, and you are the captain of a ship that has to make sure that the people on board are safe. An emotional passenger suddenly decides that you, as the captain, have to do something that can threaten the entire ship. You as a captain violate your checklist and do what the emotional passenger says to do. Umm, no you don't. It is the ship first, boarded souls second and forget about thirds. By failing to accept the natural momentum of events, the movie fails to show what humanity is all about: Survival.If the writers hadn't tried to load the movie with phony emotional decisions, decisions that in real life would have ended in failure. As a result the movie lost it's center, that is: Hard Decisions that have to be made at the end of civilization.Instead the movie becomes: Let's all play nice and it will all work out.Sorry, physics, gravity and command decisions don't work that way during times of duress. With 15 minutes before an event that isn't well modeled is going to occur, is not a time to have to deal with unruly mobs.So basically 2012 becomes a myth that demonstrates what is wrong with California and the United States: The inability to make hard decisions.The movie run time could have been trimmed by 30 minutes if this concept had been followed, and it would have been more satisfying to listen to the conversations after the mob was destroyed.Confusing discussions via video links with leaders also lead to confusion, and the emotional President scenes could have been cut with no harm to the confused story in the film.Lot's of good flight scenes, really fun family, and good emotional roller coaster.Finally, if it is the end of the world, I would take higher ratio of women to men then that which the film chose. Waaay to many males...",2012
464,tacmovies,The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!,8,18 December 2009,"Story: The movie starts in 2009 Platt and Ejofor informing a president of these United States who is curiously not Barack Obama in this world (weird... but at least he's a messianic black man right? Between this and Deep Impact, Hollywood is definitely telling America that we should be thankful to get through the Obama presidency in one piece, because the message is clearly the if you have a black president the world will try to kill you... not the political world... THE EARTH ITSELF WILL TURN ON YOU!!! If you liked that joke, it was mine. If you thought it was racist and offense, then my roommate Joseph came up with it.) that the apocalypse is about to begin and that like Noah, we need to build an ark.Speaking of Noah's, did anyone else notice that Jon Cusack's son was named Noah? What do you mean it's not symbolic? Although I can't come up with any reason why the digital television conversion didn't happen in this universe, as there are analog TV's without converter boxes functioning. Maybe there's some hidden symbolism there that I'm not getting.Some complaints with the storyline (SPOILER ALERT): If the tectonic plates decided to shift and the continental US began to sink, then who thought that landing in Hawaii to refuel would be a good idea? I'm not an expert and even I recognize the stupidity of that idea. Then we get the laziest deus ex machina in the form of the plane crashing from lack of fuel conveniently in China because of the shifting poles.(SPOILERS ALERT CONCLUDED, YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES NOW) All in all the story gets a B.Acting: There really are some good performances here. Danny Glover does an awesome not Obamessiah president. Woody Harrelson surprised me by even being in this movie and doing crazy in a way that only Woody can do. I'm glad to see Oliver Platt in something big again, even if he is the ""bad"" guy (although if I had been in his shoes, I wouldn't have opened those doors either!) It's good to see John Billingsley on something other than Star Trek: Enterprise. Stephen McHattie was only on screen for a few scenes but completely stole those scenes. Oh, and the nuclear family plus the step dad aren't bad either. The acting department gets a solid A.Direction: Roland Emmerich gets a lot of crap for his movies and I'm not sure why (except for Godzilla and to certain extent The Day After Tomorrow which I thought were lesser movies of his) but, as my friend Andrew pointed out in my original review of this movie, the fact that Emmerich keeps dealing with apocalyptic subject matter does technically make him an auteur. Overall, there are some scenes where the audience really has to suspend their disbelief, like when Jon Cusack outruns a volcanic eruption and catches up with a plane on foot, but they work from a suspense point of view. However, I do have to fault Emmerich for a few of the plane take off scenes feeling identical to the one that just preceded it in the scene before. Of course, the band Austrian Death Machine might say, ""Of course they look and feel the same, because they all look BRUUUUUTAAAAAL!"" B Visuals: If you haven't watch the Escapist's Movie Bob's review of this movie, I recommend you do so. He assessed the visuals in this movie in a far superior way than I ever could, so I'm not even going to try. Suffice to say, the visuals get an A.Overall: I laughed all the way through. . . and yes, I know this means that I should probably be seeking therapy. In my defense, everyone in my party was laughing too, so if there's something wrong with me, my friends have it too. This movie is close to A range, but really is more in the realm of B because of dumb things that drag it down, but regardless you should see this movie!",2012

Did anyone expect to actually learn anything from it? It's just entertainment. Mindless entertainment, really, but it's a fun ride. There needs to be a certain suspension of belief on the viewer's part. Of course it's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be suspenseful and take you for a fun ride, while trotting out some decent special effects. I didn't see it in the theater, so I didn't pay anything to watch it. I enjoyed it.

I wish they'd all just stfu. This movie is silly and ridiculous, yes, but it's spectacularly entertaining and tons of fun... which is what it was meant to be. And the actors are all totally believable in their roles. What's to complain about with this cast? You've got John Cusack, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt (chewing scenery with his snarly, selfish and totally despicable character - who is as unlikable in this movie as his character in Lake Placid is lovable- you go Olly!), and so many terrific performers doing such great jobs.

However, watching Independence Day 10 years later, I really enjoy what it is. Dumb, escapist cinema with amazing special effects, cheesy over-the-time action sequences and corny dialog. But what a fun movie it is! 2012 (from the same director) is exactly the same. If you go into the movie expecting to see an intelligent warning about the effects of global warming, explanations and links between different apocalyptic predictions and any scientific plausibility, you will be desperately disappointed.However, if you love ridiculous action sequences, cities crumbling and being swallowed by giant tsunamis, really corny dialog, over-the-top characters and are prepared to sit back, enjoy the ride and occasionally laugh your head off, then this is for you.I loved it. Its like one of those cheap b-grade action/sci-fi movies with dialog that are so spectacularly bad, that its actually funny. Yet it still has some legitimate, intentionally funny moments - despite being about the apocalypse. The only difference is that this movie has the budget, the actors and an amazing crew and special effects team to make it work.For the people who said it was boring, I just don't get it. They must not be a fan of action movies. Or prefer something that actually has hand-to-hand combat.The only reason I gave it a 7, is that although its a pretty looking movie, I can't really excuse the bad writing. I didn't really care too much about the central characters enough and there wasn't an emotional journey there. Even the huddled masses didn't seem real, so that made all the death and violence was very detached.But regardelss, I was thrilled, amused and had a great time.",2012

It made no sense at many points. The people's actions made no sense at many points.The worst part was the pulling on the emotional heartstring when the guy willing to risk 400,000 lives very likely on the low chance of saving a few was seen as a hero even though he was jeapordizing 400,000 lives whereas the guy trying to save 400,000 very likely was seen as a dick.

470,mailljs,Is this a comedy or a disaster movie?,3,26 March 2011,"I figure that the people who made this movie couldn't decide so they tried to cover both bases but didn't succeed in covering either. Make it a mixture of Airport and Airplane they said so he tried his best but unfortunately included a large dose of stupidity that wasn't in the originals. I thought the scenes with John Cusack driving the limo one foot ahead of the disintegrating earths crust beggared belief. But then I saw the scenes with the plane flying (for some unknown reason) about 100 ft above the ground dodging the collapsing skyscrapers were even worse. The carping second husband role was an overused stereotype that added nothing to the movie and the oft repeated 'don't say I'm a pilot' or words to that effect became annoying. So if you enjoy movies that are 5% plot, 5% acting and 90% special effects then this could be for you. It might help if your taste is all in your mouth (no offense).",2012

After all Roland Emmerich has a specific formula he follows for these shlockfests, so I know what I haven't seen yet (and yes, I'll shell out the 12 bucks to see this garbage because it is shiny and loud garbage).Emmerich did two okay films, Stargate and Independence Day - which each had their share of problems but at least had stories that hung together for the most part and entertaining special effects. The rest of his work has been pretty horrid. How could anyone possibly screw up a Godzilla movie? Emmerich managed it.I think I might wear earplugs when I see it because modern Hollywood action type movies feel the need to blast the volume to create an artificial sense of drama, kinda like how lame comedy shows think that by being louder they're being funnier.I'm sure hoping there are things even stupider than the car driving through the collapsing building we saw in the trailer.

It is so predictable that you know the end after the first two lines of ""pseudodialogue"". What is so wrong in this movie? Well... let's see 1).- The acting. It is not that it is wrong, but the script is so poor that the actors could not possibly do anything worthy with the piece of crap of lines they got. 2).- The story. That is the main problem. There was no story. As opposite as what should be taught in Movie-making 101, the story is just the excuse to throw a zillion special effects at the viewer instead of the special effects being the device to tell a story. A plot line that is as deep as the paper it's printed on, as transparent as the nighty my wife wears, as ridiculous as the speeches of the Venezuelan president. No plot line to talk about 3),- The length. It is waaaaaay too long. At over 2 and a half hours, it is ridiculously lengthy without having anything to show for it besides a bunch of disconnected special effect scenes. And i could go on and on, but at the end of the day, what's wrong with the movie can be said with a single word. Emmerich.

In fact it is quite remarkable that the failure of this movie is identical to that of The Day After Tomorrow - a lack of believability in the emotional content - beyond the fact that Jackson Curtis does appear to be quite attached to his kids, every other interpersonal relationship in the movie for some reason appears contrived - and this is just why all of the one hour or so aboard the ark is excruciating. In summary, it will be difficult for Emmerich/ Hollywood to keep attracting audiences to these doomsday sagas with ever-improving special effects alone - the movie needs to hold together with genuine human emotion - the rest is just programming",2012

The Simulation is what you would see with the exception of time slowing down and planet earth being really big. Other than that its cgi and models nothing more.

My question is, can your film meet this challenge?OK, it ain't a great movie. Does that really surprise you? Roland Emmerich's such non-classics as GODZILLA, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and the utterly turd-tastic 10,000 BC.But, a lot of us bought tickets, so he got another chance ...And this time, he hits a solid home run (though it may be an inside-the-park home run). Roland throws all he has learned about massive, earth-destroying special effects on the big screen and a large chunk of it sticks. There are several bravura sequences in this huge, HUGE film. Since the film is short on any real plot, and the acting does not go much further than the talented Chiwetel Ejiofor saying ""oh my god"" ominously (though, the humor brought by Oliver Platt, Woody Harrleson, and John Cusak is greatly appreciated). And let's face it, you didn't buy this ticket to see any acting ... if you did, you made a big blunder.And finally, two other nice touches ... and here is my SPOILER (telling you what you WON'T see in this flick) ...---------------------------- SPOILERS ---------------------------------- ---------------------------- SPOILERS ----------------------------------1- You will NOT see any leftist ""we-killed-the-earth"" discussion here ... the cause of the problem is identified and, rather than pointing fingers (which is what we do in real life), these characters simply take action.2- Citizens of NYC, you are spared. That's right, this may be the first film in many, MANY disaster films that does not show the destruction of The Big Apple. Mr. Emmerich actually shows filmmakers that there are other iconic monuments around the world that one can crush with massive special effects.So, go see the film for what it is ... a really big, technically excellent ride of a film.

482,Palidan400,Epic Proportions!,7,14 November 2009,"This is a movie of epic proportions. Like the whole world goes down. Overall it was an okay/average movie. First thing is that it wasn't a great movie, but it certainly wasn't bad like a lot of people said it was. Obviously, the first positive of this film was the special effects it had. The CG was amazing, like the best I've ever seen. Everything was so massive, it's actually quite scary to think about it, how they created and destroyed the earth so realistically. Los Angeles was ruined so amazingly, it just stuns you. The acting and character development wasn't that good. The movie was very emotional since of course this movie is about the apocalypse, but the main characters themselves didn't show too much emotion. At least not as much as expected. Storyline wasn't too original and was seen before, but the super cheesy dialogue actually fit in very well with the scenes (if you've seen it, you'll understand). It's also a lengthy movie - 2 hours 30 minutes, but I think most of the scenes were needed since 1) it covers the whole world, not just America for example 2) it's more dramatic 3) the film doesn't just start in 2012, and some years are talked about before.For those people who rated it under a 4 or something because of character development, one bad aspect doesn't bring down an entire movie, and if you rated it because of that, it's probably just a rant.All in all, this is an okay movie. It's not exactly everything you'd expect from the trailers and the topic of doomsday, but it's not a bad movie either. Characters and cheesiness were bad, but special effects and the message of hope was good. Plus it being epic.",2012

Stupidity abounds in this disaster of a film.Never mind that the ""science"" is totally absurd. Forget the fact that the hero's various cars and planes and ships and whatnot survived cataclysmic impacts. Pay no attention to the way the vehicles and buildings and such were thrown about with a level of violence that would have turned anybody in them to a thin smear of jelly on the inside.

If you go into an Emmerich movie with high expectations, looking for a completely mind bending plot a fully developed characters, you will be disappointed. 2012 is nothing that's going to change the way movies are made. Just go to see a country or two sink under water, as the CGI buildings slowly, or sometimes quickly, sink under.The plot doesn't really do anything. I know there's something about China in there, with a little bit of a certain updated Bible story thrown in for good measure. (I won't say what, in case I get marked with a spoiler, and I pride myself on spoiler-less reviews.) The absence of a plot is no surprise. The factor that sets this movie apart from many others of these mindless films, is that it's fun. It's not going to blow your mind, but it's a decent way to spend 2 and a half hours. I enjoyed myself. This is also one of the movies that is enjoyable, and then makes you feel guilty for enjoying it. I know based on what I like in a movie I shouldn't have, in a weird way, liked it. Roland Emmerich has done before, with 10,000 B.C.My final recommendation: see it with s group of people. I don't know why, but the more people you see it with, the better it seems. Maybe if you plan on just hanging out, expectations won't be as high. Either way, this is a movie to settle in with a bucket of popcorn and just enjoy it for what it is.

A modern day ""B"" movie with all the common sense removed. Don't get me wrong - I love fantastic movies where my sense of belief is put to one side for a couple of hours, but when I am told that this is ""real science"", then I expect it to be so, or at least a reasonable approximation.Here are some of the things that really irritated me - there's bound to be a lot more, but I'd lost the will to live after 20 minutes...Neutrinos pass through the earth unchanged - don't drop energy when they do so, so how can they microwave the earths core? If they do microwave the earth's core, why don't they microwave the surface - i.e. life? Volcanic explosion of the magnitude depicted would have sent out 600 degree gases at speeds just below the speed of sound. Baked in 30 seconds - dropping debris irrelevant - dead already.Can't get Tsunamis in the middle of an ocean - needs shallows to build up - i.e. coasts.China (a country, not continental Asia), moves 1500 miles in @ 12 hours - 125 miles an hour, but remains intact and unchanged until...1500 foot tall Tsunami overwhelms the Himalayas - a range of mountains 10s 0f thousands of feet tall - how?? Why did they not build an super arc on mount Everest - cheaper, quicker and safer? Plane escape - first car leaves off the back of the plane and drives away. Wrecked cars fall off 30 seconds later (1 mile away guessing on plane stall speed), and pass the escape car - they'd be travelling in the opposite direction - how does that work? Don't waste your money seeing this - buy Larry Niven's book ""Lucifers Hammer"" if you want a really good global disaster story.",2012
487,phantom_fan89,A Disaster Film In More Ways Than One,4,1 December 2009,"Roland Emmerich's latest overblown ""look it's the end of the world, what we need is the most average guy you can find with a dysfunctional family to save the day"" offering almost borders on satire as we are inundated with everything that is ridiculous about the disaster genre repeatedly over the course of almost three hours.The year is 2012 (obviously) and the world as we know it is coming to an end via a succession of natural disasters. The film chronicles mankind's struggle to survive.It's a shame that the films of Roland Emmerich have become increasingly overblown and self indulgent over the years, for he once showed great promise in being able to intertwine solid dramatic content with large action sequences in his earlier outings like The Patriot. However as 2012 and last years dreadful 10000BC show, Emmerich has forgone all ambition of producing anything of quality, instead seeming more concerned with producing the most mind numbing special effects that the ridiculously large budget of 200 million dollars could buy. It's painfully obvious where most of Emmerich's attentions lay as the multiple human narratives in 2012 fall shockingly flat.We all expect disaster movies to be somewhat ridiculous. After all they are so formulaic that the only thing that really changes is the disaster itself. 2012 is no exception as we once again are presented a bunch of stereotypical characters attempting to survive a flurry of natural disasters whilst mending their relationships. But the problem with 2012 is not so much that it adheres to every disaster movie convention in the book, but rather that we are subjected to sit through them for almost three hours. The plot is littered with so many pointless characters, sub plots and ""we're a family"" pep talks that the running time is unforgivable. In between the tidal waves and earth tremors the film lags endlessly, so much so that you are actually welcoming the complete annihilation of the world so you can leave. It also appears that Emmerich wasn't sure what tone he wanted for the film. On the one hand he tries to add in a plethora of 'emotional scenes', exploring-in a bad after school special sort of way- the big issues of corporate greed, heroism, self sacrifice, redemption and science and religion. On the other hand he adds in so many cheesy one liners, cringe worthy dialogue and absurd set ups e.g a Russian Paris Hilton look a like risking her life for her chihuahua , that you can't help but think the joke may be on us.Unfortunately the cast can't do much to elevate the enjoyment factor of the film. Let's face it, disaster films are paycheck films and in exchange for the millions paid to them the actors do their best to look serious. John Cusack (the reluctant hero), Amanda Peet (his estranged wife), and relative newcomer Chiwetel Ejiofor (the scientist) do their best to make their stock disaster movie characters look suitably worried throughout, but the relatively bad dialogue and ridiculous situations more than renders any attempt to give a worthwhile performance futile. Oliver Platt does his best to stand out as the token greedy bureaucrat whilst Woody Harrelson provides some comic relief as a drugged up conspiracy theorist. It's Thandi Newton however who receives the award for the most pointless role of the year, as the presidents daughter (much like her role in W) Newton seems to merely hover in all the major scenes contributing nothing.Whilst the film fails on many levels the special effects department manages to deliver. Cinematographer Dean Semler manages to make tidal waves and earthquakes almost beautiful in their destructive glory.If your in the mood for some mindless bit of fun and don't mind a sore backside then you may enjoy 2012. For everyone else perhaps wait for DVD when you can employ the use of the fast forward button on your remote control.

489,GloriousGooner,gargantuan disaster,6,16 April 2010,"The biggest single problem with 2012 is the length. It's butt-numbing runtime saps the soul as much if not more than the tired excuses for characters the film inflicts its carnage on. And because it goes on so long the unfolding disaster, shots of tsunamis; earthquakes et al become increasingly repetitive and the very small but eminently predictable plot twists barely register as surprising or important given the film's grander scheme. The leaps in logic are too big and the reality-stretching scenarios seriously beggar belief far too many times. To outrun one disaster is entertaining, but to outrun 3 in one day seems just plain silly - even in Hollywood's no holds barred world of the disaster movie. There's no dialogue to speak of (how apt!) and the cannon fodder is dispatched in mighty world-shaking style but after peaking early with the chaos in California the film has nowhere left to go, no higher gear so the end finale seems little more than a damp squib. Thos are 3 hours of my life i'm unfortunately not going to get back.",2012

491,jeff-coatney,"An Unexpected, Transcendently Bad Treat",4,24 November 2009,"I really didn't expect much. I knew the resumé's of the players: The Cast, The Producer, The Director. But damn!... Damn!... I had so much fun watching this destruct-orgy... I have to say it was really, really funny. I almost gave this 8 stars, but I was afraid people would get the wrong idea about me... me!? Woody Harrelson had me in tears. John Cusack played it so straight for awhile... then a wink and a nod would peek through... I see... you're in on the joke. I get it. This movie is so over the top, it redefines where the top is. Try fifty-thousand feet higher than you think it should be. I think this film and its relative box-office success have given way to its real achievement: lowering the bar on script development to the point that it would hardly qualify as an English language film. Yet there is the comedy... brilliantly, defiantly staring me in the face, making me laugh though the part in the film where the second act is supposed to go. My ribs are hurting... but nobody spends two hundred million on a comedy! I can't reconcile it. Not even Mozart could construct such a tangled web of coincidence; cliché, coincidence; cliché, ad infinitum, ad nauseum. Oh, and the moral crisis... I almost forgot about the moral crisis... it appears in the ""third act"", stapled to the main scientist guy like a ""For Rent"" sign on a North Hollywood mailbox on the last day of the month. I wallowed selfishly in the ham-fisted, contrived, thinly woven gauze of the plot, giggling and laughing my way into a sublime euphoria. Even the word ""contrived"" has lost its measure, its weight. All that is left is the far-away echo that hearkens to a time when movies were made by people that could marshall more than just an escrow account of foreign pre- sales fees, leveraged-hedge-fund-private-equity participations. I wipe away the tears of laughter, with fond memories of the computer-generated images of destruction so perversely maudlin, goofy even, yet vividly realistic-- like a special effects corporate welfare program. Thank you, Roland Emmerich, sir, for not pulling out and shooting your load of cinematic brilliance on the audience's tramp-stamp.",2012

Does it matter? Not at all. The movie is absolutely mortifying... I experienced severe dread multiple times throughout it. The graphics hold up in our modern age, and the disasters look just as horrific as you would expect them to in real life.If you're looking for a thrill and some fun, this is a great movie to watch; grab some friends and some snacks and you'll have a great time.

494,perla_arabia,At least go out in style,3,25 November 2009,"I have to say I wasn't looking forward to watching this, but given the hype I went for it. John Cusack isn't even on my least favorite list, I find his acting bland and emotionless. The script and poor editing here just made things worse. You can hardly connect with anyone, and their personalities if any don't come coherent at all. At times I thought the director was making a mock of the whole thing, especially the scene where Sasha thought he was going to live then dies head down, that reminded me of the 80s comedies, as if he was making a mockery of death!!. Again so many clichés, specially the Arab rich themed clip, oh and i am an Arab and we don't dress like that anymore, give it up that ended 1930s. This is only worn for traditional gatherings. Besides, so am I to understand Arab contribution is ZERO to world civilization and culture?. Aside from that I think the lead scientist was the only act holding up, and Danny Glover is such a family movie household name that when i saw him I felt as if I was watching one. I do like him, but i think he is too soft for the role given. Overall, can't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to see how you think about it. The idea is nice, so is the geography, and the inclusion of international feel rather than US focused heroism. But seriously not worth the hype, time (too long, and editing was poor which means there was more to it left out), and it is remotely thought provoking.",2012
495,dancemacabre,Great Entertainment and That Is All,8,27 November 2010,"This blockbuster I looked just a year after leaving. I am one of those people who do not automatically rush to the cinema when actual any film that has become a hit. In such situation rule is that there is a disappointment because of excessive expectations, which for some reason you can not solve, no matter what the present awareness that often brings great expectations and great disappointments.So I decided to see this film when the dust had settled long ago. My expectation was that waiting for me visually impressive film with special effects that are very hi-technology and digitality.Scenes of disaster and collapse, falling buildings, cracking freeway, crashing cars are really well-made but too sprayed and digitized, and these scenes is missing some doses of drama. The part in which Cusack fleeing car in Pasadena while collapsing buildings fall behind it is almost comical and I had a feeling that watching a comedy, or maybe it might seem because of the frivolous and aavog Cusacks face. I think that is important, the film is as an item for fun and turn off the brain.I got a visual treat, but I expected a little better and more elaborate story, the better the dialogues and interesting characters. It seems to me that the director wanted in the first place to offer the viewer a visual impressiveness and that everything else was just there to patch up and make a movie. Minor characters are dull and frivolous even though it is really colorful setup role, but none of them have left a deeper impression nor something which proved to be etched in your memory. I think the most disappointing role of John Cusack and Woody Harrelson was only somewhat impressive in the role of a lonely eccentric. Dialogues can sometimes be shabby, but with a lot of times aplied phrases and quotations. Also some scenes are naive and have seen and even childish and some parts of the movie I was reminded of the cartoon. Like Cusacks rescue at the last minute. Is not it already known that the main role in saving the last minute? The end is too typical, cheesy and a little pathetic with very tasteless music. So, watch this film only in the Blue Ray version because its only value in the visual sense, although there would also be able to find criticism and discontent. However, the film easily kill two and half hours time.",2012
496,bragant,The Disaster is THE MOVIE!,1,13 November 2009,"2012 cost 260 million dollars and is 158 minutes long. At roughly 2 million dollars a minute, one might at least expect a thrill-a-second work of exciting entertainment, since one does not go to a Roland Emmerich movie expecting either art or deep meaning. Unfortunately, the many millions spent on this bloated, overblown ""B"" genre programmer could not guarantee the filmmakers a good script with a tight plot and interesting characters. Emmerich treats his own screenplay (co-written by Harold Klausner) with a level of seriousness customarily reserved for the Holocaust or biopics of figures like Jesus Christ or Mahatma Ghandi. There is no plot to speak of - Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the impending end of the world and has to rescue his offspring and ex-wife from danger. That's all that happens in the entire movie - for over 2.5 hours! By the 4th or 5th time we have seen Jackson and his gang escape death (whether by earthquake, plane crash, volcanic eruption, tsunami, etc., etc.) the whole thing has become so turgid and wearisome that one finds oneself rooting for the tsunami to kill them all just so the movie can end and one can go home. The thin plot might not be all that bad if the film were better-paced and more exciting, but Emmerich wants you to know that he is A Serious Auteur and that 2012 is an Important Film About Our Time, so every sequence keeps going WAY past its sell-by date. Watching this movie is like being hit in the head with a wooden plank multiple times - one is eventually stunned into abject submission. Emmerich does everything at least twice, and his respect for his own material seems to have convinced him that 2012 could not have been shorter by one second, when at least 45 minutes of useless sub-plots involving disposable minor characters as well as repetitive sequences of cities collapsing, flames covering the sky, 1500 meter waves drowning everything in sight and famous monuments crumbling into depthless chasms could and should have been left on the cutting-room floor. By the time Jackson saves the high-tech ark containing what's left of North American civilization (don't ask), apparently by channeling Shelley Winters' swim scene from The Poseidon Adventure, any sense of awe which the sight of huge waves washing over the Himalayas should generate in the audience has been replaced by a numb wish that the whole thing will be over soon and a prayer that one's brain death will only be temporary. After watching a whole lot of cities get destroyed again and again, one simply becomes mentally and visually exhausted by the whole bloated mess. Surprisingly strong performances from a thoroughly professional cast are wasted on tissue-thin characterizations - but believe me, these performers earned their money just from being able to say the bland, clichéd lines they are given with a straight face. Furthermore, despite the appearance of realism thanks to some technically flawless CGI, there is no blood or gore - there should be body parts raining down from the sky during the destruction of LA, but somehow no one seems to be on the streets. On the other hand, a lot of blood and gore might have reminded the movie audience that one is in fact watching a film about the extinction of literally billions of living things, but why should something so petty be more important than seeing whether John Cusack will get back together with his ex-wife and become a hero so his whiny, spoiled son will accept him? In any case, what does it say about contemporary society that a movie showing nothing less than the destruction of the entire world is rated ""PG-13""? As far as the ""science"" and ""facts"" behind this utterly ridiculous bit of piffle, the less said about that, the better. Of course, this piece of overblown trash will probably turn hundreds of millions for its makers and secure Emmerich's position as one of the top commercial directors of the day. At least if the world actually ends in 2012, all copies of 2012 will be destroyed.",2012

The usual array of characters have their little stories told, many suffering, many being conveniently located very close to a coincidentally large number of catastrophic events, a couple managing to fall in love despite the mass destruction and death, and a couple taking time out at the most ridiculous moments to have inane conversations.

Movie has gone beyond its time, no matter how good you are, you cannot see Vatican going down unless you are like me jealous of their free money. Now about predictions, the relationship is really pathetic because it can never happen unless you believe we have cyclical destructions, and then, why bother unless you have taken care of hunger, terrorism/religion, sickness (AIDS, Swine Flu) and greed etc. It is like betting on puts all the time, you will only win once but will loose many times before that. Movie should get awards for CGI but without a convincing story and not even a simple realistic kiss scene, how can you do that. Movie sells actually Mr. Moore, (figuratively) our camera totting weird story teller and giant conspirator of this time. Special effects lost their impact due to story not keeping them alive and they look more like sudden fragments of several movies woven together. If you remove that Russian character (Oliver Platt) and his story altogether from movie I don't see anything will change but we will gain (30 Minutes of time and some money).

500,kevcom,I get the joke (spoiler contained),8,22 November 2009,"2012 is nearly every disaster movie you've ever seen rolled into one. I pretty much knew that going into the theater, but once I saw the cruise ship capsized by a tsunami I was certain nothing would be off limits. Clearly the production team all the way down the line knew what they were doing -- creating the ultimate disaster movie. Utilizing every bad cliché and bad dialog synonymous with the genre had to be intentional. There is no doubt in my mind about that.Earthquakes, fires, sinking ships, erupting volcanoes, floods and airplane crashes. It's all there, and the special effects (especially the insane LA earthquake) are top notch. The automobile and airplane escape sequences are ridiculously unbelievable, but therefore all the more exciting. Several scenes are shamelessly stolen from other disaster movies (most notably the ""Poseidon"" films) but it's all done in good fun.Regardless of the absurdity of the movie, it's a enjoyable ride and indeed the ultimate disaster movie. Fans of the genre will certainly get what they paid for. My biggest complaint is that it's too long. The last 30 minutes are painfully tedious. But hat's off to those involved in the production for having a sense of humor about the whole thing.",2012

While films of the worst sort are sometimes made bearable by the very idiocy of their plots, this piece of flavourless chewing gum just kept giving back the same cardboard taste, with plot and script fitted into the tiny cracks between the action scenes.

Saw this in theater awhile back and was just showing on Stars so had to post a few completely unbelievable parts of this movie...1. The three plane escapes 2 of which are by someone who has had a few lessons... doubt they covered dodging flying subways or diving through falling skyscrapers in those first few lessons.2. Making Oliver Platt's character to be some menacing douche that is like Marie Antoinette... let them eat cake. He sacrificed his mother to save someone but the geologist is constantly attacking him for trying to do his job... SAVE HUMANITY! I was so hoping he would toss that bitchy little geologist off the ship.. In the end the geologist almost caused the death of all humanity... but oh no the man in charge is the bad guy! 3. Would the President's daughter really be so completely oblivious to politics and the real world to believe that governments don't do bad things sometimes for the greater good. Like I don't know keeping secrets and protecting humanity's survival4. This portrayal of the geologist and the presidents daughter as being righteous about so many people dying... hello your not gonna fit 10 billion people in 4 ships. Darwinism survival of the fittest maybe you should learn it. 5. The President dies in what can only be a suicidal and cowardly act... hello who will lead the survivors. No president would go down with the ship without having clear leadership left behind. Definitely not a leader... just unbelievable.6. Africa survives untouched.... really.7. There's a big fence and warning signs but hey lets take the kids over to a completely evaporated lake bed with hot sulfurous steam bubbling out... oh that's safe! 8. The Sistine Chapel ceiling cracks right between the fingers...hmmm 9. In the grocery ""I feel like something is coming between us"" oh look a large crack appears between them.10. Tamara and Gordan buy it in the end saving several other characters.... reaction by them oh sad move on. Hello your husband just died tears??? 11. The JFK aircraft carrier takes out the white house.... was that necessary... really? 12. Whole thing about Jackson being a failed writer had absolutely nothing to do with story line but yet is droned on and on. This would have made sense if what he wrote was even about the subject at hand but wtf??? 13. Russian dude doesn't save his girlfriend... smart guy would go oh my options will be limited soon... better take her along cause she's hot and im not! 14. The Russian pilot needlessly sacrifices himself... another character killed off and added nothing to the storyline by it.15. The plane escaping Yellowstone.... flies through dense volcanic ash and engines don't stall... NOT! 16. The crazy guy on a hill in Yellowstone is broadcasting brilliant and has the SECRET MAP... how convenient! Oh wait that whole issue is really unnecessary because we go to the Russian to take us there. But NO lets go to the most unstable part of the US and needlessly risk your kids life for a map that you never use.I could go one endlessly but in short this movie promised a lot but instead tried to create interesting characters by writing a need for them to be in the movie then really needlessly killing them off... Charlie, Tamara, Sasha.The mishmash of politicians and scientists whose characters are really STUPID and get everything wrong and make all the wrong decisions. The politicians are just and righteous but in next frame are sinister and menacing. The scientists are so smart and know everything are continually wrong in every other frame.This movie could have been a lot but never was. Lets hope if the world ends in 2012... that this movie isn't saved! Better luck on next movie John!",2012
506,haxleyandrew,2012 End Of The World Is Fake,1,5 February 2012,"Now i know what you are thinking and it's not great. But still i wanna talk about why people think this movie has something to do with the end of the world.There were many times when people had to see a film to understand what kind of disaster would strike in 2012. They keep watching the same thing and purely it keeps getting old. But nothing like this movie is and it just explains why the Mayans never were correct about the end but that a new age and beginning would happen.Then the same explains why Harold Camping's predictions have so far failed and why his followers left him. There is a lot going on right now. But perhaps this film made by some producers about the end is just false. Don't believe them as that is all lies.Anyways Roland Emmerich's movie 2012 tells about the story about the only survivors and how the Mayan calender explained the end of times, You may remember that in the bible that the world was going to end on 2012. But they were wrong yet again because this film just gives you a look at why the Earth's destruction is very scary and why it might happen.And that's because it focuses on the main theme about the end coming. So Roland Emmerich not only managed to make this film plain horrible. But he also gave it the end of the world sort of theme added to it. Seriously a disaster film about the end of the world is just make-believe. Never fear what you see in this film because it's not going to happen and always face your fears because nothing will make you afraid.The music is also not that great either and is just cheesy and is plain silly. But because of how awful and horrible it really is. I'm not gonna go into that.Also some of the scenes with Cusack are yet silly when watching them. Because each scene has a suspenseful feel to it and they try to leave because the world is ending. It won't happen and because of that i have to say it's just plain horrible and just garbage.Also the puns nor jokes here are funny, You don't get to see characters like Cusack make many jokes here and this movie is not funny. It's just tragic and very sad, The same goes for it's theme because the film has that happening. Although the same could be said when Mr Roland wanted to make his film really suspenseful. Plus a disaster film can't have things like to scare you.Again there is a lot of dialogue and characters repeat it. Sometimes you will hear many phrases that they say so they express it better. But that does not add to the fact that it's horrible because of these theory's and this made up fairy tale about the end of the world. I can tell you that 2012 is not the end. They just made it up.To tell you the truth, Roland Emmerich as both the script writer and director at this movie made this his imagination. He was the director of both Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. But sadly he destroyed it with 2012. Seriously i don't even wanna say how horrible he was with this film and how he mentions the apocalypse. Seriously does he really believe this to be true. I don't think so and because he just cannot stop talking about this fairy tale either.Seriously the apocalypse is not happening. That's one thing for sure and because the world is changing. It's not ending in any way possible. But people who believe that it's true are lier's and they only made this worse by directing this film. C'Mon what's up with that because next time you will stop making horrible films like this Roland Emmerich. This movie is horrible and you are becoming rich off it. Stop trying to predict these prophecies as they are not true.Also one last thing i have to say is that the story is horrible. - The actors were good but their performances were awful. The prophecies of the Mayan calender and more disasters here are not important. And also the plot and also the lame scenes.This is a waste of your time and is completely garbage. So save your money and your time by not spending it on this junk. Apparently this deserves to be in the trash once thrown out. You will not even enjoy the stuff that this film has like disasters or people getting hurt. This movie is not enjoyable and is just is a big pile of complete piece of garbage. So if you were rooting for this film, Then don't go out seeing it because this film makes you want to throw it away never seeing it again.",2012

508,MobiusAg,The world ends in 2012?? It ended the day this movie was released!!!,4,1 January 2010,The fact that it has been three years since a movie motivated me to write a review should tell you just how bad this movie is! I love John Cusack. I ignored all the negative comments about this movie to see him in it. John - I hope you got a huge paycheck for this movie cuz it STINKS! 2012 is just over the top stupid! IT is way too long. You would have to check your brain at the door to miss all the plot holes in it. There are glaring factual errors throughout! The running time keeps you checking your watch wondering when will all the lameness end! The movie attempts to stun you into submission with out of control special effects and body slams you with unbelievable action sequences at every turn.It is a depressing piece of film and an awful way to bring in the new year! It made you hope that the world would come to an end while you were screening it! I needed an excuse to get out of the house this holiday season - now I wish I had been duct taped into a lazyboy recliner -with my eyes pried open - and forced to watch endless reruns of South Park or The Simpsons! I won't bore you with any details...there are other reviews that do that. Take it from me - 2012 is a disaster. You will wish you were one of the dead in the movie instead of living through this mind scrambling piece of crap!,2012
509,ryanaustinf,Not Bad,5,29 November 2009,"Ever since this movie was announced I was waiting for it. When its release date was pushed back, I was disappointed but still I waited for it. At one point, I thought that Roland Emmerich has finally made a good and enjoyable movie and not just enjoyable. Independence Day, The Day after Tomorrow, Stargate and Godzilla were bad but still enjoyable (and don't mention that steaming pile of excretions that is 10,000 BC). It finally came out and I was eager to watch it. I saw it yesterday and I was... disappointed. I was expecting a better story and a lot more destruction but this IS the ultimate disaster movie with more disaster than in any other movie. ----------------------SPOILER LINE--------------- Our main character here is Jackson Curtis. The problem here is he's not supposed to be the main character; Dr. Helmsley should've been the main character. His family escaping this movie is a cliché storyline. And by escaping the disasters I mean ESCAPING-AT-THE-LAST-SECOND style. That was my main problem. The villain in this movie is nature itself. It really leads to some great scenes. Nothing much to say here. The supporting characters are basically the rest of Jackson's family. President Wilson (Danny Glover). By the way, why was Danny Glover in this movie? His acting sucked! This movie actually had a lot of likable characters like I said, Dr. Helmsley, and Gordon. The story of this film is good enough, I guess but it could've been so much more. The acting is decent, it isn't over the top amazing as in Tom Hanks good but not too bad that you face palm the whole movie. The direction is also good enough. There are some scenes where you really feel that you're part of the disaster. And this movie did feel sad at a few moments. The scene where Dr. Helmsley is talking to his dad knowing that he won't survive was sad. The scene where the Indian family wasn't picked up and they show their love for each other one last time as the tsunami hits them was one of the saddest scenes in film history. And finally the scene where Dr. Helmsley is convincing the guys at the ship to let the other people in was also kinda sad. It's the end of the frickin' world! The visuals are ultimately the best of the year. It wipes out Transformers 2 and District 9. District 9 is pretty close though. The two stand-out scenes however was the destruction of Los Angeles and the eruption at Yellowstone. These two scenes were so awesome to watch in the theatre. However, the first act of the movie had a destruction of a store as the stand out scene and overall, not bad. The second act had the two stand-out scenes but at the end, the destruction was Day After Tomorrow again. Just flooding... That was disappointing. Overall, I still enjoyed it and I give 2012, 83% awesome.",2012
510,mark-4401,Save your money!,1,13 November 2009,"I was looking forward to this movie coming out. Went tonight, and what a let down. 1. Was very slow at that start. Took forever to get going. Yes, you have to supply an intro to get acquainted with the characters, and a base for the story. But it took forever! Needless useless dialog. Way too much information, and typical bs that can be found in all disaster movies. 2. Speaking of disaster movies, this one follows all the others in cheap storyline and thrills. a. Typical disorganized hero with an estranged wife and kids. b. Typical step-father (who ends up being left out) Remember the fiancée in Twister? c. Typical African-American President. In Hollywood ALL Presidents must be African-American... Unless they are evil... then they can be white. d. Bad guy turns good in the end... then is killed. e. Super smart scientist that convinces the world and saves the day. f. Government holding secrets from the populous. 3. VERY UNREAL storyline. Just some really... I mean really STUPID scenarios.4. How many times do you have to have a runway drop out from under you before you decide it is not a good idea to land?5. Take a few flying lessons and you can not only fly... but navigate a Queen Air! 6. A lot of coincidences that are just way too hard to believe!7. Story drags... and drags.... and drags and goes on dragging for 2.5 hours! After a while you just end up saying yourself... ""Just end the world... I need relief!""8. They just tried to jam too many (already done) disaster scenes. A combination of Poseidon Adventure, Deep Impact, Hard Rain, Airport, Armageddon, etc, etc, etc.Anything good??? Special effects were ""ok"". At least kept me awake. Whatever you do.... Save your money don't pay $10.00 to see it. Don't spend money on the DVD either. Don't even pay a $1.00 at the cubical to rent. Wait for it to come out on TV... then if you have nothing else to do... watch it for the special effects!",2012
511,lil_mexx31,Enjoyable....,6,17 December 2009,"2012 in my opinion was enjoyable. The first couple sequences however were not so. The acting in the first scenes were terrible and just over the top cheesy. Despite this though, they made up for it with a strong second half. I was very impressed with Woody Harrelson. He fitted in well with his role as the crazy guy who wanted to see the world end.The special effects in this film are spectacular. You can see where the budget went. Destruction is a signature in Emmerich's work and he is on his A game in '2012'. The explosions are just 'effing' awesome. My favorite scene has to be the Yellowstone Volcano eruption. The explosion was awesome, but what made this scene was Woody's facial expression. Very authentic.My gripes with the film is the cheesy dialogue and acting. There was a lack of depth in some of the characters. When it was time for them to die you didn't care that much. Also the length of the film. It was a little bit too long just under three hours.I did enjoy 2012 though. I recommend watching with an open mind. Its a good popcorn film.",2012
512,MatthewInSydney,An insult to your IQ AND your emotional intelligence - why I walked out,3,17 November 2009,"Yes, I walked out on this movie, 20 minutes before the ending. I've seen lots of films that were crapper, but this one was so damn aggravating. And unfortunately I went to see it by myself, so I couldn't relieve the tension by turning to a friend to say 'I HATE this film and want these characters TO DIE'.To start with the okay things first - some of the disaster sequences were hugely excessive and brilliantly creative in their way (9 or 10 out of 10), it's ambitious in size, and the cast was mostly good. I enjoyed the comic Russians, even though they were clichéd. I've enjoyed slightly silly disaster films in the past, like Knowing and The Day After Tomorrow, so I try not to take a snob attitude towards them.Now for some of why I HATED this - *SPOILERS* * Other people have commented on the 'heroes' (ie the dysfunctional white family) escaping every disaster at the last moment, more unbelievably than Indiana Jones ever did. While everyone else screams & falls down, continents literally move across the globe for this family's convenience! This is amusing once or twice, but then just gets silly. The emotional problem with this is that you can then only take this as being enjoyable action-comedy. But at the same time BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED (there's no gore, but it's clear everyone on the planet is violently killed), and then even more amazingly you are meant to care whether this dull dysfunctional family gets back together. No, I wanted them DEAD! * This family is AWFUL. Despite the world going to hell, they care for nobody but themselves. They even take their escapes for granted, and all they can give the dying people around them are blank stares and then go back to talking about their personal issues. At least their young girl has the decency to sob once or twice (okay, I take back wanting her dead, but not the others). At a point later in the film, where the mother begs someone to save her kids, I wanted them to ask her what she'd ever done for anyone else's? What a cow. Drown em. * There's nothing wrong with depicting world disaster through the eyes of an ordinary family, but the story isn't actually told through their eyes only, so their importance is never explained. Why am I meant to care? * Did every African-American have to be so bloody noble? EVERY SINGLE ONE? * Having all the non-Americans get the secondary roles left a nasty taste. Because the rule in disaster films is that most of those secondary characters are just there to be killed off. The WORLD is ending, not just the US. But everyone takes orders from the US President, everyone is happy to talk English, and if you're a character from outside the US in this movie, say your prayers. Or rather, don't even bother. * What was the point of filling ships with billionaires? Their money would help build the things, but once everyone else on the planet dies, crusty old billionaires are not only not the best people to hang around with (they're generally not known for their manual labour or scientific skills), but after the world is destroyed so will 99% of their wealth! Their assets will be wiped out. There is no bloody point! A possible plot-line would have involved SOME billionaires bribing their way on board. But boatfuls of them? I have a low opinion of billionaires, but am certain most would be way too smart to think that was a good idea. * This film is kind of insulting to other nations. Even though plenty of US Presidents have been creeps, not all of them have been, and I can accept a heroic US President in a film. BUT, it's insulting to have other world leaders follow him blindly, and have him behave so nobly, going down with his country, while then portraying the Queen of England as one of the loathsome billionaires buying her way out - considering that the Queen Mum made a point of staying in London during the blitz, it's an insult. There's another uncomfortable point where a character expresses exasperation at the type of people they're saving - just as the camera catches sight of a smug middle-eastern billionaire. It comes across as an insult, whether intentional or not, but this film doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. Oh, and killing everyone in the Vatican, weird. This kind of mild nastiness could have been fun if the whole film had've been more wicked and bitter, maybe making John Cusack a lovable sleazeball, but no, it has to attempt to pull on our heart-strings too. We are simply meant to love the dull white American family, and want to see them get back together, because Hollywood films take that for granted, and to accept that all African-Americans are amazingly noble, because that's Hollywood being PC.Where I walked out - started to get the urge when the mother begged the Chinese guard to save her children. Would have loved the Chinese guard (oh look, he speaks English) to explain to her why her family didn't deserve his help in the slightest. Where I did walk out - when one of the noble African-Americans made a god-awful speech about why they should try to save more of those horrid billionaires, that those people deserved a chance to live etc. No, I was not going to let these characters try to regain my sympathy so easily after hours of callous behaviour. And I just knew it would be a matter of minutes before John Cusack's character would attempt something similar, through some heroic action (and the plot synopsis on Wikipedia tells me I was right!).",2012
513,stazza,Perfectly Enjoyable,8,17 November 2009,"There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is a perfectly good time. What you see is what you get. In my case, in was more enjoyable than I was expecting. I went for the large screen, hi-definition effects plus the theater sound of all the action. The plot was fine and about what you expect. I might even go again just so I can see more of the fun.Not sure why it gets such low ratings, but I feel it hit the exact niche it was aiming at. And is apparently interesting or fun to people since it took #1 in the box office.It's no life changing, thought provoking event, it is JUST a FICTIONAL movie with fun action and great effects. I'll be buying the Blu-Ray also.",2012
514,lueschow,Hire a few scientists or Engineers as Consultants for God's sake,3,16 November 2009,"This movie was terrible and I would have given it a 1 if not for the eye candy effect: San Diego buildings Marching to the sea, Yellowstone finally getting the volcano it deserves, and then the Air Craft Carrier surfing into Washington DC to lay waste to the White House.But to think that they would undertake this huge endeavor to save the Human race and they would choose occupants for the ""Arks"" based on their ability to pay? And then, at the last minute regret that decision seems quite silly. Please spare me the message ""It's not fair that people with money have opportunities that the poor do not."" I hate the anti-capitalist message they try to slip in every chance they get.And why seal the Arks up if you intend to have them ride on top of the waves anyway. Beyond that, Why Drydock the Arks in the first place. If you have the resources to build those arks you could flood the valley and float the arks on the water, waiting for that big wave to hit. Anchor them tight and when the water washes over them, release the anchors and let them float to the surface.I even noticed in the last 20 minutes of the movie during the flooding scenes that they must have run out of money because they failed to ""mat"" the cinematography. Some of the quick scenes looked like they were made in a high-school film class.This is one to avoid.",2012
515,uniqueabba,"2012-overhyped, under researched & total waste of space",1,14 November 2009,"So...I saw the 5 min 21 sec trailer on You Tube in HD, I watched that and thought, wow, from the maker of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, this is gonna be good. HOW WRONG WAS I! I drove down the coast to Miramar Cinemas, Malaga, Spain in anticipation. 3 of us had bought our tickets on-line to see the ""V.O"" version, (""Version Original"") so, no subtitles in Spanish, just the film as it came from the distributor. There are versions called ""V.O.S"" (Version Original Subtitulado) - Subtitled in Spanish. As there are many English speaking people living in these parts, the theatre was quite full, all ages settled down and then the experience began. The opening scene includes an opening caption which is in the original film, placing us at present day, HOWEVER, the film had Spanish subtitles under that caption - IRRITATING, which will be very obvious later. My friend sat next to me asked what it was about, and I told him the film was based on prophecies and the Mayan Calendar, and we settled back to watch. My first issue, as is with most of these films, is why STILL after all that happened on September 11th, do American Studios STILL put the main film build up or explanations of things from a very biased US stand point. After 911 I would have thought the US would have ""got it"" as to why they were attacked - FOR ARROGANCE, yet here we get a portrayal of a 2009 where the US ONCE again is the policeman of the world, the wise older brother to the rest of the world, made out to look like morons. IRRITATED me intensely. The US President (a black one which I liked) of course is in charge and Europe as minions listen to instruction and do as they are told, as do Japan and China - IRRITATING. I was sitting waiting for some sort of scientific accuracy as to what happens in Tectonic movements, but they came up with some ridiculous ""Nuclear"" or ""Neutrino"" ray activity to penetrate the Earth, this weakening its core - RUBBISH. We move on swiftly to 2010 and now things have moved on way too fast with some kind of special vessels being built in a secret location, kept secret from the world. A world which is 2010 has such things as Twitter and MySpace as good communication tools, yet we are supposed to think that 8 massive structures being built somewhere secret will remain that way in this day and age when Iran's near revolution was broken on Twitter - IRRITATING. All the scientists are scurrying around building their humanity saving transport, with no regard to cost, that is just explained away as a ""rich Russian"" and a couple of caricature ""Arabs"" paid for the construction of these vessels - IRRITATING. The way this film just explains things so simply was MADDENING! John Cusack is a divorced man working as a chauffeur for rich, yes, you got it, Russians"", how convenient. He slowly begins to see strange uttering between the privileged few who have ""bought"" their way onto these vessels for Salvation and wants to find out more. So, naturally he goes with his 2 kids to Yellowstone Park in his truck for a camping overnighter, he strays into a previously free to the public area, now fenced off, he jumps over the fence with absolutely no security there to stop him and wander into what was once a lake area. Here he is apprehended and meets the main Scientist who conveniently has read one of his books - IRRELEVANT - now is apparent to the plot is completely awash with errors and forgotten loose ends that aren't tied up in any way later on in the ""film"". Why bring things in if they had no intention of developing the fact that John Cusack's character was a rather under rated author, after this mention, the matter of him being an author and actually a chauffeur as a supplementary job, goes out the window - PLOT IRRITATION.",2012

Mister Emmerich needs to make other types of blockbusters because I've seen enough.After seeing 2012 for a second time this time in HD, I decided to re-vote it (gave it a 6/10 upon release) to a 5/10, but still hesitating to a 4/10, simply because the movies sucks and really only the over-the-top special effects and surround sound makes it up. I'm not going to ""review"" this film as most of you have already seen it, I just want to point out some annoying points in this film:. Woody is annoying. Why must there always be some nutcase in these type of movies? Oh wow he eats pickles, his fridge is full of pickles. Pffff... face palm moment.. The kids in this film were annoying they should have drowned.. Incredible and impossible scenes of our heroes escaping with a limo, rv, cessna, antonov from crumbling roads and airstrips, it annoyed me... that they survived those.. And why is there always a damn dog, that survives, ah well chapeau to Roland. Thousands die but hey I won't try and save myself I'll just save the dog.. Let's not forget the ""science"" in this movie, far from believable.. There's always a speech coming up in Emmerich disaster films, and they always suck. Only 15 minutes before the gates close but let's have a 5 minute speech to remind us we are human and this is not who we are crap.. Half the world is dead, earthquakes destroyed almost everything but one of the main characters can still use a cell pone to say goodbye.

It's great. I only had a problem with the ending cos they did it Hollywood style and it ruined it a little, but I think people will enjoy this movie the second and the third time because it's phenomenal and the cgi is fantastic.The story is OK, the actors are great, everything is perfect except the part of the story that some governments would ask for 1 billion euros for saving old ugly people instead of filling the arks with fertile young healthy smart people who could save the human race?!? The money is no good after the apocalypse. And since all the governments know it's the end of the world, why would they charge anything? It's lame!I know there's a lot of rich people but I doubt that 2000 people could pay a billion euros each?! If this is possible then those people should be taxed correctly and we'd be out of the economic crisis in a second. In fact, I doubt that this amount of euros exists globally. Now don't come to me that it's dirty money cos that would make even more stupid than it is.Why would governments build ships that can collide when the tsunami comes if they could just build submarines so the 'take off' could go without a risk?!?!So the movie is filled with mistakes, but there is one that was just ridiculous, and since I read most of the comments on IMDb I have to quote one brilliant: '380: While a plane is moving down a runway, your family (in the plane) can see your small little hands coming up out of a crater.'Now that you know what I'm talking about, go watch this film despite all the mistakes they made while filming it.

520,quark18,Spectacular shot of collapsing glass towers,8,19 March 2019,"Love that shot of the small plane flying between the two glass towers falling into each other, then past a crashing US Bank building. This may be because I work in the area and pass those buildings in downtown LA's financial district every day. I watch that sequence over and over again on dvd, after initially seeing this movie in a theater in 2009.This is my favorite disaster flick, with terrific destruction on a massive scale. We see LA get destroyed, then Vegas and DC. That is, cities that lots of folks would love to see destroyed. We already saw New York get destroyed in The Day After Tomorrow. The computer graphics in this one are better.And that's how I watch disaster flicks. The star of the show is the disaster. Enjoy that. Everything else is contrived to give us the best views of the destruction and to make us care about what happens.Of course the plot is silly, with too many daring, improbable, just-in-the-nick-of-time escapes. It's merely a vehicle to show us the unfolding disaster.Of course the characters and dialogue are flat and undeveloped. They just need to be likable enough to make us cheer them on. At least some of them. I, for one, am delighted that at least one billionaire jerk dies near the end. And yes, it is totally credible that ""our"" government and rich jerks would find a way to save themselves and not even let the rest of us know what's coming. They're doing it already, building expensive underground bunkers for the end of the world-for themselves. Complete with guns to protect them against the likes of us.I liked the idealistic writer Jackson Curtis and Dr. Adrian Helmsley, and definitely cheered them on.This is a fun, entertaining, fast-paced, and adventurous visual spectacle.

521,Will3451,Would've been much better if most actors wouldn't acted terribly.,7,25 May 2010,"You can't make a real good movie by completely focusing on only one department, you have to focus on all departments (at least the important once) to make a real good movie. Thankfully in this movie's case Roland Emmerich did focus on more than one department including visual effects and screenplay but there is one important department I think Roland Emmerich didn't focus on or didn't focus enough and that department is the acting department.Except John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover, actors of this movie didn't do a good job as a matter of fact many of them did a terrible job. Actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton looked like that they came unprepared or they need supervision. In short only senior actors who can act good without supervision acted good in this movie.Except Chin Han foreign actors also didn't acted good as a matter of fact actors who played Indian and European acted terribly. When your movie feature a global crisis and global effort to solve it and to make it look like real you have to feature foreign countries and foreign people. But you can't cast any foreign actor to play a foreigner, you have to cast a good foreign actor to play a foreigner, if you can't find a good foreign actor you can cast an actor from your own industry to play a foreigner with the help of some make-up. Its not even necessary to include a foreign role you can still make it look like a global effort (i.e. an American scientist working in India).This movie has a good screenplay, visual effects are great and direction is somehow good too but acting by most actors let me down.",2012

That it disregards the Mayan prophecies and so forth. This film isn't Shakespeare and it never pretends to be. This is pure popcorn entertainment - and not all entertainment has to be Jules Verne or Tolkien. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and watch impossible things happen to perfectly normal people.*Spoilers below* Are there huge leaps of logic - a man with a few hours flight experience in a single engine plane able to fly a multi-engine plane and then co- pilot a huge cargo aircraft, for example - yes, there are. Sure, there's masses of stereotypes (bad guy turns good at the end, the estranged couple find renewed love in the light of a brave new world) and the number of near misses (at least three aircraft take off's from collapsing runways, getting the rescue ships engines running seconds before it is destroyed by slamming into Mount Everest) is staggeringly unbelievable. But guess what? This is about the complete destruction of the world in a matter of days, believability went out the window in the first two minutes of the film. Anyone who saw the trailers and expected to see a National Geographic documentary about the end of the world deserves to be disappointed. This film isn't about being believable. It's about throwing the most astonishing 'what ifs' at you that they could come up with. What if the entire San Andreas fault (and all the branching fault lines) triggered at once? What if Yellowstone park erupted? What if... what if... what if... On and on it goes, one massive disaster after another. And you know what? It's entertaining to watch the spectacle unfold.My advice?

I believe that if u have seen ONE Emerich movie, then u have seen them all... except from Godzilla which I personally didn't like that much. Films such as LOTR or this one here are MADE for movie theaters.. so don't hesitate and enjoy the film. Its worth the money. You will see what u have seen on the trailers.. and maybe a little more.",2012

1. Way too long ~2hr 20min, at lest 50 minutes too long.
2. Netflix categorised It as scifi, but there is no science here; none, not a jot.
3. I didn't care if the main characters survived. I actually hoped they wouldn't, which would have made for a more interesting end to the film, but it was all too predictable.
4. The acting... Well I suppose actors need to earn a living between good films.Good points
1. Amazing CGI - I've done a bit in the past, so I can see the excellent work here.'
2, Excellent production in making the film.
3. Not quite the ending I thought it would be, so nice twist.
4. I did watch it until the end, (though I had a few lengthy breaks on the way), so I guess that's worth half a star (but I can't do 1/2s so rounded it up).",2012
527,euplay1220,Disaster Blockbuster at Its Finest,8,10 November 2020,"People complain about many things about this movie. Lead characters survive by one in a billion chance. Its science may be off the mark when it says a massive solar wind microwaves the earth's core. An aircraft carrier drifts all the way to Washington D. C. due to a massive tsunami and miraculously hits the White House precisely. However, none of that necessarily matters to your movie experience.The whole point of this film is to feel the spectacle. That's all - nothing more, nothing less. The mega earthquakes, mega volcano eruptions, and mega tsunamis destroy the human civilization on a ridiculously massive scale. And we get to see it all in beautiful CGI. In 2009, along with Avatar, this movie demonstrated there was nothing a movie couldn't show visually anymore.I love this film so much because it does well what it intends to do. A good movie shows more than it says. 2012 speaks little logic but shows much, and spectacularly.",2012

529,juiceman10712,"Check it out, just don't take it too seriously.",6,17 November 2009,"Going in expecting the worst (I'm talking Transformers 2 bad), I came out pleasantly surprised and satisfied.However, there are more than a handful of critical issues with the film. The biggest and most prominent one that continued to strike my nerves was the comic relief. In a film depicting the end of the world where millions upon millions of people are dying comic relief and any sort of humour at all is BEYOND unnecessary. It just doesn't work.Period. It seriously hurts the film and without it, I would have awarded the film with at least another star Also the dialogue and most of the characters are corny and poorly written.This is somewhat expected from a disaster flick. However, it gets really distracting and for such a grand scale disaster film, some more time should have been put into fixing this problem to enforce the credibility and believability of the whole film.The visual effects in the film are easily the strongest point but we all knew that anyways. the scenes of disaster are beautifully crafted and look wonderful on the big screen: this is definitely a must see in the theatre. There is enough destruction to keep the film interesting and it is properly spread out throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime. SO surprisingly, the film kept me entertained for the entire length and I never once thought, ""When is it over?"" The story is much stronger than i would have expected and does a decent enough job at setting up the disasters and stitching them together well enough. It is in no way excellent but it gets the job done.The film plays out like a corny 70's B-disaster-movie when it was advertised as a dramatic, ground-breakingly real and chilling depiction of the end of mankind. The later is what it should have been. However beyond all of it's flaws the spectacular visual effects and solid enough storyline are enough to merit a recommendation.Check it out, just don't take it too seriously.",2012

Even when you see dead people on screen it dose not look disturbing. I guess the only scary thing was when the first flight start's in LasVegas, as seen in trailer. There was some suspense there, but that's it.I hope there would be better acting from the ""main"" characters, but their display is mediocre at best. All of the secondary roles in the movie gave more to it than the ""stars"".Near the end of movie there are so many coincidences that its more than I would expect, and I hate happy ending in this type of movie. I guess studio thought that brain washed consumer oriented Americans would pay more to see it. NOT TRUE. Since the movies started to be made for demographics, then they lost their charm.GOOD: CGI in LasVegas BAD: Movie is made to show how CGI can be used for the best.",2012

The special effects are easily 10/10 and at just over 2 hours and 30 minutes, there wasn't a single time I got bored. It was a thrill ride from start to finish. The only reason I don't give this movie a 9 or 10 is because of the suspension of disbelief that needs to occur in order to fully enjoy this. Don't expect to find super accurate science and expect characters to narrowly escape certain death at a completely unrealistic level. However, for me, as long as the acting is believable, which it is, I can usually look past unbelievable scenarios. This isn't a survival guide type movie where they show you how best to survive a doomsday scenario. This a blockbuster movie where the characters survive through sheer luck and plot armor. But if you can get past that, this movie has some of the most intense and heart racing disaster sequences I've ever seen.",2012

I sat close to the screen so maybe thats why it was almost scary sometimes . Anyway I can honestly say it was one of the best 9 dollars I ever spent ! Also for this movie I think watching the DVD would not even come close to the cinema experience . The effects were just so realistic ! What I didn't like was the excess emotionality and impractical actions and when they trade common sense for the drama and suspense . Suffice it to say I did not feel the time going by and the movie just keeps you waiting for the next scene and some comedy here and there also added a lot to the whole experience . Its been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much . Judging from how entertained I was I do not think 9 is too much . I recommend you go see it !",2012

This one uses all five but still falls flat in the thespian department. Danny Glover needs to return to acting school as does the rest of the caricatures and stereotypes that cast this special effects festival. I think that I found myself laughing more than not, expecting to be awestruck but actually left with thoughts about going back to the snack bar for a hot dog. I was however entertained by the stupendous special effects. If it were not for them, this film would be classified a comedy. I especially howled at the look on the face of the chicken nearing decapitation. Nevertheless, the technology kept this soon-to-be-an-amusement park ride from being a total loss. I give it a 10 for technology and a 0 for plot and acting, which averages to a 5. There will be of course the obligatory action figure toys for sale at Christmass.",2012
535,practicallypeach,Why are kids even allowed in Thriller movies anymore?,7,8 June 2010,"I will not lie. I enjoyed the action. Yes, it was far-fetched and unrealistic but, every now and then, I gripped my seat when I saw the world come crashing down. I think enough has been said on the topic of capitalism and racism. What I'd like to address is the dysfunctional family. I don't condone hitting kids, but never have I wanted to jump into a movie screen and slap a child so much before. These kids don't listen and they also tell adults what to do. I'm going to follow daddy up this Volcano. I'm going to help daddy unjam the gears in the boat. I'm going to tell my father-in-law off because Daddy just saved us. I'm going to go to daddy while he talks to that weirdo screaming into the wind, EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD NOT TO! I swear so many lives could have been saved in the movie if some stupid parent didn't stop and take ten minutes to explain to a child why they can't go with Daddy. It's ridiculous! This kind of behavior is considered 'cute' in America but it can ruin a movie for me. It ruined the latest War of the Worlds. Poseidon. It ruined The Original Jurassic Park, and it ruined this movie. Whatever happened to kids LISTENING to adults? And the adults making promises they knew they couldn't keep? Don't promise a child that everything is going to be alright when you know it might not be. Kids can handle it, just like they can handle talking back to you. ""Yes sweetie. We might die. Now sit down and shut up, and if you move, I'm going to kill you myself. Got it?"" Those words alone say I-love-you more than any action in this movie ever could.*spoiler* Could have saved the Russian girls' life near the end if Daddy didn't have devote so much time trying to convince his son to stay behind while he went to go fix something.

The soap opera dialogue... the ludicrous escapes in various vehicles, inches ahead of fissures, collapsing buildings, tsunamis... the offensive suggestion that HM Queen Elizabeth II would desert her country to save her own skin (and those of her corgis)... the other bloody dog... the ghastly Russian brats... and perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of all. I refer to the notion that the Chinese would build those enormous arks and then let a SINGLE non-member of the Chinese Communist Party on board. In fact a far better ending would have been for American submarine commanders to issue.an ultimatum: Let everyone else on board or we nuke them all. Then the Chinese call their bluff, and the only survivors in the entire world are those on the subs. Plus some dog. This may sound silly, but it would be far better than this very bad joke of a film.

537,nicolas-174,Like a punch in the face! And a very smart movie for the ones who understand it.,10,14 November 2009,"I've read these comments with attention and saw this movie yesterday. And I think everyone here get it wrong. It is sad to see that most people have not seen the amazing message hidden behind all the CGI and Special FX.Yes Emmerich has done a great classic with all the ingredients for a success: simple story, presentation of the characters, explanation of the phenomenon, and then the catastrophic events and how the characters are going to escape and finally an happy end. Your bag of popcorn is empty and you come back home with the feeling you spent 10 bucks and got for your money in the face.Now this movie is also like Indiocracy a very intelligent movie behind the visual. Let me explain why:1- Roland Emerich know that 90% of his audience is brainless and will explain all the scientific justification with a little cartoon that even a 10 year old kid will understand. It clearly shows that the director knows exactly what he does and who is watching. This guy is a mad scientist, this guy is the president, this guy is... every symbol is simple enough so you can check your Text messages while watching the movie and still follow the story...that's for the dumb guys.BUT2- The US president is very different than in these kind of movies. He is not an Hero, he is just a modest black man who his not going (thanks god!) to make an endless speech about how great America is. He has empathy, There is no real bad guys in this movie, they are just more inhuman and realistic about the situation, like all the bankers we see everyday in the news... But in this movie there are no really caricature of a bad guy who does not understand what is happening ...3- There are a lot of symbols that are destroyed in this movie. No one have understood the aircraft carrier smashing the white house symbol? The Vatican is destroyed why not a Mosque or a Boudha temple? And some strong biblical symbols too, I let you find them.4- who is going to save the world? I don't want to spoil the movie, but at NO time it is said that it is America. In fact, almost all the countries together are working to that, the US president is always respectful of the international community, explain to the NATO and decisions are not made in the White House only, and we are far away from ""The Day after"" and these movies where only America is saved in a patriotic boring hymn. Not in that movie.5- There is a huge symbol with the people who make the ships and the healthy 1% who paid their ticket to survive. This is not a random stupid idea, it is nothing else than another Emmerich strong political message. Think about what did happened this year and transpose... Something is melting down right now and that's not the Earth...6- at the end, replace the words of the hero about opening the gates with a call to the humanity that has a much broader meaning than most stupid movies. Emmerich had something to say to the world of a biblical proportion and he does it strongly and powerfully in this movie...I think most people will understand the real Emmerich message when the DVD will be out there. This movie is an incredible spectacular movie, but it delivers a true message. The real meltdown is a financial meltdown and a meltdown of our values and culture...There is not bad military guy in this movie, no good hero who save the world. Just a bunch of healthy paying their tickets, while the Indians who discovered everything and Chinese who made it possible to escape are dying...That's not just random... Thanks Roland Emmerich for having hidden this deep message behind this blockbuster full of special FX. You have successfully spent 250 Millions of $ to deliver a very powerful message to the world, that will I'm sure with time be understood... this movie as an historic milestone and a mirror of what did happened in October 2009. Hollywood always follow our history someway or another... In this movie Roland Emmerich brightly destroys all the symbols of greedy America, Washington, Christianity and the savers are the international community, the NATO, Chinese and Indians and Buddhists... Who said this movie is another stupid Hollywood movie? Now go watch the movie with another perspective...",2012
538,johnstrash1,Roland Emmerich - what else is there to say,3,8 February 2011,"Would somebody PLEASE, for the sake of good movie making, take the directors chair away from Roland Emmerich. Along with Shia Labeouf, Emmerich ranks as one of the two most inexplicable people coming out of Hollywood in my entire lifetime. All they would have to do is get together for a project and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" will no longer be the worst movie ever made.To be honest, I did not even know that this film was directed by him at first. But it didn't take long before it became obvious who was behind the camera. It had the same warm fuzzy feeling that all other Emmerich movies have, yet still manages to fail at making an emotional connection with the viewer. He just puts a few basic dramatic elements together, adds a shallow attempt at political commentary, dubs in some melodramatic music, then pours on the special effects. That in a nutshell is the official Emmerich formula (also see Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow).As for the characters, there are basically four types in the majority of his films. The first three are unbelievable a-holes in power, cool old men who are fathers of the protagonists and crazy, but intelligent nut cases. Most others fall into the third category as passionate and sensitive wimps who always do just the right thing even if it is completely stupid. Makes me feel all furry inside just thinking about it.If I had to say anything positive about 2012, it would be that it is at least better than Godzilla. But not by much.",2012

540,horseygurlz,A great disaster movie,8,25 June 2011,"This isn't exactly the best film in the world - but for a disaster film it's pretty good. The plot is exciting with plenty of action and drama, the characters are nice and varied and although the ending might seem decisive it actually still allows you to decide what will happen. Will the arks sink before they reach Africa? Will the people be thrown out - they weren't exactly nice to the Africans before, were they? Or will they reach Africa safely and have a nice happy-ever-after ending - that's probably what most people expect to happen. I thought Amanda Peet made a great worried mum character - and she was also a good sceptic before the disasters got worse. Probably one of my favourite parts of the film was when she was on the phone while watching the TV and laughing at any suggestion that the disasters were going to get worse. The reporter on the TV went ""I'm happy to announce that the worst is over"" (or something along those lines) and the entire state promptly starts cracking up. Brilliant. I would recommend this movie to any disaster or action film fan.",2012

Nonetheless, ""Gollywood"" goes and leaps to another non-sequitur. Exception: Ron Howard, Clint Eastwood, and others like them would have RESEARCHED the subject.And now LA gets destroyed again. Why in this world would some love such a terrible thing to happen, but when Gollywood producers put that city at the center of 98% of their TV and movie screenplay settings, so one must wonder...do they think LA is the center of the world, or is it just that they are too lazy or cheap to get off their dead unimaginative asses to write about, or film in, somewhere else? (Exception: Ron Howard, Clint Eastwood, and others like them would have CAREFULLY written up the screenplay.) I am sure Angelinios would agree. I can't imagine living in a place having their streets backed up every 5 minutes for gazillions of harebrained movies, with little or no socially redeeming value, to get filmed. Come to think of it maybe they feel the same in New Orleans, New York, Chicago, or Seattle. So what street is that in the picture, Wilshire Blvd? Am I supposed to know in order to be considered cool? Wilshire or Westheimer, who cares?",2012
542,jtrushant,A very entertaining disaster movie,7,23 March 2021,Wasn't expecting any deep meaningful characters and story-lines from this so I wasn't disappointed. This is a disaster flick and it so delivers. The best part is of course all the natural disasters and destruction. And it is brought to life by very realistic looking CGI. Even after a decade later effects look real. There is a decent story about a family literally outrunning natural disasters. Sometimes its too ridiculous but you are quickly taken over by the amazing destruction scenes which are surprisingly creative. Its a pure entertainment movie.,2012
543,deceiver-1,This is a fun movie,7,16 November 2009,"This movie was fun. It's a popcorn movie. The earth is ending and the cgi looks great on a really global scale. No, it's not academy award level for acting or story line but it was an enjoyable, fun, edge of the seat movie like independence day (not humorous though). I had fun and the time passed quickly for a long flick. It didn't seem as though there were any slow spots and plenty of nearly caught in the crevasse get-a-ways. Getting the cgi to make believable effects on global level, like you see in the trailers was kind of awesome especially on he big screen. If you're looking for a fun movie then go see it. Some movies are best seen on DVD or not seen at all. You won't regret this one if all you want is a fun time and not some meaningful epic. It delivers on all the popcorn levels.",2012

545,smiley_pat77,...it does need leave the audience to ponder anything fresh...,5,17 July 2010,"When I saw some of the shots in the trailer and particularly in the 5 minute escape from LA scene that was posted online, my jaw must have been about mid-chest. To see such a thorough obliteration of a city with the visual details that were in that scene was downright terrifying. Consequently, I was legitimately excited to see this film, if only for the look of it. The problem with that mindset is that only paves the way for disappointment later on.I suppose ""2012"" is almost like a trophy date: fun to look at, but once you become acquainted the luster diminishes. If collapsing freeways, an exploding national park, and converging tsunamis large enough to consume entire continents ever could be described as lush, this is it. But for something that looks so rich how is it that I end up feeling cheap by the end of it?I was not only OK with the protagonists narrowly escaping LA during a cataclysmic earthquake, I was thrilled by the excitement of it. In fact it was necessary to establish these main characters, out of all 6 billion people in the world, as being worthy of our attention. But to have yet another narrow escape in the same plane after the eruption of the Yellowstone caldera and again in Las Vegas when the ash cloud catches up to them is simply annoying and quite honestly, dumb.The fatal flaw is that while the buildup was indeed ominous, the Mayan prediction of the 2012 phenomenon, the one thing that is responsible for this film coming to fruition, seems to have only been included as an initial thought to give the rest of the movie a little extra credibility. The last two hours proceeds to have it shoved to the back burner. There is not even a mention of any dates during the course of the plot other than that it is the year 2012. The winter solstice never plays a role. The galactic alignment that will occur is mentioned briefly and the predicted solar maximum is included, but everything else seems to orbit around crust displacement theory.""2012"" insults the Mayan's abilities as astrologers by giving their prediction of the ""end of the world"" the ultimate Western treatment. The destruction of the Earth is not my problem. My problem is that there is no theme to support it. The Mayans merely predicted the end of our current cycle to occur in 2012. New Age theories talk about a shift in attitude, particularly Western materialism. The film sort of, kind of, perhaps, maybe explores these ideas. The people who do make it aboard the ""arks"" that are built to save humanity are those who are privileged enough to purchase tickets so of course, there is a sense of elitism and some conflict between a couple main characters calling for a more humane attitude. But by the time the credits roll, there isn't any real hope for change in the human species. More importantly it doesn't leave the audience to ponder anything fresh about our current 2009 society and what kind of changes we might like to see.",2012

Except the small part went Charlie (Woody Harrelson character) makes that video blog where he explains in a funny way what will happen to the world, the real important stuff that makes the year 2012 so fascinating, especially the Mayan calendar, who the Mayans were, all is left out, and what remains is huge explosions that left Africa the only continent that can people live in.Roland Emmerich should have done a whole lot better with the budget he had.

547,Poopdeck90210,Irwin Allen's Disaster Flix Remagined,7,23 November 2009,"I agree with the current ""buzz"" that I have heard about this film: Awesome special effects which prop up a lumbering storyline and plot. Having said that, 2012 is certainly worth a ""see"" in first run release! If you grew up I'm the 1970's, you'll immediately recognize this film to be reminiscent of the string of Irwin Allen disaster flix that he released (in VERY close succession) in the 1970's: The Poseidon Adventure... The Towering Inferno... Earthquake (In Sensaround)... Fire!... Flood!... Beyond the Poseidon Adventure. I have NO DOUBT that John Cusack (had he been born 30 years earlier) would have given Steve McQueen and Gene Hackman a good run for their money during the screen tests that took place behind the blue screens to test the sincerity of the lead character / protagonist in looking shocked and at the same time taking on the role of the reluctant leader to guide the other less informed characters thru the twists and turns that the disaster is about to present.

There are 30 or so main characters that we are forced to follow, and expected to care about. Unfortunately, I didn't.
On the positive side, the visual effects were impressive, but when you don't feel invested in the characters or story, it felt like the filmmakers were 'polishing a turd'.",2012

Deep Impact was a far better film about world destruction! John Cussack again i have 2 thoughts about his films i enjoy them but not enough to watch again and i think this is the review with this film.the CGI was good but that was the it the film was predictable to the point where i could see what was going to happen with every scene. i usually write longer reviews on films but i cannot think of the words to describe what a let down this film was! come on Hollywood!!! you must be able to do better than this!!",2012
550,viennashade,Follows the laws of cartoon physics.,3,15 March 2014,"Remember how Wile E. Coyote always lived even when he fell off a cliff, or got run over by a train? This was about that ridiculous. The John Cusack character should have died 83 times in this movie. All I kept thinking about was how well it would lend itself to one of those ""Everything Wrong With 2012"" video commentaries. The last time I remember a movie being this implausible was Speed, and it left a bad aftertaste that's never faded. But that was at least an enjoyable flick.Faster than a speeding bullet, more invincible than Evel Knievel, John Cusack's character has a knack for jumping chasms and being at the right place at the right time. Through luck, magic, miracles, superpowers, whatever, he makes one incredible split-second escape after another. This device is tremendously abused, not just in how close the calls are, but the sheer number of them.At every turn, something goes hopelessly wrong (beyond just the natural disasters). But even that doesn't stop the charmed Cusack from coming out of it alive (by the skin of his teeth). And with people dying all around him, every single one of his family makes it. Every falling fireball misses them...every time they pull away in a vehicle or plane, a gorge opens up exactly where they need to go so they have to jump it. Over and over and over and over. There is no relief from the ridiculousness.The pinnacle of ridiculousness is this scene: As soon as John Cusack finds the map that will save his family, a huge chasm opens up in the ground, and John naturally falls right into it. BUT – never fear – he manages to grab onto the edge in the nick of time and pulls himself up...still holding the map in his hand!!! Is this Emmerich guy an adult?? I understand he wants to take us on a nonstop roller coaster ride, but... If they would simply have made the earth open up a few meters away, instead of a millimeter, or they could make their getaway by a few seconds, instead of a quarter second EVERY TIME, it would still have been suspenseful, but plausible enough to not make you want to scream at the screen.Their plane (since the charmed Cusack is on it) glides effortlessly between falling buildings. It's the end of the world and they're seriously low on fuel -- why do they never dump the weight of all those excess autos? But...they continue on their hopeless journey. In the end, they only made it because...their destination had shifted! What luck.I saw the ship plowing into the White House in the trailer and thought I was in the mood for a big disaster flick, so I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin.The FX were grand as you would expect or could hope for, and the acting was passable. The problem was with the script. The dialogue, the characterizations and the plot -- all dreadful. I cry pretty easily, but it was very hard to feel anything for any of the characters in this movie. Except maybe Danny Glover. They tried to make jokes but they weren't funny. Only Woody Harrelson's character was somewhat interesting.The thing about selling tickets to the arks was played up as some terrible fault in humanity, but really – how else were they going to get the money to build them? The governments of the world all cooperate quite civilly in the face of this impending catastrophe that would put men at each other's throats. They've gotta kill anyone who figures out their plan...yet they're not worried about any of the people who bought tickets leaking the info? Like what if someone declined the offer because they didn't believe the world was going to end? Oh, maybe they were killed as well? In the wake of the Japanese tsunami, one has to wonder with all the nuclear plants and toxic chemical stores how doomed they would really be no matter what..Right up to the end, as the every-man-for-himself mentality would have been peaking, the plot did not let up on its ludicrousness. As the arks are taking off, forget that the clock is ticking and every second counts...forget that there will not be enough food/supplies and everyone on board could die and this all will be for nothing...Chiwetel's impassioned plea convinces every world ruler to let everyone on at the last second.And it ends with a lame love song...And now I will happily part with this DVD.",2012
551,prodigy-25,1500m high wave of puke - prepare for the impact.,1,20 December 2009,"Where to begin dissecting this pointless waste of film (calling it a movie would be an undeserved compliment)? I think I'll start with mutated neutrinos. Why not? One can never underestimate the danger of those. So, if you'll ever see a mutated neutrino somewhere around your neighborhood, please, call the police immediately.No, wait. This doesn't explain anything. I need to find a different approach...Ronald Emmerich – the script writer and director of 2012 – doesn't care for any of those petty and boring laws of physics he studied (or did he?) in school. Our poor old Earth has existed for 5 billion years only to be broken and CGI-reshaped at the whim of his mighty imagination. And you know what? It could be alright if Emmerich's imagination were actually half as mighty as his immense complacency.His past works (e.g. The Day After Tomorrow) were – if not terribly original – at least somewhat plausible if you turned suspense-of-disbelief mode on and remembered that it's typical Hollywood after all. But now, elated by success, he has thrown away all pretense of verisimilitude. Now neutrino act as microwaves, hydraulics that lifts massive metal gates can be blocked by a finger-thick Chinese-made plastic cable, a small propeller-driven aircraft can fly in close proximity to an erupting super-volcano (just to clarify: a single VEI-8 eruption can plunge the Earth into a volcanic winter, so your puny H-bomb pales in comparison), mobile phones continue to function just fine even when all modern infrastructure is already annihilated, and GPS navigation systems aren't rendered useless by massive miles long shifts in the Earth's crust...Such is the world of 2012. Its pieces are poorly and hastily brought together in a truly absurd, Frankenstein's manner. If Emmerich needs to justify another completely unbelievable plot twist, soapy ""emotional"" scene or meaningless CG destruction sequence, anything goes. And forgive me for leaving actors and their characters aside. I like Woody Harrelson, but even his brief appearance barely deserves mentioning. Others are just ""reading a script"", and when John Cusack actually utters these words, they sound almost like an excuse.2.5 hours of incessant brain torture that will make the coming of Apocalypse your golden dream.",2012
552,sagar272,Only thing I can say is Hats off to CG.Rest is a failure..!!,8,15 November 2009,"The whole movie comprises entirely special effects.The many destruction sequences throughout the film are absolutely breathtaking to behold, and one wonders if Roland Emmerich starts every film imagining how he will destroy the White House. Lots of sections in the movie seem very unrealistic like a plane taking off just on the verge of a collapsing run-over .i mean is that possible for heavens sake but Emmerich tends that audiences might believe everything he sells. there's enough science and pseudoscience running around to give the film a certain of-the-moment wonder and clarity. Believe me, I could easily list at least a hundred of flaws and errors made in this movie ranging from human behavior over technical design to mathematical chances - not even regarding the constant violation of physical principles. Fun fact: everyone on the planet speaks English. Doesn't matter if you're from Tibet far away from civilization. It's the ultimate language of communication. Fun fact 2: American cars have the best suspensions in the world. They can withstand every possible bump you can imagine, also limo drivers got some raw skills.John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are the only actors that work to hold the film together, while Danny Glover and Thandie Newton were an utter and complete let-down considering their previous work as in they aren't given much importance throughout. The main characters remain shallow throughout the whole 158 minutes. Some are just not interesting, others are so overdrawn (Yuri, Tamara) that you just can't think of them as real people. The story does not develop and leads to something you did not expect at all. But the worst of all is the awkward exaggeration in EVERYTHING shown on the screen. It is nice to see a nail-bitingly stuck last-second escape in a movie. Seeing your main characters taking a one-in-a-million chance every ten minutes is revolting. It is an insult to fictional themes. There's a scene in the movie where a giant cargo plane heading to China is being piloted by a Professional and a Student who has had a few hours experience after that scene even I think that I can fly one.Ultimately summing up this movie is a THRILL to watch but only if u do it with utter numbness without rethinking any of the scenes again.This movie almost touches the line of being a Masterpiece but escapes narrowly considering Emmerich's previous works. Well while watching this movie I didn even try to look for some Oscar worthy performances but may b the VFx section might run up one.",2012
553,Mister_Anderson,Better than I expected,7,26 December 2009,"If you've seen any of Roland Emmerich's previous disaster titles, you probably know what you're in for with this one. That being said, I felt 2012 had better acting and a more exciting storyline than the others.In order to enjoy this film, you have to ignore the ridiculously absurd premise about neutrinos and the sun catastrophically altering the earth's crust (forget about the Mayan prophecy, which is hardly mentioned). If you can overlook why the world is ending, this is actually an captivating film with some spectacular effects scenes. Yes, there are several perilous close calls that stretch the notion of ""luck"". Yes, the actors from all parts of the world become interconnected in what stretches the notion of ""coincidence"". No, it's not going to receive any best acting or screenplay nominations. Nevertheless, it's engaging.Cusack is great as the everyman hero. Ejiofor grabs your attention as the young government scientist trying to prepare for the inevitable. Glover and Harrison are also effective in smaller roles: Glover as the resolute President, and Harrison as the wackjob conspiracy theorist who might not be so crazy after all. Many other characters are merely stereotypes (like the Russian) or one dimensional (like the wife), but let's be honest, it's not the characters that we're coming to see. If you are, you'll probably be disappointed.2012 is not great but it entertains as a doomsday thriller. IMO it's better than ID4, Godzilla, Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 BC. Worth a rental if you're into disaster flicks.",2012

555,msmith-56,Oversold with a TV Ending,3,14 November 2009,"Marketing WAY oversold this disaster flick, promising to deliver an ""end-of the world"" scenario and delivering a very lame ending. The movie starts out slower than I expected, with a lot of TV-level family 'drama' and ""character development."" The action does not begin until 30 minutes into the film, after trying to explain way too much! I had entered the theater with my disbelief suspended, and they spend overtime creating doubts. Everyone knows that the more 'facts' you throw at the audience, the more thinking that goes on instead of watching. It was like sitting through an engineering report before riding the Six Flags Riddler's Revenge. This was unnecessary and made the movie too long.Once the real show started, the special effects were worthy of the best Disney rides. Things came apart nicely, and there was just enough detail to give you that ""bodies flying out the windows"" realism. The airplane perspective was understandable and not implausible enough to be a distraction. However, seeing LA, Las Vegas, and Yellowstone get bashed to bits was not enough. Other venues such as Hawaii were mere glowing glimpses (though the White House wipe-out was pretty good). There are too many ""quiet moments"" in-between that were like going to the bathroom between rounds of a fight. Finally, the ending started out pretty strong, if not a bit corny, then went ""happily ever after"" in the most ridiculous biblical way. It was a deal killer to have the engineering ""part one"" explain how the world was going to end in ways that Armageddon would envy, then get us to believe the deck-o-continents was shuffled and re-dealt in less time than it takes to get through the NBA playoffs.Good bits were (1) China saves the day (2) Woody Harrelson goes out in great style (3) there is no mention of terrorists or global warming.Acting is OK. John Cusak gives a journeyman performance that was everything you might expect for a disaster film. However, he was on screen much too long, as were many others. Amanda Peet was acceptable as the ex-wife but offered no value-add. Danny Glover looked shell shocked as the President but did not linger long enough to make it a problem. Thandie Newton was passable as the President's daughter but lacked the charm of her other works such as the Chronicles of Riddick. Oliver Platt was OK as the cold bureaucrat but nowhere up to his West Wing performances. And Chiwetel Ejiofor was passable as the ""do-gooder PhD that cannot figure out the obvious until it is too late but still gets the girl"" guy.Bottom line, get into the moving 20 minutes late, plan for a popcorn break after Vegas goes, and leave just after the waters crash over Tibet. Or wait will the DVD comes and skip those parts.Oh, the sound mixing was excellent. Post production made everything seamless with the minor exception of the backdrop of Cusak and Harrelson as Yellowstone went up (those flares were a tiny bit off). No sex, little blood (a few wounds), fleeting expletives were few and hard to catch, and no political statements.",2012
556,buckeye22,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be,7,8 March 2010,"I had heard some pretty bad things about this movie. I was prepared for the worst. Yes, the dialogue is hokey. Yes, the plot is implausible (as far as we know). Yes, there are some AMAZING coincidences that take place. Yes, everyone on the planet (except the makers of this movie) knows that jet airplanes can't fly through volcanic ash -- yet they do anyway, several times. Yes, it is a bit preachy all the way through the movie. Yes, according to this movie, white people are pretty bad and black people and people of color are mostly good. Yes, it's a convenient, symbolic, cheesy, bordering-on-racist ending (""The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded!""). The rest of the world was flooded. For those of you who haven't read The Bible, God flooded the Earth because it was filled with evil (this movie seems to forget that He promised he would never do it again). Yes, it's two-and-a-half hours long, when it really didn't have to be (as usual with 2.5 hour long movies).Having said all of that, all-in-all, it was a fairly entertaining movie. The special effects were pretty damn good. The story is fairly compelling. The acting is marginal, but the actors didn't have much quality dialogue to deal with. The direction was a little sketchy too, but with a guilty ""pleasure"" like this movie, you can even excuse that. I know it sounds like I'm talking you out of the movie, but I'm actually trying to talk you into it. It's worth seeing.",2012
557,wicj,It Is What It Is,3,20 December 2020,"The only reason I am bothering to write this review is to comment on fact that they didn't bother to include any ""world leaders"" from Africa on their arcs, yet they are planning to land on the dark continent to continue civilization...yeah, good luck with that.Also, where did all this water come from? It flooded the world to 29,000 feet?Yep, it's a bad movie that doesn't leave out a single cliché or disaster movie trope and ignores basic scientific principles. But it's not the worst movie ever as other reviewers have declared. It's good for some chuckles and ooh and ahs at the effects. So if you catch it for free on a streaming service and you're looking to burn a couple hours on a movie you don't have to think about, consider this -- just don't think about it.",2012

I personally fought back tears at least 5 time,and my wife,pretty much cried the entire movie. Way to go Roland. You really did make the best end all of disaster movies. With that being said, i will say that i was already familiar with several of the fx shots,and software used to make them. He did some ""day after"" snow stuff,and some fire,ash, fx from the godzilla film. But,those movies pushed the visuals in a new direction,so why not use them. I was confused by the ""license mistake"" to the point that i wouldn't let it go at the time.

559,daniel-mcgarry,Why Am I Not Surprised?,1,27 November 2009,"Once again, Roland Emmerich has raised an enormous budget and spent it all on CGI special effects. In a way, I'm happy for him and his family that he has found gainful employment, i.e., a paying job, but why must we allow the ENTIRE WORLD to think that Americans as a society are THIS STUPID?! For obvious reasons, we must view the end of the world in the cinema because when it really does come we'll be too busy running and screaming. And for the record - the end of the world is JUST THAT. There ain't no survivors, Ark or no. The levels of volcanism and fire would consume all the available oxygen, so even if you were one of the lucky 14 people to be in an area that wasn't drowned/burned/or broken open and roto-tilled into the depths of the planet, in a very few short hours you'll be asphyxiated. Last year's 'Knowing' was at least realistic. Giant solar flare = End Of Life. But even they just HAD to have a 'happy' ending where benevolent alien visitors save some of the children. A more realistic scenario would be: ""End of the world's coming - make your peace with whatever type of God you can be comfortable with.""And there'd be a LOT more looting, rape and pillage... In the final analysis, it's never 'Women and children first' it's 'Every man for himself!'",2012
560,mkools,Make sure your remote control has full batteries,1,8 December 2009,"To be short, this movie was just awful. This is one of the worst movies I've seen for the past five years. OK the CGI was pretty impressive, but that didn't help the movie at all.I won't go into all of them but this movie was one big large chain of all movie clichés you can imagine or come up with yourself. The hero was divorced, his son doesn't call him dad, his son wants to play the hero (War of the Worlds anyone?) and the hero always makes narrow escapes, not one or two times, but maybe 20 times.Then there's the mistakes. A wave with the height of Mount Everest (which would never be possible). A bursting Yellowstone volcano which takes 7 hours to reach Washington, yet they can outrun it with a small airplane that goes like what, 200 mph? The president not going on Air Force One but instead dying with his people, noble? Yes, but plain stupid too and in the real world this would never happen. If there's one thing you need with a disaster like this it's a leader. A plain without fuel that explodes and the list goes on.....I mean come on I know it's not that realistic and everything but there were just too many of those mistakes.Further more, this movie was way too predictable. You could easily guess with every action or scene what was going to happen.And you know what? That wasn't even the worst part of this movie. The worst part were the 'I will always love you' dialogues. So if you are going to rent this movie watch it with your thumb on the forward button on your remote control to skip all these scenes because there are a whole lot of them. I think from the 2.5 hours this movie takes people are crying for 1.5 hour or there is some other boring dialogue going on that nobody is interested in.To conclude my review, I didn't care at all the world was going to end, or the people that die in this movie. I just wanted this movie to end so I could go home and burst in tears.I've seen some terrible movies in my life, but this one goes in my top 10 list of worst movies ever seen.Do yourself a favor, skip this one and go rent War of the Worlds which I know has a lot of flaws too but compared to this flick it's an absolute masterpiece.",2012
561,dp-brightful,It's a Fantasy Ride People,6,4 January 2011,"OK, if you watch this movie as a family film meant to entertain children and be more in the genre of light-hearted fantasy instead of action then this film is actually reasonably fun. The problem is that the film was supposed to be a great action film played by a strong cast of actors. The movie had far more potential than it realized. That's why most people hated the movie. It far underperformed it's potential.That said, watch this movie as a fantasy film. Suspend belief for a while and sit back and enjoy it. Yes, the scenes are unbelievable. Yes, the graphics are cheesy by modern standards. Yes, the script is overly gratuitous, self-serving and convenient. But, the movie is still fun. Good silly fun. 6/10 stars, mainly due to moments of good acting. Woody Harrelson alone makes for a good chuckle or two.",2012
562,Kinetek,Hackneyed & Tired,4,25 November 2009,"What to say. I was looking forward to seeing this film, because despite my disposition for really deep and meaningful fayre, like most people I do love a good old disaster movie. Is it bigger than The Day After Tomorrow? You bet. Waaaay bigger. Is it bigger that Independence Day? Sure is. Is it as good as either? Urm...2012 serves only to show that no matter how much ego, money and contrived patriotism you throw into a project such as this, it simply can't work because the engine itself is seriously flawed. Emmerich has certainly succeeded in making the biggest (in every possible sense of the word) disaster movie in the history of film - but that doesn't help one jot here.The actors seem almost uncomfortable with the roles, and I'm finally coming round to the idea that John Cusack hasn't had a bad deal regarding parts in the past, but simply makes excruciatingly bad decisions. Danny Glover plays possibly the single most contrived US President ever seen on screen - it's cringeworthy to the point of vomitus.There's no plot, no sense of direction other than getting right down to the CGI fireworks, it has utter contempt for the real world both physically and factually, and possibly the worst aspect of this movie is that it constantly tries to tug your heartstrings with bile-inducing clichés and schmaltz.That said, the CGI really is something to behold at times - but it does beg the question that if Emmerich was given a tenth of the budget and told to step away from the 'bang-bang machines', would the result be any good? Well, if you take away the CGI out of this equation, what you have is quite possibly the biggest B-Movie ever made - and that is no exaggeration.So, all in all - I don't recommend you waste your hard earned/stolen cash on this. If you really need to see it, wait for the DVD or BD to surface for less than the price of a McDonald's very soon - because I'm afraid this one is destined for the bargain bucket in a supermarket near you, very, very soon.I'm giving this 4.3 out of 10 - and three of those stars go directly to the guys who toiled over the CGI machines, wondering what they had done to deserve this. Truly a disappointment.",2012
563,jeffrey4949,Great earth-destruction scenes but no substance,7,30 November 2009,"Maybe this movie will have an impact on the global movie audience, but if it does, it won't because it's a good film. It might strike home with millions who see it and suddenly realise that our planet is a fragile system of checks and balances and when they get out of control ... oh boy; better watch out! The computer effects are simply breath-taking as the globe literally disintegrates before our eyes, but the story and especially the lumbering last third of the movie were tiresome.2012 fails to touch on why 2012 is important to doom mongers. Okay, maybe many of the viewers are not so interested in the many forecasters who predict the same - 2012 is the last year for us all - but showing a one minute piece of mass suicide at Tikal is not good enough. In fact, this movie could be any year you like to choose. The director simply hijacked the doom year of 2012 and then totally failed to explain why 2012 is so important.Everyone must see the first half of this movie. It's a technical masterpiece. Some can stay on to watch the ramifications of global destruction and how we might decide who is 'saved' if we get the chance, but nobody need stay and watch the last third. It's an insult to the audience. The script is crass, with sickly goodbyes and a pathetic plot with totally unrealistic contraptions to 'save mankind'. Some shots were laughable (although not supposed to be so). Look out for the flying giraffe and the floating elephant. Also take note of how a simple propeller can stop a vessel the size of 10 supertankers in just 30 seconds. Then there is the 'where did that come from' convoy half way up a mountain, and the infantile sunrise 27 minutes after the biggest storm in the history of the planet.I understand that this is the director's last 'disaster' movie. I hope so. And how fitting that he should be hanging up his clapper board after directing a real cinematic disaster!I score it 7, but only for the special effects.",2012

You need to have a relatively good cast to waste. You need a special FX budget that could keep a poor country fed for a year, and lastly you need a cliché riddled stinker of a script.This film has them all in trumps! The story was so unbelievably bad that at times I just could not stop laughing, and these were the serious parts. The FX of course were great and it was relatively entertaining (hence the score of 4 rather than 1).

In between is a long string of ridiculous action scenes, with cars jumping roads breaking apart (twice), airplanes taking off with runways crumbling behind them (twice), runways that are too short and end at a chasm where the plane must fall down and barely make it up again (twice), a car driving under a bridge in slow fall that nearly scrapes the roof as it barely makes it, plane flying through a small gap between two skyscrapers falling towards each other, and on and on and on and on.I found by the last half hour I just wanted it to be over.

My favorite character was Woody Harrelson's character, and he died less than half way through by being engulfed by a cg super volcano. The whole movie, the crew flies from Yellowstone, to Vegas, to China, to Mt. Everest, giving you a major headache!

I missed it at the cinema, and despite moderate views, I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD. I can't believe how disappointed I was. I didn't expect an 8 out of 10 film, but neither did I think that it would be this far below my expectations. Quite frankly it was rubbish. The special effects are good, but this can't save it. The script was an absolute insult to your intelligence. I do like John Cusack and Danny Glover. It meant nothing here. This film was just loaded with the same tired old clichés and moronic sub stories about peoples personal issues and emotional baggage. Why does the main character always have to come from a broken marriage? Can't they think of something new? You really have to leave all of your brain at the door. *** Spoiler***Just one of the many stupendous exaggerations in this film was a van out running a pyroclastic cloud. A normal volcanic explosion sends these out at 700km per hour. This was a Super Volcano, a catastrophic global event a mere 1000 times bigger, yet our heroes still manage to escape from it despite being right there when it erupted.

572,Moragandjim58,Predictable Hokum,6,29 November 2009,"Firstly, if special effects are your 'thing', then you will adore this movie. They have crammed so many into the movie, that you will want to watch it again and again. You will see tiny figures clinging to the wreckage of crumbling buildings as they crumble into the bowels of the earth. There are the spectacular losses of world famous landmarks, and the associated death of panic stricken onlookers. For those with Blue Ray and HD TV's, this will be a slow motion voyeurs dream as you watch these scenes unfold.However, if like my wife and I you like a good story, then this is not for you. The story is a minor incidental part of the movie. Whats worse, the script is very B moviesque. ""But it's a suicide mission!"" ""I'll do it"". Cue much kissing and hugging while I muttered, ""get on with it then"". A huge crack is racing towards the escaping car/plane (insert mode of transport) and you just know they have to escape because the films still got 2 hours to go. Then there's the speech by one of the main characters about cherishing family and so on, so you just know they will be dead very soon. It was cheesy and too predictable.I read one of the other reviews, and he/she commented that this film had the potential to be truly great. If the quality of the script and storyline had even been half as good as the effects, then this could have been one of the greatest movies of recent years. Unfortunately, Roland Emmerich seems to have spent so much time and money on the effects budget, that they either didn't have time to do a good script, or they couldn't afford one of Hollywood's great writers to produce something memorable.All told, it was well executed hokum.

Despite the CGI effects being top notch, the film quickly descended into absurdity and disbelief, and looked as if I was watching something from the 'effects gag reel' of The Day After Tomorrow.Sadly, the idea of the ancient prediction about the world ending in 2012 is chucked away in the first 10 minutes or so, which leaves the rest of the film open to an unrealistic structure, and a lazy, unimaginative script, involving John Cusack's character with a highly embarrassing sub-plot about his family issues. How can a film that cost millions to make get tangled up in a senseless script that descends into its own non-logical manner? Taking all of this into account (and the fact that the film is just a pinch too long), Emmerich has yet again stunned us with his visual effects, and is easily the best point to emerge from this disaster flick.I really do hope that the world does end in 2012, because then, films like this that spend so much money on trying to make a good film, won't be made any more.",2012

Or, even if I don't ""like"" them, I appreciate that they have some relationship to how things crash, explode, etc. And when a movie persistently flouts every possible law of physics just to inject artificial drama into the scene, it results in less enjoyment of the action sequences, not more.Also, I like love stories and human interaction. But when the clock is ticking down to the last minute or two of total annihilation, and people who are purportedly intelligent, thinking people, chose that moment to have an extended discussion of their feelings, GIVE ME A BREAK.And I usually don't mind movie that run over 2 hours because, sometimes it just takes longer to help the audience understand the human motivation, or to give the plot enough time to evolve logically. But to waste over 2 1/2 hours and still wind up with a ridiculous, incoherent plot, with characters that are worse than implausible and who waste some good actors' talents? Ugh.",2012

576,Rick_Swift,What are you going to do on Day 27?,8,13 November 2009,"Swift shot: Dynamic special effects dominate a terrible landscape of destruction and demise. The characters gradually become compelling and the story is interesting; what you won't find shoved down your throat is the conspiracy theorists rantings, it is addressed but not overdone - well played by the director. There have been enough shows on Discovery and the History Channel postulating what might happen – this film shows you what WILL happen! OK, perhaps nothing will happen, but either way, this film can stand on its own as an impressive natural disaster thriller.What do you grab as the embers burn around you? What is the thing that defines you, what are you willing to let go of when the final bell tolls? These are questions that will haunt you throughout Roland Emmerich's latest natural disaster epic, 2012.I am assuming most know the Mayans predicted the end of all time to be December 21, 2012. So, how will it all end, what will be the final stroke that does in humanity? I won't ruin it for you by giving it away (as there is a slight twist), but I will give you a hint. . . the human plan for survival is nothing incredibly novel.The storyline centers around a broken family, struggling to come to terms with roles and identities undefined. John Cusack plays Jackson Curtis, a small-time, albeit published author of a novel that swallowed his marriage. He of course is broke and trying to prove to his now somewhat estranged children that he is still their father. He wants to hate the new beau in his ex-wife's life – and I wanted to hate him too – but he serves his purpose and is an honorable character.On one of his ""super dad"" trips to Yellowstone Park, they happen across a drained out lake as some whackadoo (Woody Harrelson) observes his family get detained by the US Geological Department. Of course they are advised to vacate the area but are never told why. Jackson discovers the nut-job broadcasts a radio program from a trailer in Yellowstone – and at first he blows him off as another conspiracist freak. But, what do you do when the freaks with the cardboard signs are right? In a race to escape the end of the world, Jackson manages to gather his family, including his replacement, to a beyond top-secret escape plan set out of China. In a twisted Bondesque setting, a secret international society will stop at nothing to protect the secret. Flanked by sub-plots galore, reminiscent of Independence Day, the characters come across as a tad melodramatic – but not to the detriment of the audience.What makes this film so interesting is speculating your own role in your family, your country, your very existence – when the stakes are nothing short of the entire Earth, what would you do to survive? Would you sacrifice yourself so that others may live? What values truly make us humans? These questions are answered throughout the film. I was incredibly entertained and compelled to follow the life-paths of these characters well after the final credits faded out.If you wait to rent this one, shame on you, the special-effects alone demand you enjoy this in theaters. I was amazed at how interactive the crowd was throughout this film. I remember when I saw Independence Day, surrounded by fellow jarheads – and how we cheered as the Marine saved the day.This film lets everyone play Marine! See, worth isn't measured by wealth or what color your nation's flag is or what your medals say about you . . . it is measured by your actions regardless of personal danger. Anyone can be a hero, it just takes a compassionate heart and the courage to stand up.www.iratefilms.com",2012

And believe me, I am a fan of well-made popcorn films in general, and of Emmerich's films in general. I loved Independence Day and other stuff he did, even use scenes from his films as examples how to build a scene, a character etc etc. One for all is the president's speech on July 4th in ID4 which is a masterful example of writing, acting and subtle use of music - each time I see it I want to applaud Bill Pullman... But this awfully noisy and boring excuse of a film is just nothing else than a play-pool of special effects with an awfully negative plot, no irony whatsoever and more than stereotyped and surprisingly wooden characters and actors.

It also has characters you don't really care about, if they die no one gives a crap. You don't even care about a dog in the movie. And who's idea was it to cast John Cusack? He was just terrible, everyone was just god awful in this movie. I had to watch in my Earth Science class last year over Armageddon. I would have rather watched Armageddon over this piece of crap. The only thing that is good about the movie is the special effects, but you only saw the good ones in the trailer. This is the third worst movie I have ever seen.

580,ricburger,Why Has Emerrich only made one good disaster movie?,3,31 July 2010,"The answer to that question is, that that movie (Independence Day) didn't take itself seriously. Everything he has done since has been much more straight faced and that has been there downfall. I know what your going to say, ID4 wasn't a parody. No it wasn't, but it made so many sly references to other films and TV series in a wonderful eye winking way, that it made it much more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. Maybe that's the point here? Maybe Emmerich might have a better track record with comedy merged with gigantic special effects. Maybe he should have done that awful ""Disaster Movie""? Granted. there was one part of the movie that seemed to gravitate towards that sly wink. That would be Woody Harrelson's over the top performance as the conspiracy radio talk jock covering the crisis while waiting for the Yellowstone caldera to erupt. Alas, it was far from enough to even make it entertaining. The special effects are well done, but all that does is make this a grand cliché.",2012

It can be a little silly at times, but its all part of the entertainment. You are not supposed to take it too seriously.

This is Ronald Emmerich's take on the apocalypse, which before the mentioned 2012 date was an actual possibility according to many people. Emmerich gives these deluded souls a visual perspective of how the final moments shall play out. This includes everything from mass wildfire the likes that will shame any real fire of the Californian landscape. Earthquakes which will dwarf the intensity of even imagined earthquakes such as the ""big one"" of North Pacifica and floods and destruction the kind one hopes to never have to have the misfortune of being in vicinity of. In other words if you want to see the planet barf you will enjoy 2012. If you are in for some characterization or plot than this film is bound to leave you disappointed. Had 2012 arrived before the Alien attacks of Independence Day maybe the reaction would have been much more boisterous but it comes in the day and age of too much CGI and special effects which renders it pretty much pedestrian at best.",2012

587,Bosch,Rubbish,6,24 November 2009,"Tonight I went along to see this, the new Roland Emmerlich disaster epic 2012. It starts well enough in 2009, with shots of planets in our solar system lining up (the scale is all wrong) and a nice close-up of the sun. Then we're inside an Indian neutrino detector, and from here 2012 goes careening off the rails. You see, prompted by the alignment of the planets, the sun starts spewing out solar flares that contain, ummm, ""mutated neutrinos"". These particles somehow begin to heat up the Earth's core just as water heats up in a microwave oven. Yep, this is how it's explained in the exposition! Cut to three years later and the Earth's crust is going berserk, just like the screenplay. Look, the film is not that bad, really. I mean, it didn't make me want to drink bleach or anything like that. What you've got is one reel (20 mins) of set-up followed by a string of crazy cliffhanger escapes. John Cusack's in it, trying to patch up his broken marriage to Amanda Peet, and who can blame him? So that's interesting. California and Yosemite National Park are both destroyed with amazing photo-realistic SFX (remember, Emmerlich brought us that photo-realistic woolly mammoth stampede in 10,000 BC). Also, the third act has some great visuals but also the worst Touching Hollywood Moments we've seen since, well, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Additionally, there's too many cringe-worthy speeches by assorted protagonists – not enough of them die horribly. That said, 2012 kept my suburban audience of plumbers, single mums, emos, and Japanese students entertained with its sheer excess; this punter just never wants to see it again.",2012
588,Avanti16,I saw what I wanted to see,5,28 November 2009,"We went to the 1st show of the morning and paid $5 each, so it didn't hurt that much. I told my wife that I want to see only the special effects, and they were good. Beyond that, there isn't much to say. I think I liked it more than that War of the World thing, though.Most disaster movies are very predictable. There will a few parallel stories going on in the beginning, with an occasional hint of the impending disaster. Then there will be some powerhouse who won't believe anything as there will a lull for a short time. Then the big thing strikes. Then the story switches to how some loved ones try to push their way through this disaster (with some emotional drama). Then they get separated, but meet again toward the end. They always do. Oh, yes. One more thing. There will be one or two high profile sacrifice, and then the movie ends.The difference in these movies come in terms of how tight the script is, character development, and acting. Unfortunately, this movie falls every which way you look at it. You don't feel sorry for any character, and their deaths - Oh, well - we all will die some day. So many unnecessary characters they have in this movie (the Russians, for example). On top of all that, there isn't much of a reference - historic or otherwise - Mayan or others - to the real thing.Anyway, I went to see the CGI's, and am definitely not disappointed.",2012
589,PapaT_86,Up next on Fox... When CGI Buildings Colapse!,5,16 November 2009,"Remember the episode of The Simpsons many moons ago where Lisa was distraught to see Homer and Bart finding a show called ""When Buildings Collapse"" the absolute height of entertainment? A show which simply consisted of buildings, well, collapsing. Well it seems like they would be the ideal audience for 2012, a film which features a lot of stuff falling apart seemingly randomly and without much greater significance or dramatic weight. Then again, even Homer's attention might start to drift during this one, not only during the many sappy dramatic interludes but also by the time the film gets to the 100th CGI object falling apart, it would probably occur even to him that it's not that exciting because it's just being done with a computer which could conjure up 100 times more interesting images. The appeal of many stunts is knowing, at least subconsciously, that what we are seeing was done ""for real"", even with whatever safety precautions were put in place and whatever touching-up was added in post production. What exactly is the appeal of watching a CGI ship sink in and of itself? Such a scene needs at least a modicum of suspense to work, something Emmerich seems entirely unable to muster. Either that or we need to care about the characters, and with this overstuffed cast of stock figures there's not much chance of that happening with most of them. One or two such scenes might manage to entertain, but 158 minutes stuffed with them palls fairly quickly.Still, I will give 2012 a little credit. It's not as obnoxious as Independence Day (i.e. there's no Will Smith punching an alien), nor as dull and melodramatic as The Day After Tomorrow. There are even a couple of set-pieces in this movie which are genuinely exciting stuff. Not surprisingly these are a) two of the earliest set-pieces and b) with the best developed characters in the film. This shows hints of a better movie. I think a focus on one family's attempts to escape the end of the world (as in Spielberg's unfairly maligned War of the Worlds adaptation, from which this film's paternal theme seems ""inspired"" by) would provide a far stronger and more involving basis for a movie than 2012's attempt to paint a bigger but shallow picture.And what is it with Emmerich and dogs? I'll let Homer have the final words...""My favourite part was when the buildings collapsed!""",2012

This was even more tedious than Independence Day, which was unwatchable rubbish. Take out the special effects and you are left with what ? I'm really struggling to find something good to say about it. Tum-ti-tum-ti-tum - Woody Harrelson was entertaining, but after that you have a disaster- movie-by-numbers, you can easily guess who lives and who will die, and for a disaster movie it really dragged in parts. Knock off a few minutes, kill a few of the main cast - no-one is that lucky and it's about time John Cusack bit the bullet.Bill Hicks would have loved it though, he finally got Arizona Bay.",2012

Even at climax one average audience can not understand where the hero is getting in gears, where are gears? how door open or close. how a piece of wire got in gears. where they used latest technology to build survival ship? This part is very complicated. I also did not understand what is about Tamara who was on the cage of animals? May be I missed or by story this point? I recommended to see ' Matrix( all parts), Resident Evil(all parts) & Terminator(1,2 & 3)rather than 2012.

592,aiga,It's all been done before... and better.,4,10 November 2009,"I was very lucky to get to see this movie before its official airing at a press-release in Riga, Latvia. I was so excited! I had been waiting for this movie since I first heard about its being in production. It has been a while since there was a decent catastrophe-movie. Well, at least not since The Day After Tomorrow (I so loved that one!). So, that was the idea I had bouncing in my head when I trotted down to the theater to see the end of the world in 2012. I got comfortable in my seat as I waited impatiently for the show to start. After all, it is more than two hours long. And finally it started! So, for me this was the peak moment of the movie. From that point on my excitement got deflated. Well, I admit, I might have been over-excited about it. I might have been too caught up in The Day After Tomorrow. It is one of my favorite catastrophe-movies. I was expecting an equally good story. Something new, maybe. I don't know much about making movies - I haven't made one, but I can recognize a good story. That is the key element I am looking for, but didn't find in 2012. In fact, it was a bad reproduction of The Day After Tomorrow. It's greatest problem is the incredibly week storyline. Come on! If you are going to spend millions of dollars on CGI, you might as well come up with a good-enough story to go with that. Something new, maybe This one is so predictable. It does not have a shred of originality and it is filled with clichés, and it is out of balance. I felt like there was the idea of the end of the world, which was not the background situation against which the story took place, but, in fact, the main character itself. I guess, I could say that it was overwhelming. Then there was this whole bunch of other stuff going on which didn't really made me care. It was like Yeah! So? I have seen it before. It was exactly the same. As you might have understood, I was disappointed in it. 2012 had some good actors playing the parts, but the story was all empty and cheesy, and the characters were not developed enough. However, I must admit that the CGI was awesome. If nothing else, you can enjoy that. And if you sit close enough to the screen (like I usually do), you might almost get to experience the feeling that you are witnessing the destruction of the world right there on the spot and get the sensation of general closure. That is the way it might happen. Any way, don't expect any more of it than the special effects – there isn't. In spite of my disappointment, I strongly believe that people differ and so do their tastes in films. No objective opinion is possible. I'm just expressing my own. If you feel that you might like this movie, go right ahead, and see for your self. Then write your own comment.",2012

594,RipTheJacker,2+ hours of over-hyped mediocrity,5,20 February 2010,"Running at over two hours, there is only one exception to a long film: the film has to be GREAT. This film, is not so great, therefore its extensive length also makes it tedious and redundant after the first half. This film is neither good nor bad. It doesn't hold on very long, but it doesn't let go too soon.PRO: Jackson Curtis and his family are highly enjoyable, and the little girl definitely steals the spotlight. The casting choice is pretty decent too, I enjoyed Cusack's performance, and a few of the other cast members shined on the spotlight. Also, the special effects are stunning. The disasters are phenomenal albeit completely done in CG. If you have seen the trailer, then you know how great the film looks with its high-budget effects. Although...CON: ...if you have seen the trailer, you have basically seen the entire film. Again, I can't stress enough at the film's length. What this film does well is disasters, what it doesn't do well is plot, development, dialogue, and a few other minor let-downs that dilute the overall quality of the film. While the effects are great, you can only watch and enjoy it for so long within a 2+ hour film. You notice the film slowly starts to become redundant, and the WOW factor quickly wears out to a point where you simply don't care very much.OVERALL: I think the film had a great thing going. It started off as a highly enjoyable apocalyptic thriller with a great cast, but with its lengthy/redundant premise it slowly drains out the fun factor and leaves you anxiously waiting for the film to end. It's unfortunate that with all this hype, the film turned out to be nothing more than another mediocre Hollywood blockbuster. That is why I gave the film an average score of 5/10.",2012
595,FilmBrit,Loaded with Special Effect for a Disaster Film,8,5 June 2021,"2012 is a disaster film of the 2012 Mayan Prediction event of its time, when everyone was speculating if 2012 would happen. This movie pretty much takes everything said about that event and really places a good movie out, to show how the world will dismantle itself as ""fore told"" a thousand years ago.Like any disaster film, the movie has characters, usually a family who makes their entire last moments worth while, trying to outrun hazards caused by the event itself. This family is usually teamed up by a scientist of some sort and they venture off, to try to find some place to stay safe.Maybe what I should have expected is how the era, this movie was made in, back in 2009, how they at least placed special effects in some scenes, well, they really made so many scenes, loaded with special effects and they are wonderful. What I really didn't expect and in a way, what I did enjoy was how the dark, terrifying scenes, really contrast against the characters in the film, to tell its story and it made it worth while to look at. Maybe it's not some peoples interest by it just adds more to what goes on in the movie.If you really want to feel lost, this movie is for you and it does a great job doing that. Maybe not for everyone in that scene as the movie is almost 3 hours long and sometimes I think the movie slowly gives a predictable resolution to the situation but I suppose I can't complain. It has to end somewhere. This movie really takes away the show of a disaster film.",2012
596,bending_spoons2000,This cheese goes to eleven,3,1 December 2017,"2012 is by all means a classic disaster movie. You've got the fractured family and the step dad (who of course buys the big one at the ends in heroic fashion to make way for the mother-father reunion you knew was coming ca 20 minutes into the film), you've got the ""scientists"" nobody listens to, until it's too late, the nutjob (who is of course not a nutjob) and the typical suits from the government who look after themselves before everyone else and get a lesson in humanity. Oh and there's a dog, there is always a dog and the dog always manages to make it out alive after some perilous journey to safety when everyone else around it dies.The CGI is good (hence the three stars). The acting is well...OK, the plot...njaaa it's a disaster movie and things blow up, get flooded and melt away. The film would have been endurable if it was at least an hour shorter. I really could have done without all the ""drama"" on the ""arks"" and the mind-numbingly bad cheese that followed aboard them. Thank god for the fast forward button.Probably the best way to sum up this film is the line at the end of it where the little girl (who had been wetting the bed and wore ""pullups"" exclaims that she no longer needs them because she feels safe. Give me a break...seriously? This cheese goes to eleven!I should add that I like a bad disaster movie (guilty pleasure...what can I say?) But this one wasn't even bad funny, you know when you can laugh at the lunacy...Atomic Twister springs to mind. 2012 is so bad that I had actually seen it once before and mercifully forgotten about it until of course the sense of deja vu I was experiencing when watching it gave way to remembrance of stupid plot details I was reluctant to experience again.If a cheese fest is what you are after I suggest Flood: a River's rampage.

How about the fear and chaos of the world ending...NONE shown by the general U.S. population or even world population for that matter.All we saw, is squabbling by government commanders, little kids worried more about where their divorced father is constantly and some little mutt doing a high wire act to be re-united with it's owner.This movie had no suspense in it at all..it was just drama about how the main characters can survive 2012...nevermind the 300 million others that live in the USA and what they were doing to prep for the world's end.As for the actual disaster scenes..too short, not enough end-of-the-world destruction scenes. Each scene would begin and then cut out to what the main characters were doing instead...arguing, squabbling, doing unrealistic scenes and talking to each other about non-essential things, except what was occurring around them...the world ending, the earthquakes, the tsunamis..I mean WHO THE HECK cares about some stupid divorce??? in the middle of ""supposedly"" end of the world chaos?

The normal things happen, like big disasters and stuff, but there is a lot more. This movie is really long so a lot of stuff happens. I was never bored with the movie, because they always keep having different things happen. So yeah I was entertained throughout, but that doesn't really justify the insane length for the movie. If you go in with the right mindset, and alot of time, you can definitely enjoy yourself, but if you're not in the right mood, this movie will probably feel like a long waste of time",2012
605,dannyjcarr,"Stop being overly critical, its a good family movie !",7,16 November 2009,"Fair enough, the storyline and acting in this film are substandard, but after watching it I am positive it was not made for us to watch and walk away and to think Danny Glover made a great president !, John Cusack is a great action hero ! Both in my opinion were terrible but as others have mentioned, if you switch your brain off and watch the action, you will be blown away ! Yes it is far fetched, there is not a chance anyone would survive, I am sure when Mr Cusack fell into the crack in the Earth above the lava(before pulling himself back out to catch a plane once again), he would have melted ! The car would never have made it out of the first street in LA with all the devastation around it, they would all have died in the real world ! END OF MOVIE, is that what you would have all wanted, a disaster movie over in 25 minutes ?!? lol I do agree some scenes were not needed, Danny Glover being the patriotic President, not wanting to abandon a sinking ship etc. etc., that could have been cut from the movie, who would have given a toss, everyone was gonna be killed, who would have remembered how brave he was ? The president would have been the first on the plane !My main gripe with this film was at the end, why were they so worried about the Ark they were in crashing into Everest, it had just about been bashed into every other mountain in the area with no concern or damage caused, so what made Everest so scary, ""We need to get the engines going, otherwise we are going to hit Everest in 1500 metres!"", my calculations were it took about 10 minutes from then before they started to hit so they were travelling at 5.62 miles per hour, hardly back breaking speed to cause concern, after all they must have used some sort of alien material to build the crafts after the hammering it took on the other mountains. Also the shock on their faces when they see Air Force one approaching the bridge of the ship, why would they be so worried, surely the glass had been built to withstand impacts like that, what did they expect, debris free tsunami's ?!?!?!?Other than the other stupid near misses and the pointless love story, i.e. he kind of wants his ex wife and family back, but she is madly in love with new partner, kids think the new partner is great and love him like their own dad ........... ""Anyone seen Gordy, my new partner ??"" ""He died love, crushed and mangled in a giant cog, very very painful though fast death, thats why the doors did not shut, you nearly drowned and we nearly crashed into Everest"", ""oh OK"", She then throws herself into the arms of her ex who has saved the day by releasing the giant cog ! (not exactly what is said but its what should have been said.All is all, I am contradicting my summary and am also being overly critical, its going to win as many Oscars as my writing wins booker prizes, but it is a good family action movie. Kids won't read too much into the acting and storyline, they will watch an enjoyable fun film and watch in awe. Get a extra large popcorn and enjoy, its worth watching on the big screen I would say, you won't get the same effects on a TV, so there would be no point in watching it at all !",2012

When Cusack leaps on the plane he yelps, ""We are going to need a bigger boat...er...plane."" And so continues the badly misplaced, plagiarized lines/scenes/actions/ideas from the truly great films. It would be a fun film exercise to name every great movie that this disaster of a film has copied and botched. If you manage to survive this disaster film, I highly recommend that you decompress and restore your film sanity by watching a Hitchcock or Spielberg Film.",2012
607,escapeN2flixtion,Truly Spectacular in Scale - and Disappointment,4,5 October 2019,"If you spent any time online in the late 2010s, you doubtless caught wind of the great 2012 apocalypse scare, when thousands of people became convinced the world would end in December of 2012. I suppose it was inevitable that somebody would try to make a movie about the phenomenon. Roland Emmerich took a shot in 2009 with the silly, disappointing, and ultimately pretty forgettable disaster film aptly (and not-very-creatively) titled ""2012.""The first issue with the film is that it makes no use of the 2012 story itself. The entire doomsday theory was inspired by the Mayan calendar, which ran out in 2012. You might think the calendar would play into the movie somehow? At least, you'd think that the Mayans would be involved in some way? But aside from one or two random mentions, the Mayans and their calendar have nothing to do with the story at all. The doomsday scenario in the film is triggered by an increase in the Sun's neutrino emissions, which somehow destabilizes the Earth's crust, causing unprecedentedly vast earthquakes that swallow cities whole. The tagline for the movie reads ""We were warned,"" but that tagline doesn't make sense in context: who warned us of this event, exactly? Instead of capitalizing on the mythology behind the 2012 scare, Roland Emmerich just made a generic natural disaster extravaganza in the vein of ""The Day After Tomorrow."" What wasted potential.Still, Roland Emmerich is no stranger to disaster extravaganzas, and I've enjoyed many of his past efforts because, in the end, it can be fun to turn your brain off and thrill at watching stuff blow up. And that's what films like these should be: FUN. Sadly, though, 2012's not much fun either. As odd as this sounds, there IS an art to making a mindless action spectacle like Independence Day work, and 2012 screws up several fundamental details.See, while the appeal of films like Independence Day is mainly the action (because that's the fun part), character actually DOES play a role. If you've seen any Roland Emmerich film, you know his characters aren't deep. But they don't need to be: what they DO need to be is charismatic. Steven Hiller in ID4 is the perfect example: a charming, all-American go-getter, a proper action star who fights the aliens with bravado, played by Will Smith at the height of his career. The characters in 2012 can't hope to compare. John Cusack plays the same divorced father character you've seen in countless films: estranged from his wife, down on his luck, spending a day with his two kids who both openly dislike him and would rather be with Mom. The set-up is tired, but the film plays it more or less straight. Stock drama between bitter divorcees and their bratty kids doesn't get me in the mood to see cities blow up. In fact, these characters are pretty unlikable; they get me in the mood to see THEM blow up. A film like ID4 would have anticipated that and used these characters as alien fodder. But in 2012, this dysfunctional wreck of a family is what I'm meant to care about. Not good.With 2012, Emmerich is clearly hellbent on making the destruction bigger than in any film he made before it. But bigger does not equal better. For sure, the scenes of destruction in 2012 outdo movies like Independence Day in scale, but not impact. Take the collapse of Los Angeles, for instance: as our ""heroes"" evacuate the city, despite the cataclysmic upheaval all around them, they themselves never seem to be in danger. The land around their car, or the air around their plane, is strangely free of damage or debris; the catastrophe seems to always be just behind them, not quite able to touch them. The destruction of LA is so over-the-top, with so much debris all over the screen, that it causes sensory overload: you simply can't take it all in at once, separating you from the action. Later scenes like the eruption of Yellowstone and the Washington tsunami have the same problem. Contrast this with the alien attack on New York in ID4, which was pretty straightforward: a giant fire wall of death, slowly spreading through town. If you're caught in its path, you're dead. It was easier to follow. Less can certainly be more.2012 occasionally takes a break from the destruction to add some moral drama into the mix. But action spectacles, by design, cannot do this convincingly. ID4 made this mistake in its second act, with President Whitmore discussing whether it was right to use nukes against the invaders. Why is this action movie trying to have a serious discussion about nuclear ethics? Get outta here. 2012 invokes a similar dilemma, as world leaders meet to discuss whether or not they should just let whole cities perish for the ""greater good."" Make no mistake, moral dilemmas like these are poignant and can make great drama, but 2012 was not sold as a drama. Serious talk like this harms a mindless actioner because it invites the audience to engage the plot intellectually - in other words, turn your brain back ON - and once you do that, the plot falls apart.Basically, Emmerich's action films are at their best when they focus on the action, with charismatic, fun characters to guide you through it. 2012 is too bogged down with unlikable characters and misplaced drama to shine as the action spectacle that it's really trying to be. Mr. Emmerich, in the future, when you market your film as a silly actioner, just give me a silly actioner. It's what was advertised, and it's what I paid for.",2012
608,Nomissimon10,CGI Testing,3,21 June 2021,"This movie comes off as a test of technologies to see how far you can go with CGI. They tried, and I think it's more than documented that it's an absolute disaster. No pun intended. The movie contains a lot of bad scenes and decisions from the characters that make you cringe. The special effects are used to the point where they completely dropped the talent of acting, story, and believability.",2012
609,nicrok,"Entertaining, brainless ride",7,12 November 2009,"I must admit that I've had my brain at home while watching this in the theater, just like it's supposed to be. Instead, I enjoyed a ton of popcorn and coke. Well, I left the theater with mixed feelings, though strangely satisfied by all the mayhem.Viewers will be greatly satisfied with the splendid first two thirds of the movie: the earthquake in California, the volcano, and the quite suspenseful escapes by plane - which are all excellently executed - will deliver perfect entertainment. John Cusack also does quite okay, along with all the other minor characters. You will stare at the screen, whispering 'What the f**k', praising the top notch CGI, attempting to process this gigantic scheme of destruction and mayhem... briefly, the first two thirds of '2012' plainly ROCK. You will love yourself for having decided to watch this!Yet then... the last third will annoy you, even offend you to a certain extent. You will actually hope that 'The end is nigh'.The reasons for this are mainly plot holes concerning the mounting of the arches, cliché-ridden drowning scenes, the lack of real suspense, and idiotic decisions by those in fictional charge. It fails to convince. Also, an Emmerich movie HAS to offer the typical dramatic and pompous speeches by those who have been blessed by an epiphany of the true meaning life (the mutinying scientist, for instance, who would nobly sacrifice himself and all else to save the lives of those left on earth). These moments are too cheesy, implausible, too melodramatic and don't really contribute to the whole enterprise. Oddly, they seem to be obligatory to Emmerich's film-making.Gladly, the first two thirds will offer enough entertainment and satisfaction to ignore the ending. It's worth your money.",2012
610,ymghali,"great visuals, cliché content",8,13 November 2009,"For its genre as a disaster movie, 2012 delivers what it promises: excitement, great visual effects (though over-stated as ""digital"") and suspense. However, it lacks the creativity and novelty expected in the 21st century. Unfortunately, the one thing that I wished for not to be present in a ""global"" disaster movie, was very much there indeed: the clichés about the different people that make up the population of our planet. For a film that takes glimpses of nations and people across the Globe, it failed to provide real ""human"" knowledge about the characteristics of different communities on the planet. Stereo-typed Indians, Russian ""nouveau riche"", rich Arabs, religious Italians, authoritarian corrupt Chinese, simple Tibetan monks and of course, the American Super Hero, make the main characters. The plot is weak as these is no elaboration on the predictions and scientific causes of the disaster other than the naive statement that the Earth is becoming a ""microwave"" because of the alignment of the planets. The symbolism of Noah's Arch and having a child-character by this name had a bad influence on the suspense element. In defense for the movie, one can say that great efforts were done to produce convincing visual effects and that it makes a good entertainment film. Perhaps I aspired for a more enriching experience that would relate to human intelligence. I was wrong. I advise those who haven't seen it yet to do so but not to expect more than ""good"" and ""decent"" entertainment.",2012

It starts with the idea that neutrinos from the Sun, which do not interact with ordinary matter, have ""mutated"" (as if elementary particles have DNA), and are heating the Earth's core like a microwave oven. That alone would leave any physicist in hysterics. This heating causes massive earthquakes that generate massive tsunamis that ultimately drown the entire Earth, including the Himalayas (but not Africa, which somehow floats to the surface unscathed). The oceans end up about twice as deep as they started. Where did all the extra water come from?

Even though the story that the movie presents is based on a possibility, and as a genre the movie is fiction, the entire drama presented makes sense. What went wrong that makes me cautious for not giving it more credits is because the hero of this story, or I have to say the heroes of this story are lost a bit too much in the tragedy, but who wouldn't be in a world disaster, and that is why the movie rely a lot on special effects, which sometimes it's not enough to save the day.",2012
616,raven8000-794-597613,Catastrophe on screen and behind the camera!!!,7,17 July 2010,"It's been a while since a decent ""end of the world"" movie and this was a breath of fresh air to the back of our seats. From start to finish you are on the edge, waiting to see what gets destroyed next and how the characters are possibly going to survive.There is everything you would expect: Great visuals fast paced action, world destruction and nail biting suspense. These make the film what it is and bring its success; which will keep all viewers happy and put bums in seats. However there are some very big holes created which aren't results of the end of the world but the making of the event.The calibre of actors is a bit flat, a couple well known people but none who have the big Hollywood status right now and so lack star quality. Bigger names would have drawn bigger audiences however I suppose putting in top action stars would have eliminated the peril as you would expect them to succeed. With these actors you are constantly wondering.However the big problem is in the story telling is there is none of it. The 2012 doomsday theory is a preconceived idea so the film makers already had that in place. They simply destroyed anything that hasn't already been blown up. And the rest of the story surrounds the relationships between the characters, which we have seen a thousand times. This film lacks originality and you constantly feel like you've seen it before. Everything has been put into blowing s**t up and the visual effects. The other factors to the film have been put on the back burner with little or no effort to address.While this film won't win any Oscars for its story telling or acting it will get endless honours for its colossal creation and groundbreaking effects. There is enough going on to keep everyone occupied and the majority of people will simply pass over the lack of story.The only way I can rate this is to say it is not as good as Independence Day, but better than Day After Tomorrow. A great action packed movie which delivers again and again and so succeeds at its goal; creating a movie spectacle worthy of destroying the world.Overall Summary: Bit hit on screen with dramatic action and effects.

It's a cheesy story that you've seen before. There are cheesy death scenes where after somebody dies they look at the sky and yell ""MENDOZAAAAAA!!!!!"". Yes, it is that bad. This movie is so bad that even rednecks think this is way over the top. If Liberace were alive, he would say ""This is the gayest thing I've ever seen... and my house is covered in mirrors!"".

Actually, the Bible is a lot better. The CGI here is OK, direction is marginal, music is weak. Be sure to avoid the music at the end, it is just trash. How they ever decided to include that song is way beyond me. The movie's dramatic moments are predictable and weak. Some actions by characters are just stupid. There are massive plot holes; why, for instance, would rich people be able to buy a seat in the ark when money will be useless? Why did people stay behind for no apparent reason?

What I'm really expecting 4 this movie is only on the CGI, & Special Effects thing, nothing more & all of them came up pretty awesome...From my point of view, 2012 thing it's just a plain a stupid prediction from stupid people but many people believe it though... My question is why did they believe in unpredicted human history instead believing in God? Back to the movie, although it's pretty resembles to ID at least it's better than ID a bit... It had a really touching scene, decent CGI angle, & a perfectly well made design of sub-marine ship but the glitch is lack of humor... The character of this movie also resembles to ID where there's 2 protagonist IMO Adrian(black) & Jackson(white), but ID got 3 IMO(the president, pilot, & computer expert)... But 2012 also got president but as supporting character, when I presuming before watching I thought he also a leading character... But it doesn't make any sense why he would die... Why staff & any others didn't by him? He's a president, right?

Both directors are terrible screenwriters or both came from the same grade school of ""Saccharin and Cloying Nonsense."" Someone needs to tie these guys up the second they decide to put pen to paper.

This movie does not pretend either.I get the feeling that everyone is throwing tomatoes at this because, in the light of the global crisis we are all experiencing, people expected depth and perhaps to shed a tear. I was expecting something as bad, if not worse than ""Transformers 2"". But after the first 10 minutes, the film told me what I was going to get, pure unadulterated non stop action, and nothing else.So, as an action movie, it is one of the best I've seen, and is better as an action movie than ""Men In Tights"" is as a spoof. It is a very real example of how to utilise current technological and theatrical advances without showing off, as in ""Transformers 2"" or ""Bad Boys 2"".This film can be described as a continuous cliffhanger spectacle with a sprinkle of characters for seasoning. And anyone with skills of perception should be able to switch their mindset in the first ten or fifteen minutes.A true Blockbuster.",2012
623,Asmith580,2012 – An adult idea turned into a family movie doesn't work.,2,3 December 2009,".....Let's jump into the thick of it then. This movie was terrible. If you're going to make a movie about the end of the world, don't try and make it for families to go see. A movie like this should have blood, gore, trauma, real human emotion, painful sacrifice, love, loss, triumph, hope, and reflection of doing the right thing. You can tell that this movie attempted such things, but they went about it all wrong. All we get once again is action packed thrill ride scenes with absolutely no real and tangible emotion. I had the same problem with the new Indiana Jones. If there is no chemistry between your characters and the audience, then you have failed as a writer and as a movie maker. Thus this movie was an utter failure in my eyes. There is so much wrong with this movie, it isn't even funny. From the little things like knowing for a fact (being an ex-jet engine mechanic for the US Navy) that an engine would immediately stall if any amount of ash got inside and all your electronics would stop working if a volcano went off near you, to the big things like the directors attempt to make us care for all the evil billionaires who got to survive, but forget that the common man got screwed like usual. ***Spoiler Alert*** The ending of this movie was downright stupid. You expect me to believe the main characters got to the main land with a bunch of rich billionaire jerks and the people who let everyone die and live happily ever after. I don't think so, the writers of this movie obviously either thought about these things and didn't care, or were just a bunch of morons who didn't think about it. (I guess they could have just been lazy) This ending sums up the movie well with poorly thought out scenarios with a terrible story line masked by CGI effects all to make a crappy film for one reason only . . . to make money. I would love to remake this movie and rate it R, so I could capture what it would really be like if the world ended in 2012. So in short, if you're a mindless drone who doesn't care about cinema, plot development, or the character's on-screen chemistry; then go to this movie and enjoy, but if you are looking for more than overblown GGI effects and the mindless plot lines that we have come to expect from Hollywood these days, then by all means, go and see a good movie and scratch this one off your list.",2012

There was too much talking in some scenes where there should've been more action. The acting wasn't bad either. A lot of people seem to think that the actor's weren't really trying. I didn't notice that, I felt they did an okay job at least.Overall, if you really think about this movie it makes you think. How would humanity handle the end of the world. Honestly, I think if we knew the end of the world was near, something very similar to what happened in the movie would happen in real life. Questions pertaining morality, the government, our relationships with everyone around us would really be put to the test. The film had me almost crying in some places.Overall, not a bad film.

Regardless of your views on the subject, pls go and see this in the theaters, the effects alone are worth it.This movie is essentially a sequel to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" although it is not intended to be one, and from that point of view, given the fact that (almost) all sequels suck, this is brilliantly entertaining.One main draw for me to go the the theaters is movies that have special effects and ""things blowing up"". This movie was a true visual treat. This is the primary reason why this movie gets a 4.5 stars despite its unbelievable plot, real bad characterization and okey dokey acting. I didn't let my brain get in the way and I simply sat back and enjoyed.Plot. This is where you check out your brain. You gotta have some crazy plot to bring about a doomsday, so you should just accept that and move on. Lets face it, something like a homicide or a cancer patient story will not really bring about global tidal waves, they can only be caused, apparently, by earth crust displacement.Speaking of characterization, Roland, I gotta tell you man, you did a bad job here. Just pull out your older movies and look at the strong characterizations your movies have displayed despite being sci-fi oriented. Case and point - Independence day, characters played by Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum even the non primary characters like the drunk farmer who gave up his life, the other stripper, presidents wife etc were very memorable characters. None of the characters of 2012 really moved me, I think I might already have forgotten most of them.I understand that one does not go to these movies to be vowed by some great acting, its just not that genre. But even with that expectation, the acting disappointed me. Everybody sucked, except Woody Harrelson, he was good. Initially I thought it was just bad acting all across the board (except woody), but then I realized that it was the lack of characterization that did not really give the actors a chance to showcase any kind of acting prowess. Roland, you got hit with two stones because of one bird.Roland, buddy, how come none of your primary characters, in all of your movies, have parents, while every body else in the movie does? Just wondering.Fact Check >> Arnold wont be the governor in 2012, his second (and final) term completes in Jan 2011.(For the folks who don't know, Roland is the writer, director and producer of the movie) ______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Characterization - a lot more of it even at the expense of cutting down some pace scenes and effects * Chiwetel Ejiofor's speech at the end of the movie was not really moving, I would strengthen that. * Bring around Oliver Pratt's character towards the end. Something to the tune of, when they bang into the big mountain (I wont say which one) towards the end of the movie, they see mountaineers up top. After their engine starts up Oliver, having had a change of heart, turns the ship around to rescue the mountaineers. * Seems to me like the only people who wont be affected by all this water would be astronauts in the International Space Station. Would be nice to bring in that angle - what happens to them. * Remove the haggling part for ticketing. If the world s going to end why would I haggle for the ticket price, as long as I can pay. * No back story on why John's son hates him and then no real reason why he comes around. * I would add a side story on prisoners (hate to imagine that they would all drown like caged animals). * I would add a side story on immobile hospital patients and their families. * I would add side story about human ingenuity and about necessity of being inventive in times like these, for survival. * Show that some military submarines have also survived, some of them perched up on mount Mc Kinley or Mt Whitney, would make a great visual with some biblical similarities. * Declare that all remaining survivors are equal, be it a sheik or a humble bartender on the ark and there is one single nation post calamity.This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2009/11/2012.html",2012
628,il-vampiro-is,The Day after the War of the Worlds,3,20 December 2010,"First time I heard about this movie, I was told that I should rather not try to see that movie and let it go of R. Emmerich who was no longer the genius who had created Stargate back in 1994 but the wealthy director who directed a string of low-rated post-apocalyptic movies in a row in the 2000s. 2012 is a good movie if you only watch the FXs but some characters constantly find themselves in impossible situations and they always manage to make it out ! (they survive earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, etc.); now the question is : how can you buy this ? This no longer has to do with science-fiction, this is watching without reasoning : you are going to see people die in various ways and a few survive (you already know whom as early as the movie starts.) Added to this, actors actually overplay by moments and the scenario is probably not too developed to be existent as well as credible - unless the characters are perpetual lucky strikers. Yet, if I had to find one aspect of that movie which would be a positive one, let us mention that there are a few comic scenes which effectively made me laugh like hell(even scenes which are not supposed to be comic ones, which suggests that the film turns burlesque by moments.) They had the money, they say, I'm sorry to inform you that, graphically and technically, the film is beautiful and well-done but it does not save the whole thing, mind you! ''2012'' is like all these cliché-striken movies in the 2000s, the staff only forgot to write the script, I mean, THE formidable and innovative script, the one that makes you dream/fear/impatient and ... reflect. In fact, I had the impression all along the movie to watch something between The Day after Tomorrow (dystopia due to nature rebelling) and War of the Worlds (2005 overplayed version with the father, divorced from the mother, with two kids - a boy, and a girl; who are simply useless as far as the story is concerned) and this is probably the reason why I disliked it so much. The title is good if you omit the Mayan prophecy that usually goes along with the year 2012. But, do not prepare for the prophecy to be explained if you have not seen the movie yet ! This production reveals a terrible ''scenario vacuum''; even the presence of Danny Glover (Predator 2, which I liked much more than ... that) would not make me change my mind, unfortunately. But I laughed. So, what d'you say ?",2012
629,wolveren,Awesome for Effects,10,20 October 2013,"My review for 2012 is very much overdue. I didn't review it earlier because to me it was perfect. Firstly, I had no problem with the movie as I am a number one fan of Roland Emmerich. I went to watch this for all the awesome effects even if some of them were a bit unrealistic as some would say. But hey, this is one of the best disaster movies of our time if you don't mind some funny bits. I gave this movie a 10 for all the blow it up stuff I always wanted. The story is your basic look at our hero of the day who just happens to be a frustrated divorced writer and drives a limousine for rich people. Not much of a story really although it tries to stick with it even after all the running around and getting on something in the nick of time. I know most of it was ridiculous, but I ain't stupid I just enjoyed it for what it was. An earthquake of that magnitude in this movie? You couldn't run, walk or even drive around like John Cusack did, and he wasn't even a professional race car driver. And I know from personal experience with earthquakes with lesser magnitude. But like I said, I came for the destruction and I got what I wanted and I hope Emmerich keeps doing movies like this forever. Blow up and destroy more stuff for us Roland!!!",2012
630,RHewison,Enjoyable but not thrilling,6,2 December 2011,"I love the disaster movies. I love the thrill and excitement of not knowing whether your heroes will survive and wondering what I would do if the end of the world suddenly came upon us. With Deep Impact and the Day after tomorrow firmly in my top 10 films, I had high hopes that 2012 would be just as good, if not better than these incredible films with its use of the latest advances in cinematography. However a great disaster movie it was not meant to be, as a general film straying into science fiction it was enjoyable but not thrilling.I think my main issue with the film was that normally there is a hero or a few heroes, who you are rooting for all the way through to survive. 2012 bills John Cusack as the hero of the hour, who realises just how important his family is to him. However although I adore Cusack normally, my heart just wasn't in it and while I want him to survive, it doesn't ultimately make a difference to me either way. The film also was jam-packed with action, probably too much so, nudging on the edge of believability, with cities crumbling within the first half an hour and whilst it was very dramatic, it feels that it's been drawn out and it's not until the last 45 minutes that you truly got into and felt your heart start to race.My other issue with the film was the way in which some characters were portrayed. Adrian Helmsely was presented as a hero who argued back to his boss, who said that it wasn't right what they were doing and demanded that more people should allowed to be saved. As a scientific adviser he seemed rather inept with ""temperatures are rising with incredible velocity"" just one of the many unscientific phrases tumbling from his humanitarian lips. Carl Anheuser was shown as the bad guy, the one who tried to control who would be saved. This is all very well and good, but if this were to happen then I would argue that Anheuser is actually the one in the right. Human life needs to be preserved and to do so does mean some sacrifices.Despite the incredibly dire nature of several aspects of the film I found myself actually rather liking it and am a tentative fan of the film. It does require a suspension of reality on the viewers part (but surely that's what films are for) and it does turn into an enjoyable film with a twisting plot that whilst it doesn't leave you aching for more does mean that the film seems to fly by as though you are strapped into a roller-coaster instead of sat on your sofa. The special effects used are brilliant and the actual plot line and ideas put into it are fantastic. The actors play their parts superbly, particularly Woody Harrelson and it is an enjoyable movie.",2012
631,vmxgroove,Complete piece of crap...,1,13 February 2013,"This was probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. Everyone associated with the final product should be embarrassed by what they created. The actors should be ashamed to lend their names to this project. If the world ever does come to an end, we should make sure that this film is destroyed with it. The acting is OK but the story is awful and completely weak. The characters seem to navigate through special EFX that are so silly and unrealistic. I actually laughed at how it continued to unfold. After a while, it played more like a comedy then a drama. This movie is a well polished turd that only a complete moron would enjoy. No doubt that it should have been an Alan Smithy production.",2012
632,emick23,Horrible and I've seen it all before,3,27 November 2010,"I've grown really tired watching movies with implausible plots such as this; world tragedy, quick-paced solutions, and impossible scenarios of survival. I saw this on ""On Demand"" and I question why I made such a decision. The acting sucks - typical of a Roland Emmerich movie - with wooden performances and no emotion felt for any of the characters; I did not connect with any of the multitude of characters you're supposed to feel sorry for (too many to count). The technology used in ""2012"" on the ark is typical of the quick ""we-need-to-fill-in-the-impossible-holes-to-fill"" with impossible digital video tracking systems. Much like Enemy of the State, there are cameras everywhere (really? In the rear gate closing gear mechanisms?) and they have facial identifying technology so it makes it easier for the ""officials"" to locate the people they need at those pivotal times when they need to. Sadly, I fell asleep. I seem to have that problem with movies of this type where it takes forever to lead up to some kind of story. From what I've seen, however, just watch ""Day after Tomorrow"" with Dennis Quaid (end-of-the-world apocalyptic events), ""Godzilla"" with Matthew Broderick (end-of-New-York-City apocalyptic events) and snippets of ""Independence Day"" with ""Bill Pullman"" (just parts of the apocalyptic events) and you've seen ""2012."" The only thing missing from this turd of a movie is Jabba the Hutt's talk with Han Solo in the ark. Emmerich said this would be his last apocalyptic movie... just in time.",2012
633,boonhanlau,A Great Movie,8,26 May 2013,"I seriously don't know what the others had expected to see from this movie. This movie has good plot, good acting, good effects and also moral values I suppose.Although some of the scenes do not make sense, so what? As long as you enjoy it, it's a good movie, IMO.This movie keeps me interested from the beginning to the end. It's satisfactory.It's a good movie to watch it with your fellows and family. I gave it an 8 out of 10.I highly recommend it.",2012
634,dirikan,Good To Inspire People To Do Something,6,23 November 2009,"Many people around me went to the cinema to watch this movie thus I heard different tunes from this people. Some didn't like it at all, some say I loved it. For me, it's a masterpiece to show everyone what kind of an end is awaiting us, even tough it's a bit (more than a bit probably) exaggerated. Then why did I give 6 out of 10 ? Here we go..First of all, the movie was toooo long. You had to sit about 2,5 hours to watch the movie. If I were at home and watching it on BlueRay, I'ld probably give 3 breaks. That's one big minus for my sake.Also, regarding the music, I didn't hear too much. Did you ? You might say ""why on earth are you complaining for not hearing music?"" but for my sake,music is a must in a movie. And I believe there are excellent scenes for musics. That's also another minus.The relationship between father and son.. That's a bit strange. I didn't really like it.After all, this is a disaster movie and it shows all of us how bad things can be if we still keep on devastating the world. From what I learned so far in my life, there is no joke you can make to nature! Eventually nature takes the revenge and it usually happens with a very bad ending.I don't know if you noticed but, there are only a group of people survived after the disaster. So we're all dead! Ready yourself or do something to avoid it happening. One man can't save the world, but if there are hundreds of millions of these ""one man""s all around the world, something can be done. It's time to act.",2012

636,Davebop,"Special Effects good, everything else ridiculous",6,29 November 2009,"This is an archetypal disaster movie that closely mimics the directors previous efforts (Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow) in many plot aspects. There is very little in this movie that comes as a surprise, except perhaps for the number of times certain characters survive ridiculous situations.That being said, if you don;t take it too seriously (which is a pre-requisite anyway for most disaster movies) this is an enjoyable effort, if a bit over long. Some of the special effects are superb and fully enhanced by the cinematic experience,I can imagine it would be a good choice to watch at an Imax. The acting is in general pretty good, an area a lot of these films can fall down on, with John Cusack his usual brilliant self in the main role and he his ably supported by the rest. I especially liked the appearance of Lance Henriksen (Bishop from the Alien films, a legend in my mind).If you want a fun and exciting film this definitely delivers, if you want something original or thought provoking this is not for you",2012
637,StrontiumAE,'2012' is so last Century.,6,16 February 2010,"If you take every disaster movie from the past twenty years and role them into one film, what would you get? 2012. Roland Emmirich's latest apocalyptic offering is fueled with as much references to previous disaster epics as it does with fire and brimstone – and there is a lot of fire and brimstone. Taking direct cues from his recent offering The Day After Tomorrow and last century's Independence Day, 2012 is a literal tour de force of exploding cities, country engulfing tidal waves and mass death on a biblical scale. The story is mind numbingly simple: The world's governments learn of an extinction level event due to take place in the very near future and its up to an ensemble group of characters (which for a Hollywood movie are uncharacteristically mostly African American) to find their way to safety and lead mankind to its new epoch. Emmirich seems to take pleasure in milking the world's pre and post millennial fears of the end of civilization by constantly dishing out end of the world scenarios that can give even the most optimistic amongst us nightmares. And why does he make these films? Because we as the audience will continuously lap them up. In the run up to the year 2000, popular media thrived of the world's Millennial anxiety with a series of films and TV shows based on the destruction of mankind. Then it was the X Files, Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Matrix and even the 'factual' Y2K scare. If it was not for the September 11 attacks in 2001, in all likelihood the Western World's preoccupation with the extinction of the human race would have itself, died out. However in the last decade we have had the Dawn of the Dead remake, 28 Days Later, Terminator 3, The Mist, War of the Worlds and Knowing, all echoing the social fears that came to light on that day. Those fears can be summarized under the mantra that we will all meet our Maker one day; the question is how we will meet Him? At the core of these films including 2012, is not the many spectacular ways we can all die, but of how we choose to survive and move on, even after society itself has ended. And that's what gives this genre a little gravitas. Although 2012 is nothing more than a paint by numbers CGI filled disaster epic, there are lessons of humanity that can be learned from this and other similar films. That lesson is that the real threat to the end of humanity does not come from aliens, viruses, self aware computers or even Mother Nature herself, but it comes from other humans and how we treat each other when faced with a world ending crisis. However, is it necessary to go into to this movie understanding the philosophical issues it raises? No. 2012 is equally enjoyable as CGI porn and nothing more. Turning your brain off and resigning yourself to being simply awed by the sublime images of Mother Nature reaping her destructive revenge on mankind, is enough to enjoy this film. 7/10.",2012

639,rid-diego,Emmerich takes disaster movies into a next level,8,18 December 2009,"I saw 2012 last night on a special screening by my college and I have to admit, my expectations were not too high... I mean, Roland Emmerich directed Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla (funny films to watch, BTW). And when I heard he was directing a 2012 film I was not surprised. I thought he would take the Mayan prophecy as a main part of the plot and that's it, that's why I didn't understood the amount of characters. But, when the movie begins, they (Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser) offer a scientific explanation (if not realistic or plausible, at least sound better than it will happen just because the Mayans said so) of everything that starts this year and projects to the future. It looks that they wanted that year 2012 was just a mere coincidence. And it works well. Destruction scenes (earthquakes, eruptions and tsunamis) are just amazing. Full of clichés... but they work, at least for me... and the rest of the attendants. But something is necessary to stand out: this films shows the harsh reality of this world, that is (major spoilers ahead) 1. just rich people are allowed to live, no matter if you are smart or hardworking (or helped someone else to survive), if you are not rich, you're dead, and 2. people in panic are even more dangerous than an enormous tsunami. Emmerich takes disaster movies into a next level by making, not only the best destruction scenes in (maybe) movies history, but he (major spoilers ahead) is really filming the end of the world as we known (that obviously includes millions of casualties). Very worth watching film. If you can catch it on a theater, even better.",2012
640,StormsEdgeProductions,"Plausible, fun and clever",9,22 September 2010,"2012Most of us are already acquainted with the theory of our planet going POP in the Winter Solstice of 2012, and for those of us who aren't, this film will certainly let you know. I was looking very forward to this film, and had doubts that it would be as bad as some critics said. I was right. Which is a first. To truly admire this film as much as I have, you have to take away the layers and layers of exciting and beautifully orchestrated sequences of destruction, and look deep into the message that it leaves. But even if you can't be bothered to scan all 158 minutes of it in depth, it still makes a great popcorn film to watch at midnight if you want to be entertained. After showing this film to numerous amounts of people who thought it would be bad, they ended up enjoying it. I personally am a big fan of Roland Emmerich films because of how charismatic and imaginative he is. And that's just what you get in the film too. Unlike its predecessor, 2012 doomsday, this film has a backed-up plot and naturally explains what is going on. It's so easy when making a film like this to get carried away with blowing things up that you completely forget to explain to the audience what is going on, and Roland has been careful to avoid writing a pointless film. It begins by explaining what could happen, and why. And Roland actually bothered to do his research too! The dates and disasters in the film are consistent with those in the prophecies, and I don't just mean the end-of-the-world date! From the word go I knew it would be good, and it just kept getting better. Everything in this film actually happens for a reason, and it all flows well leading from one even into the next without losing continuity of having unrealistic timing. And the best thing about this film is it actually shows emotion and true Human aspects. We see order turn to chaos, greed, and self-centred behaviour. We see those who think it's all a conspiracy and those who want to help others. Essentially, we see the breakdown in Humanity. This film contains scarily accurate Human nature. Then we have the Governments, who are collaborating to build and ark (there are references to Noah's Ark in this, as the main character's son is called Noah), but want to keep the evidence of the end-of-the-world secret from the public as to not create chaos, and trying to silence those who are trying to make it public. In fact, the way the Government and everyone acts in this is extremely plausible and realistic. The acting was also brilliant, with some very good supporting cast to add depth. Liam James played Noah Curtis amazingly with a great range of facial expressions, as he does in all other projects he works on. Amanda Peet (who I've been told makes very nice Maple Syrup pancakes) also does very well. We are provided with a wide range of different characters.The thing I most enjoyed about this film is the suspense. The film doesn't follow trends, making it more exciting and original. I was on the edge of my seat watching this, enjoying all of the fun and action packed sequences. The only thing that could be criticised is the amount of lucky escapes, but this doesn't matter as it's still a well-crafted and enjoyable film for all the family to watch. It's had plenty of bad reviews, but only from people who either looks too deep, or too shallow.",2012
641,sampit,Great popcorn entertainment...,7,13 November 2009,"So, where should I start? If you looking for great character development, brilliant acting or fantastic dialogs, this movie is not for you. Also the plot is a bit too simple to be enjoyed by a thinking mind and the characters pretty one dimensional, directly borrowed from many worn out disaster flicks. Scene after scene occurs where the director wants to have these emotionally-charged scenes where you're affected but, because there's no foundation, so you really don't care. The only noteworthy performance is that from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Adrian Helmsley. But where this movie does score is the jaw dropping unprecedented scale of destruction that you see unfolding before your very eyes. The computer graphics are awesome and so is the direction. The cinematography is near perfect. The film has a 2hr38 min runtime but it flies by as director goes on destroying one city after another. Earthquakes tearing apart freeways or huge tidal swallowing entire cities has never been shot better. As the end credits roll you can't help but ask yourselves a question? In Godzilla he destroyed NYC, in Independence day a lot more cities, in TDAT the northern hemisphere and now the entire World. So what next does Mr. Emmerich have in store for us? Unlike Day after tomorrow where the subplots were just contributing to runtime, while being sappy, idiotic and totally unconnected, here they serve its purpose quite well. So get set for the ride of your life and sit back any enjoy as Emmerich has fun destroying our world once again.",2012
642,tha_hawk,"Not convincing, but tries really hard to be so.",3,30 January 2010,"I can't really say that Roland Emmerich has put his signature on anything that I've come to appreciate. Maybe I just don't get this type of movie, or maybe it's simply because I feel a total lack of sympathy for any of the characters in this picture, as well as in his previous work. Sounds a bit harsh, I might admit, but the fact is that ""2012"" is made in a fashion that puts the characters somewhere in a dark corner, and places the idea of ""the end of the world"" on a pedestal in the center, with plenty of spotlights pointed at it. The story is constantly focused on the destruction of the Earth, and the people just seem to be there to fill out the gaps, and to make the scenes of explosions and floods of water fit together. The flatness of the characters, and the preposterous ways in which they repeatedly manage to escape from death, is really what brings this movie down. On the good side I thought the animations worked quite well, as well as the pace of the film, although the runtime could've been a couple of minutes shorter. The sound was good, with lots of dynamic, just the way I like it, and under the circumstances the acting efforts were fine,(after all John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor are no rookies). Furthermore I think the original idea clearly has potential for a great movie, the question is who would write/direct it to make the idea justice, and in what year would a remake take place?",2012
643,nilbogman,Maybe I'm just too 'general public' to be a critic...,7,30 July 2010,"As a disclaimer, the only spoiler I have included is the overall tone of the ending, no plot specifics. Promise :)I'm not sure whether to think of myself much of a movie critic or not. I know what I like in a film for sure, but it seems to me that I'm quite nicer to most films than a lot of people on this site. So, particularly in this review because it seems to very much from the others, I hope that you find this review somewhat helpful but it seems impossible to promise that you will agree with me. I judge a film based on how it leaves me feeling. Not like sad gets 1 point and ecstatic gets 10, but based on the level of effect that the pull of the emotion proposed in a film has on me. I don't go off on a checklist and explore every little detail down to the last byte (i.e. character depth, particular performances, little filmmaking goofs) Thus 2012, to me, is quite possibly one of the best films I have ever seen.I had a phase in around eighth grade when I first found out about the 2012 conspiracy in which I started freaking out. I didn't want the world to end so soon! I did a little research and learned that there was no way anything could happen, but still the thought lowered my spirits quite a bit whenever mentioned. Now, when this movie came out I did whatever I could to avoid it, the whole depression residue still left in the deep, dark pits of my soul. However, as in today's case, when you're on a 9 hour plane ride and have seen every other film in the seatback entertainment system, you don't have much of a choice. So, I entered the world of this film at 30,000 feet not expecting much of anything but a bunch of explosions and $50 million of special effects.That's where I was wrong.You see, this film wasn't just several edited clips of explosions. It was a film following the journey of an average American family, under harsh stresses, facing the end of the world. And even though a few parts are clichéd to the point where you want to rip your hair out of your head (I swear if I ever hear that 'you cannot fill a cup that is already full' analogy in a film ever again...), the ending, surprisingly enough for dealing with the end of the world, brings an extremely uplifting emotion. It proposes many possible morals to the story. It installs a sense of hope in the viewer. Oh yeah, and then there's that special effects and bang boom KABLOOSH!!!! BAM BAM BAM BAM KSSSHST!!! BANG!!! and stuff.Overall, don't get put off by the grim prospect of the world ending. See this film. You'll be happy you did. So, the verdict",2012

It may sound all too much like other doomsday scenarios of recent decades — the 1987 Harmonic Convergence, the Jupiter Effect or ""Planet X."" But this one has some grains of archaeological basis.One of them is Monument Six.Found at an obscure ruin in southern Mexico during highway construction in the 1960s, the stone tablet almost didn't survive; the site was largely paved over and parts of the tablet were looted.It's unique in that the remaining parts contain the equivalent of the date 2012. The inscription describes something that is supposed to occur in 2012 involving Bolon Yokte, a mysterious Mayan god associated with both war and creation.However — shades of Indiana Jones — erosion and a crack in the stone make the end of the passage almost illegible.Archaeologist Guillermo Bernal of Mexico's National Autonomous University interprets the last eroded glyphs as maybe saying, ""He will descend from the sky."" Spooky, perhaps, but Bernal notes there are other inscriptions at Mayan sites for dates far beyond 2012 — including one that roughly translates into the year 4772.And anyway, Mayas in the drought-stricken Yucatan peninsula have bigger worries than 2012.""If I went to some Mayan-speaking communities and asked people what is going to happen in 2012, they wouldn't have any idea,"" said Jose Huchim, a Yucatan Mayan archaeologist. ""That the world is going to end? They wouldn't believe you. We have real concerns these days, like rain."" The Mayan civilization, which reached its height from 300 A.D. to 900 A.D., had a talent for astronomy Its Long Count calendar begins in 3,114 B.C., marking time in roughly 394-year periods known as Baktuns. Thirteen was a significant, sacred number for the Mayas, and the 13th Baktun ends around Dec. 21, 2012.""It's a special anniversary of creation,"" said David Stuart, a specialist in Mayan epigraphy at the University of Texas at Austin. ""The Maya never said the world is going to end, they never said anything bad would happen necessarily, they're just recording this future anniversary on Monument Six.""",2012
647,jamesantoniou,Is it realistic? No. Is it perfect? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes.,7,20 March 2011,"I can completely understand why 2012 has so many negative reviews; It is not realistic at all, and there were way too many 'close calls' - i.e. if this was real life they would be dead in the first ten minutes! So it is nowhere near perfect.However, I have to ask myself this question: Did I enjoy it? The answer is a resounding yes. It was very exciting, and the special effects were outstanding. So whilst it wasn't perfect, it was certainly enjoyable.Even though it was enjoyable, I think it could have easily been ten times better as the plot had a lot of potential. Score: 7/10, Summary: Not perfect, not realistic, but very enjoyable. PS - this is good as Blu-Ray!I would say view this especially if you like Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.",2012

The characters exist only in the imagination of those who made this garbage possible; Hollywood and its employees. They have zero chance to exist in reality.Forget about the fact that the whole premise was nonsense; i.e. the Mayan calender.Notwithstanding that, Roland make it very clear by his old-school stereotypical dehumanisation parade: shallow WASPS, caricature-sque Arabs,superstitious Catholics, robotic Chinese, etc. on the other end-scale of his 'reality' a heroic American president (who in fact have no authority over the NS or secret service when it comes to such situation) stay behind? Why, because he wanted to help by attending to his people's final plight: it was laughable, not eye-watering Mr Roland.Going through this crap was like a bizarre dream, full of ludicrous absurdities, be it a scientific or logical one; one can't tell which is which.

The characters and ""story""elements all appeared in his previous movies, and there they were plausible and they worked. But here he just repeats himself and just can't cut it. 2012 is an okay movie if you haven't seen anything like it before, but otherwise - like for me - it's boring and not even eye-candy, because imho the special effects were not good. And why would you shoot such a movie on video and not on film? I'm really disappointed in how stupid Emmerich and the producers seem think I am.",2012
652,TechenPrime,A pretty bad movie to say the least,2,21 December 2012,"So I never actually intended to watch this movie since I do not really believe in the 2012 end of the world thing but instead i watched it on the day it was supposed to happen just for kicks and laughs. The movie however was much worse than I thought and could not even bring out any laughs...well maybe a little for how ridiculous it was. I'm a little surprise no one had picked up on this but there was really only one purpose to the entire movie. First of all let me tell you that my review will contain spoilers: So the purpose of this movie was to straight out bash religion. The main focus was obviously to bash the bible a little more but generally all religion. If you take note to details in the film you will see that a lot of the people whose deaths were focused on (not all but a lot) were religious people. Catholics were were shown worshipping in the church and monks in the temple when oblivion hit. The president, who was to most likely there to represent Obama and Obama's ties to Christianity is shown wanting to pray to God rather than escape with the scientists, rich people, and other atheists. The main geologist who is one of the main characters of the movie decides to talk to his father who mentions that ""God"" knows how much he loves him. Now it could just be a saying here or he could be religious. Later on its kind of ironic that an earthquake would hit under their location and cause a tsunami that would kill everyone on board the sea ship that the geologists father was on despite being far out to sea. That same waves travels all the way Washington DC where the president who had just survived an earthquake and seems to be the only one to survive is hit with the same same ship the geologist was on which was being carried by the wave, a horrible fate for two religious men. Then all the main characters dodge ridiculous odds and go to China, a communist and open atheistic country, to board what was first thought of as a start ship or space craft but was actually a man made ark like ""Noah's Ark"" from the bible but instead man made. Why was only china able to make this in time? Probably because of their Darwinian example of survival of the fittest (money, support from the rich, possibly forced labor). The people then had to board quickly because a tsunami was going to hit them faster than they expected. They tried to leave those who were not on the ship behind. But the geologist who believes in human's inner goodness as displayed throughout the entire movie wants to show compassion for his fellow man unlike the Noah story in the bible where the ark was shut after years of warning and the people could no longer get in which is probably to symbolize that atheists are nicer than God or something of the such. After their compassionate act or whatever they realize that the whole world was not flooded over (because they thought it would be) but that the whole continent of Africa had raised up higher so that the waves couldn't reach it. This would not only prove the evolution theory that there was no universal flood but that Noah himself probably saved himself like this and not by God's hands but by his own human will and power. The reason the movie was so bad was because it was all based on Atheistic Evolution vs Religion and there is no fun in a war zone of ideals. The movie was not based on actually making a good story line and including logic in the actual events. I don't know if they are trying to say random chance can cause this to happen or something but come on. The movie's effects were way overdone, nothing made sense from beginning to end in terms of logic and the Mayans were mentioned once in the entire film (probably so that its religious component wouldn't be a factor). All in all I give this film a 2/10, i would have given it a 1 but some visual effects in the movie weren't that bad.",2012
653,wilsonskye14,Worth a watch,7,30 May 2021,"I'm going to say this film was definitely one of many of my guilty pleasures. A large part of that is due to John Cusack starring in the film, but it's enjoyable because it's almost laughable how unreal the events that transpire are.You can tell that the goal of this film was to scare the wits out of doomsday theorists, especially because of the Mayan prophecy that the world was set to end in 2012. The cataclysm, the extreme side to natural catastrophes were largely built up to instill that fear.That doesn't make the film bad though. You can't expect much from Doomsday films. Even most of the great doomsday films are laughable due to the exaggerated disasters. That doesn't make them any less enjoyable to watch.One thing I liked was the government secretly building these arks like Noahs Ark to prep for the ""end."" It was different than most apocalyptic films I've seen.The only complaints I have that gave it a 7 out of 10 for me was the exaggerated degree of believability with the natural disasters and the romantic sub plot between the main character and his wife.I found it highly improbable that all of these catastrophes or natural disasters would just happen to happen all at the exact same time and at that magnitude. That and the fact that the family just happened to just barely skate pass each of them.Another thing that I was flustered with was Jackson, the main character, and his relationship with his ex-wife. She JUST lost her boyfriend and is making googly eyes at her ex in the middle of doomsday of all things.Developing a relationship during a distaster and getting over someone you were in a relationship with or were related to immediately after they pass is one of the most frustrating tropes for me.Overall, this film is rewatchable and enjoyable.

There is a large earth quake where they live as well as other major disasters worldwide, they all have to try and survive, which takes them on an epic journey. The plot is well planned and has a lot of variety which gives you the sense of a worldwide disaster, which is always good for this type of film.

I went to the cinema expecting some incredibly expensive CGI and a total lack of anything else (plot, character development, good acting,...and so on). But sadly I didn't even get the little I was hoping for. I will not start counting the numerous script logical errors or physical impossibilities I saw. It's futile. The movie is so bad you actually laugh at the most dramatic moments it tries to deliver( and trust me, there's a lot of them). I like action movies, I don't mind if an action sequence is a little over the top, but the sheer number of miraculous escapes in 2012 is ludicrous. Overall, the movie is just a series of death defying stunts and little dramas terribly overdone by some characters you don't give a **** about. It's more like some drama TV series(could have been a better idea to make this into a 20 episodes TV show). This movie deserves just a 4 out of 10 from me, but I give it a 5, for Woody Harrelson and a brief apparition from Arnold (""I believe ze worst ist now overr!"" ).",2012
658,Instantdeath,The end of apocalyptic rehashed movies. PLEASE!!!!!!!,1,16 November 2009,"First and foremost, I need to get this one out of my system before ripping into this pile of atomic sewage. Why oh why did Emmerich feel the need to run this film beyond 2 hours??????? How many pointless actions shots of that screechy girl in the junior pull-ups did we have to endure, Christ! that's all you need, driving through a Yellowstone Volcano, dodging flying magma, only to be distracted by the fact that your daughter is about to p*** herself. We often wonder about airport security, but if I could manage to acquire a plane by simply giving someone my Casio digital $5 watch, the mind boggles at the endless possibilities. Why didn't any of the Arc take significant damage when all the planes on the airfield swept towards them? IF the earths crust is constantly moving, why wasn't there more damage to the Arcs. At the end they said there were 6 ships, but we clearly saw that number 3 was damaged beyond repair, why didn't it sink when the Tsunami swamped the whole base?????????I like my action movies for being unbelievable at times, but for a cosmetic surgeon to suddenly develop the ability to charter not only a single engine, but twin engine and then to top it all off a 6 engine Russia cargo plane with a full pay load is beyond comprehension, even in fantasy land comprehension. Why did the laws of physics deserve such a pounding in this film? I found myself grinding inside with every possible disaster scenario that confronted the luckless family. For example, its like yes! we've found a way on to the Arc, No! now the simple door mechanism wouldn't shut and the waters coming in. Oh my God!We're heading for Mount Everest, quickly hit reverse and we'll be saved! Yahoooooo!......Utter Drivel! I don't want to even get started on the Russian Billionaire, who could have used some of his millions to take some speech therapy lessons. Too predictable, over acted, I don't think at any point I felt any real fear or trepidation for the characters as it was pretty obvious who was going to bite the bullet. The two guys on the cruise ship??????? Please explain why it was necessary to tell us that the scientists father had been T-total for 25 years, how is that relevant to the massive tidal wave that's going to hit.Hated this film, too long, overdone and mind numbing.One last thing....The president is Danny aka 'Mr Lethal Weapon' Will this surely end Hollywood's love affair with making films about the earth self destructing, we're all doomed! Yeah, Doomed to watch this horse crap over and over again until someone in the board realises ' Oh wait! maybe people would like to see some half decent CGI and real character plot development alongside original story lines......no wait, make more of these abominations and splice in some extra CGI to fill in the black holes in the plot.'

The best thing about it is actually that it's a patchwork of two movies, first part is dumb as hell, the scenes of devastation are completely illogical, but the actors and director did a great job nonetheless. And it has Woody Harleson.
The second part is plain awesome, put aside some other illogical choices and stuff. There is humour, bravery, consideration, heroics, leadership, unity, good visual effects and great scenes.

663,AdventureFan,Bad Storyline and Script Trump Special Effects,2,27 November 2020,"There are spoilers in this review!2012 is a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster with an all-star cast that had great potential, but is destroyed by the terrible storyline and script. To begin with, you have to accept a really implausible cause for the worldwide disaster, but I'm okay with that part, since it's a disaster movie; the main problem is the storyline and bad script that follow.The storyline is riddled with clichés, 2-dimensional characters, plot holes, and predictable outcomes. For instance, there are cellphones that still work when there should be no infrastructure left, and situations that conveniently change just in time to help the protagonists. The special effects are great, of course, but are rendered ineffective by the unbelievable way the main characters escape, over and over again, from certain death. After seeing them escape multiple times, I eventually stopped being concerned. Of course, the people around them die quickly, as would be expected in these scenarios, and this only shows how ridiculous it is for them to always survive. For the most part, it's obvious ahead of time who will live (the ""good"" guys) and who will die (the ""bad"" guys or ""sort of bad"" guys). Some storylines are left incomplete, such as when one of the main (likeable) characters dies, and the family of protagonists don't even mention her death. They even end up with her dog, who she made sure to save before herself, but still no mention that it was sad/unfortunate that she died, or that her dog misses her, etc. I'm not sure if that was bad editing or scripting, but it makes no sense in the movie. There is also no explanation of whether the wild animals taken on board the ship (to maintain the species) survived or drowned.The actors overall are (surprisingly) convincing, but there are times when they all seem to struggle with the poor script. The only scripting that seems realistic to me is the relationship between the kids and their dad (John Cusack), especially with the adolescent boy. The other relationships/characters in the movie follow the usual Hollywood formulas: divorced wife he still loves, new boyfriend she doesn't really love and is kind of a jerk (but improves as a person before he dies), crazy conspiracy theorist who is really right about everything after all, estranged parents and children who try to re-connect too late, etc.The movie seems to drag on way too long, despite the non-stop action. It could have been a good movie, if they had spent less money on CGI and more on the script; as it is, I can only give it two stars for the special effects, for having a fairly diverse cast of good actors, and for the kids/dad relationship. John Cusack gives a strong performance as the main lead, but even he can't save this movie.",2012

Ask yourself if you actually enjoyed 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'Godzilla' or even 'Independence Day' (a film that many would say is okay but I maintain is half a good film - the first half - and half a total mess).If we carry on paying to see these types of films (Transformers et al), they will continue to make this garbage.

665,nconstab,Who am I to judge? It made money!!!,3,15 November 2009,"So I arrived at the theater with low expectations to begin with and doing so greatly helped me to not walk out. It amazes me to no end why Hollywood continues to develop unbelievable scripts that are easily fixable from the start. Sometimes there are elements to a story that are so forced and inane, one wonders how these intelligence-insulting decisions are made to forge ahead and run with it. Yes, I was a tad dismayed that mythologies and prophecies were not examined more closely and most circumstances of survival scenes were completely over the top. It was freakish to me that Danny Glover, who was cast as the President of the United States, and the young lady that played his daughter were both previously cast years ago as two of the strangest characters in Oprah Winfrey's train wreck, ""Beloved"". But what truly bothered me is when vast modern technologies were used to create the ultimate series of Arks for human and animal survival, the plight of all the main character's lives were hanging by a thread because the boat's engine would not be able to start unless the gate was completely closed. Really? That's all you got? Utterly unforgivable and I want my money back. My numb rear end didn't appreciate this waste of time either! Just another lesson that it doesn't matter how bad a script is and how many good scripts they probably passed on – it's who knows who and who owes someone a favor – and how everyone in Hollywood operates on fear and are afraid to question the simplest of fixes. The real problem is that none of this matters; they made money and will continue to as long as the public continues buying into mediocrity.",2012
666,greendistantstar-1,Too Much To Believe,6,20 March 2010,"I much anticipated this movie and saw it on its opening night. Having waited until its release on DVD (Blu Ray in this case) to write a review, I'm glad I waited. As eye-candy, 2012 is a total feast. The CGI action and rendered scenes are simply jaw-dropping, well done. The concept is somewhat flawed scientifically, though this is well explained by the scientific adviser in the 'Special Features' section of the disc.The acting by Cusack and the rest of the crew is as good the script allows, and that's not much. But dear me, who is responsible for the screenplay and editing? How many times can our hero and crew make last-second escapes from seemingly hopeless situations before we throw up our hands and say ""Enough!""? How many plane escapes from huge pyroclastic flows? How many car/van escapes, gaping hole escapes, underwater escapes, before you realize that whoever was putting this together must be assuming that the audience are morons? But here's the biggest surprise of all. This movie could have been so, so much worse. The alternate ending shows just how really dumb this movie really could have been. You can see Chiwetel Ejiofor grimace with incredulity when he takes the phone call from his not-really-dead Dad and says ""I can't believe it!"". And Segal with his arm in a shoulder-sling also grimaces, everyone in the scenes does. The deleted scenes also tell this tale, and really anyone that comments on 2012 *without* seeing these scenes and alternate ending hasn't quite got the full picture.6/10 for brave acting with a mediocre script, amazing CGI and foolish implausibilities.",2012

Maybe then one of the characters would have survived. As for the un-realism...well, you're going to a movie about the end of the world, as predicted by a CALENDAR, that just so happens to have the date land on 12-21-12...I don't know what everyone expected. Last I heard this was a MOVIE, not a survival guide for the end of the world. If that's the case then I think you're better off watching a documentary/mockumentary. This was nothing more than a fun popcorn movie with lots of falling bridges and buildings and those edge of your seat scenes where you think everything is going to hell but at the last second everything turns out alright... don't go into this movie expecting an Oscar masterpiece (unless it's nominated for the special effects), enjoy the outlandish action scenes and the millions and millions of dollars at work.",2012

If some distant planet is in danger of exploding, we might just identify with the few humans that happen to be there while it's happening. But this is not a distant planet. This is Earth in just a few months time from now.The special effects in this movie are enough to make the viewer at least consider how awful it would be if this were really to happen. We see the planet fall apart before our eyes, and the realism is strikingly brilliant. The problem is, any concern we feel is for our own countries, our own people, our own families and loved ones. In my case, that's mainly western Europeans and South Americans. I feel for them as I see their homelands washed away under a sea of lava.But that is not what this movie wants. It doesn't want me to feel concern for the annihilation of everything I have come to know and love. It wants me to care about Cusack and his nauseating family. I have very rarely seen a film in which I have desperately wanted the hero to die, but in this one I did. I want to know where I am, where my mother is, where my dog is, where my friends are... Cusack's silly little plastic Hollywood family is the least of my concerns right now as the world is about to end...

There are a few situations that are not humanly possible, but still, it will take your breath away..thats for what we go watch a movie...right?It will definitely make us think if we were in that situation, what would we do? The efforts taken to make this movie could be understood by the perfection of each and every shot in this movie.Don't listen to my comments..just think for yourself... What else can you expect from the makers of Independence day and The day after tomorrow.Prepare yourself for the last days.Just watch it. Its really worth it. Go ENJOY in a BIG SCREEM.",2012

I liked it back then and and, yet again, thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - a rollicking good yarn, with great special effects that kept you on the edge of your seat.

671,mark_galvin2000,Check your brain at the door...,6,16 November 2009,"...becasuse this film does not test the little grey cells in the slightest.This is definitely one of those movies that does what it says on the tin, disaster flick that requires a happy (Hollywood) ending. With dialog that is in places cringe worthy and quite frankly abysmal overuse of the same plot device (how many times can a plane escape a rapidly approaching hole in the ground and then fly through a collapsing city!).However despite this it was still a very enjoyable film. After all how many times have you seen the White House crushed by an aircraft carrier? The actors on the whole deliver solid performances although there were a few moments where a throat lozenge would have been useful.In summary this is a paint by numbers disaster movie with solid performances and an absolutely spectacular CGI element. All in all good fun, just don't expect to have your intelligence tested and you should be fine!",2012

It wasn't perfect though.If you like movies that have a lot of special effects, adventure, and a little sci-fi this is a good movie. There were some parts that dragged on, but it wasn't too bad.Like others have said, you can't think much in this one. They barely mention the history. And some parts were pretty unrealistic. Some of the parts the acting wasn't as good either. Some of the ""natural problems"" were repetitive as well, which dragged it at certain points. Some of the people's reactions didn't seem real at all, but it didn't bring the movie down enough to not be pleasant to watch.But overall it was interesting. Entertaining at the ideas and creativity of the destruction. Not the best, but not the worst either.",2012
673,ronniholme,Terrible,1,15 November 2009,"Me and my girlfriend expected a lot from this movie, we obviously never expected it to be a drama masterpiece, but some nice action and hopefully a story that made somewhat sense.God were we let down, the action scenes were terrible, of course we know that the hero will make all sorts of getaway moves, but Superman ain't got nothing on this guy.The movie can pretty much be summed up with.Terrible dialouge, scene where our hero and his god annoying family get's away just 0.0001 second before it's too late, and then another awful dialouge and nonsense, after where our little superteam decides to land on the middle of what is gonna be the worlds largest volcano, they of course get's away just at the very very last second, let's not forget that a volcano cloud moves at incredible speed, however our hero can of course outrun it in a mobile home down a curvy road.This goes on and on, I stopped counting the amount of ""tense"" scenes after 1 hour, but it's retarded, because you know that the good guy and his family are gonna survive, it's obvious and therefore these scenes become retarded and quite boring.Heck I would have preferred the ex-wife and a kid dying once in a while, it would have given you abit of the ""omg are they gonna make it?!"" feeling, but it doesn't.It's an extremely boring movie, there's no ""wow nice effects"" we've seen it all before, acting is just horrible, of course the bad guy who just shows his loving heart at the end dies, of course our hero's ex-wifes new girlfriend dies a pretty terrible death so we're sure that he'll get his ex back, and of course she forgot everything about her just dead boyfriend 5 minutes after he's dead and starts making out with her hero ""what a slut tbh"" You really have a terrible taste in movies if you liked this, you gain nothing from seeing it, whatsoever.",2012

I do not go to the movies to see how good of a job the director made or if the actors are good or bad (I do not even know when an actor is good or bad) or if the movie had a good or a bad plot (granted there are some that are as bad as they can be), I am not a critic and I do not want to be one.

And the part where the airplane actually goes into the the cindercluster cloud which actually would choke the engines, and burn the airplane to the ground.

Its 2.5 hour+ running time moves at a great clip, and there's enough science and pseudoscience running around to give the film a certain of-the-moment wonder and clarity. The many destruction sequences throughout the film are absolutely breathtaking to behold, and one wonders if Roland Emmerich starts every film imagining how he will destroy the White House. Like all of his other films (except for The Patriot) it has big names but no huge names and really is a blast to watch. It has just the right balance of action and melodrama, often, as with all good films of this genre, in the same scene. The audience I watched it with was laughing and cheering throughout, and I'm sure it will be the definitive event movie of the holiday season, critics be damned.",2012
678,tony_aka30,"Is this movie a comedy, a family flick, an animated feature or a serious film depicting the end of the world???",2,14 February 2012,"I finally got the chance to see this film on TV a few weeks ago, and I'm glad that I got to see this one for free because I wouldn't pay a single penny to watch this in theatres or in home media.This is your typical B movie: an average Joe starts out small and ends up becoming the hero saving the day, all the secondary and useless characters that the audience has no attachment to die, all the important characters survive, more action and CG than story and one of the protagonists scores with the hot girl. Oh, and of course the film is full of additional cheese and typical clichés.2012 is a movie that cannot decide what kind of genre it is. Is it an animated feature? Because 90% of the movie seems to have been done by a computer software. Or is it a family comedy? Because most of the time the characters popped out stupid jokes in critical life threatening situations and the main family seemed to survive by a hair the most extreme and catastrophic situations...and joke casually about it afterwards...ugh...Or is it a serious film depicting the end of the world, which is quite a big deal if all this doomsday BS actually occurs, as 90% of the time you see cities being destroyed and people being crushed by the force of nature.So there is serious drama and destruction going on and on top of that the characters with screen time pop the most useless and inappropriate jokes, avoid sure death and on top of that there is an overdose of unrealistic and exaggerated CG...yuck! This movie deserves no more than the minimum (1 star). However, this movie does somehow address the issue of social inequality, which is a theme I think deserves attention.So 2/10.",2012
679,briansouter,Spoilers: Great end of the world movie: excellent script and cast,10,9 December 2009,"I must be alone in thinking this a much better movie than many of the mainstream critics and potluck reviewers on IMDb. Some reviews were so bad they've forced me to make afew comments on the film. 1. Its a great script, mixing humor and pathos, great and emotional dialogue, terrific CGI...Notable scene: the train hurtling into the void...a scene that could come from a John Martin (google him) painting.Since the film has made > $600million, we can assume few people have not seen it. Divorced Writer and general Everyman Jackson Curtiss and bibliophile and humanitarian Dr Adrian Helmsely head the two story lines, when it becomes known the world is about to end.Helmsely sets in motion a plan to save a remanent of humanity, Curtiss learns by lucky accident from conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost (a comic gem) of the disaster and the US govt plans to build 'spaceships', and blessed with the most amazing luck effects to get his estranged to the point of departure. The most implausible events happen, everything is written on a grand scale, yet the characters are NOT overwhelmed, thanks to the clever casting choices for the the varied characters, a strong well written script(see Charlie Frost giving his sermon on the mount), where wit and humor do not detract from the tragedy that unfold. The film moves deftly thru emotional registers, from humor to pathos often in one scene, without jarring. For those who find no emotions, i suggest they go see the film, or did they miss the 'President of the louve is an enemy of humanity' scene aboard airforce one. Helmsely - Anheuser constantly bicker as they present the two poles in the story of ruthless pragmatism and naieve humanitarianism. The most novel casting feature is Charlie Frost: a wild eyed conspiracy theorist, whose radio fulminations are more accurate that Cal tech, and whose apotheosis on the mountain continues the biblical strain in full Isaiah mode in the story as he launches into his prophetic attack on humanity forseeing with certain relish the end of Washington. This film has a bit of everything in its script, allowing space for sly political commentary...G8 ships end up seeking refugee in the third world(Africa), threading the idea of the end of the world into random thoughts ('Curtiss, late to meet family: 'Im a dead man') to the jazz duos: 'It ain't the end of the world'. Well known personalities are given sly post modern digs: Governor Schwarzenegger calming peoples fears that the worst is over just when California erupts, and the Queen and her corgies is seen doing what the Obama like president does not. While more somber moments are given to characters like the excellent Danny Glover's President Wilson...Obama?? But the heart of the film is well borne by the two leads: earnest thespian Ejiofor and sly-witted Cusack, both embodying a compassionate urge, which is why they have suck great luck?.Comedy, pathos, tragedy,wit, is crammed skillfully into the fleeting 2.5 hours, engaging this viewer and not letting up till the cliff hanging climax.",2012

However, the story line will stretch your imagination.... a lot! That's why I recommend that all 'adults' leave their rational thinking, and logic, at the theater door. (My daughter saw it too, and at 16, she recognized too many 'logic' flaws to make it a believable movie.) Not one to see again, but may, when it comes out on DVD, mainly to watch the special effects. The heroes and heroines should have died a thousand times, but somehow they all (mostly) made it through. Teenagers, 15 and under will love it, those older will find it a long stretch...!

How many trees could have been planted in the Amazon rain forest for this amount of money? I am sorry to be a damp squid with regard to this film but for me the acting was 'ok' and generally the film was not only depressing to watch, but lacked any real interest in the fact that the major scenes seem to wash over quickly (Gee you had better look at this, Yeah another continental drift.

If it weren't for the special effects, it would've been utterly unwatchable. Seriously. And I'm usually the one who likes these cheesy action movies. I loved Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, etc. But no plot or complexity whatever, again + bloated budget, again, and no imagination, this time, slopped atop an epic 2000+ (?) year old myth = horrible film.

686,AdaMadaPia,Atrocious,1,8 March 2016,"I was very excited about this film when it came out. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. Normally, I like John Cusack and I think he's done great work, but this was just...in a word, awful. I can get behind ""check your brain at the door"" films for the most part and can even suspend my inner skeptic when it comes to lack of realism in fiction, as long as it's done in a way that doesn't make me feel patronized. But, that's exactly what this film did. The effects were good, I'll give it that, but that's pretty much the only thing it had going for it. ***Possible Spoilers***I found the characters to be nauseatingly insipid with the notable exceptions of Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson. Unfortunately, they had very tiny roles in the film and were killed off fairly early. In all honesty, I found myself empathizing with the lowly extras who met their untimely demises more than I could empathize with any of the main characters.They essentially gave John Cusack superhuman powers what with his apparently previously unknown ability as the World's Best Driver. Seriously, what was this guy doing chauffeuring around rich Russian boxers when he could have been starring in the Indy 500? The amount of times he and his family defied death throughout this film was insulting to anyone with a few brain cells to rub together. A close call, or two, I can get behind that, but this was just ridiculous.The little girl was cute, but the boy was just annoyingly petulant through the first half of the movie and only slightly less annoying through the second half. Amanda Peet did an okay job, but her character struck me as enormously self-absorbed, begging the old Chinese woman to save her kids when she seemed to have little regard for the lives that were lost all around her. She also barely batted an eye when her boyfriend/husband lost his life in a heroic attempt to save her and her kids. In fact, they were all like that. The only times anyone showed any interest in someone besides themselves was when Danny Glover sacrificed his life while helping injured people and one, or two lines delivered by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandi Newton and that was when they were already safely aboard the Arc. And can we stop with the broken up relationship and killing off the new love interest just so the main couple can get back together trope? Good grief. If all that wasn't bad enough, the ending was so unbelievably insulting, I practically retched on my popcorn. John Cusack and his family survive the massive flood despite the odds and when it's all said and done, the survivors aboard the Arc watch the sunrise. There are no tears. No shock, or devastation as one would expect when nearly 7 billion lives are wiped off the face of the earth. No, they're freaking SMILING. Just one happy family again and the little girl doesn't even need Pull-Ups anymore! Yay. *gag* I literally wanted to smack every single one of them and demand my money back.",2012
687,scattering_like_light,Fx++,8,4 December 2009,"I went to see 2012, expecting it to be nothing more than a simple distraction - a 'shock-and-awe' style FX fest... to my surprise it turned out to be somewhat more...Indeed there is little in this film that isn't handled well, and few bits that were not didn't really matter. Here's the basics: The visual design work on show here is truly spectacular on every level, and was largely what I paid to see it for, so full points there. Cinematographically this really is a treat, with endless shots of assorted landscapes falling to bits, blowing up, and making life in general quite difficult for people. Equally well-designed are the camera placements amid the carnage, which is showcased in what I never found not to be a massively impressive way.But the film really is much more than that. I dislike lack of credulity in films, and aside from the slightly ridiculous thing about the Mayan Calendar at the beginning, I was largely convinced that things were plausible. This even extended to the numerous 'flight-from-peril' sequences, which manage to walk exactly on the line of 'feasible' and 'unpredictable' most enjoyably. More than once I genuinely wondered if the current hero of the moment was going to make it.Acting is solid and believable throughout, and I found myself genuinely sympathetic with most of the characters in it. As a result, during the numerous moments of tearful goodbyes between relatives I was rather glassy-eyed myself, and felt connected with their plight.What IS nice is that the sentimentality-factor is not overplayed, as is so often the case. Warm, heart-felt and touching do not often lapse into simpering and nauseating, and although the 'Hero America' factor is still very much in evidence, it's not massively horrible.'Bad people getting their just deserts' is also present and correct, though surprisingly not often in the ubiquitous 'awful death' type way, and often there are twists in situations that reverse things, making bad people do good things, and vice-versa.Lastly, it's all put together well, and skillful editing ensures we all know what's going on most of the time, even as we concurrently follow a number of characters in their own struggles.Scored dramatically, acted well, and hugely lovely in the 3D department, anything I could find wrong it was rendered (no pun intended) unimportant. Worth a see in a cinema if you can, or at least on a massive screen.",2012
688,boggle_eyed_spaghetti,Cliché beyond human imagination.,3,13 December 2009,"I went into the cinema, with no expectations, because of the trailers I had seen, it looked like it would be another Day After Tomorrow film - A disaster movie from the perspective of a dysfunctional family, who in the end, get back together, because of the disaster. Entirely based around a modern day crisis, which will be dated soon enough. However, with these expectations, I still went in with a clear mind, hoping that it wouldn't be like that. I was severely wrong. It was exactly I could not think of a more cliché storyline, and whats worse, it had SO many crass and cringe-worthy lines and parts in it, I could of died, right there in the cinema.I can't remember every single one, but here are just a few, which actually hurt my soul. The Vatican starts to crack under an Earthquake, and the cardinals look up at the roof of the Sistine Chapel, and on the Creation of Adam painting, a crack goes between the Hand of God and Adam. *shivers* The Russian guy in it, can't remember his name off the top of my head, but he said some of the worst lines known to humankind i.e. ""It's Russian.. eh?"" ...Okay from that it's not as effective, but if you've seen the film, you'll understand completely.Also when Jackson Curtis falls from the camper van into the large quake hole, and everyone thinks he is dead, and then it's the whole ""tense- looking-at-the-hole-hoping-that-he-would-emerge-again-and-he-does"" thing. His hands appear when he pulls himself up onto the runway, and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. I did NOT see that coming... What confused me the most about this film was when they were in the Ark. Why was there a giraffe making a random appearance every 5 minutes? It was just a pathetic attempt to try and put humour in a serious situation, and it really didn't work. You can't just break tension of the moment with ridiculous humour.The last thing I have to say really, is the unlikeness of everything that happened. I'm not denying what will happen, because some of the stuff in the film that happened, like Yellowstone blowing it's top etc. might happen. I don't believe it will, but I won't say it won't, because I don't want to be wrong. Anyway, I digress. What I'm talking about is some of the things the main characters did to escape disaster. Now I know I'm supposed to allow for poetic license, but I can't help it. The things they did were just so outlandish. For example, one of the characters, Gordon, is a very amateur pilot, only ""having a few lessons"". Now, being a licensed pilot, I can tell you, from that experience, you can't even possibly begin to understand how to operate a giant cargo plane from a single engine plane on your first attempt. It's just ridiculous. And some of the flying he does, is not only improbable, but if he attempted it in reality, he would die. Some of the driving was just ridiculous too, but slightly more believable.There's so much more, but I can't begin to describe it all.The only thing going for this movie, is the special effects. They were pretty spectacular, and just as well, seeing as the whole movie contained them. Particularly the CGI. It was pretty good.However, I do NOT recommend seeing this film, unless you want a fantastic laugh, or you are into cheesy, cliché, disaster/family orientated movies.",2012

After one hour and 45 minutes, I couldn't wait it to be over.

Me and my mum personally love this sort of genre and it's disappointing to see very little of it! Watching this is super fun and I rewatch it definitely!

And then I went to see it. Oh boy, ... cough,... sputter, I'm getting nauseated. A star studded cast with John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrleson, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, etc. gave this film such high hopes. But did somebody forget to hire a screenwriter for this? Because this film had some of the worst drivel and cliché driven schtick I have ever seen. I was beginning to wonder if it was a David Zucker spoof on Disaster Films. The film starts off well, building plot and intrigue. Characters are nicely introduced. Pending doom and foreshadowing are not overdone - yet. And then Woody Harrleson is introduced. That's when the film begins to seriously unravel. The over-the-top comic lunatic that Woody plays turns a potential disaster into a laugh fest. Then all hell breaks loose. Catastrophic earthquakes, explosions, monumental volcanic eruptions, cities sinking into the sea all come flying at us at 300 mph! Pray tell, how in the world does John Cusack and company manage to barely miss every single devastating earth swallowing fault crack, buckling highway collapse, airplane disaster, noxious volcanic plume, and near death drowning? On top of that, we are deluged by pathetic weepy emotional dialogue from all the key players. Danny Glover is the worst violator of sappy monologues. The only tears I shed were tears of excruciating pain over watching this drivel. The only basis for not submarining my ratings on this film were the terrific special effects and CGI. Well done. Lastly, the screenwriter cements the film for utter doom with the final two lines spoken by two main characters. Absolute stupidity. Guess there wasn't anything else to say. Don't waste your money on this film - unless you get to see it at the $2 movie theatre or have a devotional love for special effects.",2012

699,ggoinghometime,"""Retarded Epic!""",7,14 November 2009,"After today's showing, my boyfriend summed it all up...""2012 is retarded epic"". What he meant was that 2012 is just completely over the top destruction. And that is what we paid for. Destruction. We were definitely not expecting an Oscar worthy movie, but something anyone would enjoy. Of course the movie had its silly moments. Come on, we all expected it. In the trailer, John Cusack says, ""Holy..."", but was cut off by a massive explosion! This movie was obviously not made to be any deeper than an ""end of the world"" flick, folks. It was meant for entertainment and millions of audiences will be satisfied. I am a very tough critic, but I enjoy action movies especially like 2012. I enjoy movies for ""what it is"". The acting was mediocre. A stronger cast would have been better, but they did their thing and we loved it.As far as the action, most of the sequences were humanly impossible for anyone to survive...but very fun to watch. It had many ""edge of your seat"" moments...times that by 100!Realistically, 2012 will never happen and has been the folk tale of humanity for years. I was actually very impressed that the movie had a few intense and emotional moments. I applaud the director for that. For a second it made me think what *I* would do if it was the end of the world. Overall, it was a very fun movie. If you walk in expecting a serious and dark journey to survival...don't. Because this movie is an over-dramatic-blow-crap-up Blockbuster flick.Enjoy it because I'm sure you will.",2012
700,nathan-taurus,The Biggest Disaster Movie Ever,8,9 April 2010,"First of all I would give this movie 7.6 if I could.Acting = 8: The acting is good for the most part with some giving better performances than others. The little girl acts scared very good and Chiwetel Ejiofor is my top performer.Storyline = 9: This beats all other disaster movies as it has the almost total destruction of the world with billions possibly killed.Graphics = 9: The CGI is first rate and watching giant fireballs and waves crashing down along side buildings and cities is fantastic.Execution = 6.5: Unfortunately the big problem with this film is there is so much going on at once and too many characters piled up that it is hard to feel sympathy for the main characters. Also having children and pets ruins most of these movies because when they are rightfully afraid and screaming or barking (the dogs of course) we have this anger towards them because we are not in that situation, we are only watching a movie and we know it. It also doesn't help that the kids are always annoying. These gigantic films cannot suck us in so we don't feel what they wish for us to feel. When it's over all the viewer asks is ""What would I do?"" This movie is far too long at 2 hours 22 minutes and repetitive. Somehow the main characters are involved in almost all catastrophes that occurred and are only 1 metre in front of all road splits and building collapses - why does everything fall down just as they are approaching? 2012 is a great disaster movie with many flaws, but I'm still glad I saw it.",2012
701,dunamission,Depressing and boring but sensational SFX,4,29 November 2010,"This movie is so poorly written that its just a non event until the special effects start kicking in. The characters are dull, the story is miserable, and the acting is amateurish. Its not until the world starts going to poop courtesy of some awesome graphics, that the movie takes off from imminent ruin just like in the plot. Then the slow miserable story continues to unfold with some fantastic in between special effects to impress us with. The action sequences are probably the most far fetched ever in movie history, but this wouldn't be so bad if the story was fun, but it isn't. At the end of the film when we see the kind of people who were saved, I was left thinking that I would have rather have been left to perish. Who'd want to be a part of that community who survived? There's so much boring irrelevant movie in this movie that I'm sure the editors could have hacked an hour off of it. If this had been a B movie with low budget SFX, I think it would be one of the worst movies ever made. I'm not kidding. However it is salvaged by a roller coaster ride of some of the most impressive effects I've seen in a movie.",2012
702,clauslykkebo,Amazing! Watch it! But only once!,6,20 December 2009,"I was looking forward to watch this film for quite some time before release date and then I went to the local cinema with one of my girlfriends a couple of weeks ago.As expected the visual effects was amazing and every frame a piece of art. The details was mind blowing and makes the whole film worth seeing! And this is where 2012 fails. The history is pretty much formed to fit a trash can. There is way too many ""almost""s (you know then the car brakes heading towards a little boy on the road and the car stops just a foot before him) and a lot of illogical actions and minor or major details. E.g. why is it Sasha must stay in the plane which is already crashed? And why isn't there more women on board on the arc? This was some of the mayor but I also think there's a lot of physicist that could point out a couple of details. Beside of the trifles it did annoy me that the 'film look' vanished in the hand held shots of people getting wet by a bucket of water inside the arc and the very convenient security cameras oddly enough right in front of John Cusack's face. Maybe it's just me but when I or anyone else notice such scenes and by that is thrown out of focus at the story line it's a failure in my eyes.Though when walking away from the cinema I still had a wonderful feeling of mass destruction and could easily imagine the local buildings crumble and disappear into the giant crack in the earth in a cloud of dust and screams! Simple amazing! Overall I've given 2012 six stars and that's mostly because of the visual effects and the rest because of the awesome feeling of mass destructions! I will really recommend watching this film... but only once...",2012
703,Anfubvinch,"A disaster movie ? No, just a disaster.",4,30 January 2010,"I didn't have high expectations about this movie. Well, first, the director is Roland Emmerich. The King of apocalyptic movies full of clichés with no interesting characters. Then, the budget of this film is 230 million dollars. So I knew before watching it that it would be a movie with a terrible scenario, terrible actors, but I said to myself: hey, at least it has nice visual effects ! I was right. There were nice visuals. The problem is that there were too much. way too much... The movie lasts 2h and 30 minutes. So picture it: 2h and 30 minutes of unbelievably bad dialogs, unbearable patriotic scenes that alternate with huge stuffs falling down, breaking down, tumbling down and (especially in the last 30 minutes) flowing down. Why is there so much water ?? When I came home from the theater I couldn't believe how long I stayed in the bathroom. And about the actors: oh yeah, the actors... Danny Glover as the president of the United States is pitiful (but he hasn't been in a good movie since Lethal Weapon 2) and John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor are quite bad compared to their usual performances. 2012 is terrible movie only to be watched (if it is to be watched) in theater. Full of clichés, like the Italian president who goes to the church to pray instead of running away ( not sure that Berlusconi would have done that), and highly demagogic.",2012
704,JAllen60,Much better than reviews suggest,9,14 May 2010,"A superb apocalyptic comedy, spot on in every respect though a bit long. But, hey, it's the end of the world after all, and we shouldn't feel rushed to get it over with. The movie is filled with brilliantly realized clichés and hilarious caricatures, dozens of impossibly narrow escapes, several running gags about everything from absentee dads to breast implants, more special effects and sight gags than you can count, and actors who clearly are enjoying fiddling around as Washington drowns. Absolutely nothing is to be taken seriously here, especially not Mayans making calendars, a point apparently easily missed given the many tone-deaf reviews this film has received. Think of 2012 as an updated version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and you will be in the right frame of mind. Thought I was in for a painful viewing experience reminiscent of The Da Vinci Code, and was very pleasantly surprised. Not for everyone, but if you enjoy quirky, intelligent humor carried off by a remarkably balanced and skillful ensemble cast, 2012 is hard to beat.",2012

The Theater is a mere 70mm screen.. Even then i have enjoyed the movie to the fullest. The actual events of destruction start after 40 Min's of start of the movie. The car chase is the highlight of the movie. If i could meet Roland Emmerich i would really want to tell him how great his direction was. Seriously the master of destruction. The entire movie kept me on the edge of the seat. There was not a single scene in the movie when i got bored. The movie really made me think of the doomsday. There was detail in every scene shown in the movie.I just loved the movie and i say it is a must watch for everyone! There was everything in it!! It really made me cry!! Thank you Roland!!!,2012
706,stefanjovanovicmelbstorm,"Great visuals, non-existent storyline, mediocre acting",5,20 November 2009,"I went into this film knowing there would be a LOT of CGI. But I had also hoped for a coherent storyline that at least tries to explain the 2012 doomsday event. Instead, apparently the Sun had a momentary spaz which begins to heat the Earth (like that isn't already happening). I wish Emmerich put in the Mayan theory a bit more, as this would put the movie on some kind of firm basis.The visuals were awesome, but it seems to be the only thing Emmerich can do properly. I thoroughly enjoyed the super volcano explosion, as well as the destruction of Los Angeles, but after a while, it seemed that from then on, a lot of the stuff than happened was completely unnecessary.The acting was concerning. Amanda Peet did jack. She would just sit there and scream pretty much throughout the film. Danny Glover also did jack. To me he was more of a new broadcaster rather than the president of a nation. The Russians were also a bit annoying, as it was clear Emmerich tried to put comedy with the billionaire. Adrian Helmsley was the only character who at least acted concerned about the human race. He at least tried to save people. Oliver Platt's performance was alright, as he demonstrated the typical man who cared more about his own life than others.",2012

They couldn't find 300 bucks to pay anyone with high school to write the story when they decided to spend gazillion on CGI... And famous CGI is NOT so realistic, everything has cartoonish feel. Action scenes... Tom and Jerry and Roadrunner have more consideration for laws of physics and reality than people who made this movie. It would be much more fair if they made just an hour of CGI effects, than trying to package it in this ""movie"".I didn't expect to see Schindler's List, and I love action flicks, I watched Independence Day 3 or 4 times, but this one is really disaster.",2012
708,jacksonjackson,The End of the World: The New Family Therapy?,6,24 December 2009,"Who knew the end of the world could be such a bummer? In ""2012,"" the first and certainly not the last big-studio bid to cash in on the supposed coming apocalypse, Roland Emmerich once again lays waste to Earth and its assorted famous landmarks, but this time it's with a touch of exhaustion, an almost routine finality. Maybe it's middle age (it's his first apocalypse since he turned 50). Or, maybe, it's because to a consummate destroyer of worlds (four doomsdays and counting), the true end of days is really just the final dreary step. Few images, after all, beat that of the California coast crumbling into the ocean like a sinking aircraft carrier, or of the subsequent barrage of flaming volcanic rock that pummels the earth when Yellowstone finally goes kaput, blowing its literal top and the audience's already torpid movie-going mind. Both of those sequences are given high prominence in ""2012,"" though neither is predicted by the end of the Mesoamerican long-count calendar, from which this movie takes its name if not much else. Weaving escapist fantasy into scientific fact has long been the prerogative of high-concept vehicles like ""2012,"" which omit most of the finer factual details (the Mayans never actually wrote of the end of the world, for starters) to make their own pseudoscientific conceits appear frighteningly plausible. That may explain why ""2012"" takes a nominally more scientific approach to the cataclysm (neutrinos, crust displacement, blah, blah, blah), though even Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the president's scientific adviser, seems to know that it's all one big joke long before Woody Harrelson, as some sort of apocalyptic hippie fanatic, can pop his eyeballs and declare, ""It's the apocalypse, man!""Mr. Harrelson's character doesn't figure much into the story beyond the usual wise fool archetype, though at least his bug-eyed mugging gives oomph to what is otherwise a pretty unremarkable disaster flick. The real selling point of ""2012"" is, of course, the annihilation of our planet and most of our species, and, if nothing else, the destruction here can hardly be called boring. That's to be expected, seeing that Mr. Emmerich is certainly an old hand in the industry, having already vaporized, trampled, flooded and frozen the planet solid, not to mention raked in a collective ten-figure sum at the domestic box office. Considering the worldwide scale of ""2012"" and Mr. Emmerich's incurable tendency to one-up himself, it's also no surprise that here he works so relentlessly to cover all his catastrophic bases, from the pulverization of the Vatican to the inundation of D.C., to the purely extraneous sight of a cruise ship keeling over, Paul Gallico-style, upending the galley and its many digitally- rendered flailing human bodies.But, seriously, what's the point anymore? Like most apocalyptic trifles, ""2012"" trades on the doomsday scenario to stake the usual forgettable claims at the resilience of the human spirit (and the American nuclear family) but mostly it just wants to watch the world burn, sometimes literally. The human race is ending, after all, and if that end never really resonates in ""2012,"" it's because not even Mr. Emmerich seems interested in examining it beyond the visceral level. Although he duly taps his emotional well by occasionally bringing you close to the calamity – the tiny human bodies tumbling from a collapsing freeway are certainly frightening – it's hard to feel awed by or even care at all about any of it when all the man wants to do (and wants us to do) is have a good time. ""2012"" is a pretty much a romp, then, and, for its first ruinous hour at least, a reasonably satisfying one. The sturdy B-movie screenplay by Mr. Emmerich and Harold Kloser actually picks up in 2009, giving time to introduce a few of the leading men and women who will figure into the imminent end, some of them likable (Mr. Ejiofor), others abhorrent (Oliver Platt as a blustering government bigwig), most of them just plain boring. Three years later, as the cracks in the Earth and the story become wider and more worrisome, more people come into play, in this case an everyfamily (John Cusack, Amanda Peet and their two burdensome children) we're meant to follow while modern civilization crumbles around them, in increasingly spectacular ways. But the spectacle wears off and the movie soon drags, done in when Mr. Emmerich's exuberant flair for devastation gives way to his seriously underwhelming affinity for family soap operatics and teary moments of worldwide harmony. Part of the problem with movies like ""2012"" is that even with the latest brand of pricey computer-generated effects at their disposal, such wizardry tends to undercut itself when you stop and realize that almost none of what you're seeing is really there, really happening. Mr. Emmerich is not entirely to blame, of course, though it's nonetheless a wonder that after three stabs at destroying the planet, he still can't avoid the disconnect between human tragedy and worldwide destruction that runs through ""2012"" like a fissure and keeps even its most realistic-looking disasters from ever feeling remotely real. Which may make it the perfect tonic to this particular ploy of the paranoia market.",2012
709,voidi,Drenched in exaggerated drama and clichés,6,21 December 2009,"If you combined Independence Day and The Day after Tomorrow, took out the cool one-liners and added the most amazing SFX you have ever seen, you would get something like this.It has all the characteristics of a bad mainstream action movie. The plot, characters and dialogs are so predictable I found myself laughing during some supposedly dramatic scenes. Every time the protagonists make a close escape from the Cataclysm happening around them, it's in the last possible second. Every time the vehicle passes a potentially deathly obstacle, it's by a few centimeters. Such close escapes CAN create drama, but they are happening throughout the entire film, at every possible moment. At some point, you will get bored with the predictability. The whole movie is so full of clichés, part of it is actually painful to watch. While most of the actors are doing a solid job, they can't overcome the awful script.The special effects, however, are what makes this movie worth watching. You can overlook the terrible stuff that usually makes up a good movie when you watch the destruction of a whole city, a huge wave rolling over the Himalaya or the eruption of what was once the Yellowstone National Park. These are truly the best SFX I've ever encountered in a movie, and they are the reason you should watch it regardless of its bad, well..., rest.",2012

At first, I thought it was gonna be not directed by Roland Emmerich but bad luck comes when actually a lot of critics say it was a negative, and I agree with them too. So here is my review for my thoughts about it. At first, I know that this is Columbia Pictures' playground. I guess that I mean, there is a disasters everywhere coming in 2012? Are you serious, sounded like some kind of sci-fi movie from Roland. And it says and the plot is like:There is a disaster in the whole universe of earth in 2012.And it sounded like futuristic, only to make it more worse, I have many complaints about this movie including the lazy script, and heavy reliance to this film. It is still a OK film, but I will give it a 1 and a 5. Saying, this is one of the effort films. It is a OK film.",2012

Sadly, 2012 is one long blunder of a movie.The movie's themes of faith, hope and unity are hidden underneath the ridiculous action scenes. Of course that's the point of 2012... but the movie goes on overdrive with all the near-misses. Watching 2012 is like playing Russian Roulette with an empty revolver. The film's main characters somehow seem to survive every disaster from taking their lives at the very last second. And you know from the beginning they're gonna survive till the end anyway.You could appreciate the humor in casting John Cusack as a writer-turned-limo driver, two separate roles he has played in previous films. Beatrice Rosen plays a Russian in this movie as she did in The Dark Knight. And Woody Harrelson's character was fun to watch as well. In fact, he was probably the only one who actually bothered acting. Some of the characters' accents were horrible (Beatrice Rosen, Johann Urb). Also, Cusack's son in the movie had an odd personality. There would be times he seemed wiser than his dad... and for the rest of the movie he was a scared little boy who's very annoying. 2012 is predictable and the action scenes look messy but that shouldn't stop anyone from watching it. It doesn't insult your intelligence as much as some other movies. Unfortunately the movie's chaotic and disorganized scenes make 2012 comical and ridiculous.You would think Emmerich tried too hard to outdo his previous effort and you could forgive him because he did try.Sadly this movie is a disaster.",2012

However, the acting was sill more than decent, and the story kept evolving with time, but the true highlight of 2012 is the amazing visual spectacles. The visuals in this movie are nothing short of astonishing, and as someone who watched just about every disaster movie out there, I can say that 2012 takes it to the next level, by delivering disaster scenes that will ASTOUND you with their realism. The scenes are SO detailed and so realistic that if you were to watch such scenes as part of the evening news, you would have found them totally believable. Some moments in fact were quite intense, even shocking (in an entertaining kind of way), which was all part of the experience. There is no question that 2012's depiction of disaster is an astonishing accomplishment in film history and as such is a must watch (assuming that you like this kind of stuff, of course). The movie has a fight for survival story-line, delivers some nice action scenes, a lot of drama, a good number of intense experience moments, and even several emotionally charged moments which all in all make 2012 worthy of watching.

I like that your interpretation of the end of the world is sort of like the birth of a new one with the ending on a (SPOLIER) boat like spaceship which is like Noah's Ark. Overall I gave it a 7 because of the effects you used and it seemed to be like a family oriented type of movie anyway or something that you could watch with your friends.

However, I don't really understand how they figured this would be appealing to audiences outside the United States. The movie has almost nothing to do with the Mayan calendar, though.. There are some vague references and allusions to it, but it's basically about how the rich people of the earth will survive, the Chinese people provide all the manpower and die anyway, and the rest of the world can just die.

Deep Impact, Waterworld, The day after tomorrow, Independence day (without the aliens), and Knowing. All of these movies combined equals 2012. This movie was pretty much eye candy. The special effects were some of the best and it's hard to take in the whole movie because everything happens so fast and I bet when it comes on DVD when you freeze a frame the picture will speak a thousand words.

It brings to life the foretelling around the 2012 events predicted to end the world-----------------The massive volcano, the Tsunami, the earthquakes, shifting of the earth are all here...----------------- So yes, the hero is able to dive from the volcano eruptions, dive into water where there is sheer death, help fly a plane, save the last ship on this earth etc etc... but that is what makes it fun...

Of course it would have needed a different script, and plot...and director. By the end of it I was numb. But hey, what other film in recent memory allows you to see giraffes being moved via helicopter across the Himalayas? None, you say? There's probably a reason for that. Good grief! And the poor actors. They'll be tarnished forever by this turkey. I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch another John Cusack film again without thinking of how low he sank in this disaster of a disaster movie. *sigh*",2012
725,JACK-296,Irwin Allen Where are you?,2,16 November 2009,"I have been a fan of disaster movies since I first saw ""The Poseidon Adventure"" on television when I was five years old. I love everything about them, the great music, the terrific effects, the gathering of actors who you get to see meet their demise in very cool ways. What happened to all of that? Today's disaster movies are just terrible.2012 is no exception. Cool effects but you never really feel that anyone is in any type of danger. The characters are cardboard, the plot thin, far too many comedic moments. If I want to see a comedy I will go see a comedy not a disaster film. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" had lighthearted moments in it but you never felt as though the situation they were in was nothing but grave.Roland Emmerich should sit down and watch a few of the late, great Irwin Allen's disaster films such as ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and the incredibly awesome ""The Towering Inferno."" Note to Hollywood, go back to making movies and not video games.",2012

But the story is the same as in many other disaster movie. A standard story about a family who tries to escape from the many disasters which happens in this film. But if you look beyond that story you have a great 2 and a half hours in the cinema. With great action sequences. the escape from Los Angeles in very good. If the ending was a little bit different, (WATCH OUT SPOILERS!!!!), they talk about the end of the world. Please let it be the end of the world. Instead of saving a handful of people. Please destroy the world if you say so. But if you want a great movie, go and see this. You won't get disappointed, only if you think about the many coincidences. Greetz from Holland",2012

This had me sitting on the edge of my seat for half of the movie, and I think I found my 82 year old mother huddling under the chair. It's full of action, disasters, and I don't think appropriate for young audiences, because a lot would have to be explained to them. But if this is what the earth will become when the end of the world comes, I don't want to be here. Watch it, it's a good movie!! One of the best disaster movies I've seen in a long time.

Apparently yes!,4,2 January 2010,"I have to admit I was quite curious to see this film after having met a lot of people who had been impressed by it. Now, I feel as if I had wasted 2 and a half hours of my life trying to stay awake. I'm not going to say that this is the worst movie in history, not at all, it's just that the only thing through which this movie stands out are the special effects used and there sure is a lot of them throughout the movie. However, its predictability and clichés, as well as all the ""far out"" effects of driving through a collapsing building and dodging falling skyscrapers in an airplane make it really boring. At least ""Independence Day"" had some really funny parts. I really had the feeling that the producers want to compensate all the weaknesses by using more and more special effects. And from their point of view it worked, considering that it was such a big hit. Their recipe for success: take one obscure prophecy about the end of the world, wrap it up in special effects and don't worry about the rest. Anyway, this movie could probably be an entertaining and intense experience provided that you leave your brain at home before going to see it. Personally, I forgot to do that.",2012

Well, I'm not exactly a big fan of Roland Emmerich's past films, (Independence Day was the most overrated piece of crap I've ever seen), but I was really impressed with his latest work, 2012, about the apocalypse according to the Mayian calender on that year,(obviously!) The story was believable, the effects were astonishing, and the acting, for the most part, was pretty good(not exactly Roland's strongest suit in making his movies). It had a good cast too. My favorite was Woody Harrelson's character, as some crazed, intelligent conspirasists hillbilly that meets John Cusacks character halfway through the movie, warning him about... u know. Speaking of which, I only gave it an 8 outta 10, because I mentioned the acting was PRETTY GOOD(pretty being the key word) it wasn't the greatest, and some parts of the acing in the movie were a little unbelievable. Plus, Idk if John Cusak is the strongest leading actor. Although he did decent, I thought they could've got someone better. Bottom line though, I think this is possibly Roland's best work to date(yes, a tip of the hat to u Roland). A solid movie that definitely, in the end of the day, makes u wonder...",2012

If you are a fan of that movie like I do, you also definitely can't wait to watch it. Although the sooner was better scripted and structured, the later has powerful CGI. What is so good about 2012 is the breath taking moments. Some may not enjoy them since they are also too unrealistic. However, I find the best advantage in the accurate blend of humor into breath-take that feels like a pleasant relief. The major disadvantage is the great distance between the movie budget and it's scripting and plotting efforts. The end seems to be missing some cool expected scenes. I rate it with 8 since I am a fan of this type of movies. Perhaps it would have been a 6 if I were not.",2012

I had to sit in the second row, because the entire theater was packed. I knew from the beginning that it would be good.When the movie started, it did go a little slow at certain times. That was only in the beginning though. They still added suspense to make you wonder what was going on, since they didn't reveal what was happening until a little bit later. Once the world starts coming to an end sooner than expected, an author tries to save his family from being a part of this tragedy. It's filled with suspense, terror, and draws you in. I looked around the theater and everyone's eyes were glued to the screen. It was intense, and if you truly believe this is going to happen, even frightening. There are parts that really tug at your emotions, and parts that take you by surprise.Even though 2 of the main stars in this movie are young, they did an outstanding job. Everyone in this movie did an outstanding job. It didn't even seem scripted. The actors definitely helped make this movie what it was, because they made it so that you could feel what they were feeling.Overall, I rate this movie a 9/10, because the very beginning had a few slow parts, and the ending...you'll see.Do we have 3 years left or less to live?

In 3 years the Government secretly has been building giants ""Noah's Arks""; they have been prepared to the end of the world without letting us know it.Short review: 2012 have comic, drama, rolling giant donuts and best of all, spectacular visual effects that totally blows your mind.

I went in with my best friend to watch it, and I walked out of the movie theater very satisfied with the experience. Emmerich is a great director and writer. Special effects were awesome, John Cusack performance was very believable. All the children were amazing. However, Amanda Peet's performance was terrible. It was so fake. And although Thandie Newton is an amazing actress, her role here was redundant. The movie is over 2 hours long, but the time went by pretty fast, it has non-stop action scenes, and emotional moments at time. This movie is not based in history, it is not a documentary, it is created to entertain, so don't expect to learn anything new. Just enjoy the ride, it's worth the time.",2012

There's nothing we haven't seen before a thousand times, usually from the same director. Of course one needs to suspend reality constantly throughout the film and aren't we oh so bored with that?

This movie, with all the resources that were available, could have the movie of the year, decade. It could have been iconic, but it seems that the producers and director, only wanted an average movie with some supreme effects.The movie is being killed by the silly funny remarks at some points, come on guys billions are dying and you are joking? Also, the unnecessary romance, guys you cannot guarantee your life for the next five minutes and you are flirting with the woman??!!! Watching this movie can never make you feel it realistic, only because 2012 fails to read the correct reaction of the human nature in similar situations. furthermore, killing the characters when their part for saving the family (main focus of the plot)finish, example, you drove our plan and reach us here, thank you, you can die!!! and eventually saving the marriage, who cares??? the world is ending buddy!!! Finally, the movie can only touch you visually, and when the movie finish, the effect is gone. Will you enjoy it, probably yes. Will it touch you in the core? probably no.It is disappointing how they can convert a potential masterpiece movie into an average box office hit movie. I am disappointed...",2012

I love disaster movies, liked Independence day but god, this was terrible. Boring, cliché ridden, insulting, overblown, did I mention boring? None of the characters were of any interest to me (ooh, a divorced dad whose kids have no respect for him, never seen that before). But what really made me angry was the way the movie constantly insulted the audiences intelligence, eg. the endless near miss escapes where an old camper van can outrun a superheated cloud of ash and fireballs, a light aircraft can be engulfed by the same ash cloud and emerge unscathed, and of course the biggest and heaviest cargo plane in the world, loaded with 10 or so cars, can dive nose down into a hole at the end of the runway and still have enough lift to safely make it out, weaving between collapsing buildings like it was a bird. (Sorry, but that last scene really got to me). Add dozens more improbable moments like these, and of course that nausea inducing we must retain our humanity speech near the end, and you have one BAD movie.

And escaping from volcano by running (Not whole time running but how is that possible even Flash could have some trouble at that situation). At one scene ground is collapsing under their little plane, but (i really DON'T know why) their plane never got affect from this kind of situation. The little plane should be pulled down. They are finding a plane which has got cars in it. And like second Indiana Jones movie they are escaping from plane by using one of the cars.( you will understand me after watching this movie) ( and this scene really reminded me the second Indiana Jones movie.

742,ImASmurf,It's just boring...,3,23 January 2010,"Don't get me wrong, I knew what to expect (not that it would be boring though), but after hearing a few good things about it from friends, I must say I was disappointed.First of all, the only thing 2012 has in common with the Mayan prophecy is...well, the year they predicted it would happen. Nothing is really explained about why they predicted it. I don't know, since 2012 is in two years it could have been interesting to know a little more.But anyway, like somebody else said in another review on IMDb, 2012 makes the end of the world look simply boring. The movie lost my attention half-way through to a point where I just didn't care what happened anymore. And why would I, everything is so predictable it becomes pointless to watch. Here's a list of things that made me hate this movie: -The complete un-originality. Why do end-of-the-world movies always have to feature the same kind of characters? It's always some random dude, divorced with 2 kids, who then, thanks to the end of the world, finds new love with his ex-wife and saves the world. *yawn*-That re-united family then always survives the most impossible things. It's OK to survive like one big event, but they keep surviving everything without a scratch. Even Chuck Norris wouldn't be able to do that. *yawn* -The useless biblical references, like, G, Noah's Arch. Whatever. *yawn* -The CGI effects: at the very beginning when California goes down, it looks like c r a p. Sorry but the part with the limousine chase...The Day After Tomorrow looked way better (and was a better movie) :*yawn* -The stupid happy ending. Basically the entire planet exploded and it lasts only 2 days. Then suddenly the sun shines and everything's like nothing happened (except Africa is where the US used to stand and now it's humanity's new home). I know it's not a realistic movie, but come on! I'm sorry to say this, but for once, if everybody could die in a movie, it would actually be nice for a change (sorry if I offended anyone). Anyway, *yawn*, again.The parts I liked best where the ones with Woody Harelson. I guess I really lost interest once he died. Too bad.I could go on and on. What do you want me to say, it's just dull, even if it's the kind of entertainment you know you must put your brain to sleep. If you've got nothing better to do, give it a shot if you can stand almost 3 hours of boredom and stuff you've already seen anyway. Else, go watch The Day After Tomorrow again, it's shorter and better.",2012

Evading a stream of bullets from several opposing forces and escaping unscathed....hmmmm ""believable"".This movie however, this seemed to be on a more frequent basis and a grander scale. John Cusack and co. tend to have extrapolated any luck from the less fortunate and placed it upon themselves so they can survive any number of over the top scenarios in which death is seen as 100% certain.I don't understand how people on here can call this entertaining unless you have the IQ of a pencil. It's one of those movies which would make the director a bit of cash only, I don't believe any thought was gone into it and it really was a waste of my time.Anyway, to summarise Terrible acting, terrible effects (relatively speaking) and an unbelievable chain of luck.

In Ecuador sold out in all cinemas the first 4 days, everyone talks a lot of this movie, some good and bad things a heard about this movie. Predictable story but you get what you pay for, great special effects, I did not like john cusack for this part The movie have great emotional moments.

Later the same person who flew the little plane has suddenly gained the experience to fly a cargo plane with only a pilot across the world...

747,Deezydog,Taken too seriously,7,4 November 2010,"I think people take a movie like this entirely too seriously. We all know what we're going to see here. People criticize the film, with respect to it's execution, like it's an Oscar quality film when we all well know that this is a blockbuster movie made for summer audiences to enjoy in the masses and with their families. It's not a family film per see, but the is not The Godfather, nor was it ever intended to be such a film. The major draw of the film is the subject matter; how that relates to the religious predictions and media spawned fear of the end of all time. It makes for an entertaining subject matter because it creates a buzz in our general culture that is all too familiar, with respect to previous predictions of disaster. I.E. Y2K, etc. I find that the deeper meaning is that it is a pivotal way in which we, as members of society can be driven away from some of the urgent matters that effect our society and our world. It is a distraction from what's actually going on.Obviously a lot of money went into this film and was mostly spent on visual effects. How is that different from any other Roland Emmerich films? Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla, and 10,000 B.C. were all tent pole movies with large visual effects budgets. Is it all so different than Michael Bay?The only main problem I had with the movie was the character dichotomy of Jackson Curtis and Kate Curtis. So she leaves him for a doctor because he's a failed writer and then comes back to him when he saves the day. How conditional is that? What kind of message does that send?",2012
748,heliwolfhodge,Great disaster movie!,9,6 May 2010,"I had big expectations for this movie after all of the advertising and hype. I must say that the movie lived up to my expectations!What's good: I've heard a lot of people say that the special effects are the only good part of this movie. Although it is true that the special effects are what makes this movie, there is a lot more to it. The story is obviously based on the end of the word, but there are subplots too. It doesn't get too technical either. At one point I think they mention Boson particles, which to most people means absolutely nothing, but it's enough to lend a little bit of nerd-ish-ness to the explanation of why the world is going to pot.What's bad: Yes, as I have heard lots of times before, some of the near-death escapes are a little absurd. It also became apparent to me during the movie that, curiously enough, all the massive destruction has no effect on airport runways! Numerous times the heroes take off in their plane while the world crumbles. All I have to say to that is this: it's a disaster movie, it's not going to be realistic. If it was realistic all of the main characters would have been killed off in the beginning and the movie would have been very boring! Another thing that bothers me is the whole gate-stopping thing at the end. How does an electrical cord manage to seize up a two foot wide gear that raises a gigantic door. I mean, seriously, that door must weigh 50 tons and the mechanism that raises it can't tear a cord an inch wide?!?!?Besides the often-occurring absurd escape, and the occasional lack of mechanical advantage, I found 2012 to be a very satisfying movie. The director managed to get across the 'moral of the story' about compassion, unconditional love, and other wussy things without making it too cheesy. Overall a good movie, and worth a second watch.",2012
749,xxjennyfajaxx,When Prophecy Fails... Again.,4,20 December 2010,"Ever since Festinger created the term 'Cognitive Dissonance' after a religious cult believed the World would end on 21st December 1954, very little has changed: There were idiotic people then who believed the World would end then and there are idiotic people now who stupidly believe that the World will end on 21st December 2012. Now, don't get me wrong, the action and the special effects were astounding but the moral message behind the film was completely uncalled for. That's right. The message that we will all die a horrible death on the 21st of December 2012 lingers about for around 158 minutes in this lame excuse for a film, and I'm actually surprised to see how many people have fallen for this prediction. Now, that's not to say that you're an idiot if you are easily influenced by messages such as these. I can at the very least admit that I felt quite wary at first when I heard all about the Mayan prophecies but it came to a point where a group (*ahem*- CULT -*ahem*) promised us that aliens would visit our planet, that's where I stopped believing in this prediction. If only others would follow my example: NASA have actually received emails from teenagers who are questioning what will happen in 2012, and are even considering suicide as not to witness the end of the World. Honestly, when will people learn? Emmerich, your disaster movies are eye-boggling but is it really necessary to question our moral standards? To questions our sanity levels? It really is ethnically wrong that you are forcing these young people to believe that we will all die on this particular day, whilst you make a profit. All I want to say is if you believe in this prediction then why not believe in fairies or unicorns? Pardon my sarcastic laugh - lol. If you want to believe this prediction and waste your time planning your travelling to many continents of the World as the characters did in the movie, then be my guest.

The special effects not only gave a highly realistic sensation, they provided beautiful images, which the viewer will not soon forget. The action scenes were thrilling, elegant and creative.However, the film was too long and tended to play itself out after the first half. The second part of the movie showed the survivors trying to fix a malfunction in one of the arcs that were supposed to shelter them from the earthquakes. This part proved to be long, tedious, predictable and quite unrealistic. The idea that the main character – a limousine driver and failing novelist – could somehow become a humanity saving hero with almost supernatural powers (illustrated by the under-water scene) – is highly unbelievable and tends to put a dent in the whole movie experience.The movie also tried to convey a social and moral lesson: we were supposed to understand that moral issues should be put into politics, and not merely cold calculations, even if it means carrying on greater risks and sacrifices. That to was quite unrealistic: our world leaders hardly acknowledge moral considerations in peaceful times. Why would they start doing so when their own survival is at stake?",2012

Yeah, we're all gonna be swept by a tsunami in less than 10 minutes but NOW's the best time to talk about humanity. Yeah, we all payed a billion dollars to get onto one of the Arks but sure, let's open them and let those poor bastards in, because once we stop caring about our fellow humans, that's the moment when we lose our humanity.

754,ChrEberle,Weirdly entertaining (contains spoilers),8,18 September 2014,"Very often, movie reviews or threads start with apologetic sentences like: ""...I also enjoy artsy movies from Stanley Kubrick and totally unknown, independent flicks from Europe."" Yes, indeed, me too. So, is it a guilty pleasure to like this movie? Well, no! To put it as simple as it can be: ""2012"" entertained me. Me. I don't care, if millions of others did not feel entertained. The thing is: I enjoy movies that are well made and so over the top cliché that they cannot be taken serious. Or movies that just parody movies like ""2012"" Indeed, Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to do a shot-for-shot parody- puppet version of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" before they decided to do ""Team America"" - which tells a lot about the ""quality"" of Emmerich movies - they transcend the catastrophe genre. At the same time I have to say that I also enjoy it because of this really basic, almost archaic ""Apocalypse Wow"" trope. Yes, sure, the characters may be cheesy and cliché as heck. The whole movie is one big cliché. For me, such movies - also movies like ""Armageddon"" - play in a certain parallel universe where the U.S.A. are the really good guys, where the president is a good guy, where the government is a ""good guy"" (even if they have to kill people off to keep the biggest secret ever, namely: Building super-arks to save a bunch of chosen people - and billionaires.)In Emmerich movies, our whole, actually very bad way of life - the western way of life, the ""American Way Of Live (TM)"" is a good guy! I was wondering why I love this movie and do not hate it. The simple fact that disgustingly rich and powerful people, that can't contribute at all in this ""brave new world"" lying ahead (politicians, royalty, oil-barons, Russian oligarchs) get saved should me make it hate.But maybe the unspoken, off-screen fact, that they may be saved in the first place - but sail into a new world, where everything that has once been is gone - even the monetary system that made these rich guys pay their tickets (one billion Euros - not dollars - per person!) - so, what good will be a bunch of rich, old farts in a world, where the very first and basic things will be survival, building shelter and finding / growing food? Maybe that makes me like it: 7 billion die - and around 300.000 survive - in three arks. What kind of ""happy end"" is that? There were rumors back in 2009 that there will be a TV-series about the events after ""2012"" - which never happened - and quite sure will never happen... it could only be cheap and boring anyway. Watching this movie in 2014 makes it a bit less thrilling - sadly. I guess it was this subtle wave of ""2012-mania"" ...all this ""it's the end of the world"" frenzy that was building up towards the long awaited year 2012. And then nothing happened! How disappointing. We still live in a world, where a few chosen ones use up the resources and billions live in pure s***, have no clean water and no food, so a bunch of movie-geeks like me can rant about or praise movies like this particular one. It's funny that I write a review about some movie that could only age badly. Everybody knew already back in 2009 that it would. Back in 2009 even the worst ""end of the world movie"" had an aura of suspension and unconscious fear about THE end... now, ""2012"" is just another, old Emmerich product, well not ""just"" - it's entertaining. To me. And that is, what counts. Because let's just take all these really bad rip-offs, these cheaply produced B-Movies with extremely bad-looking CGI and titles like ""2012 - the end of the world disaster"" or ""Independence Daysaster"" - where the only good and entertaining thing is the title. They have usually actors that were maybe famous 20 years ago - or aged porn-stars. And they are just bad - in a bad way. ""2012"" is bad in an amazing way. It's bad in a good way. A very good way. The special effects are amazing. The actors act out the cheesy script in a funny way - heck, the whole movie is one big fun-ride!",2012
755,utkukalkanci,That was the best disaster movie I have ever watched,8,7 January 2019,"The producers clearly tried to use the 2012 hype caused by an interpretation of the Mayan calendar. To be honest I do not think that the characters are portrayed in a sophisticated manner, or the acting is wonderful. Their reactions to the events could be a little bit more genuine and some drama involving human interactions could be added.
But the film is very good at its main subject, which is the natural disaster. The story about the disaster and reactions of institutions are well described. Increase of count of neutrinos overheating the molten core may not receive a high grade in a science project but it is a nice detail for a movie storyline. Visuals and imagery, and engineering feats were also very nice.
In short it is not a movie to see overacting actors and actresses with the aim of getting the academy awards, but a very fine action movie about a natural disaster.",2012
756,Scy_Fy_JunKiE,If you are a fan of the science fiction genre then please read on...,8,17 November 2009,"If you are reading this then you are considering watching this movie. I knew what I was getting into prior to my viewing. In my mind I thought this was just going to be a popcorn movie about the end of the world.But once I saw it I began to understand what the writers or directors or whoever where getting at. If this is the end of the world what would you do to ensure your children survive.Besides the fact that this was the first movie that I ever spent with my hand covering my mouth.... As a moviegoer I can suspend the disbelief of how this ONE man new what to do (because he listened to the nay-sayers) and I spent the entire time watching with my hand either over my mouth or wiping away tears.This movie was meant to be just entertainment, however, it has basis in real fact that the world as we know it may change and we as humans much like the dinosaurs might not be around to see the result.I don't know much about the movie industry but I can say that the last movie that I saw that pulled at my heart strings this much was Deep Impact. Just the idea of putting someone else's life in front of your's made me... stop and think and then be happy. It is the most I can ask for in a movie. Go see it if you want to be entertained. If you are looking to be funny haha amused, then go see something else. Go see it if you want an actual depiction of what will most likely happen to people when the world gets turned upside down. Most realistically you should see it and think... What would I do for the people I love most in this world.That's what I did and the result was more then I could have asked for.",2012
757,ChaseIsPro,The greatest disaster movie of all time!,10,16 November 2009,"Once again the master of disaster Roland Emmerich provides us with a non stop thrill ride, with laughs and drama along the way. I'd say out of all the movies I have seen this year(meaning blockbusters) this would be number 6. Along the ride we have an amazing cast including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson who all give great performances especially in the more dramatic moments. The screenplay written by Roland Emmerich and composer Harold Kloser was very original and great. The scene that sticks out most in my head is when they need to escape California, I was definitely on the edge of my seat.Go see this film!",2012
758,sand_dune,"Not a movie, but demonstration of CGI",1,15 November 2009,"This film has zero cultural value. You can compare it with building a huge sand castle and destroying it violently eventually. Dialogue is pathetic, characters are flat, Amanda Peet too unattractive for a romantic part, virtual camera in close action scenes is terrible (looks like a bad computer game). While watching the movie all you do is waiting for the next demolition scene (which are very saturated). But even there it makes little sense, as nowadays you can see all kinds of demolition in computer games or on Youtube.Rating 1/10, but excellent CGI. Films are not meant to be like this - demonstration of raw computer power and absolute rubbish in every other sense.It is advisable to watch to geeks who don't mind spending 3 hours on purely watching modern computer effects.",2012
759,kyleweis,At least the popcorn was good.,7,25 October 2015,"This was like a weird thing to do watching 'cause it was 18.12.2012 ..Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.This one was still very funny from the beginning, entertaining, didn't have to use brains (i took this as sleeping movie..) somehow i managed to watch this throughout from beginning to end.Funny acting like everyone is ""whoa whoops"" like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more ""serious"" theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so. It does its premises and so .. nothing quite spectacular but yeah worth of watch :) If you take things too seriously or are afraid all the time in theaters don't watch this you miss the humor. Thats for me now, I have a Galaxy to explode.",2012
760,bluf2000,Great special effects and... thats all,2,3 December 2009,"Seeing this movie's trailer, I was eagerly waiting to see it. I wanted so much to see a catastrophe movie, which is not pathetic, extra-patriotic, with self-sacrificing and heroic people. But i have learned once more (TOO many times I am afraid), that if the following is true: (a) disaster movie (b) in USA, then the movie MUST be pathetic, with very strongly heroic self-sacrificing, patriot characters. Of course the good characters prevail, and the bad ones die. Of course the good character saves all, saves mankind, and anyone will listen to him. He makes virtually all that rulers of the world should do. So... lets be objective. Special effects and CGI are great. These made me (from the trailer) go to the cinema to see this movie. And I was in no way disappointed by them, on the contrary. I could say that the first 20% of the movie was somehow OK. But... come on people. I am a Sci-Fi fan, I understand that the movie has fantastic premises.... but this must not influence character actions and development. They have to be Realistic. We are not watching cartoons here. So these are a few of the stuff that actually ruined the movie, and made me hate it. * US president who refuses to save himself, remaining on the collapsing earth, and being killed by the disaster while he was nursing wounded people (ohhhhh my god, its so gross) * new superman character John Cusack. He can escape from a van which, while he is inside, falls into a lava crevasse. * bad reach Russian guy dies in the end very stupid, while the good poor guys escape. All of them. Oh, and BTW, Russian guy's children escape also (although they were also reach, but we cant kill kids in a patriotic, altruist movie, can we ?) * after one hour of flight lessons, a common plastic surgeon flies planes much better than Schumacher drives formula 1 cars * an altruist patriotic scientist can convince all state presidents to be good. And to cooperate. * the dentist (sorry, plastic surgeon) must die, because John Cusack must return to his ex-wife (who in the while was married to the dentist. No, the surgeon. Silicon surgeon.). We cant let superman alone, can we ? * by the way, John Cusack can also repair billion dollar hydraulic mechanisms (below the watter) which were broken very easily (suspect, isn't it ?) and easy to fix (for John Cusack. Superman.) Well.... these are only a few things that actually killed me while seeing this movie. They literally ruined a film which could have been exceptional otherwise.I give it 2 of 10 (I was mad writing this article:)).",2012
761,p_parker44,"Cheesy, Clichés galore, just awful",3,21 March 2010,"OK, this is my first review on IMDb but I felt I just had to leave one for this movie. I knew it was always going to be a bit cheesy having seen the trailer and coming from Roland Emmerich we sort of know what to expect but what I didn't expect was the sort of cheap script that came along for the ride. The movie is full of silly lines, every cliché that you can possibly imagine and more! I didn't mind 'The Day after Tomorrow' but this is a step backwards. The effects are good but after a while you just think 'yeah OK, another building falling over'. The film is probably 1/2 hour too long and the whole Russian billionaire & family is just pointless with some terrible acting. It honestly in parts is embarrassing and you feel sorry for the likes of Thandie Newton and the stupid character that Woody Harrelson plays.Yes it's quite a ride and it's a movie that's made tongue in cheek (I hope) but just too much all in one go. Very, very disappointing.",2012
762,luisfelipe8395,Plot's sucked. Effects hasn't.,6,17 November 2009,"Well, yes, this is a bit worth watching (because of the effects, I must say). Since the tickets aren't expensive, it's not a loss. When I came into the cinema, I had an expectation that the movie would talk more about the 2012 Maya prediction, than any other thing. This wasn't what happened. The movie barely talks about the prediction. You can't make a comparison between the Maya prophecy and the movie, except for the year it occurs. I was a bit disappointed, because I thought it was going to be a fiction movie, but based on true facts. For my sadness, it wasn't. They could call this movie ""The Day After Tomorrow: 2 - the remake"".Despite of visual and good effects (that's why I gave 6 out of 10), the history is totally nonsense, is totally waste of time and has nothing to do with the Maya prediction, as I've said before. I was hoping this movie could be the best one, maybe for this decade. A shame it wasn't. Had everything to be a success, and failed, badly.Now talking about the plot, totally disposable. In the first minutes, I really enjoyed in, specially in India, when they've discovered that the world would ruin. As of this moment, the writers got lost in the plot, trying to juggle a sci-fi and a family story, always having the American ""dad superhero"" that does everything in the right way, saving the world. Fortunately we still had a few nice things that make you think, such as in the end, when everybody move to Africa. When would someone move to Africa nowadays? It's shown that we may need them in the future, and this was well done. The rest of the plot sucked, unfortunately.Even though that sucked, I can't say the same about the effects. This was the best part of the movie for sure. When the White House fell down, it was the beginning of a new era. When California was swallowed by the ocean, you could see the world changing. And at least, it had substance. That was happening because of San Andreas Fault; a shame they didn't mix everything they showed in the movie with Maya prediction, that was unused in the movie.6/10. Not the best movie I've seen so far. Seems media is exaggerating again -- talking about the expectations about the movie.",2012
763,moush,War of the Worlds meets The Day After Tomorrow!,2,28 November 2009,"Without the aliens, of course. I guess I don't need to explain why I think the movie is similar to The Day After tomorrow (Hell, its even by the same director). But, why War of the Worlds? The whole concept of a family trying to escape the doom and destruction and get aboard a ship that will save humanity. Sound Familiar? Overall, the movie is laden with a lot of visual effects. Too many I think but overall not bad. Now, if you consider the physics of it, that's a whole other story. I don't think even half of those spectacular shots that are shown would happen that way in reality.Story wise, I felt it was too weak. I just couldn't feel for the characters or anyone for that matter. I mean c'mon, humanity was about to end and I couldn't sympathize with any humans. Its mainly because the movie just didn't give enough time to develop any characters. Most of the movie is just special effects. But, there is also another reason why I couldn't sympathize. And that is due to the inherent story itself where all these important people and the protagonist's family are trying to get to this ship while millions of people out there die. They only start showing some sympathy towards the end, and that too, to those people who were chosen to be on the ship but for some reason couldn't. What about the millions who died and who were never even given a chance to save themselves? And the end...Oh the water's receding, the tsunamis weren't as bad as we thought, Africa seems to have risen. How convenient! Just living on their arcs, sailing away around the earth hoping for things to get better would have been a realistic ending for this movie. But, then again, how realistic was the movie anyway!",2012
764,sfarless,Don't know what to say.....,2,21 January 2011,"I am normally an easy reviewer but: 2012 is huge waste of time; How can anyone blow such a great plot idea! I'm going to send the studio a bill for my time watching it! Great actors but bad acting, a lame story line, forced attempts at humor with characters presenting a labile enough affect to INSIST on the extinction of the human race! that's right, at times I found myself actually pulling for the disaster win! Special effects are good, but watching your toddler play a Barney the Dinosaur video game will do the same for you. Save the dollar that you're planning on feeding the Red Box. If you're tempted to watch this movie, do yourself a favor; phone that neighbor that you don't like and ask to watch one of their vacation videos instead. I will give everyone involved another chance, but I'll never forget the night I watched this movie.Apparently I need to submit more lines of text for this review to qualify for posting. So let me say that I'm jacking up my bill to the studio for this additional typing (what more will this movie take from me!).

767,zanderjusthere,This movie is so exhausting.,3,20 March 2020,"This movie is shallow, especially for how long it is. The character are all paper thin. There are more than 10 characters integral to the plot. There is so much going on in this film that your mind becomes a puddle of mush by the end. There are some characters who are enjoyable, if shallow, and the movie really sells the idea and feeling that the world is ending. But that is about it. The cinematography is also pretty bland and unimpressive, the generic late 2000s early 2010s thriller kind of cinematography. Will the special effects are good, the visuals level out to 'bland' overall. The acting is serviceable, nothing special, just enough to not take you out of the film while also not sucking you in.The movie feels like it doesn't saying anything interesting or meaningful at all. The main ones seem to be humanity needs to stick together to survive, and the indomitable will of the human race. But those are pretty standard themes with action/thrillers like this. And this movie doesn't go out of its way to do anything interesting with that theme.The third act is just lousy with killing of minor characters who aren't needed any more and then just kills them off to give the audience some sort of emotional reaction, failing to do so effectively making it feel exploitative. It also only kills of the few characters who are even remotely enjoyable. It also gives off the feeling of the plot being extraneous. Overall the plot just feels like at the base level if the government just got everyone in the entire world involved then so many people wouldn't have to die. And the movie doesn't offer anything that is satisfactory that makes it feel natural. Either thematic or plot wise.At the end of the day the movie just feels like nothing.",2012

Acting was fairly OK, but the whole action was leading me to hope for the lives of the main characters. As i watched the movie for a second time (aired on local TV) i realized that viewers (or, at least, i) aren't really supposed to care for the millions of lives lost during the destruction of whole cities - at least, as long as the plane of the main characters makes it. Of course, with the exception of the ship sinking. Those being said, i enjoyed the movie but i feel that the director should have obtained a bit more drama out of - hell - the end of the world. The matter of the dysfunctional family seamed more taken into consideration than the near extinction thing.",2012

770,JDuu,Odd tale of morality,1,6 August 2020,"Spoilers (obviously) - so we all know the premise of the movie (natural disaster destroys the Earth etc), however this genre also usually contains a social commentary, i.e. despite adversity, humanity is ultimately able to overcome the challenge it faces by pulling together/discovering an innovative solution, and essentially becoming more as a species than just the sum of our parts.In ""2012"" the opposite happens. Instead of ""saving humanity"", shady government officials create secret ""arcs"" using expendable foreign labour, financed by private-sector billionaires, who in return get a coveted ticket on board.Once the disaster strikes, humanity is destroyed (to comic effect in some scenes, seeing a pair of elderly women drivers plunge to their deaths - hilarious!), we also see Indian refugees drowned, chinese workers abandoned etc, while Arabic sheiks and Russian oligarchs scramble to safety on their paid-for arcs.The final insult is that once the devastation subsides, the arcs plot a course to settle the Cape of Africa, which we infer has been decimated from the floods. So presumably that leaves a new generation of billionaires to re-populate the planet, who are obviously more special/deserving than the peasants (who are now all dead).I almost feel like RE was trolling the audience/producers, by making a subtle swipe at capitalism, but whether this is intentional I can't be sure. Certainly leaves a bitter aftertaste.",2012

I almost yelled out several times at parts that were so embarrassingly awful, in the hope that perhaps I was dreaming the dreadfulness of the experience. Things like ""Airplanes just can't fly like that"" and ""stretch limos cannot fly"" and ""please please just stay under the water and get jammed in then ark gears and put us all out of our misery"" ....oh the nightmare of it all.....Do not buy a copy, do not rent a copy....if you MUST watch it, ensure no effort to get it has taken place, as you will regret it.

It soon became apparent that this, to me, was nothing short of a full blown comedy. Again, and so often with movies nowadays, you leave the cinema wondering 'why?' This could have been so very much better, a great story let down by every cliché possible to pack into a movie. Regardless, it was still enjoyable, you just have to realize that at the point of 'beyond belief' there is a point where the audience will not accept being taken for that much of a fool. This flick didn't have to slap me in the face, I was already doing that to myself throughout. It was laugh out loud hilarious, yet still mesmerizing. John Cusack, the standout performance. A remarkable actor who never flinched once under the circumstances. The rest of the cast were stock standard, supplying the predictability with undeniable precision.I'm also wondering if this film was made to set the new record for goofs in one movie. People are going to have a field trip with this one. I gave it eight as I have not laughed so much when things were so serious, and that in itself is a movie genre! Enjoy this one.",2012

Second, the anchor characters of the movie fail to connect with the audience as a result, you are not with them during when they so many disasters strike them from all corners CG is spectacular, but, almost always you feel you are seeing a rendered image and not an cleverly choreographed sequence say like Ronin, or Die Hard 4 etc CGs in Godzilla or KingKong 2008 or entire Jurassic park were better and it had some human element in it. Here, you have a rag-tag family, as usual woman lives in with the other man. A boy and girl goes with the father on a camp , Voila, they discover the ultimate truth and brave all odds to live and stay united when some billions are wiped clean on earth. Shallow!! You almost want the members of the family to die for their nonchalance exhibited during the crisis!!

What was disappointing was that the storyline and character development were pretty weak. The Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson roles were good, but not sufficiently integral to the story to make them worthwhile. A nice romantic scene is good in a movie but not when, with only minutes to save the day, the hero pauses to make out with his ex-wife. This occurred just minutes after she learned her boyfriend had been killed. The ending was kind of a letdown considering that all the heroics were just to save the world's billionaires. Overall, while enjoyable, 2012 is nowhere near as good as Independence Day by the same director.",2012
776,dale-carol-m,Hold onto your seat its going to be a bumpy ride!!!,9,11 November 2009,"I am a great lover of disaster movies and until now thought that this generations brand of disaster movie didn't hold a candle to the 1970/Irwin Allen run of them - Posiedon Adventure/Earthquake/Towering Inferno. Sure there had been a few that were not bad, independence day/the day after tomorrow/ Armageddon but nothing earth shattering... Boy am I eating my words. This movie was in my opinion, the Best disaster movie I have ever seen. I give it a 9.5/10. I would have given it a 10 if Chiwetel Ejiofor had of punched Oliver Platt! Boy did he deserve it!! With a fantastic cast, including Danny Glover, John Cusack - who incidentally was awesome in this role, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson playing Charlie Frost, end of the world radio announcer and totally nuts, and h plays him so well, and someone I had never heard of before, Chiwetel Ejiofor, who played the major scientist of the piece. Not to forget the rest of the awesome cast, each of them adding to the layers of the storytelling. The movie was kept rolling along by telling the stories of several independent characters all facing the end of the world as we know it. The graphics were by far the best character of the movie and if you saw the trailer you would get just a hint of how exciting it is. I sat down at the start and said to my mom that if what we had seen in the trailer was all we were going to get when it came to excitement i would be very disappointed. Well I all the excitement I could handle.... and more! The story spent the first hour setting the premise for the film.... the world was ending... and the last hour and a half was spent holding on to my seat, squealing, ducking and weaving in the times of action, crying at the more poignant moments, getting angry at others, as we followed the stories of the characters. I think this movies stirred up just about every type of emotion. It was awesome. I have no doubt i will go see it again. Do yourself a favor and watch it on the big screen! Don't waste your time waiting for video, or watching it on the small screen. This Has to be seen on the big screen, with the big sound. It adds to the movies hugeness as much as everything else. I would not be surprised if we don't see some awards for the special effects for this movie.

What I hadn't expected was the way the CGI gripped me. This film has the best CGI I've ever come across. All in all it was a pretty intense experience, (almost) all 2h 45min of it. Of course, towards the end you know how it'll wind up and are really just waiting for them to get it over with. Too many emotional scenes where, amidst general destruction, the ""characters"" find time to pause and exchange sobbing and heart-felt banalities to each other. Then again, it is an American film, even if the director is German. My biggest GRIPE is with the fact that the studio (like many other studios) finds the need to post fake reviews on IMDb praising the director, the ""character development"" and so on. Come on guys.

The special effects are beautiful and nicely made. However, I think the story and the movie overall is a disaster. The topic is a worn-out one: end of the world, and this movie does not add any new bright ideas to the picture. First of all, they mix three different beliefs coming from different religions and present it as an end time scenario. Well, we have the apocalypse as presented by the book of revelation when Christ and his army defeat the anti-Christ in Armageddon. Then, we have Noah's arch which has happened in the past, so it won't have anything to do with 2012. Yet, the scenario presented resembles this story the most. And, lastly there is a Maya prediction of worlds end according to their calendar. All these three stories are mixed in a very shallow and artificial way in order to justify all the special effects. I do not like John Cusacks play and rule at all. First of all, the only thing that he thinks about is saving his ex-wife and kid while billions of people on earth are dying. My first question is: Is he a hero at all? Secondly, even if he is successful in saving his family, what is it worth? life of these couple of people compared to all those billions lost. Also, I don't like the way they treat queen Elizabeth compared to US president. Well, US president sacrifices his life for his people and refuses to ride the Noah's arch into safety while he knows that most of his country men will be killed. However, we see queen Elizabeth going to the arch with his dogs! which means they worth more then humans for her. Well, I am not sure queen Elizabeth is so mean in reality. Besides, I doubt that Obama would be so noble as to sacrifice his life like that. Anyways, lets not be so fussy over political details.There are two moments in the movie however that I liked. The first one is when the Russian billioner sacrifices his own life for his daughter. Throughout the movie, you get the feeling he is mostly concerned with his own life and neither his daughters nor his girlfriend are of primary concern to him. He seems to keep them around as sort of company. While he seems to be an antagonist, he willingly sacrifices his life for his daughters near the end which was sort of nice. The second scene that I liked is the Russian billioners girlfriend love towards her dog. She really loves the creature and sacrifices her life for him twice. The second time, she clearly does not survive. While she is not a main character, the affection she shows towards her dog is impressive. The dog does survive thanks to the lady's sacrifice. To sum up, I suggest you avoid this movie and save two hours of your precious time.",2012
779,annorgnl,2012 is a bomb,1,28 November 2009,"I love movies. I appreciate actors who take the time to perfect their craft, directors and producers who look for the perfect ensemble to tell a story enhanced by effective effects, sets, costumes and what-not. I say that so people will understand the level of disappointment in 2012.The special effects, writing, and editing are sub-par for the professionals in this film. Danny Glover! Amanda Peet! John Cusack! How can you have a bad film?!!!!!!! And yet, the director/producer pulled it off somehow. I am a recent fan of John Cusack and enjoy many of his movies on a regular basis (Must Love Dogs, Martian Child, etc) but this is one I hope never to see again. Have you seen Martian Child? Listen and you will hear Cusacks' David Gordon lines said by his Jackson Curtis character ... how does that happen?! Save your money, re-watch MARTIAN CHILD if you want to see a movie with John Cusack and Amanda Peet. If you don't want to see them, watch anything else ... a video-taped tooth extraction would be easier and more interesting to watch.",2012
780,dilbharadwaj,Visually brilliant but emotionally handicapped...,6,29 December 2009,"First things first... Before bashing this movie to be utterly ridiculous,know your director... For god sakes this is a disaster movie made by the guy who burned the earth in ID4 and froze it in Day after 2moro. Just expect some of the most awesome CGI ever on screen without thinking too much about physics and logic, then you will enjoy the movie.Plot revolves round the mayan prediction of end of time on Dec 21, 2012. Due to solar flares, neutrinos generated heat the earth core and the crust begins to shift, messing the whole world. It follows the journey of Jackson Curtis, a failed author on a quest to save his family amidst worldwide destruction. Don't dig too much into the plot holes ( in fact they are as huge as movies budget). This movie is meant for CGI, i mean its awesome. The LA ripping apart, yellowstone volcano, Vegas destruction, Tsunami over Himalayas... All these scenes are epic and lotta detail is thrown into each of the frame.The movie is awesome till the last 10 min.. The climax completely ruined it for me.. From the most terrifying worldwide destruction, everything just goes to normal in about 27 days... That completely negates the whole mood of the movie... Also it sends a wrong message( though truthful) that life of only billionaires is valuable... Common man's life means nothing... Also the Indian scientist who figured out all this mess, the person who is responsible for saving human race is left behind and some wealthy lady(with her dogs) is chosen for survival of human race. The movie is full of stereotypes... A good US president, Father having trouble with his son.... i can go on and on....The movie also generated a lotta noise in blogging world for being Atheist and against Christianity. Lets think for a minute people, what do you expect if something like this really happens... The world gets destroyed and St.Peters Basilica and Mecca are left untouched ??? Common... I am a believer in god but i think nature is above everything and nobody can go against nature's fury, not even catholics or muslims or hindus...Among the performances, John Cusack is charming and Amanda Peet has nothing to offer. But Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the scientist Adrian steals the show. This guy is brilliant and is sure to be next Danzel Washington. Danny Glover makes a good President. All other characters are passe...So give this movie a shot... Sit back, enjoy the cool effects of earth getting shattered in all directions... Don't scratch your head over logic...6/10 from me...",2012
781,alikhanrider,2012 Review *contains spoilers*,9,8 November 2009,"I had been invited to my friends house, who took me to a screening of this movie. I was waiting to see it for quite a while. My expectations were good, but the movie was much better than I thought. Here's a movie that deserves to be on the big screen. The CGI is equally comparable to that of Transformers. Great special effects. John Cusack is perfect for the lead role. He's a writer turned limo driver, and tries to save his family from the 2012 phenomenon. He drives through an earthquake, volcano eruption etc. The cinematography is well done.There are some scenes in the movie that are epic and memorable. The script is well done. There is some humour, which is well done. The part where the volcano erupts and Jackson Curtis tries to escape it is great, along with the part where they outrun the earthquake are very well done.Overall, the movie is worth the money. Go watch it when it comes out.",2012
782,shshnk,Just another superhero movie?,3,14 November 2009,"I wonder how can people actually say it was a classic, or the ultimate disaster film. It was the ultimate disaster of a film. I expected to see something believable, something which could connect the Mayan prophecy to reality. Something plausible. But. I am still in shock. It takes a lot of courage for a producer to put in all that money in a no-script movie. But maybe because it is meant to do well at the box-office, keeping in mind the hype which surrounds it. But this is no-where close to art. No visual treat really. All that effort goes in vain. You don't want to watch the whole world die helplessly. There is nothing breathtaking about St. Peter's Cathedral's roof falling on praying priests, who believe in God. What's worse is, the movie used the tag line 'WE WERE WARNED'. Warned of? Makes us believe there is something we can do. We really can't. It is a result of some random cosmic event, and nobody is to blame. But still we all die. And yes i mean we. This movie apart from making you angry, will make you feel so unimportant. Because you know, you are also dying when the whole world is. And you have nothing that you can do. You know there are these group of idiots, who have been selected to go on to the Ark leaving all of humanity behind to die. Including You. It's a terrible feeling trust me. I think the makers should be sued. The Mayan Prophecy and all the hype that surrounds it, makes it such a great plot for a movie. But after this disaster, I am very sure other people won't try their hand at the theme, and thus a potential blockbuster is lost forever. And it doesn't end here. At a certain point of time, I started wondering, whether it is a superhero movie. Who can drive cars with rocks falling (not even one hitting), fly planes below falling buildings, run from a volcano, come out of a crater, do everything superman couldn't and still be unhurt. To conclude I just felt that the writers were again on strike.",2012
783,funwsin,Great disappointment,2,29 November 2009,"The 2012 idea offered a great opportunity to make a true global disaster movie. The plot is imbecile. The characters are black and white. Typical stereotyping. Except for the White House staff. They are, of course, morally pure. The effects are good, but there are very few scenes with actual destruction and hi-tech effects. If the movie were an hour shorter,it would have been better and the story would be more fluent. The personal relationships took most of the suspense out of the movie. The dialogues are idiotic and simply annoying. Nobody in the Universe would talk like those pathetic characters in a global meltdown.The film is full of standard characters. Everything is so predictable. The main characters miraculously survive disasters, land in high mountains and get saved in the last millisecond. 20-30 minutes of superior effects cannot compensate for shallow story and unrealistic characters.",2012

This film is a real stinker.The premise has potential.... end of the world, only a few will survive, continents breaking up, massive tidal waves.... what could possibly go wrong?

Add to that unbelievably bad science - i know that this is a disaster movie, and some poetic licence is allowed, but come on... Microwave Nutrinos!? - and worst of all, the plot....There are holes in this script you could drive a tank through. The script is diabolical. There are moments here where even the Village idiot would say 'er, guys, i think that's a bad idea'. Cringingly bad.In fact, this film is so bad, you couldn't even pay me to Pirate it. It's just that bad.I actually like disaster films. I like being able to turn my brain off and just watch the special effects, but this film has more cheesy dialogue than it does cheesy special effects, and i found myself longing for the next deafening action scene.Worst. film.

Unfortunately for the audience the only thing epic about it was the grandeur of destruction. The movie starts normal, with lots of potential. Then, as it moves on to John Cusack's role Jackson, it becomes some mixture of War of the Worlds and Day after Tomorrow, and Armageddon. Somehow it has become basic principle that the main character in a disaster movie is either divorced, or split up from his girlfriend, and is necessary to find and win this 'true love' blabla back. Furthermore it's the government trying to cover the disaster up, because yeah, that's what governments do: cover things up. It's really a shame that this has to be another one of that kind of movies, because all potential it has flushes down the landfill together with whole continents.What a shame.",2012

787,nickk2,Sure,8,22 November 2009,"2012 is, in my opinion, just what it set out to be, a view on just what could happen if the 2012 Prophecy is correct.2012 is by far the most action intensive movie I've ever seen, practically every minute there are mountains folding in on themselves, cars being thrown into the air, the Earth's crust splitting apart, and so on, but it was entertaining.True, there is almost no historical viewpoint into the Mayan culture or background to the event, besides a brief summary by a news anchor fairly early in the movie giving you a quick lesson on what 2012 is, but that was a choice made by the makers. If they had chosen to go in-depth into the event, it would have bothered action lovers, if they had skipped the history lesson, they would be bothering history nuts. In a movie like this, you can't please everyone.The story is believable which is very important for a movie like this. What they do actually seems like something the world powers would do (the good and bad, each and every detail of the movie) if 2012 were to occur.One thing that can be said about this movie, is the acting was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the small role played for Helmsley's father, he stood out to me.All in all, this movie is a definite see if you enjoy apocalyptic movies (Armageddon, Deep Impact, Day After Tomorrow, Etc.), I'd say it is one of my favorites in the genre, and a genre I very much enjoy.",2012

I have no idea if they have a name for what's wrong with the people who rated this movie poorly, but to me it was the most amazing film I've seen this year. The acting was great, especially with John Cusack. The special effects were really awesome, and the shots that portrayed the disaster scenes really seemed to bring me right into the action. I felt like I was flying through the destruction as it progressed; it was just absolutely incredible. When I first saw the previews to this movie, I already knew I'd enjoy it, and I was right on the money. It was a bit confusing at first, because it seems like you're introduced to two different ""groups"" of main characters (the government/president/rich people group and the family), but as the movie progresses, I realized why it was appropriate to script the movie that way. I'm definitely gonna buy this movie on iTunes when it's released.",2012
789,temporary_fault,Weak over the top and a waste of your time!!,3,18 November 2009,"From the offset this movie fails in a very spectacular way. Agreed that the effects are visually stunning. But it fails to help this film from falling flat on its face. The jokes are somewhat humorous, here and there, but the story line itself is way over the top. The best thing in this movie is Woody Harrelson and unfortunately he is not in it long enough!! And talking about long, this film goes on a bit. I not going to bore you with long comments, cause quite literally the film is not worth it. Its definitely the worst of Emmerich's disaster movies, and is so unrealistic. Take the kids to scare them a bit if you want, in fact that is the mentality of this film to be honest. And yes, yet again its set in the US of A and yet again the Americans are the hero's, Are we not getting bored of Glorification of America and how great Americans all are in movies. Should of taken a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and set it elsewhere as he did with district 9. basically its a big pile of visually stunning cheese, but make of it what you will!!",2012
790,powermikee,This is exactly what I think when I hear the word Hollywood,6,4 December 2009,"The world is falling apart, volcanoes exploding, earthquakes, people dying. Who will be the hero survivor out of it all...John Kuzac. Come on seriously? Yep John Kuzac, pansy ass, wimpy, never speaks up, John Kuzac. Maybe I just don't like the guy. Personally I think Nicholas Cage could have handled this role much better, but to me it just took away from the whole feel of the movie.As far as blockbusters go some people hate them, some love them. I'm a fan, I look forward to the next movie full of CG effects and great action. Independence Day did it well, so did Day After Tomorrow. But 2012 just didn't do it for me. I thought it was badly cast and the acting was not realistic. We're in a plane, barely got away with our lives, the world is falling apart around us...""wow I'm so calm, lets tell a joke"". The story was also too repetitive. How many escape from disaster scenes can you have with John Kuzac...lol...like I said I just don't like the guy.The only thumbs up I can give this film is for the CG. It's got some great effects and looks better than most films. But, too many directors today think that is the solution to making a good movie and that's just not true. Action, CG, a great story, character development, suspense and witty humor, all mixed together perfectly make a great film. 2012 just didn't put it all together. They could have done so much with this story, but instead they turned it into a cliché, exaggerated action flick that bored me. This is the McDonald's version of a movie, processed, unoriginal and like a thousand other films. Watch it only because it's the sort of film that is better at the movies but don't expect too much originality.",2012

Nope have to have two. Both just narrowly avoiding taking off from a crumbling airport and missing falling buildings by flying under them. And who the hell builds airports underground? Because that is exactly where they'd have to be for these plane escapes to be missing these falling skyscrapers. I guess you just felt the need to repeat Jackson Curtis's limo escape, just in the air. I about walked out when the airplane that was supposedly out of fuel, exploded when it crashed. Are you seriously that dense Emmerich? Not only do cars not explode on impact (as Hollywood would have you believe), but jet fuel has a higher flash point than gasoline. Therefore how the hell would an airplane? While your screwing everything up, let's just completely ignore geography and pretend a flight from Las Vegas to China passes directly over Hawaii.

Before I watched this movie I thought ""I like action movies, and destruction movies. Also the cast is decent."" So already I wasn't expecting much but what I got was enough to start a real apocalypse.The movie starts off alright, not great, not even good. In fact it starts out like every other destruction movie ever made. I thought that was fine, there's not many ways to start a movie like this. But come to find out that the entire movie follows the same formula. That formula, if you haven't guessed, is ""what did another apocalypse movie do? Oh okay lets do that."" The fact is, this movie has absolutely nothing new to bring to the table AT ALL. It takes every little trope from every other action movie ever made. There is literally no new content here at all.So after the copy and paste plot, action scenes, and tropes, I start wondering why this movie was ever made. And it is simply to cash in on the popular 2012 theme going on right now and nothing else. This is one of those movies that i'd like to punch the writers in the face for making it. Not only is the entire movie predictable, but it's just stupid. I know John Cusack can act but he doesn't seem to care enough anymore. Probably because he knew how bad this movie was but realized he hasn't been in anything in a while and needed to stay relevant. The ONLY 2 reason this movie doesn't have a perfectly bad score of a 1 is because frankly Netflix exists and the level of awful for movies has been taken to new heights. Secondly I was kind of entertained enough to keep watching even if it was just because I was thinking ""So what trope are they going to use next... oh that one, okay.""

I've watched 2012 several times on DVD and I am always entertained. I don't need to sit and analyze the science or even the dialogue. Yes, I like special effects but I also like survival movies. Sure, the protagonists seem to escape every possible death trap, but what would be the point of killing off these folks along the way. Then you really would have no story. I think that those who fault the movie, especially the plot, have not actually watched it beginning to end. I don't judge it in anyway other than what it sets out to do--entertain--and that it did for me.

Better advice could not be given to you, rest assured!!This is the FIRST film I've ever walked out a cinema from, 40mins before the end no less - the only thing I was grateful for was that I went alone on my day off, meaning I could leave without offending (which I'd find difficult to imagine) a mate or the Mrs. Why did I go?A friend at work told me about this film, saying it was 'worth a watch', the 'chase scenes are fantastic' etc...Effects are great, thats true - the only problem he forgot to tell me of is that a lot of the CGI effects have been reused here from films already been done, and ripped off (EXCEPT the volcano eruption, thats the ONLY CGI scene of originality 'never seen before')...What my workmate also forgot to mention was that the chase scenes (encapsulating the effects) are pretty much the entire film worth watching (in total about 50 mins worth). Those 50mins are sewn together with pointless, irrelevant, and cliché'ingly bad character building and back plots which take into account the other 2 hours of the film! All the characters in the entire film came across as hollow and inept, without distinction or uniquity, mostly because of the script (or lack thereof) that the cast had to work with, but also partly because of the poor choice of cast used. John Cusak maybe a good comedy actor, but frankly thats all he is, all he ever will be, and thats where he should of been left!! Woody Harrelson is the ONLY character which can actually be perceived as a character and not a cliché, and furthermore is the only one that has the passable amount of deliverability and empathy with his character to successfully pull it off...and laughably, he's barely in it.This film reminded me a lot of the 'Quantum of Solace', given the overuse of chase scenes and shockingly bad script writing. In fact, I was starting to think that John Cusack WAS James bond after watching him escape an Earthquake, a Volcanic Eruption, fly through falling buildings repeatedly untouched. I think my early departure mean't I missed out on a few more, but I won't lose sleep over it...Dunno what Roland 'lets destroy everything' Emmerich and Dean 'I'm a div' Devlin where thinking when putting together Cusaks character to be honest(which laughably, I can't even remember the name of!)...You can just imagine their Script/casting development meetings...Roland ""Lets get a character in there who crosses Capt. Chesley Sullenberger III, Lewis Hamilton, and Anakan Skywalker - seeing he must be able to see every crash/near miss before it happens.""Dean ""yahh, cool Roland...cinema goers will rave for that!!! I'll just do the disaster CGI, you handle the character development, thats what you're best at..""Roland ""this is true, cheers Dean...we now need a really good & convincing actor to pull it off - who shall we use??? Bruce Willis?? Matt Damon? nahh, not good enough for THIS movie.....I KNOW!! THATS IT!!!! we'll use JOHN CUSAK!!! sign him up Dean, now please...""Dean ""for an audition?""Roland ""nah, no need cause I thought of it, and for that reason It'll work - just sign him up, pay him whatever he wants..."".-----------Its really not funny, I know. Especially having wasted money and an afternoon to see the final result...----------------Final Conclusion in Summary.If you want to see mayhem, destruction, and see 10 or so watchable CGI sequences(if somewhat reused/ripped off)which have been sparsed out inbetween unnecessary dialogue and inept character building lasting almost 3 hours, then go see it. Frankly, after 2 hours I simply couldn't be bothered to watch anymore, if you can, then credit to your patience...However, for the vast majority of you I can save your time and money from my mistake to tell you that you're far better off saving the £8.50 on a ticket, and invest your time by watching/or doing something else - at least until this comes to your TV set for free on Terestial in a couple of years...Do yourself a favour - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!",2012
807,s_suiker,movie of the year,9,30 December 2009,"Ever wondered what the end of the world would look like? i know Roland Emmerich did. And he really knows how to bring his ideas to the big screen! the movie starts up slowly, explaining something about the heating up of the earth's core and introducing John Cusack as a not very successful writer and not very successful family man. Then events start to unfold and he has to rise up to the challenge and save his family. This movie picks up speed and never loses momentum. The only downside was the lenght of this movie. after 2,5 hours it's time to wrap things up, but this movie goes on just a bit too long. Still, this is the most impressing movie of 2009, which was a great year for movies.",2012

809,greerg2004,"This movie was so bad, I couldn't wait for it to end.",3,14 November 2009,"I saw this movie this afternoon with a friend of mine. We were really excited to see it. The special effects were amazing as shown in the previews. That is the extent of my praise. The dialogue was awful. The way the storyline was written was very predictable. If you watch other epic movies such as Independence Day, Armageddon, etc...and come back to this one...there is no comparison. For almost three hours I couldn't wait until ""the world ended."" There were such great actors that the story could have had more depth. I am glad I paid matinée pricing. If you want to see a movie with substance, this isn't the one. After two hours, I could care less about the characters' fate.",2012
810,liannesclan,"This was a great movie, YES to JOHN CUSACK!!!!",9,15 November 2009,"Great Movie!! It too grabbed the emotional aspect of the John Cusack character and to those of the other characters coming to terms with the events taking place. While it was unrealistic that everyone else dies while they make it all the way to China to the arcs.......... it gave me hope to see that they persevered. I think that when all disaster movies come about to see that hope remains and is seen on the Big Screen, it makes hope felt for others as well.Woody Harrelson was funny as heck, Danny Glover is great, Chiwetal Ejiofor was good too!!! and I didn't realize that George Segal was in the movie!!! This movie, with the previews was almost 3 hours long so be ready for sitting a lot, but it doesn't really feel that long once you get into the movie.Cudo's to John Cusack........ I am really glad to see him as a major character in a big movie He deserves it. He has always been good!!! Amanda Peet was good and it was Great to see her in a role where she isn't moronic.......she was good as a mom!!!",2012

The visual effects are amazing of course. Wait for the DVD release (even the Blue ray release) and you will totally enjoy the visuals on your big flat screen.Well, it seems that I need to write 10 lines to post.

Now, after watch it, my vision has changed a little: it's a mix of garbage, trash, filthy things and Satan itself.Please don't waste your time and money watching this crap! It's unbelievably BAD in every single aspect, that even the million dollar budget spent in special effects goes under with this. You will forget about them every 20 minutes, because your need to get away of the room will takeover your mind and make you think in nothing else but leave.Seriously, believe me... Please!!actors: 03/10 (TERRIBLE. Except Woody Harrelson. Charlie Frost is a cool character)special effects: 05/10 (it's an album of everything watched before, but too quick and too unreal that your desire to leave the room will prevail)overall: 03/10 (a couple of things, about 20 minutes of movie, worth to watch and hear...)",2012

815,Panner55,Roland Emmerich: The Master of Disaster!,7,14 November 2009,"Here's the thing, if you're one of those people who go see Spiderman hell-bent bent on proving how there is no scientific way spider DNA could possibly turn a nerdy journalist into a web-slinging superhero. Or, If you seriously question why Superman can take a rocket propelled grenade to the groin, but his loins are all set afire at the mere sight of Margot Kidder, then you're probably going to have some problems with Roland Emmerich's epic film 2012.Sure, the science is little shaky. Okay, more than a little shaky. Like a 8.5 on the shaky science Richter scale. But, so what? Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Spiderman, The Dark Knight and the other 6 of the top ten box office grossers of all time aren't intended to be science journals. Suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to have fun. These are movies folks, they're meant to entertain. This movie really, really entertains.Roland Emmerich, director of Independence Day and The Day after Tomorrow, is the Master of Disaster thanks to his latest master-disaster-piece, 2012. The action, which is unrelenting, non-stop, heart pounding, oohing and aahing out loud in the theater awesome, is only paralleled by the jaw-dropping visual effects, which at times makes other films in the genre seem like a still life of a bowl of fruit.The acting by John Cusack, Amanda Peet and Danny Glover is capable and believable. The dialog, except for a few clichés like ""But, that's a suicide mission!"" delivered in the last act, was funny and for the most part clever and original. And though the movie runs nearly 3 hours, everyone in forgot about their popcorn.Again, if you're a reality seeking science geek, or even if you've watched a few seasons of Discovery Channel, the final result might have been a nuclear winter that would have made the last ice age look like spring break in Ft. Lauderdale instead of the Love Boat goes to Africa. but try not to go there. Enjoy this movie for what it is. 2012 is the new standard for disaster films. Not a guilty pleasure, just a pleasure. Enjoy, it's not the end of the world.",2012

(for the want of a better word),1,29 March 2010,"Some really bad acting, some really bad writing, some really bad special affects and some really bad, oddly placed, comedy. Must be the worst film I have ever, half, watched, as at this moment I am switching it off.The only crowning moment in the whole film is the casting of Thandie Newton, but even her beauty can't take away from how really bad this movie is.This is the reason why I rarely watch films at the cinemas or rent them from the video store. Nowadays anything will make it to the cinemas and that's why I download first and then if I think it's good, I buy it or rent it on Blu-ray several months later. Bottom line, don't waste your money.",2012

818,liamiskwl,not that bad!,7,20 November 2009,"OK so this wasn't the greatest action film of all time, nor the best written, but the film isn't that bad! honestly i don't know what people expect the idea of this film was always going to be purely for aesthetics! the scene through the streets of California is jaw dropping yes they do survive a thousand falling buildings, but at the end of the day it is still a film. designed for entertainment. a lot of the comments on this film say how unrealistic it is, and that some of the plot is unacceptable, but i think there reading in to it too much, the film although long does not drag like the last 30 minutes of the legendary lords of the rings finale! overall the film is a good action film just to sit back and watch, with some of the best CGI to date. If the viewers want to watch a realistic film then watch a documentary!",2012
819,vbn_in,what a waste of resources,5,16 November 2009,"This epic movie is Roland Emmerich's baby. This baby could have been as good as Godzilla, Independence day or The Day After Tomorrow. What happens? He screws it up with a lot of emotions, drama and god knows what superhero crap (pardon my language). The trailers had created so much anticipation in the audience but doesn't live up to it at all. OK, yes the CG was good. But you cannot use it as an excuse to cover up the emotional mess that was shown.The movie starts off with showing the sun emitting some microwaves thats causing the earth's crust to heat up rapidly. This is detected by an Indian in a copper mine where he claims that sometimes the temperature in the mine goes up to 120 deg F. I wonder how the NASA never found out about the heating up of the Earth's Core earlier than the Indian.The time skips to another place where Mona Lisa is being replaced by a fake to protect it from the destruction that is about to take place. So its apparent here that some super powers know about the 2012 disaster about to take place and we assume that just like Mona Lisa other treasured items are being replaced as well.Jumping ahead again to 2012 we see a divorced John Cusack who is a limo driver and an author go get his kids in a limo for a camping trip. His ex wife Amanda Peet married to a Plastic Surgeon Thomas McCarthy.During the camping trip Cusack meets a crazy Woody Harrelson a radio host addressing Mayan predictions and adding to that the almost dried up lake on his camping spot makes Cusack suspicious even though the government scientist Adrian assures him all is fine.Soon enough the frequency of earth quakes increase and our Cusack puts 2 and 2 together (was he a limo driver or a scientist) and concludes that the Crazy radio host was right. Then we see some crafts dodging fireballs, poisonous smoke, uprooted buildings, cars, trains all dodged by the surgeon (flying is part of surgeon's course) flying the plane expertly whereas on the other hand you see air force one succumbing to the natural disaster.It becomes a little too heroic when you see people around you dying and the only ones surviving are these few characters start to end. How lucky can you really be when a wave, 35000 feet high is racing towards you. Somethings evade common sense completely.The upside of the movie is the CG. the earth quakes, volcanic eruptions and yes the 35000 feet high wave coming from the ocean are all very scarily impressive and you are forced to think, man can fight all odds to survive or kill anything or anybody for power, but you cant and don't mess with mother nature because when she gets down to spanking there is no safe spot for you to be in.This movie is watchable just due to the special effects but it doesn't even come close to The Day After Tomorrow let alone Independence Day. I rate it 5/10.",2012
820,michaelamostkova,Didn't hate it as much as I was told but it still was pretty bad,5,29 July 2020,"Who doesn't like a bit of doomsday goodness? With that being said, it's not very fun if you don't care about the characters. There were some major actors like Cusack completely wasted as tropes of disaster film, the above mentioned playing a failed writer&father who reunites the family in the light of the survival of the end of days. The list of these cliches goes on and on. Maybe it was an intention to just throw lots of money at the production so people can enjoy some disaster without caring about the human element. And the movie should be able to make me care. It should make people ponder how they'd behave and what sacrifices they could make. This movie doesn't do it for me which is sad considering I could watch Independence Day over and over. It's one of those films where you enjoy bits but not the whole piece.",2012

It was worse than Armageddon -- but better than JURASSIC PARK. I lost count of how many times I rolled my eyes.Really! Every character is somehow connected -- and the reveal causes me to roll my eyes. The special effects were fun -- though far from realistic. There is very little to be gained from going to this movie. Wait until it is on Cable.It is fun seeing some of the actors in this film who are better than the material.

The effects are great and devastating. Exagereting some part, such as the flight taking off between the broken earth, the girl calling her dog far away in the middle of people....funny to see but it makes it ridiculous. No big surprise but of course a good visual time. Little boring at the first 20 minutes when we don't understand who are the people as it's jumping to different subject without clear relations between them. Caricatural of Russia & China.",2012

The scenes involving the John Cusack character escaping from California and later Yellowstone are so absurd that suspension of disbelief is impossible. I could pick any number of things in this movie that are absurd beyond belief. Driving his limo *through* a collapsing skyscraper as it falls? Oh, come on!For any movie to really work, you have to be able to believe what is happening on some level. But Emmerich has gone too far in the pursuit of the ""Wow!"" factor and the whole thing almost seems like a spoof at time.And the sad thing is, it didn't need to be so over-the-top and it still could have worked.",2012
825,athena_dab,Could have been significantly better...,5,10 April 2010,"Haven't we seen this movie before - with better execution? Deep Impact, Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, etc.**Spoiler Alert** I really think this could have been a more interesting film if less of the storyline involved crumbling buildings and burning islands, and more focus was given to life on the arks; or the state of the earth after the catastrophic events. It lacked character development overall and in fact, some of the peripheral characters had more depth than the leads. Though I do enjoy their other work, I don't think that this film was cast correctly.It's also yet another example of too much of the budget being used for inconsequential special effects at the expense and detriment of the script, which seemed sloppy and unfinished.I see that ABC passed up the opportunity to launch a show based on the concept of the movie - perhaps a wise choice. When we have shows that excel at special effects and action, and yet others that are spectacular in terms of the science behind-the-scenes, why would anyone invest in a poorly executed idea such as this? You may or may not recall ""Earth 2"", which aired for just one season. It was a smart idea, but lost the attention of what should have been the target audience. In comparison, this film lacked the proper balance between action, drama, comedy and science. I think most people will have forgotten about it within a few years.When will Hollywood start making intelligent science-fiction/fantasy based movies?",2012

I am surely not going to comment on plausibility or scientific accuracy, I absolutely give it strong points for the special effects (which was, after I read and heard a number of reviews before actually seeing the strip, about the only thing I expected then). I was surprised, however, of the actual comedic potential some of the scenes carry along, there were some really good moments of situational humor and a number of funny quotes.

Firstly i thought that the movie was meant to be based upon the Mayan theory but as i recall in the movie they mention the Mayan theory once in the background of a news report. I did think that the movie was animated exceptionally well but all of the close calls to disasters got a bit cheesy such as when they got engulfed by the ash and escaped it again and the ash just seemed to stop.I also expected that this film would be a very gripping feature and the disaster scenes would send a chill down my spine but yet again that was a disappointing feature to this movie. There were parts to this movie where i lost interest and just hoped it would end and in the last hour especially it seemed to lose its momentum.There were parts of the movie that did keep me entertained but i am afraid this movie could have been so much better so it only scores a 5/10",2012

This wasn't a disaster movie it was a movie disaster, the actor were so bad that every time they spoke i had to cover my ears. From cheesy lines to terrible Russian ''accents''. This movie had it all. And the worst thing is, oh yes it gets worse, many people think that this is actually going to happen. So the only thing left to say is that if you like big budget CGI movies with bad acting and dumb plot then you should most definitely go and see it. But if your a person who still likes movie with a great cast ,that can actually act, and an interesting story line you should stay away from it like your life depended on it.",2012

By the last 15 minutes, I could care less what happened.Roland Emmerich's philosophy to film making seems to be - if 10 cliffhanging moments in a film are good, cramming 1000 of them in are better. There's a difference between 'suspension of disbelief' and absolutely annihilating it, and this film crosses that line after about 30 minutes.I could detail all the ridiculous ten-thousand to one coincidences that occur rapid fire in the movie, or shed light on the enormous gaping plot holes but it's not worth it. Suffice to say Emmerich's ""Godzilla 1998"", by comparison, was high art. I can't recall the last time I've seen a worse movie - it's hard to believe this is averaging over 5.0 here at IMDb.

I was satisfied with the scenes which were shot with Panavision Camera and Lenses (35mm), but the scenes which were made with the video cameras ( Panavision Genesis HD Camera) I was very disappointed. Some water scenes at the end of the movie were shot on video and this destroying the atmosphere totally. It began as a great movie and ends partly as a dramatical soap in old fashioned ""Springfield Story"" 80s video picture quality. You are feeling you are in a catastrophe and then ...

It's like this: Me and my wife wanted to get a present for her parents' anniversary, so we went to the mall. We decided on the movie first, 'cause we had got there too late, it was starting in half an hour. We said, we'll get the present afterwards... Get this: the room was almost booked, but half of them were reservations, so we thought we'll wait to see if they'll come in time, to pick up their tickets. Some of them didn't, so we were as happy as kids because we knew we were going to sit in the back, where the best viewing conditions are. So... The review... Well... The next morning I told my friends 'Don't event dare to ask!'. I think I would've been the only damn person on this planet, that would've swear at the movie, hadn't been for my wife!!! At about half-time I said to her 'You know, we could go right now, and buy that present... I can't take this anymore!' And she really took her time, and evaluated what I said. There were some idiots on our left who were continuously laughing at the movie, who suddenly didn't seem the eternal idiotic spectators anymore, that always laugh when there's no reason to! Even I was almost laughing at almost each damn scene! I'm so sorry I payed for it! But I tell you, it's a scam! The picture will take the trip around the world, and will make so much money on behalf of us, the idiots! ... And we thought that action movies will be the only movies we were going to watch in a theater, from now on... Well... I guess, not even that genre is worth it anymore. I mean, come on!!! The only good actor was that damn dog of Natasha, or whatever her name was! And, yes! The final part, where the arks come in. The entire view of the huge caves in the mountain, where they were being built, that was fabulous! And people's will to do anything, in order to save themselves. It was epic! But that's it! Just for the info, I happen to like aircraft, and know just about anything concerning them. And I know that the Antonov 225 is the largest aircraft flying at this moment on Earth, but I can tell you that AN 225 seemed to be able to do aerobatics that only small Cessnas are!!! If one loses control of the AN 225, it would take some 6-7 kms height, before he could rise its nose again, not some 400 metres, as it looked quite clearly in the images where the earth was tearing apart, and the plane had somehow entered beneath its surface level. Let's be serious, man! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever cross India, and reach the Himalayas! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever form itself!!! Yes, it takes an earthquake, thus a continuous movement, for a tsunami to form. But for a 5 mile high tsunami... It would need some 10s of thousands of kms before it could reach that height. And the distance between the center of the Indian Ocean and Mt. Everest is about, I think, 4-5000 kms. It's outrageous! I'm only hoping some actors within this movie won't commit suicide... Come to think of it, as somebody wrote here, Hollywood has downgraded, and I don't know what to expect of the new Dune adaptation that's about to come... It's my favourite book!",2012

There has been enough written about how dire this whole film really is.Onto the promise, 2012 feels like a prequel to something much more interesting, the arcs are full now, there is a definite Orwellian feel to the surveillance on board and definite resentment toward leadership, and a definite class structure between those who paid and those who just got a place. Perhaps a film set 30 or 40 years after the events of this film based on one of the arcs, none of the characters are the same (please) perhaps there can be something kind of interesting made from the premise, it may be a bit '1984'esque, but blended with some 'Minority report', 'Metropolis' & 'Battlestar Galactica' the reimagined series. You could have the story complete with revolutions, class struggles, ration issues, political corruption, medical issues (disease spread etc.) an increasing population, the premise is there, not that it will ever have a chance of being made, and even if it did, you just know Emmerich and the studios would make it awful.",2012

836,orjakobsen,Are they good at making special effects... Yes they are,5,15 November 2009,"First of all why 5 stars out of 10. Let it be said that the effects in this movie are amazing. This and the idea of handling such a topic on film is what I will give the 5 stars out of 10 for. Why only 5 stars. My first thought after watching a movie about the judgment day for the entire human race was: ""Thank god it's over"". 3 hours of mediocre dialogues, 3 hours of people I have no background knowledge on, calling and saying goodbye to their families (which I don't know either) and 3 hours of what is supposed to be ""on the edge"" action, where John Cusack continuously survives against all odds (and when I say all odds, I mean ALL odds). When I sit back and think it through and ask myself, what they did wrong in this film compared to The Day after Tomorrow, which I liked, the answer for my part is, that none of the emotions shown by the actors in these situations seemed real. It simply didn't feel to me like these people where experiencing what I was watching on the screen. No matter how insane the situation was there was always room to stop up and put in a little joke or ironic comment, you know, to lighten the mood a little while the earth is disappearing from under your feed and you're watching probably several thousand people die in front of you. It simply seems ridiculous and takes you away from feeling like this is really happening. So instead you lean back and enjoy the special effects. In a perfect world this movie should have been split up into several parts where you could pick out the parts you actually wanted to watch. In this case I would say 4 parts would do it. One part just showing digital effects of how it could look when Earth as we know it comes to an end. The second part showing small scenes where random people call each other up and are ""sad"" together, 30 minutes of this, you know, to get you emotional. The third part should deal with the subject of humor during huge disasters and really go into detail with the way some people manage to crack jokes when facing immediate dangers which will for sure kill them. The fourth part should be random dialogues and situations between random people, like a Russian girl having an affair with a Russian guy and monologues on how much she likes her small dog or whatever. Anything really goes in the fourth part so simply jump in with random ideas which could spice things up. If 2012 was just the first part I would maybe give it 8/10, the 3 other parts takes the score down one star per part.",2012

838,moviescapes,Computer generated action sequences showing the end of the world.,7,30 August 2017,"I expected a War of the Worlds sort of story and that's what I got. There is grave danger beyond the characters' control, there are stumble upon opportunities, lots of conflict to overcome, a family reunion... all the stuff I was looking for. What surprised me was the amount of wall to wall destruction and unrelenting pace of action.Lots of people died. Lots of the Earth was destroyed. Actual plot was scattered throughout in small doses. It was kind of predictable, most apocalypse movies tend to be a certain way. Especially when weaving a romance or family story line within the OMG of the world coming to an end. Always a nice juxtaposition.Most of the action sequences were visually pleasing and amazing. I assume a whole bunch of CGI made this movie possible. Actual actors on camera seemed sparse in comparison. Some pretty intense catastrophe scenes and a memorable obscene gesture.http://fcmclub.blogspot.com/2010/04/2012-2009.html",2012
839,skygod111,Yes... it IS a DISASTER!!!,3,2 August 2010,"Thank God I saw this movie on the Movie Channel. Even so, it was a waste of time. Special effect were good (not great), acting and script were very poor. Cusack shouldn't have ever taken this role. I trusted him since he was good in every role he had in the past. Since '2012', I won't trust his good judgement to choose good roles in good movies.I started to disconnect when a couple was at the supermarket. The cereal boxes were all moving on the shelves from an apparent earthquake. The girl asked her boyfriend if he saw that. He says no! Holy s**t, didn't he at least felt it?! And I completely disconnected from the movie when the plane took off while the earth's crust was opening. Usually, a plane takes altitude. But noooo! This one was flying below the ground and inside the crack while buildings, bridges, cars, etc were falling.I like disaster movies when they are done with a minimum of plausibility. This movie is a disaster! From now on, Emmerich will have difficulties to find Producers to make big budget movies because he in not a master.",2012

Cheesy dialogue? Silly contrived metaphors? UN-NECESSARY! This movie could have worked on so many more levels, but the burden of its script was too much and it was 20 minutes too long. It seemed like every time the story was building up some real tension we'd stop to have a mother/daughter; father/son; brother/sister; author/apocalypse-loving; bimbo/dog bonding moment! Seriously?

841,literallyjunk2,the worst film yet from Roland Emmerich,1,22 November 2009,"Independence Day was a bad film, The Day After Tomorrow was a terrible film, but this is exponentially worse than either. It's almost like a bad remake of The Day After Tomorrow, in fact. Just like The Day After Tomorrow had a chase scene involving ""the cold"", this has a chase scene involving ""the crack"". Just like The Day After Tomorrow had tidal waves bringing ships in-land, so does this film. Just like The Day After Tomorrow had a hero dad trying to get from point A to point B to rescue his children, so does this film. You can't blame the cast, and you can't blame the script. The blame for what's wrong with this film lies squarely at Roland Emmerich's feet. When will the producers realise that Emmerich's films are not box office hits because he's a good director, but merely because of the subject matter and the CGI budget. It doesn't have to be him that directs the film. They could pick a decent director and have the same success - perhaps with more potential for sequels. If anything, I would imagine this film will be the last straw for anyone as far as actually paying to sit in a cinema through this kind of complete and utter drivel. We like big budget special effects films, that's why we go, but if he's not going to improve in the areas he's lacking in, then I'm really going to stop paying to watch it. I'll watch it on a media where I can fast forward to the CGI. A really, really, really, really bad film. And the CGI ain't that hot either.",2012
842,adiberardino,"Great special effects, little substance",5,22 December 2009,"Let me first start by giving the rating... I gave it a 6 out of 10 for 2 reasons. The first 40 minutes or so are probably the most BORING 45 minutes to ever grace the beginning of a disaster movie. It could easily have been compressed by getting rid of all the filler about the family. Had it continued along this path, it would have only received a 2 or 3 out of 10. The special effects and the pace thereafter was what redeemed it. The special effects were absolutely MAGNIFICENT, falling buildings, crumbling ground, tidal waves 1.5kms high, it was amazing! For people saying that there are no Oscar worthy performances... this was not designed to win an Oscar for best actor, it was designed to win an Oscar for special effects, the humans are only bit part players. John Cusak plays the likable father that saves the day. Oliver PLatt is a believable bad guy, but other than that, not much else there. But I was so disappointed with the first 45 minutes because it so did not set the tone for the movie. What also redeemed it however was the refusal for feel good moments. It annoys me when people have a lifetime to forgive other people, and then redeem at the last minute. Any attempt to do this here is rebuffed (hence the father who's son dies before he can say he is sorry).",2012
843,dengee34,Not that bad at all!,8,29 November 2009,"I thought this movie would be bad. very bad. I was wrong, as i heard from the beginning of the release of this movie; it got a lot of negative feedback from the viewers. Well, I have to say this movie was actually so-so, not that bad at all!I do not understand why so many people dislike this movie, this movie was interesting.the good:there was a lot of effects, interesting scenarios and sound effects, the acting and.. the drama. The effects again. Some scenes was effects and along as whole 5 minutes of destruction. This movie really gives insight how it would looked like if it really happened.the bad:it could be shortened down, maybe the movie was too long. There was some scenes I'd like to see deleted, because there was too much talk in them. And it got boring after a while. And now there wasn't enough of humor, and lack of feelings. I refer to the characters in the movie. The storyline. Not enough to be interesting, you didn't get a good explanation why this all was happening with the earth. The only informative hint was that the Mayans predicted the end of times and it was shown on TV, then this guy who worked with radio also made a animated running movie of what was waiting the world. However, the storyline was not enough I think, there was something missing all the time. It really felt like there was no stop in the movie only running from one place to another.to sum it up:it turned out into an interesting ending. After 2 hours i could say the ending was really surprising, nothing that I expected. However the effects was so realistic I'd say i have never seen any movie before with so much destruction in it. Usually i am very good at rating movies, and this movie actually gets a whopping 8 out of 10 from me. As I mentioned earlier, if it got shortened down, the plot got more interesting and the characters would show more feelings... this movie could be remember for long... not that bad at all.",2012

I don't really understand the bad and harsh opinion of those who attack this movie with extreme judgment. Well.... this is a kind of American pie-disaster movie. And like one of this kind it follows an already seen guideline. Several mistakes and fanciful, adventurous (sometime very close to be ridiculous I have to say) moments just made for the entertainment. But on the other side whoever brought this movie into light made a huge effort to develop those scenes full of incredible special effects. And just for this reason it is a movie that cannot be trashed as garbage. In the theater I was pretty involved to watch it and I particularly enjoyed the second half. The last scene with the flood coming on the Himalaya was just so cool. The idea of the mega boats was very interesting. So....I didn't dislike this American pie movie at all. Like the cheesecake, you have to take a chunk only once or you can feel too heavy for a second round.",2012
845,mmxmmx2,"About as expected - massive special effects, hardly any story",7,14 November 2009,"This comment might contain some mild spoilers.I just HAD to see this movie, as it has been hyped for months. I didn't really expect much more than we see in Day After Tomorrow, but really had some hopes that it would be both the ultimate disaster movie, and the summary of all the ""in 2012 we are doomed""-stories.Well, it was about as expected, when I saw it last night. Massive, spectacular effects, but thats about all. We see that the earth core is heating up, and therefore causing extremely massive earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunamis (of a size to completely wash away India) and of course a pole shift. No Maya story, nothing. At least the SFX were pretty decent, apart from some seconds where I thought that the earth crack looks a bit like a typical computer animation.I also got the impression that the movie doesn't take itself really seriously (like Independece Day) - overall it was too well made to be unwillingly funny, but 1-2 groups of people in the audience were laughing a bit at some scenes. It also has a typical happy end (considering the situation), and would probably be a ""fun for the whole family"" movie if less tragic.Buying a ticket was not really a waste of money, but this movie could have been MUCH more. Maybe all the good ideas where hold back for the announced TV series, which I'm also REALLY curious about.",2012

From such an experienced director this is PATHETIC!Now for the actors:Woody Harrelson was the ONLY actor that actually did a good job.

Maybe this is a little too over the top, I thought to myself. But the trailer depicting a massive tsunami flooding the Himalayas reassured me that this film could provide some epic yet poignant moments. After seeing 2012 I can say that I was not disappointed.Emmerich found time for some interesting scientific mumbo jumbo in the opening half hour; ludicrous, but interesting. Neutrinos emitted from a massive solar flare are heating the Earth's core and causing crust instability, hence the magnitude 10+ earthquakes. The next two hours are full of destruction, but it is good destruction. The scenes are not quickly cut, shaky, and indiscernible – they are sweeping and steady so you can savor the effects from a birds-eye view. The eruption of Yellowstone is awe-inspiring (yes, I said awe-inspiring). I was fortunate enough to see 2012 in Sony 4k resolution.There are cheesy moments (family talk); funny moments (deranged, pickle-munching radio host); and even some philosophical moments (Tibetan monk with tea pot). Okay, maybe the last one belongs in the funny category. If you can enjoy a film for its sheer visual power and not its acting, then 2012 will suffice.",2012
849,s-thienel,2012: breathtaking effects and a solid story,10,11 November 2009,"I saw this movie today, and it was really good. I don't know why people are complaining that there is no story, there is plenty of it.In my opinion it is too much story. Much of drama and human emotions. There are some clichés, but in general the story is good. In my opinion it is Roland Emmerich's best script yet.The special effects are really, really the best there is. And better than Avatar. It is very, very hard to tell that all these images are computer generated. On the big screen the effects look at least twice as good and realistic as in the trailers. I think the cartoonish effect that some people claim is due to the low resolution of the trailers. Even 1080p is not enough to do these effects justice. Only metallic surfaces look a bit ""fake"". but the rest is truly unbelievable.I think some effects shots are a bit short. I do not want to spoil anything, so i keep my mouth shut.If you want a good evening in the cinema: here you go. It is a must see for almost everybody, since there are many different genres mixed together.It is a shame that this movie isn't made in 3D. It would take the experience even a bit higher.

Movies like these are not meant to be intelligent or sophisticated. Just take a look at the premise--2012 is not going to be the apocalypse, and not even modern day Mayans themselves believe in it. Emmerich (hopefully) just took the idea and decided to do something fun with it.What this is however, is a whimsical special effects bonanza meant to be taken lightly. The overload of close calls may be insulting to reality, but it does make for a lot of graphically impressive scenes. The shallowness of the main characters may make things dull, but it makes it far easier to take it lightly. People who want to have a good time coming into this shouldn't be looking for a good story, they should be prepared for a destructive joy ride, full of fantastic visuals and fanciful situations.",2012
851,jjhjespers,Worst. Movie. Ever,3,22 January 2010,"Writing a review of this worthless movie would even be too much effort. This is total crap. The most impossible things happened, cliché after cliché. I just write this to warn everybody out there NOT to watch this movie. I've just watched it, and am much too frustrated to think clear. A shotgun pointed to my head would be the only way to get rid of my frustration at the moment.I'm just happy I've downloaded the movie, because going to the cinema would be the worst 5,- ever spent. There are just so much impossibilities in this movie, writing a review would just take me as much time as watching the movie. So, this was a waste of what used to be perfectly usable bandwidth, not to mention the devaluation of my TV.Lol@myself. After a few months I see this review again and decided to mix a bit of nuance into it. First, I gave it 3 stars instead of one. That's for the visual effects that aren't that bad. The story however is still one of the flattest, nothing-containing ones ever. Some explanation is needed for those who did not see the movie. You do not get to know the personages anyhow, they remain flat and anonymous. The acting is just bad. Why is there suddenly a romance that did not grow on any way out of a divorce full of irritation to each other? 'OH, my beloved husband is dead, let's just kiss with my ex-husband who I have hated for years?' So many things that happen are so just NOT possible. The coincidence is just totally over it's head. By the way, I don't write English essays often so please excuse me for English is not my main language, if I do make some mistakes don't mind that too much. I still strongly advise you not to watch this movie since it is so bad that it probably is the only way to get even a brain-dead zombie annoyed.",2012

Yeah Trailers are the only thing abt this movie that are awesome.Well let me start my review with little more un conventional way I am not going to describe anything about the story (Because there is hardly any story that exists!)The term ""Jaw dropping"" is used so many times relating to this movie and I am also no exception.. In praise or in hate..(huh!) Visual effects of this movie was jaw dropping.. The attention of details and massive scale really never seen before. (I guess) its very difficult to tell which scenes were vfx one and which were not. The plot of the film was Jaw dropping (I could not control laughing) when end credits started and they said Written By: Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser ? written by..? are u kidding? they haven't written anything.. this movie has only some good shots featuring VFX and no story no character development no good duologue's, no praise worthy performances.This is going to strike hurricane in worldwide box office but people with brain going to hate this one. this one can surely compared with Transformers-2 in No brainier category.

854,jason_whittaker77,Waste of time and money,4,19 November 2009,"Too long, too many characters, effects of varying quality, and a script of pure cheese. Not a patch on The Day After Tomorrow, a film which has focus and plot. 2012 is just an excuse for a special effects bonanza, some purely for the sake of it, and many of a disappointing quality. You can tell there are a lot of miniatures in there (vehicles, buildings), and many of the wide shots seemed to be mainly animation.There is at least double the number of characters necessary, and many of the subplots are utterly pointless. The film veers off in different directions, and I lost interest. There is a lot of acting talent, but none seem to have been pushed. Oliver Platt is way, way above this kind of nonsense, he gives us a silly caricature, and Cusack phones it in too, while his rival, the new man in his ex-wife's life, is possibly the most singular cardboard cutout character I've ever seen in a film like this.The director clearly doesn't do characterisation in shades of grey. In his eyes, you're either a goodie or a baddie. If you're the former, then you're squeaky clean, if you're the latter, then you are a pantomime villain. There is no middle ground, and because of this I found the film quite boring because you can predict the characters responses to each new challenge. Just imagine what Tarantino style characters would make of an end of the world scenario ?! Can't recommend this. Should have been so much better really.",2012

Comments such as;""a disgrace to human intelligence"" and ""the dialog was always cheesy"" make out much of viewer response. And you have to say it - The plot it quite useless, characters are as shallow as a puddle on the pavement, the amount of American propaganda and patriotism is frightening and yes - it IS unrealistic! Despite this I did enjoy this movie. Reason being; This is a Hollywood produced disaster-movie - it has no aspiration to contain the qualities of ""Casablanca"" or ""Das Leben der Anderen"" it has one.sole.purpose = to entertain with action and explosions! And this, it does well! The awesomeness of getting to ride alongside a limo escaping through a Los Angeles falling apart, watching a volcano eruption with nuclear proportions and Mr. President dying the only way worthy of a man in his position; getting crushed beneath an aircraft carrier! It is simply entertaining. So to sum it up; there is no reason to judge this movie by the standards of Ingmar Bergman, since it plays in another league. It must be judged for what is it - cheesy, classic, Hollywood action entertainment. Thus my rating will be 9/10. The last point is lost due to the destruction of a Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4.

I didn't care for anyone in the film, and the more that died the better in my opinion.And as usual most of the action happens in America. LA is destroyed. Yawn. Vegas is destroyed. Do we care? The White House is destroyed. Yesss! But this film gets a rating of 1 for a scene that is so overtly racist it really beggars belief: on board one of the Arks, Dr Adrian Whatever is confronting his boss about how people obtained tickets to get on board, and is astounded when he's told that tickets were sold for 1 billion Euros each, 'in order to save the human species'.The camera then cuts to some (presumably rich) people walking into the Ark, and finishes with and lingers on a group of Arabs dressed in Hollywood-cliché Sheikh and Burka costumes. Dr Adrian then asks incredulously: 'This is the gene pool we want to save?'.If this had been a race other than Arabs, I wonder what people would say. There would of course be a huge outcry. This type of snide and disgusting racism is the kind of attitude that was prevalent in 1930s Germany, and look where that led to. Absolutely shocking.",2012

I got it, it's over 2 hours long and you would have a chance to connect with the characters, but no... little connection with the characters.To be honest, I wouldn't care about what would happen to them at all. I really want to cheer for the hero, but no. The story is lacking, it's just one chaotic scene thrown in after another... and some arks you have to pay one billion Euros for and what not.

865,thiscouldbethelongestema,Forget leaving your brain at home you need to be a zombie to enjoy this,1,7 April 2010,"I remember seeing the first trailers for this, and like everyone else i thought. Wow! this looks great. I suppose it's hard to argue with the fact that this movie does look quite good and some of the CGI is impressive,however, the story is just so awful that it makes you throw your hands in the air and exclaim; ARE THEY ACTUALLY SERIOUS? This thing is an absolute disaster. Character development is terrible. Plot holes abound. The laws of physics or just common sense are just plain non existent. I enjoy video games so i don't want to make the comparison that this is like watching a video game. It's Not! Video games at least make an effort to develop a plot or make you feel something for the characters. This movie does neither. This appears to be the remnants of several other unfinished disaster movies all mashed together into a giant mess and unleashed upon the public. This is a stinker. Avoid it like the plague!",2012
866,christian-carrion,I....soiled myself,6,9 April 2011,"what can i say about 2012? I.....soiled myself. it wasn't that bad. The special effects were nice, what with the big ass tsunamis, earth quakes, and huge erecting (haha erection) volcanoes. They took real facts that have been thought up about the end of the world, and put them all together. The surprise to me was john cusack. yeah he was good most of the time, but he's more of a comedy man than...action drama. Some parts didn't seem real such as the limo driving thru a falling building, i would think that Ven Diesel could've pulled that off, but not Mr. Cusack (you seen him drive in better off dead? damn Asians) i was on the edge of my seat, and very thrilled. Hopefully i won't be seeing that next year. nothing to do but wait.",2012
867,kmzittle,2012,7,1 December 2011,Generally the movie was quite exciting. The narrow escapes in LA to get to the plane and even after the plane left the airport were great. Thank goodness there were no sex scenes as far as I can remember so as to further distract from the movie. The distractions and cuteness of the kids was enough along with the camping scenes.I would argue that the end of the world scenario would have been more accurate from my point of view if the Earth would have simply been destroyed by being burned up by the sun or the Earth would have split into two parts due to the tremendous pressure built up inside of the Earth. That would have been interesting to see all the water and matter flowing out into space. The flood ending reminded me of Noah's ark.,2012
868,liquid_sunset820,My eyes almost rolled out of my head.,3,17 March 2013,"You know that one scene in Independence Day where the family barely escapes a wall of fire inside a giant tunnel, and just as you think the beloved Golden Retriever is going to die, it leaps to safety?Stretch that scene out over 2 and a half hours, and that's my reaction to 2012.Maybe because I've waited until 2013 to watch this movie that I'm a bit jaded. But to call this movie ""awfully entertaining"" is an overstatement.I sat and watched this for free on TV because it was the only thing on. I saw Danny Glover and thought, ""oh, I didn't know he was in this."" I said that to myself about five more times. The cast is solid. The acting and characters, however, are not. I'm not bloodthirsty, but at some point I did catch myself disappointed when some of the most annoying and selfish little bratty kids survived. John Cusack achieved the award for Most Apathetic and Out of Touch father, while Thandie Newton received an accolade for Most Underwhelming. **Spoiler** Really. Like, her dad dies, and she let's out a poorly time sob, and that's literally the last time she sheds a tear. She, like most of these characters, is then back to continuously droning on about themselves and cracking jokes like billions of people aren't suffering and dying slow deaths while she has the chance at life(one could almost make an analogy that Americans do that daily). **end spoiler.**And the Russian guy! I was waiting for Will Ferrell to come out and ask him if he had Peanut Butter in his mouth. Its that bad.The effects, while good, are beat into your head so much, you will watch with child-like glee and enthusiasm as the waves destroy the world. Whoosh! Splash! Boom! Yay! To sum it up with another comparison-- Its like the old school versions of Mortal Kombat where squeamish people and concerned parents would go into settings and turn off the ""blood."" You'd just be kicking each other in the face, throwing swords at each other, over and over, yet no blood. I don't get how a world ends, and 99% of humanity is wiped out, yet I don't see a drop of blood, a dead body, anything to imply something catastrophic is going on.",2012

Either that or they were casted by lottery.All the supposed graphic glory of the CGI is lost when buildings purposefully fall in slow motion while a plane moves between them as a normal pace, or when cracks only ever appear in convenient places, like just behind the car the protagonists are in. This happens, not in one, but several scenes, and it borders on plain stupidity.All in all, a very poor movie.",2012

If this movie was at least as watchable as Independence Day or The Day after Tomorrow then I wouldn't be so irritated by it. But at least it didn't annoy me as much as War of the Worlds so I'll give it a 4.This movie appears to have had a script/story that ran away from the screenwriters and left the movie with an ending that they couldn't alter and just had to go with. The clichés in this film are an insult to the viewing public IMO. They could at least have 'attempted' to confound the critics with a few unexpected turns, but they went for the defeatist Hollywood formula - ""Advertise and hype it, and they will come, and we WILL make profit"" The problem with this movie is that, as the story progresses, it seems to get more and more absurd and rather than sticking a knife in and cutting out the beast's heart, the screenwriters let it live in it's mishapped form. The ending you're eventually left with is morally ambiguous for all involved and no amount of emotional rallying by the main actors is of any significance (it's easy to call for human kindness and empathy when you're one of the lucky few on the bridge of the main ark - even if you did leave your dad/family/friends behind to die).The memory of this will live on in the minds of those who don't appreciate it and tarnish the Director's name for a very long time (especially after his string of previous disasters).Was there any mileage whatsoever in the main family being dysfunctional? Any at all? ...... I think I'll drop it down to a 3.",2012

I'm yet to see a high-budget disaster / apocalyptic movie with both effects and storyline! As a HUGE fan of this genre, I waited years for the release of this movie for it's effects alone - I wasn't disappointed! Yes, the storyline was flimsy and unbelievable (as was much of the acting) but what do you want from this kind of movie? In a real-life global disaster of this magnitude, we all know the odds of a family all surviving together, finding a plane, finding ANOTHER plane and flying halfway across the world to crash-land in the mountains and then be driven to salvation in the form of modern-day arks, is ridiculous. But without this stupid story-line, we wouldn't have been treated to the amazing CGI special effects as the film would have been over before it begun.I suspect that, as with Roland Emmerich's 'Day After Tomorrow', this movie was all about the effects with a lot of artistic license on the story line.If you want a believable storyline, try 'Pride and Prejudice'.",2012

They are action but also provide opportunities for thinking our lives, relationships and priorities. 2012 is one of the best disaster movies. The most important question is what will you do if there are limited resources and absolutely no chance of saving everyone. How will you decide who will live and who will die? How can you justify such decision? How can you keep your humanity after deciding to kill millions or maybe billions of people? There are no easy answers but these are the important questions. These questions are about the poverty that nearly half of the world population suffering. These questions are about the incredible waste that the West is producing and the cost of that waste. There is only one phony monologue referring this issues. More could be achieved with probably a shorter movie. I enjoyed the 158 minutes and also worth the 10$ that I paid.",2012
875,gigan997,When Will Roland Emmerich Learn??,1,17 July 2014,"When will Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin learn? I guess when they finally run out of disaster ideas. They already ruined Godzilla, capitalized on global warming and had aliens take a shot at world domination. It's only natural that he'd hurry up make this film before a director with actual talent got a chance to. After watching those barely acceptable films, along with ""10, 000 B.C."" in all its maligned light, I honestly didn't have high expectations for this film. And what a coincidence, the duo presented audiences with a predictable family melodrama weighed down by overly done action sequences.I can't lie say there aren't some captivating and mouth-dropping shots, but the humor seems to never let up. Even as the world crumbles to pieces and society is at the end of its rope. A perfectly good time to tell a joke or two, don't you think? The same old formula of a divorced family getting back together after the step father is conveniently killed during the chaos is put to use, yawn. As a result I end up not giving a rat's *ss about any of the characters. In fact, it would've played out better if everyone would've simply died. How many clichés and comedy must I suffer? If the film had been marketed as a comedy then I would've honestly given it a higher score (maybe a 5 or 6) but instead it was portrayed in trailers as the end of all epicness. What a laugh.",2012
876,rmoore23,Emmerich goes all out on this three hour destruction derby.,8,10 January 2010,"I don't care what anyone says, I had a blast watching this movie. It's probably my favorite Emmerich film next to Stargate and ID4. Granted, if you hate Emmerich's movies, this probably won't change your opinion. Sure, 2012 is a lot more shallow than something like Avatar, but this is the kind of movie where you don't expect a super deep plot line. It's the mother of all disaster flicks, plain and simple. I don't think its fair to compare this to Michael Bay's flicks, at least 2012 tries to add some emotion/pathos amongst all the carnage, and while I didn't give a crap about any of the (Human) characters in Transformers 2, I actually liked some of the characters in this. Emmerich movies are always more about the spectacle than the people behind it, but I thought the cast kept this movie afloat. Obviously, the special effects are spectacular. (The Los Angeles escape and Yellowstone eruption were some of the most epic things I've experienced on the big screen.) It's pretty much an implausible action movie on a massive scale. Movie purists will scoff a lot at it, but entertainment wise, I found it very satisfying and very well paced for its three hours of length. It's hokey, but damn is it fun.

885,bravepawthedog,Another 'End of the World' Movie,6,19 September 2017,"2012 was just another ""Apocalypse"" movie that was a stroyline off of the Mayan prophecy of the end of the world happening near the end of 2012. It was a baffling movie to me. John Kusack, was the average writer being portrayed and in the middle of what looks like a divorce with his former wife, who was hooked up with this ""rich and snobby"" surgeon. The movie started also with a Scientist, who came to another country and visited a friend, and discovered the truth of the temperature of the Earth starting to rise. The story takes us back to Washington DC, where the scientist demands a top official looks at the documents stating the facts. He reads it, and makes a call for his car to be out front and the scientist to go with him, next we see the United Nations, and the US president, played by a legend, Danny Glover, who inform that the world is coming to an end, and that their wasn't much time. That's when we see John Kusack, running to the kids, and proceeds to take them in a limo, to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. During the trip, while the kids and their dad are taking a walk, they cross a restricted area in Yellowstone, and a whole brigade of the U.S. Army shows up and takes them away. Throughout the entire story, we see the planet being destroyed by huge earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, as well as the great and fatal Yellowstone Super Volcano. Every important person in the government, or children and spouses thereof, were given tickets to board huge ship vessels to survive the end of the world when it flooded. Towards the end we see, everyone fighting to get on, and a few people, sadly who I turned out to like in the end, die. The public was finally deemed freedom and safety onto the boats, just minutes before the water sweeps in and floods them, and they launch. There is so much argument and validity to this movie, it's confusing, yet gets exciting, it's emotional, yet happy in the end. There could've been a lot more done, and realistic scenes added to make this movie better. Overall Rating: 6/10 Overall Reasons: - Confusing Story -Wasn't exactly realistic looking all around -Acting and production could've been better",2012

This is a big Hollywood movie, so be prepared to suspend reality for a couple of hours; check your inner critic at the door. It's more fun if you don't focus too much on the head-scratching ""science"" and other unlikelihoods. But who cares? You get to watch Woody Harrelson steal the show as Charlie, the crazy Yellowstone conspiracy theorist. The special effects thoroughly bring you into the story, better than any movie I've seen in years.

And about 50 degrees of separation, could not connect their fans. So, why this paradox? Why do cinephiles come here in flocks to rate 2012 with one star, one star,one star, half a star, zero star, one star? What were they expecting from a disaster movie? Having said that, a few thoughts about 2012. Yes, the science is laughable, and the plot holes are big enough for an Antonov to pass through. But you know, if you want your science hard, really hard, there is always NASA TV, where you can watch space shuttles getting launch delays for weeks. And regarding plot holes: they can be insulting when something pretends to be something that is not (anyone remember the horrible Flightplan?). When there is an unspoken convention between filmmaker and audience that plot holes are exchanged for sheer indulgence, there is nothing really serious to complain about. It's a win win situation.

There were probably 3 characters out of the 20 or so the movie focuses on that I actually gave the slightest smeg about, and that was purely because of the actors in question's previous roles prior to this movie, not because 2012 had given me any reason to like them.So many great actors, such a feeble script.I'm struggling to find the words. I'm simply blown away by the sheer scale of this trash movie.The special effects are superb, don't get me wrong, but it's like a couple-of-hours-long advert for a special effects company, seemingly made in the prime vacation period for all of the good scriptwriters and directors in the world.Insulting? Yes, insulting. It's every movie cliché you ever rolled your eyes at, tied together into a feature length bundle.

At times glaring logical errors made it difficult for me to enter the world depicted in the film. The character development and emotional aspects were also quite superficial.

892,oliver9184,2012: Immediate Reaction,6,16 November 2009,"2012 is a story about the 'end of the world' and is inevitably going to get compared to The Day After Tomorrow (2004), another story about the end of the world, or something similar, directed by the same Roland Emmerich. With better spectacle, a better cast and a (slightly) better story 2012 compares very favorably with The Day After Tomorrow - though as much through that film's failings as through it's own strengths. Independence Day (1996) remains Emmerich's best film - and probably THE best film - about the end of the world so far.Because the limp and soggy backbone of The Day After Tomorrow was formed by two of the dullest and most nondescript actors I can think of - Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal (aptly playing father and son) - audiences struggled to care about anybody in that film. They and everyone else in the film were as uncharismatic and tedious as real life people - and this is not what we go to the movies for. The final straw in that film's coffin was its deadly serious tone. It was a grisly experience that I wouldn't want ever to have to sit through again.That was what I was a bit worried about going into 2012. I didn't want to see a similarly bad version of that film. And though 2012 is better in every way it still doesn't quite come recommended. The cast is a great deal better: John Cusack plays a sympathetic father, looks as young as he always did and (of course) wears sunglasses like always; Danny Glover is unintentionally hilarious as the President, slurring and lisping and presumably dribbling all over his shoes. The two young kids who, in this kind of film could easily be so bad you spend the running time wishing they would die but knowing they won't, surprisingly, are fine and I was fine with them not dying. Best of all are Oliver Platt (as the Cynical Government Man), Chiwetel Ejiofor (the Earnest Scientist) and Woody Harrelson (the Not-So Crazy After All Conspiracy Theorist). Of course these characters are two-dimensional archetypes; the casting however is spot on and each of them puts in good work, relishing the clanging lines they've been given and clearly relishing their meaty, bombastic monologues. Also, there's a good helping of farcical humor to go with all the meticulous destruction and grandstanding melodrama. This seems odd at first though becomes extremely welcome towards the end as the story inevitably goes to pot and as the anticlimactic climax stomps slowly out of the future towards the present.The biggest set-piece and the clearest evidence of this film's quarter billion dollar price-tag comes about a third through, lasts for absolutely AGES and, does not bore. Cusack manages to escape the tectonic silliness that Los Angeles has suddenly become with his estranged family and rival dad first in a limo, then a small plane. The action is staged in such a way that's dizzying because the shifting background in the long-lens shots denies you the sense of real-world context you'd normally have. The earth itself has become kinetic in a way I hadn't seen displayed like this before. Happily a short while afterward the story requires yet ANOTHER plane journey, this time in the biggest plane in the world (""It's Russian!""), and one filled with the most expensive cars in the world... for no real reason at all.Up to the last 50 minutes or so the film manages to maintain interest but after they get to where they were heading the story turns very quickly to sh.t because everything has literally come to a halt. The only thing driving this bloody-minded, thick-skulled mammoth of a movie was its urgent sense of having to get somewhere, of needing to escape this, that or the other. It all gets very and claustrophobic, Poseidon Adventure style and... that's it. The last forty-fifty minutes is as boring as The Day After Tomorrow but with slightly better acting. The supposed tension here comes not from a city collapsing underneath your plane that might not be going fast enough to get the lift it needs for you not to die but - stupidly and boringly - from some guy (who you definitely don't care about since he only just got introduced) with his leg trapped down a well somewhere. This is pretty much the point from which you can tell that the very end, when it comes, will probably be as boring if not more so.",2012
893,e_mendez,Absurd,1,1 March 2010,"After seeing this movie I can almost picture the memo sent out by the studio with the requirements:Hire two random teens out of Facebook who like action movies. Use every possible cliché and stereotype from action movies from the last 30 years. Use every cent of the budget on CGI effects. Hire good actors who will do anything for a paycheck. And for the love of all that is Hollywood: do not come up with anything original.Seriously, this movie had every tired cliché in it and then some. The scenes are so unbelievable that the only people who will find this movie plausible are those that think that Star Wars was a documentary. An example being when Gordon is asked to fly a plane. He says, and I'm quoting here: ""I've only had a couple of lessons."" Now, the fact that once he gets airborne he makes Manfred on Richtofen look like someone who has never even so much as flown a kite is simply one of the hundreds of absurd things in this movie. But just when you think that there's no way they can top that joke then comes the two pilots flying the Antonov giant like it's an F-16. If this movie was marketed as a parody movie making fun of end of the world movies, it would have worked better.This movie is also a very clear character study. There's the good guy, the obvious bad guy and each character gets... well, pretty much what they've deserved and gotten in every action movie of the past 30 years. Woody Harrelson does his best Crispin Glover in this, which, again, works great as a comedy. There was zero imagination regarding the characters in this movie, it was so scarily predictable. Additionally, each scene tries to outdo the previous one and it just becomes a big, gigantic joke. I was laughing hysterically at all the ""tearjerker"" scenes of people about to die because they were so trite and had been done much better in movies before this one. How desperate for cash were these actors to sign on this?***** SPOILER ALERT *****This movie is crap.",2012
894,alex_davies1,The God of all Ultimate Entertainment,10,12 November 2010,"LMAO!!!!! Are you some kind of boring 90 year old man????? This has to be the worst review I think I've read on here and I've read a few! You're moaning about Close Calls???? IT'S CALLED GOD DAMN TENSION IT WAS THE WHOLE FUN OF IT! It kept you in the edge of your seat! Every bloody film has CLOSE CALLS. James Bond is probably the ultimate one which abuses this to the MAX yet it is fantastic! If this was meant to be REALISTIC as you think it should have been. Then they wouldn't have made it off the bloody runway and then they'd be a completely blank film without the main characters.Flippen hell you must be the worst person to see a film with. My opinion on this film wasn't the best of story lines, but the Director said himself in many interviews that he didn't want this film to be deadly serious, he just wanted to deliver entertainment and to just bring a bit of humour to the situation otherwise it'll be quite a depressing film. Might as well call it Shindlers List 2 or whatever.I found it extremely entertaining and I got my money's worth out of it. There was a lot of character development but it isn't Batman you're watching here it's the end of the world lol.I went thru nearly every emotion. Happy, Sad, Terrified, Anger. No other film has made me go through so many emotions and those films are supposed to be called ""Epic and Memorable""",2012

897,xadione3000,2012 - extreme stupidity,3,24 November 2009,"I rarely write reviews of movies, but sometimes I think of the good of others and this way I want to tell you that there are almost three hours of your life that you will regret and you'll never get back watching 2012. Here's why: 90% of the film action is around retarded people. They are so predictable and you easily realize who escape and who not; Dialogues are a rare idiocy - in fact quite realistic if we think to the characters; Main character's behavior is one that makes you throw your shoes on the screen - they are not serious or funny but very irritating by their stupidity. Basically, they go where they go through a blind chance, not after they're decisions.Secondary characters are just some elements rid of the main actors cling desperately to reach the happy ending.The only positive aspects are a part of special effects, but honestly, looking back at ""Independence Day"" (1996), I realize that Hollywood Action is going backwards.2012 is a very very poor movie. Unfortunately, he managed to fool me.I have smiled only once, when the Russian girl dies.For the rest, all embarrassment phases: The Earth breaks, buildings fall, and a girl of 7 is looking back at her house and says: ""My hats!""The girl of a Russian billionaire is on the run after her puppy threatening to remain outside of the ship; The main character, Jason Curtis (John Cusack) run after a plane faster than the earth breaks behind him; - U.S. President prefers to remain on earth and die next to ordinary people rather than save; All characters who help the main characters dies in this movie. Obviously, children are saved.Etc. Etc. Etc.",2012
898,Boomshtick,Best disaster movie ever,10,11 November 2009,I was able to see a pre-release screening of 2012 in Toledo Ohio on 11/10/09 The trailers don't even begin to show you what goes on in this movie. The special effects are incredible. They really paid attention to very small detail for this production. I mean academy award worthy effects. I was blown away! I plan on seeing it on the big screen again as soon as it comes out. There is so much happening on the screen I have too just to look for other little stuff. It had a plausible storyline with characters you can believe and relate to.I don't want to tell you too much about it. You need to see it for yourself. This is a definite must see on the big screen. I can't wait for it to come out on Blu-ray. I hope when it does that it has a lot of special features on the fx and making of. It's 2hrs 38min's long so don't drink a lot before you go see it because you don't want to miss a moment of this picture. Enjoy it. I did.,2012

Entire movie was done like a roller coaster ride, anticipation anticipation anticipation, then DROP! I'm sorry it didn't work for some of you... it was fun for me and my friends =D Cusak and Harrelson were awesome, along with the visuals/sound effects -- Oscar quality. Others could have done better. Maybe if Denzel Wasington was president and Will Smith played Adrian Helmsley... then this would have been crazy, but budgeted at??? But with all the naysayers trying to stop movie studios from making money... something like that will probably never happen... but then, most of you will rather opt for stuff like Paranormal Activity that only costs several thousand dollars to MAKE.Again, just appreciate it as entertainment.",2012

902,Soumil_De,Apocalyptic misadventure,7,21 June 2021,"Out of all the disaster movies 2012 has made an impact which permits it to stand out from the rest. It carefully depicts every destructive scenario that one could hope for. It can be described as something horrible but irresistibly entertaining at the same time. The realistic and vivid visuals along with appropriate and convincing sound effects is something that really sweeps you off your feet. All thanks to the VFX team, because of which we keep holding our attention till the last moment of the drama.Nothing extraordinary is there in the story as it is in the same wavelength as other disaster movies with flimsy storyline. It focuses primarily on survival and unfolds mostly through special effects. The movie spends half an hour on ominous set-up scenes , like scientists warning, strange events occuring, prophets ranting, and then unleashes two hours of cataclysmic special events hammering the Earth relentlessly.As for the acting part, everyone is just alright, fitting into their roles but nothing too catchy. John Cusack perfects his hangdog look as the ordinary man wih the spirit of a hero, while Amanda Peet doesn't really have much to do. Thandie Newton, a fine actress, portrayed the role of the First Daughter. The only actor who stands out amidst the crowd is Chiwetel Ejiofor as the American scientist.",2012
903,leodanin,Not really worth dying for....,6,11 November 2009,"Saw the movie at Cinemax Versova. Honestly speaking nothing great about the movie 2012. It was actually predictable in certain scenes. Very good work with graphics though. I would compare it to the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and in fact the work in the former was far more impressive. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Adrian Helmsley) has played a very good role. Also John Cusack (Jackson Curtis), Thandie Newton (Laura Wilson) and Danny Glover (President Thomas Wilson). Funny part in the movie is when Jimi Mistry (Dr. Satnam Tsurutani) speaks English very fluently but has a hard time speaking Hindi... hahaha....I would rate this movie a 6/10. Its an OK movie, so maybe a one time watch but not really something to die for.",2012

I had some respect for Mr Emmerich before this, and I love disaster movies. After 2012 I will think twice about going to the movies to see a disaster film. And I will never ever see any of Mr Emmerich's movies after this catastrophe. The story is stupid, but that's OK - no one expect it to be any different, it is a disaster movie after all. But there has to be some nice characters, some jokes and funny moments, and a totally unconvincing but happy end. In 2012 there are so many characters, and none - none! - of them has any charm. There's too much of them and they are all dull. How is that even possible?! John Cusack was in this film just because of the money. Like Sean Connery once said: ""Good actors sometimes do stupid movies for lot of money"". No jokes. Not one. No happy end. What kind of movie is this?! I'm sorry I watched this film. This is Emmerich's bad - and 2,5+ hours long! - ego-trip. I wish I could know how it's possible to make such a bad film with so much money and so much levels of control - which producers, editors, art directors etc. said to Emmerich ""Yes, this is it!"". Don't watch it. Instead, make something nice for yourself. Or just sleep. Walk. Sew. Anything is better that watching this.",2012
906,polombob,"It's the end of the world, not anybody's career",7,15 November 2009,"Anybody going to this movie to learn about the Mayan prophecies for 2012 or for any true science, is going to be sadly disappointed. But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.See this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.The film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.Enjoy the show!",2012

The interested chicken , the girl that got over her wetting bed problem , the dark skinned president that was the last man standing , the crazy blond chick with her dog... there is just so much non scene , and so much comedy for this type of apocalyptic movie , at one point i thought i was watching a comedy movie. i went out of the movie thinking that this should be some kind of a secret message... cause the movie has a very very bad plot...i think they wasted the money and the 2012 hoax, it could have been a grate piece.",2012
908,nathan_034,Well executed and surprisingly satisfying.,7,14 December 2009,"I went into this movie with much skepticism. Afterall, this year's mega budget pictures have all ended up feeling like a high-class tranny hooker. Good on the outside, but in no way pleasing nor satisfying on the inside, not that id know. (ie. Transformers 2) Especially with such a huge topic of THE END OF THE WORLD, you'd expect this movie to fall flat on its back after half an hour or so (ie. Knowing, good Lord what was that). But this movie did surprise me.It did not try to conjure a convoluted and nonsensical plot-line to justify the end of the world, and the sub plots all come together a tad shakily but albeit, steadily eventually.What I enjoyed most was the attention put to the different moral aspects of human nature and survival, and the reign of goodness vs selfishness in human morality. It wasn't deep, but just addressing this seemed sufficient to bump up a couple of points.See this movie. Its well done (for its genre of disaster flicks) and is a visual treat. And dare I say, at times had me on the edge of my seat...This isn't gonna win any Oscars but it will satisfy any viewer seeking FINBALLY a above average disaster flick that does most things right.",2012

I went with really lot of expectations on the movie, though not in terms of story line but in terms of action sequences and entertainment stuff. I should accept that I'm really satisfied and really worthwhile watching it once in theater. The graphics and the action sequences are really awesome. Moreover, not much time is spent in introducing the characters and stuff. About just 10mins or so is spent in that and then starts the series of action sequences that extend the full length of the movie. Not even few minutes of it is spent in boring stuff. Except few illogical sequences, really a nice entertainer and would say it needs definitely a theatrical affect to enjoy it to the full extent.",2012

912,BAGreen-1,2012- I've seen the end of the world and it's great,10,14 November 2009,"Yesterday was the release of the long awaited film 2012, a disaster film that is based on the 2012 phenomenon. The director of this film Roland Emmerich is the mastermind behind famous films such as The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day. Being a big fan of these films I couldn't wait to see how he portrayed the ultimate disaster movie, showing the end of the world as we know it. With an all star cast including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Woody Harrelson, as an hilarious 'crazy' radio host who address's the Mayan's prediction of the phenomenon but know one believes. It sounds cliché but 2012 did have me hanging off the edge of my seat, literally. I thought I had seen everything CGI had to give but this was something else. There was explosion's, tsunami's, earthquakes, catastrophe after catastrophe. For most parts of the film I was holding my breath. The thing that I feel made it good viewing is that it didn't take itself too seriously, you could be crying one minute then laughing the next. All in all an emotional roller-coaster of a film. Think Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day on steroids with a pinch of Titanic. Definitely one to watch.",2012
913,af_Snowboarder01,"The science is terrible, the CGI is awesome.",8,18 November 2009,"From magical morphing neutrinos that can interact with matter to disaster immune planes that can't gain altitude, in the science category this movie gets a solid F. The writers couldn't grasp a passing understanding of poles, faults, geography, how fast buildings fall, volcanic eruption, altitude, or how much water is actually on earth. The character development is terrible and rife with stereotypes, and humanity in the movie would have been better off without the main characters ever existing as they nearly wiped out 1/3rd of humanity. So rack up another F in the character department.However, I still gave it an 8 because of the CGI and hilarity. Most of the flaws are in the name of making the effects that much cooler, and the camera's perspective in many of the shots was excellent. Despite the scientific inaccuracies, where else will you see a limo drive through a slowly falling building, St. Peter's Basilica (with pope) squish a bunch of worshipers, a nuclear volcano's bomb obliterate a crazy radio host, or an aircraft carrier smush the US Capitol? The flaws make this movie very funny; the stereotypical billionaire, data that can predict down to the second yet neglect an entire continent, the ships built in China (like everything else), and the ex husband catching a break when the new husband is ground into hamburger.That being said, this movie is better suited to one of those roller coaster simulators than an actual movie.",2012

It will convince you to believe the realism of 'the world's end' ! The escape scenes will take your breath away .. The storyline is a little bit dull, but you sure cannot hate it! Do not expect a well-phrased script in this movie. The movie has exactly done what it was meant to do. People have been complaining about laws of physic and lack of realism. But it is how it should be !! I'll sure give a 8/10 to this movie.For these 'costly made' movies, people expect them to be perfect in every sense ! You go wrong in few aspects, there will be people giving 1/10 ratings. They will have a dozen lines to write ""how the script was not good"", ""how the movie lacked realism in that X scene"". May be everyone wants everything to be damn perfect. I agree that movie could have been better with a better story line, but you surely can't rate it awful! The movie does has some flaws and it is not the best movie in the Hollywood. But also, it is very much better than many movies to which you have rated more than 6-7/10.

In fact, I don't think there was a main character. Very convoluted. Notice who they cast for the good guys and who they cast for the bad guys. This is a typical movie for the present Hollywood mindset. It started out OK but went downhill right up till the end. The story became more unbelievably sentimental with each scene. The special effects were the only thing that made the movie worth watching. A waste of time...I started reading a magazine halfway through the movie and turned it off before the final scene. The underlying message is so heavy-handed and in-your-face, it's vomit-inducing. They should rename the movie ""I'm OK, Your OK"".",2012

The first part of the movie did seem a little slow during the character development, which is to be expected. But, once the action starts, look out! The director did a great job, starting out with low intensity events and building up the intensity of the events of the move to the final climax. This is an awesome movie that has to be seen on the big screen for the full effect, highly recommended!!!",2012
919,HienoKaveri,"Awesome effects throughout the movie, but that's it.",7,15 November 2009,"Firstly, I have to get something off my chest concerning all these 1/10 or 10/10 ""reviews"" here. I really hope IMDb has some sort of intelligent scoring system to weed these morons out, as it goes without saying there is no way this movie could be worth one star. It features some of the most expensive, state of the art CGI I've seen to date, and that alone warrants more respect. But also, that alone doesn't make it worth 10, so weed all those wackos out as well. It's disappointing that a reasonably respected forum as this allows these idiots to vote, when they can't do it in a pseudo-subjective manner.Enough of that rant, let's get down to the movie. Went to see it today with the wife. Came back with my ears ringing after two and a half hours of almost continuous effects and explosions. I won't go into the plot as there's no much to mention: the earth is heating up from the inside, and it's (of course) happening extremely fast (as in: we have days instead of decades or centuries) and whole of humankind will soon be wiped out.There were a couple of surprises in the plot, which was nice. Also a few completely out of the blue moments of humor, which had the entire theatre Laughing Out Loud. A nice contrast and relief to the otherwise constant suspense and action.Acting: I certainly wouldn't predict any awards here, but it was all good and believable. Mostly. Oliver Platt and Danny Glover were excellent and touching at times.Effects department: We all knew this already, it's constantly at the awesome level apart from a few distinct moments of ""that looks fake"" but believe me, the good moments outshine the little flaws. The physics modeling of the effects, the attention to detail, is absolutely overwhelming at times. That combined to the sound effects, is all pure win.The bad: too many close escapes. This has been mentioned here before, and I agree, some of the main cast should have died multiple times. But this being Hollywood, that can't happen of course even if that means bending the laws of _everything_ beyond the point that even the viewer will see it. I think we could have been happy with a few more seconds or even minutes of escape time in many of the sequences, and it wouldn't have made much difference to the outcome of the movie.Overall, it's a decent watch. If you're a fan of disaster movies, you won't want to miss out on this. Highest body count of them all.",2012

I mean, the world is coming to an end - THE WHOLE world, and you expect them to show moving speeches and original dialogues?! I think the movie showed a lot of reality and how human race would really behave in a situation like that. The movie showed all of the faces of humanity which we don't see often in catastrophe-like movies. This movie is very well written, there are no holes in the story, the characters were all really good, I'm giving it a 10! It had some laughter, had a lot of action, emotion, the movie's got it all!

""In Indian Mythology we have ""pancha bhoothas"" (the 5 energies) (air, water, land, fire, sky. and it is believed that one day all these pancha bhoothas will play. and in that game only the man suffers. the man who is using, utilizing,WASTING those 5 energies will suffer.that day man will be scared to breathe. to drink. to cook. to come out. and to walk."" then the man faces the greatest horrible experience.and finally he dies.and how..?? how he dies...?? how the 5 energies play?? that is what is shown in 2012. an extremely high quality graphical thriller.the best action sequences. photographed to sufficiency.the script would have been taken care. it is a sci-fi thriller which showed the struggle of a man and his family for survival when his own surroundings are taking revenge like a monster to kill him. if the script would have been developed on the basis of how man fears of his death in such a situation rather than showing the struggle for survival,it would have worked out well. note that the fear of death and struggle for survival are opposite and like two sides of a coin.if the fear is shown rather than the struggle then we will feel the real horror.then 2012 will surely have an impact on the audience. they will think. of course i appreciate the work done. its a good movie with high end CG visuals.",2012

If you watch the movie with normal expectations, you will enjoy the special effects and stuff. If you watch it with high expectations, well, don't watch it. First half of the movie was fine with special effects, if you like apocalypse as I do you will love the scenes. You will find that scenario has some holes in it. Family finding a way out through some insane guy looks absurd, the airplane scenes are like ""director forced to create something"". But in general I would say 6/10 for the first half. Second half is the real disaster part. Scenario becomes obviously absurd. Side characters die without reason. Movie kills the bad guy for just being rich. Family reunion, stupid ship problems (how can not the motors run when the doors are open, that was way over stupid). While the water reach thousands of meters, Africa came out untouched because it raises few hundred meters. A specially the last 30 minutes are incredibly boring. Director forgets about the main plot (END OF THE WORLD) and focuses on the escape story of the main character and his family from a jammed door.

Next thing they know, their work is on the big screen and they are all wondering, ""WTF?!!! WE did THAT?!""2012 deserves forgiveness because it was an accident. It was a collective sobriety test in which everyone failed, but is fun as heck to watch.To be sure there were was some legitimately good acting in this picture...I mean for drunk people. Chiwetel Ejiofor was the calm reason in the midst of a disaster of a project. John Cusack can make even a bad movie bearable. And, Woody Harrelson! I think he was literally woken up out of bed to make this movie. Brilliant! Best horrible movie ever made. Thank you Columbia and Roland Emmerich. Next one's on me.",2012

BS.I think this was one critic who did not enjoy an action packed movie.This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time! and i think if you are not open minded about a fictional action packed film, then go rent yourself a documentary about planets and earth that can give you some scientific proof which you can take to bed with you.Voila.

The mayans predicted the end of the world.and the whole movie is based on that. Better Mayans don't watch this movie else they will see how disastrously the movies is made about their prediction. I will rather cut this 2Hr30 Min plus long movie in 3 parts first middle and end. First part is decent and watchable.The movie starts with the coal mine in India where Dr Helmsley is called urgently by his friend who suggests the end of the world but in entire film they don't show any Indian saved or even the guy who discovered the end of world and cautioned entire world about the disaster.John Cusack was unbeatable. Reminded me of Die-hard. All the action in movie is repetitive and cheesy. Despite of having all the special effect don't feel like watching the action. Middle part of movie is really monotonous and boring to watch,Its better to sleep than to watch the film. Finally they don't end the movie that well. End is all about the countdown. first the end then countdown to survive in the end when the Ship meant to save is about to destroy.I am still wondering why is Himalayas lie flat in end and only country surviving is Africa . Cape of Good Hope cheesiest dialog ever heard by me.",2012

ON a jet with probably a dozen cars in the belly, they opted to try to keep the cars.. at the end of the world... THey could have made it to China in back if they dumped the cars somewhere over the Pacific, and still had the audience wow effect of watching rich people's bentleys get destroyed.2) Conflict confusion, we are not sure what the conflict in the story is. Is this a poem about a tidal wave? Or are you trying to tell a story? If you want to write a story you'll need one or MAYBE two of the three conflicts and these will need to be Major recurring themes in the plot, person vs. self, person vs. nature, person vs. person (( and then the ever popular person vs. divine occasionally crops up)). THis movie has no fully developed conflict. 3) Amanda Peet is still hot hence 2 stars. 4) Crossroads = awesome. As in the song by Bone Thugs in Harmony. They are not in this movie, nor is the plot device. the characters in this movie are somehow on different planes of existence when I am pretty sure they were ""acting"" right next to each other. No bond or connection is felt, most disappointingly the Amanda Peet / Cusak connection was not well developed.5) Deus ex machina- it's too frequently used. God is selective in his acts and you can too! I am not going to take the time to craft out this draft because frankly the movie isn't worth it.",2012

There are a lot of great writers out there. I don't think paying them for writing a good story is the problem. I think the real problem is that some people became completely blind and empty.

We don't know whether the things shown in the movie will be happened in the near future But keeping the content of the movie aside, the movie is worth to watch for its splendid graphics. This is typical Roland Emmerich genre film, which will have car chasing and plane chasing during heavy explosions which had similar scenes in Independence day and Godzilla. The main asset of the movie is its gripping screenplay and wonderful presentation. One can enjoy this movie to its fullest, only if it is seen on Big screen multiplexes.

I thought it would be one of those rubbish horror disaster movies that scare people about the mythical story but actually they made it into a partially funny adventurous movie which has just past the parental guidance line. It was also good the way that they split 3 stories of the movie then joined them together to make one. I have rated this movie 8 out of 10 because I thought the direction and acting was good yet the movie was a bit too long which could possibly lead to boredom plus there should of been scenes about the Mayans predicting and discovering the end of time.

To enjoy the movie I needed to ignore the clichés, plot holes, formula character situations, and heavy reliance on CGI; which I did without too much trouble. This movie owes more than a nodding acquaintance to the low budget 'B' sci-fi movie ""When Worlds Collide"" (released in 1951). (I understand there is another effort also entitled ""When Worlds Collide"" due to hit us in 2010 - though I know very little about that at this time).

But awful, even though there are great actors, and 80 minutes (at least) too long... nooooo, thank you. From the first special effects to the end credits, this movie was worse than pulling teeth. Predictable, awful script, actor efforts. All in all, just a really (and I mean epically) bad movie. Sometimes I have no idea what stars think? Like Cusack, he has been in some of my favorite movies. Do they just get a script in their hands and go ""well, for that amount of money, I will do full frontal - and a fool out of myself for years to come? This prostitution sucks the credibility out of even the best actor/actress (female people acting are still actresses as far as I am concerned - one is no better than the other) Save your hard earned cash and above all your time!

I just don't get how all his movies are so bad!I found ¨Independence Day¨ a good movie, but thanks to all his other movies, is Independence Day just one of them. Maybe he's just good in making trailers, because the trailers of all his movies are very good. John Cusack normally acts in good movies, so I don't understand why he agreed on taking this role. In this movie they also try to makes jokes sometimes, I just pooped my pants for shyness that the directer had to had at the premiere of the movie. First I thought that i was gonna see a serious movie, but when John Cusack drove through a breaking building I was about to throw my coke on the screen.

Well, I should have taken his ADVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was even worse than I thought it would be. I went to this movie knowing there would not be a plot or characterization but thought that at least the special effects would be enjoyable. What can I say, I was dead wrong. The entire movie is a cliché of scenarios and attempted suspense and thrills that have been rehashed time and again in ""blockbuster"" movies. The main characters are of course able to survive through countless impossible close calls, it seems 3/4 of the time they are the only ones who miraculously (usually luckily) survive. The special effects scenes are the same thing over and over and over again, just with different things exploding or falling. Very monotonous, over long and boring. Why did I spend my money on this!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??! OK so it made me laugh quite frequently for the first hour and a half, but those laughs were at how terrible the movie was. The rest of the time I was either sleeping or desperately waiting for the end credits (well, actually, I was waiting for everyone in the movie to die). The movie turns into a futuristic Noah's Ark at the end. Come on, I thought the world was supposed to end!!!! I didn't want to see an updated version of a fairy tale taken from the ""greatest bull**** story of all time"" (I quote George Carlin)! Why is this not getting below a 4.0?

I forgot that Emmerich essentially started it a year before Cameron when he destroyed New York and the White House in Independence Day.But we're 13 years past that grand popcorn feast's release and the Disaster Porn genre, thanks in no part to Emmerich himself (see The Day After Tomorrow – quite frankly Emmerich has to choose which way civilization is going to end already), has only gone downhill.

It's portrayed as it would were it to happen: not a lot of time to gather your thoughts or prepare or digest what you've seen.The actors/actresses in the film were true to self; acting exactly how any one would in this situation. It got me thinking, that's for sure! At some points there are suspensions of disbelief but it works so well, you don't really notice it.All in all, I have to say that this movie is the end of world movies to end end of world movies; of course, the fact that 2012 IS approaching lends credence to the theme.",2012

The main characters are in and out of peril enough to keep you munching away at the popcorn during the outstanding special effects of the disaster scenes.I do like this film for the same reasons I like DAFT.

I didn't expect much, just to be entertained, sorry Emmerich but you failed.This movie just has one cliché after another, which is not necessarily bad if it's fun. But it was boring, the suspense-scenes were to chaotic and hectic to enjoy it. Luckily the CGI was good so it didn't look ugly.The main problem was, you don't get connected with the characters, so you don't care what happens to them. Hence, you just sit and watch, but you're never on the tip of your seat in suspense.Luckily, the actors try to make as much of their characters as possible. Chiwetel Eijofor stands out by far, the only scene that you're emotionally involved is with him halfway the film.I believe, if they held Emmerich back just a little bit it would have been much more suspenseful. 2012 also should have been 20 minutes shorter, it just keeps going along.But sometimes it's entertaining, drink a couple of beers before you watch it and you'll possibly be entertained.

Sadly, the Bible got dished and God was not reverenced in any way. Prayers were made to look pointless. Lots of science and ""nature"" referenced as ""having the power to sort things out."" Several family moments with Cusack at his best made it a worthwhile movie and most enjoyable.Action and more action. A couple of twists and turns. Makes you want to buy some batteries and a flashlight and move away from California and Vegas!My wife really squeezed my hand throughout and I even got into it.

They also provide a cliché story of his family and wife who are divorced, the main character becoming the superhero of it all despite the destruction of the whole world how could he possible dodge death 10000 times to save the human race and what do you know he gets his wife back. This movie provided a thin plot which was none the less boring, while i was watching this it was like sitting there like a dog chasing his tail... endless. This movie shows nothing about society or contemporary science behind the actual theory of 2012. If i were you avoid watching you will be sadly disappointed. Go spend $15 else where.",2012

But then it sped back up again and took you on the ride of your life and had amazing visual effects. I only knocked it down a bit in my rating because of the poor dialog writing, but other than that its pure visual. The characters were somewhat believable given the circumstances they were put into, however I found myself a bit distracted from the central plot (the disaster itself) by the often overwhelming showing of the ""human-ness"" of the characters and their struggle.

Real science content - zero; intellectual content - zero; yawn content - massive.It is always a pity when the yanks take on something like this. The small-mindedness with which they are cursed always reduces the potential for a global, encompassing, complicated storyline to the personal relationship tribulations of the supporting (soon to become the saviour) character. It happens in every movie (blockbuster or not) that comes out of Hollywood.It is almost as though they can't get their heads around anything more meaningful than afternoon soap operas. For some inexplicable reason, American movies always spread the emotional and other woo-woo so thickly it is hard to take their movies seriously. This one is no exception.There is so much I could pick holes in but it would end up as a spoiler and I don't want to do that. Suffice to say, it's full of schmaltz and family values as seen from the interminably American adolescent perspective and writ small. It's a shame really.But I have acclimatised and only sat through the tedium in the vain hope that the movie might say something meaningful.

948,pratik1812,a master piece!,10,17 November 2009,"Let me tell you that i am a big fan of Roland Emmerich.The German director producer begin his career in his native Germany and went on to make epics like independence day, the day after tomorrow, Godzilla.After all the hype about this movie being the costliest a lot was expected from the movie and the movie did live up to the hype. The movie is based single-handedly on the abrupt manner in which the Mayan calendar ends in 2012.Roland Emmerich's nearly three hour (158 minutes) depiction of the end of days, essentially revolves around divorced father Jackson Curtis, played by wide eyed John Cusack, who in the tradition of these doomsday films, gets his act together to play Saviour for his estranged wife and two children.Throughout the film, the four joined by several others during their journey, ensure that they land in all important places across America, so that the audience gets a good look at the tearing up of the earth's surface in Los Angeles, Vegas (right through the Vegas strip), Wyoming, New York city and Washington DC. The destruction of Rio Di Janeiro, Buenos Aires and St Peter's Basilica, is enough to show that the world is suffering too.Sample this - The President tells his daughter, ""An unprecedented international venture is under way"". Or the scene in which Charlie, the conspiracy theorist tells ""You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire"", speculating who all might get away.Everything in this movie was grand. The visual effects were amazing, something never seen before kinds.

949,gvark-586-78752,Non-believable non-realistic and unwatchable,1,19 November 2009,"I was so looking forward to 2012. As a huge fan of the disaster movie genre I can be very lenient in grading such titles. The Day After Tomorrow scored highly with me, I was a sucker for Armageddon and Deep Impact, I saw each Airport movie about 500 times. Yet this was just a painful one to watch.So what is wrong with this piece? The plot is the usual dumb affair that sets up disaster movies. You have the scientist, the top level official, the president and the divorced guy trying to re-win the love of his wife and kids.The special effects are great. You will see great landmarks obliterated by natural disasters, you'll see pronounced great people die gracefully, you'll see the good guy trying to save everyone in dramatic fashion with special fx galore.What's wrong then? - you may ask...It loses any sense of rationality. I'm always disgruntled with horror flicks as with all rationale the first time I hear that crazy noise as any normal mortal man I would let out a high shriek and start running in the opposing direction. Yet horror movie stars are of the dumb variety and they want to see what made that deadly sounding noise.Disaster movies work because whilst the setting is mostly science fiction, the reactions are at the very least humanly possible. Here everything is just done with an extra level of dumbness. This completely ruins the whole story. I don't want to give spoilers so I'm not going to state any of these happenings, but trust me, not one moment of this movie is believable. You never have that feeling that jeez, this could really happen...This one factor practically makes the movie an unwatchable mess...",2012
950,marypooh80,Total no-brain(er),8,19 November 2009,"I give this movie 8 out of 10 but only because of the special effects, which were brilliant. Unfortunately, the movie is a real dud and you really don't have to 'think' to view it. Pure mindless drivel and if it was not for the special effects, I would recommend waiting for it to come out on Netflix. What a great storyline but frankly they blew it. Such preposterous scenes that it was quite laughable. I don't think the makers intended this to be a humorous film but it was laughingly bad. Okay, I know 'disaster' movies don't require a huge level of intelligence to view them, but at least lets have a film with some believable moments. The concept is one we have all heard about (the world is going to end in 2012) and the makers executed this theme quite well in the concept of their 'outcome' but something went wrong along the way. If they had just run with their 'ending' premise and made it more a thriller than a 'disaster' movie, I think it would have worked much better. I went to see it because I knew the special effects would be brilliant and I was not disappointed on that level. However, I did not expect much in the way of 'filling' and I was not disappointed either. Shame, it could have been a contender for a great nail biting thriller. The script smacked of laziness; a bunch of people putting their heads together to come up with some special effects to enhance an event that might or might not come true. If the world does end in 2012, it will be a shame that this movie is one of the few (that I know of anyway) that pays homage to such a catastrophic event. I mean, there's bound to be someone who will survive who can view this moronic offering of 21st century film making.",2012
951,fluffyousra,lovely special and visual effects !,7,27 November 2009,"this was the best special and visual effects i've ever seen .. The film was full of it and i really really liked it . On the other hand , the story was not good . I mean its not deep its not as good as any other movie . This movie reminds me of transformers 2 as it was full of the special effects and visual ones but there's no such a good story . The story of the 2012 movie wasn't so impressive , the story didn't catch my eye actually , it was really normal . But i can give the special and visual effects like 7 out of 10 and it really deserves u to go to the cinema that's the kind of movies u should go to the cinemas :) .I'm going to talk about the story now . I shall rate the story and i'll give it 4 out of 10 .. Yes , it deserves this rating . Its not that bad but its so shallow and its so normal . the story was so long so it was a little bit boring and also the movie shows that the whole world was destroyed and there's noway to run away .. u know! But ... at the end they made it and they was rescued .that was a bad end too!though the story was bad , the movie was so good because of the lovely special and visual effects ;)",2012

Being a big fan of The Day After Tomorrow, I had been looking forward to this film for ages, and my God I was not disappointed! From the second that our hero bundles his family into the car and speeds off across (a rapidly disintegrating) California, I was literally sat with my mouth hanging open for the rest of the film. The effects and the score keep your heart pounding in your chest and Emmerich does a fantastic job of drawing you in to the individual struggles of a select few families, in the midst of worldwide devastation.Definitely one to see in the cinema!",2012
953,valletok,Braindead but great super-movie,7,22 November 2009,"OK, the script is awful. The dialog sometimes stupid. The acting is at times stereotypical and exaggerated. Its a bit like seeing A day after tomorrow all over again, except everything is hundred times worse. The story lineup is quite similar, with scientist all over the world discovering the inevitable. Everything is moving much faster than anticipated. There is a divorced father with low parenting skills trying to save his kid(s), the American president dies and so on. Its almost as they used the same script only adding catastrophes.Having said all that this is really great entertainment. I loved it from beginning to end. This is one of these movies I would watch twice in a movie theater. Its actually great fun to see the end of the world. So go see it, just don't bother about the details, and you will enjoy the ride of your life. I fear however that this is the end of the catastrophe genre all together. There's nothing left to destroy...",2012

955,sasa-radojcic,"Great, senseless ultimate disaster popcorn movie",8,30 November 2009,"I saw the trailer, and I knew exactly what I could expect from this movie. I deliberately made the choice to see this film in a cinema, on the big screen en and the hard noise coming from huge speakers. Hello people, it's Roland Emmerich, you know, the guy who make's these huge disaster movie's! (And I do not mean disastrous as in 'bad')And it was everything I expected. Not more, and for sure not less. I hoped for 158 minutes of entertainment and I got just that. I also knew that I really, really, really not should think during this movie, I knew that there would be plot holes the size of - well - Earth, I knew that the characters would be two-dimensional but recognizable and easy to bond with.As I said, really do NOT think for a second. The plot (While earth is being fried a father/ex husband is trying to save his family) is basically one plot-hole after the other. Nothing really makes sense. Every scene about illogical as can be. I went to see this movie with a friend, and just for fun we started to name the various plot holes. We had a very enjoyable evening since we had more than enough material to talk about. And new plot holes just kept coming up!But to tell you the truth: who cares. The plot is basically there to connect the various stages (the first sign's, the bigger sign's, the really huge sign, all of earth) and sorts of destruction (Earthquake, volcano's, tsunamis) of Earth. And the film does just that with superb computer graphics. Really, do not believe those who say that the computer graphics where bad. This is 2009, it's Roland Emmerich, the guy really does know how to use a computer.So, the film was cheesy, the characters where cheesy, the music was cheesy, the plot is cheesy but the film delivered what I expected: 158 minutes of pure entertainment delivered best in a movie theater. It fits perfectly in a line with Independence Day, Armaggeddon, fifth element, and the like. Nobody is asking that these films are logical, really not, but they need to be able to entertain me while I am watching. Those film's did it, 2012 did it as well.I am giving this film 8 stars as it is a does exactly what I was expecting from this movie (pure entertainment) for it's genre (disaster movie).",2012

After every scene in the movie, I thought to myself, ""Why am I watching this?"" I suppose I wanted to give it a fair review. After seeing the previews, I expected it to be bad, but I had no idea. The narrow escapes are so unbelievable that I couldn't imagine anyone over the age of 10 enjoying them. I apologize if I have insulted any 5 year olds' intelligences with that last statement. I can't talk about the plot because it doesn't have one. This goes to show that an enormous budget doesn't make a good film. What a waste.",2012

It really annoys me that a lot of directors these days think it suffices to make an excellent trailer just so that people will come to the cinema. Or did this guy actually think he was making a master-peace? Sure the 'special-effects' were great, although after seeing Avatar it's obvious that even in that area it wasn't top of the line. The plot is so lame, predictable and the acting is terrible. I had no feeling with any of the main characters and was actually hoping they'd all die by the end of the movie. Those scenes in the car, I mean come on! Okay one jump over the cliff or through a building, but 3 or 4 times! Maybe kids will enjoy it..",2012

Billions are dieing and I should care about one American destroyed family? Scenes with airplane with 1:9999999999999999 odds every 30 seconds. When that black Dr.geologist is talking some cheap moral things (which don't work in our society system, no Sir) on screen to let those mass on ship and leaders off country agree to him. Scene when Chineese guard let our ""heroes"" enter safe zone because mother is crying? You are only mother here, and all those billionaires paid billions (which I will not comment...) but you are exception. You can pass. (I will not comment how they even got there)And why is American captain of the Chineese ship, and Americans command everything? That ridiculous American propaganda is so sick.I just wonder how can this film get 6.1 when its so bad, and so much reviews are confirming that...If you haven't watch movie please don't make my mistake, and if you plan watch it, when you feel mentally damaged by some scene (and you will feel that) turn it off and go read some book or write IMDb review.",2012

The acting is first-rate from John Cusack to Danny Glover. The movie's about a family who is trying to escape from the cataclysm. The cameo of Woody Harrelson is hilarious. The production of the movie is top-notch. The story is your basic end-of- the-world chaos.The Earth's crusts are shifting - causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions on a global scale, followed by unfriendly tsunami waves. As indicated earlier, a main reason the film worked for me was the emotional connection I felt towards some of the characters. The cast here is top notch, including some recognizable actors like Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet - and of course, John Cusack.",2012
960,jrobertson1990,It was honestly not that bad,7,8 April 2010,"I am serious. I am usually pretty harsh when it comes to critiquing movies, but this definitely didn't deserve all the horrible reviews I read. I think it might have been one of those cases where one person pointed out a flaw, then everyone saw it and only judged it based on that. These flaws were the characters' never-ending ""clutch"" escapes from their doom. Constant death-defying moments. I mean, how many times can you escape the Cataclysm? I guess more than 5 times, according to this movie. One particular example was when the family got in the car right when the earthquake happened to be at their doorstep, literally. The ground was collapsing just a few feet behind them as they ""out-drove"" the apocalypse. Okay now that I am done bashing movie, I would like to say some good things about it. John Cusack, once again, never fails to bring a calm, cool hero to the screen. Well there were a couple times he shouted and cussed, but who wouldn't if the world was ending? There were a few corny dialogues shared in the movie, but definitely not enough to lessen the score. The CGI was great and entertaining. Most might say the movie was far too long, but I think that is because movies have become far too short. I was satisfied with this movie. I think it is a great family movie, aside from the inappropriate cussing, but it was seldom. Definitely worth a rent. Though a scary subject, the apocalypse is always something interesting to see how others would portray it. Don't let these other reviews hinder you from watching this movie!

However, I didn't have that option so I've given it one star, which I've dedicated to the hot monk in order to make it justifiable.If you're really worried about the world ending on 12/21/12, then don't watch this movie because: (a) it will make you wish that you were dying sooner, and (b) on the eve of the 20th of December 2012, you'll regret having wasted 158 minutes of your life.",2012

No movie has ever taken the ""Apocalypse theme"" to the heights that 2012 did. Directed by Ronald Emmerich, the talented director behind The Day After Tomorrow and 10000 BC, this movie pushes the limits of modern CGI effects and action scenes. The pacing of the movie is great and never leaves the viewer with a moment of boredom. Along with the great action scenes, the movie also makes a great message of worldwide unity between peoples rather than money and politics. 2012 is no doubt Ronald Emmerich's biggest movie.

964,charmedmagic92,Nice special effects... where's the plot?,3,12 May 2011,"The first impression that I had of the movie before I saw it was that all of the money towards the movie was put into the special effects and that it didn't have a plot. I didn't think that I would really enjoy this movie. After watching it, I was mostly right.The plot was more predictable than a sit-com. There were very cliché moments and aspects of the movie that I've seen in so many disaster movies before this one. In the extreme chasing scenes where the main characters are running / driving / flying away from disaster, the speed of the earthquake / dust cloud seemed to match the speed of the characters, slowing down when the characters stop for a moment.The characters were under-developed and the dialog was childish. I didn't fell much emotion, either for the characters or the overall situation while watching this movie.The thing that bothered me the most was that there wasn't any attempt to explain what was causing the entire planet to just unleash hell everywhere with super-volcanoes, earthquakes, and flooding. The only thing that was mentioned was something about the sun aligning in the center of the galaxy. What does that have to do with anything?? Movies like Day After Tomorrow, Twister, the Core, and even some B-movies would at least have some sort of logic into the explanation as to what was causing the chaos, even if it is the typical blaming of global warming.However, I would be wrong to say that I didn't enjoy watching the movie; even if to satisfy the simple thrill of watching a super-disaster; just like riding a roller-coaster. After all, the special effects were phenomenal and visually realistic. Too bad the plot wasn't.",2012
965,harshavardhan-in,It was a best disaster movie ever,10,13 August 2011,"The movie was fully entertaining , with all the stunning visual effects, explosions , the volcanoes , Tsunamis ...you name it. Rolland Emerich managed to put all kinds of disasters that can ( cant ) ever happen in the world together and managed to make a movie out of it.The movie does have some ..infact many plot holes.. you cant just run away from an earth quake in a limo you should be lucky to have a wife whose lover coincidentally happens to be a pilot... you happen to know someone on the ship who can get you inside of it without paying the single penny... AND you have to be lucky enough to be working for Russian billionaire who is actually going to board the ship and can offer a ride in his plane..........I should say John Cusack is the luckiest guy on earth if such a disaster happens.But if we set aside all those things and watch it like movie ,,it is entertaining as hell..It is pretty much impossible but I loved the Earthquake sequence where John Cusack and his family escape in a limo.. Visual Effects were stunning and no one can deny that...If you are looking for complete all action and entertainment flick then this is it...

966,mdplayer82,"Every character serves a purpose, but none are fully developed",5,15 November 2009,"Until I sat down and actually looked at the billing on IMDb, I thought John Cusack's character name is Curtis Jackon (50 Cent? No, Its actually Jackson Curtis). While that is laughable, it is not as ridiculous as Carl Anheuser (the name of Oliver Platt's character). In my mind, I kept on thinking, ""I need a beer!"" and ""When the hell are they gonna introduce a character named ""Busch"" whenever they mention his name. If the movie theater actually served alcohol, I would think this is subliminal advertising.As ridiculous and laughable as the names are, the # of times that the main characters escape every disaster situation virtually unscathed is out right unbelievable. Its almost as if the writers were hinting, ""We're not trying to make this movie real, just enjoy the eye candy as the masses succumb to every predicament nature can come up with"".At 2 hours 38 minutes, this movie is hovering the line of being uncomfortable long. But once the first disaster hits, the pacing is quite fast. I wasn't bored throughout the movie. It did come at a cost though. I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters, with maybe the exception of John Cusack's on-screen daughter. Amanda Peet, playing John's ex-wife, was stilted and lifeless. The special effects was more interesting than she was. Woody Harrelson was the scene stealer. I wouldn't say he saved this movie in terms of the acting, but without him, they could have replaced all actors with robots and I wouldn't have noticed the difference.I can forgive the bad acting and the badly written script. After all, it is a disaster movie. It doesn't need either to draw in the audience. The idea this movie presents is enough to attract tons of movie-goers, as the $65 million weekend box office suggests. But as disaster movie goes, this is pretty low on my list.",2012

Emmerich keeps copying his own disaster movies and the copies are becoming very pale now. Uninspired acting by Cusack, Platt, Glover and others. Harrelson's performance is way over the top. He is not at all funny but I don't even know whether he was meant to be funny. The plot and action scenes are not at all credible. Even within the context of the movie everything is much too unlikely. The movie had a lot of potential but was never on track right from the beginning. It's a total waste of time and money.

The entire length of this film I was stunned, sitting there in the theater watching this latest baby from Hollywood that really should have just been aborted. The main problem with it is: A. Horrible, boring, and predictable plotting. B. Utterly disgusting and stupid dialog that makes screenwriters cringe everywhere, worldwide. c. Acting that is as wooden as a chair-and I shall not waste any more words describing it as I am already getting bored thinking about it and writing this here review.

Frankly, the 5 minute or so clip that was released to TV and the Internet showing the family's escape from LA was the best part of the movie. The interesting thing is that I'm really on an apocalypse / end of the world / end of civilization kick lately, and 2012 didn't impress. Maybe it needed to be darker, more brooding? I expect that I'll really enjoy The Road when I eventually see it, and figure it will be a more satisfying ""end of the world"" film.

Everyone has something to hate about this film but the movie wasn't intending to be 'Gone With The Wind'. This is the essential Friday night movie.Not Saturday Night but Friday Night. Sure, a lot of it is illogical and Rolland Emmerich graduated in the MTV style of directing college but, at it's heart, it's just a great entertaining popcorn movie. Even Bay has admitted that was what he was aiming at. And for a popcorn movie, it's a very strong movie indeed. The acting is impressive with Bruce Willis making you cry for real in that last scene of his where he proves to be the ultimate superhero and he doesn't even have to say ""yippee ki-yay"". Cusack is doing his nice hammy acting in this film but he gives a really genuine performance in a lot of the scenes. Liv Tyler is stunning and excellent as Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's fiancée. Billy Bob Thorton has a nice little role at the NASA headquarters. Steve Buscemi is the best part of the film. Funny yet still a great actor, this is one of his best performances. Michael Clarke Duncan is light in his role as one of the astronauts / oil driller and Owen Wilson lights up the screen just like in 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. That's only some of the cast that I'm going to list and those are the most recognizable names in the list. The script by 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' scribe Jonathan Hensleigh and 'Roadkill"" and upcoming 'Superman' writer J.J.Abrahams is fun and enjoyable with some real quirky dialogue and real funny bits. There are also some genuine moments of suspense and drama. The look of this film is obviously special effects orientated with the New York asteroid shower opening sequence and the destruction of Paris standing out. Of course, this film is just an enjoyable popcorn film and is actually deserving of it's place in ""The Criterion Collection"" of DVDs since it's that enjoyable kind of film that only comes along once in a while. But add to that the fact that there are some real sad moments and great acting in there and, there you have it, the perfect ingredients for a Friday night movie.",2012

Also, after reading some other user reviews I can only assume that many of them have not seen real earthquakes, tsunamis, or explosions; because they look unbelievably real in this movie, and yet some claim that the CGI is horrible. There was literally no part of this movie that ever looked fake to me, and I watched it on Blu-Ray. The sound mixing is outstanding, and if you watch the movie on a nice surround system it sounds truly amazing. The actors all do a great job too. I know tons of people who like this movie, but unfortunately most of the people who actually take the time to get on here and rate it are the ones who think they know everything, or that they could do better, or just the simple few who are not into disaster movies.

974,ridley_coppola,What happened to the Mayan prophecy?,5,11 November 2009,"I went to an advance screening of 2012 a few nights ago and I have to admit that this movie was entertaining at best and that's it. The whole movie is almost entirely comprised of special effects. Of course you'll see all of the lead characters survive scenarios that a regular human being would not. Some of the scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that you want to laugh at the fodder that's being expected of you to believe. Emmerich certainly pushes ""suspension of disbelief"" to its limit.John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are the only actors that attempt to hold the film together, while Danny Glover and Thandie Newton were an utter and complete let-down considering their previous work history. You won't see any remotely Oscar-worthy performances here. The casting of this film seemed off and poorly executed. You could tell the bulk of the financial budget went to the special effects and not the actors.The thing that I found thoroughly disappointing about 2012 is that it's almost entirely lacking of any interesting backstory or intellectual substance whatsoever. There's very little mention of the Mayan calendar, Mayan history, or any of the prophetic wisdom that has foreseen the supposed end of days. The fear, analysis, curiosity, and everything else you've ever wondered about this new mysterious year that is quickly approaching is almost entirely removed from this film. That would have and could have made this film closer to a 10 if I didn't feel like my brain was utterly wasted on this CGI and special effects bonanza. They try to cram so many explosions, eruptions, earthquakes, and natural disasters into two hours that I might be a little desensitized to the real thing if it ever happens. After awhile nothing felt realistic or interesting about it at all.It's novelty entertainment at best and that's it. You won't wince at how painfully awful this movie is, and you won't walk away knowing anything meaningful about 2012, but hopefully you'll help repay Sony pictures for the exorbitant amount of money that they and Roland Emmerich spent on their special effects budget.

Mr Roland does this quite a bit in his movies when there is total havoc occurring and then 'tries' to break the tension with an attempt at humor. I honestly think this approach has made some of his movies seem silly. I mean, isn't that what we see these movies for? The tension? (Case in point also ""Godzilla"" and ""ID4""). All these movies had great potential for the human element but instead focused on effects rather than the human scale of tragedy. These were not funny situations so why try to be funny? It fails in my opinion. Don't make a serious situation then lace it with laughs. Now if your are like a lot of viewers today and could care less about any believability, then this is the movie for you! If all you crave is explosions, earthquakes, tidal waves and the like then you wont care if the characters are/act stupid. But there are some of us out there who like the action but ALSO like some realistic approaches when it comes to people, not stereotypes & silly accents. Yes, this movie is about the end of the world, billions upon billions of deaths, disaster all around and it should be treated in a darker manner instead of like watching an afternoon matinée of Dagwood Bumstead. Its very hard to sympathize with any character since the script seemed to fail in every direction. I mean, why spend 200 million just to have people laugh and be uncaring? Effects, effects, effects is the answer. It seems all people want anymore is just a bunch of explosions on the silver screen. Some of us crave a bit more than visual stimulation. Now, like I stated that if its just ""Bing Bam Boom"" is all you want, then this is the flick but if you want a bit more of a human story then I would steer clear. I honestly believe giving this a 5 star rating is being overly generous. I leave it up to the viewer to decide.",2012

The visuals, well they looked clunky to be honest, the sort of wholesale destruction and amount of energy released to achieve it would have made most scenes a smoky grey ash haze but reality never intrudes in movie world so they were clear and clean and totally unbelievable as a result. I don't care how good your driving or your stretch limo is, you get amongst that lot for real and you die. I guess if hopeless pilots with box cutters can bring down steel framed and concrete high rise buildings in New York then sure, some plastic cutter can fly a twin engine slow plane through disaster even better than a limo can drive through it. From there it just gets worse, terrible stereotypes of the Russian billionaire and his girlfriend and family/pilot etc...yet Americans hate being stereotyped themselves so why do it? More special effects that wasted good computing power and money to achieve no impact and some cursory humanity to let a few unwashed masses aboard the arks in the face of the latest setback at that point. Why bother? like nuclear Armageddon the living will envy the dead. Another critic wrote that burning the money and filming it would have been more dramatic, I agree. Stay away from this unless you have eaten something bad and need to vomit without taking ipecac to get that started, this will do it for you!",2012
979,lloyddriscoll,Too much style too little substance,4,12 November 2009,"An effects laden extravaganza with a lame duck script serving up every movie cliché on the books. A president who gives his all and shows the common touch in his country's hour of greatest need. An evil self serving bureaucrat eventually trumped by a goody two shoes whose diatribe on humanity and compassion was vomit inducing. The estranged couple who are at one another's throats from the get go yet amazingly reunited at conclusion. The evil Soviet tycoon with detestable overweight and indulged children. Fabulous almost flawless images on a mighty scale of destruction and devastation and a sound track which nails you to your seat, but sadly way too much dialogue from one dimensional characters whose words were telegraphed an hour before they took the trouble to speak. And as for Woody Harrelson..I hope he needed the money.",2012
980,gmatgerlich,"Not the best disaster movie, not the worst.",7,19 November 2020,"So I'm a HUGE disaster movie buff. Absolutely love them, especially when it's made by Roland. This one is probably my least favorite Roland disaster, but I still really enjoy it. Just like in most disaster movies, there's of course going to be unrealistic scenarios. Because well, it's a movie. If you're one of those people who dissect every scene & try to decide if it's realistic or not, then you just simply lack a creative mind, and this movie is not for you.. or any adventurous movie if you're like that. However, there are a few parts where I could see it happening if the world did come to an end this way, such as the arks.If you go into this expecting a perfect, flawless flick with no goofs, A ++ acting & dialogue, then of course you're going to be disappointed. Overall, the acting was definitely good for the most part & I would give it a B. This is how I would grade it personally.Acting: B+
Writing: B
Directing: B+
Editing: A
Sound: AI'm not gonna rate every little category but usually when I want to watch something new, I look at those 5 specifically.As I wrap this review up, there is one thing that I would like to mention that surprisingly, I haven't seen anyone else bring up yet. The one thing that absolutely drove me insane & wanting to rip my skin off my face was the little girl, Lilly who is Jackson's(Cusack) daughter, SCREAMING Daddy throughout the entire movie. There has to be at least 20 times if not more where she's screaming it! It's absolutely ear piercing the way she does it. I'm sure most of them were done in post rather then during filming. But they could've taken at least 17-18 of those out and I still would've enjoyed the movie.Hope you enjoyed my review. Take care.",2012

It asks you to beat belief down, grind it up, stomp on it, then choke it down with vinegar. It is nothing more than a collection of never ending explosions, gratuitous special effects, punctuated with lame dialogue. The actors must have had their doubts during the filming, they seem so mechanical and predictable. They surely knew they were trying to polish a turd of a story. The writers did not trouble themselves with anything inconvenient like facts or real science when they created the premise or storyline of the film. They just made a bunch of stuff up that makes no sense, and blew up the world 50x over in CGI. I lost count of how many sharks were jumped in this travesty of a story. I cannot believe the writers did not go for the cliché dove with an olive branch at the end, but I suppose they were able to resist the temptation to be that predictable.Grab a few beers before you watch this one, you are going to need them...",2012

The visual effects were interesting enough, as expected. But rather than a sinister glee, I reacted to seeing the world ""destroyed"" before my eyes with an unexpected sort of sadness.I enjoyed 2012, but ultimately the plot is pretty much what one would expect. What I think is 2012's real triumph is not so much the survival of ""humanity"" - that is, human compassion - but to capture the ""quiet"" moments of the humanity in grief and loss: a father failing to reconcile with his son, a son and father privately coming to terms with the end, a family huddled together as they watch a tsunami crash down on them.The film's most irritating aspect is actually Roland Emmerich's own personal opinions that littered the film. While a film like 2012 might perhaps be reasonably anti-religious, Emmerich's over-emphasized opinion on the useless nature of religion is at times distracting.",2012
987,Metalshad0,Typical Roland Emmerich movie with serious localization issues,2,12 November 2009,"The Story itself is kind of typical for a Roland Emmerich movie. The question of whether to believe or not is being asked in a kind of very cheesy way...I'm not sure if Emmerich even had a color correction team work on the movie. It feels very unstatic considering the movie quality.The actors are already only average. The worst are the German voice actors. I've never seen a professionally made movie like this one use such bad actors on screen and have such horrible voice actors. Not only do they lack ability, but they have also been cast horribly.This completely ruins an otherwise average screenplay that has quite interesting camera twists in it.Another question (I'm a passionate photographer). Why do, when a photographer looks through his camera, they put in the battery status and the time the video has been recorded. To me there were too many logical errors in this movie.Next to the bad voice acting and their casting...makes this movie unenjoyable...Godzilla was a master-piece in comparison to this!

In this movie the director only wanted to say their is no god no body cares humans except themselves. I heared that the director wanted to make a plan that mecca is been destroying. if you care in the Vatican scene significantly the painting cracks from the place that God is touching Christ, And also at the end of the movie the only religious missionary who survived was a Lama that they believe there is no god but they are really kind and moral.

989,carolanhannah,Severely underrated movie!,9,4 August 2018,"Disaster movies tend to follow a basic formula; focus on protagonist and their family, everything is good to fine, disasters begin happening, protagonist and family have to find someway to be safe, protagonist and family saved and live in the end. This film is no different in that aspect, however I honestly don't understand the hate this movie has received? Generally I don't tend to trust critics reviews anyway and for this I was right not to. Yeah in terms of story line it's your basic disaster movie formula, but the way this movie is filmed and the focus on quite a large amount of characters outside the protagonist and his family is done beautifully! The special effects are so brilliant they honestly have me grasping my seat and holding my breath even though I've seen this movie on 3 different occasions (it's on tv now that's why I decided to do this review). The disaster scenes are done so so well and again make me anxious each time I've seen them (and that's not just because of my conditioned fear of Tsunamis since 2004). I do love John Cusack and he is great in this and does a great job portraying Jackson, the protagonist of this movie. In fact all the main actors are great in this, the only nit pick I have is with Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Adrian, in the scene where he's on his phone to his dad for the last time saying goodbye. Too me he didn't seem sad enough for a conversation you know is going to be the last before your father perishes in the middle of the ocean somewhere. But again that's just a nit pick, don't get me wrong he was brilliant in this movie and really did have a sense of urgency about him. Also the scene where he addresses all the leaders about opening the gate was fantastic and he did a great job of portraying that. The devastation scenes are what really tie this movie together though (which would make sense for a disaster movie), I've never seen a movie portray worldwide disaster so well. The scream in the distance, people clammering as they fall from buildings being shattered by earthquakes, the fires in the distance, it just all seemed so real and raw that it honestly gives me shivers every time. Sometimes in movies like this the special effects can just make the movie too ""actiony"" and eye roll worthy, but the scenes just portrayed what that would really be like so so well. If you don't like disaster movies I still say give this movie a chance! It's got a really important message that is not cringe worthy (as they can be in these types of movies) but actually really important and relevant. And not just in a Climate change way. On a deeper level I feel this movie comments on class differences by showing in situations like this the 99% would realistically be left behind, and we always do in many aspects of society and culture. But all in all this movie ticks all the boxes of a movie of this kind for me; great special effects, tension, family dynamic, multiple characters focused on just the right amount, a message that is important and relevant for our time, and just an interesting movie that keeps your concentration the whole way through. If you haven't already give this movie a watch! Honestly each time I've seen this movie I've appreciated it a little more.",2012
990,vanitsky,It's that sad: the worst Emmerich's movie,4,19 December 2009,"I gave 4 stars - and all of them for computer animation. MOVIE (""scientific"" aspect): 1. The most intriguing concept of ""orange peel"" - instant change of the Earth's poles - was presented in the movie so fast that many viewers (most of them are not experts in geography and related areas) simply had no chance to understand what actually caused the catastrophe. Visually all is seen as volcanos' eruptions everywhere, earthquakes and tsunami. So almost all of my friends could not get the idea: how the wave could possibly reach altitude of 7,000 m (24,000 feet) if it is known from 2004 that tsunami loses its force after landfall? 2. The Mayan calendar's issue is irrelevant to the ""orange peel"" concept, as much as the planets' parade expected in the year 2012. MOVIE (script/directing): 1. Excellent actors were not simply in a position to perform: there were no dialogs in the movie - just one-two line(s) ""verbal shots"". Bad guys - as it used to be - had some more space. Oliver Platt was quite good as a White House bad guy. A Russian billionaire is something new on the screen - but still looking and acting like previous era ""Russian mafia"" bad guy. 2. The script is a combination of stereotypes ""Dad, I love you! - mom, I love you!"" - and panoramic views of the end of the world. 3. Technical details - oh, it's just a movie! No need to know that airplanes' engines can't work in volcano ash. No reality is needed or requested. It's just a show.

Irony I suppose considering my belief that these scenarios actually would not happen. However I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Sure there was a little corny down to earth scenes. I thought that was a nice touch and having John Cusack play this role was a perfect match. So I think it' actually helped John's career. After seeing this it was very hard not to tell anyone. All I could say was ""you have to see it"" you won't believe how it ends...I never expected that. I do believe we need to start doing our part in recycling...I subscribe to using the blue recycle bin -it's only $4 a month & cuts down on a lot of trash.

The first was Brüno, but in contrast to Brüno 2012 doesn't get better near the end, it even gets worse.The action-sequences are not only highly unrealistic and badly scripted, they are also absolutely boring and have special-effects far from up to date.Spoiler: The main characters should have died, if the action was meant to be a realistic event, more than 10 times just during the first runaway in San Francisco.This movie is also full of clichés and lacks good acting. Almost none of the characters (except the U.S. president and some of the scientist) appear authentic. The worst and most misplaced character the conspiracy-blogger played by Woody Harrelson.Even worse the director inserted comedy-elements in this movie, which are not only bad but have nothing to do in a movie with this topic.There is no tension building up while viewing this movie. Every time the director tries to build in a tension-break you already know exactly what will happen. Even so is there not even a real climax in this movie. Other than in Independence Day where you are waiting eagerly what will happen next, in 2012 you just think ""how bad will be the next try to show some ""exciting"" moment"". Spoiler: The ""highlight"" is the scene near the end when Tamaras dog is running over an anchor-cable toward her on the departing ark. And just when the movie appeals to the ""good in humanity"" you can just shake your head and ask yourself why you just then see some of the characters with the most inhumane behavior survive. Needless to say that even the one-man-saves-all moment has its place in this movie.Combined: 9 Euros and 158min of lifetime wasted.",2012

My low point: towards the end of the movie Peet's character has her husband killed in action. That was expected, since he's depicted as a moron throughout the entire movie. And in Emmerich flicks the moron gets what he deserves, right? Maybe an hour later (an hour in the story) Cusack's character saves the day, and he ends up making out with his ex wife (Peet). Believable? Get this: she replies, 'where have you been all my life?' This is someone who just lost her spouse. How imbecile do those film makers think we are?Great CGI, though...",2012

Although the special effects were great, the pace of the movie was quite slow and makes you yawn at times. The cinematography was breathtaking but the screenplay was not as good.Scientifically, there were so many errors made in the film that we tend to laugh at such absurdity being displayed on screen. The movie seems to be influenced from all of Roland's previous disaster flicks. There was no mention of any backing for the theory of the end of world in 2012. There wasn't much comedy in the movie and few instances thrown here and there don't make you even smile.

(One reviewer compared the action sequences to the Dukes of Hazzard and I agree; I kept waiting for the car to freeze midair with fallen leaves trailing behind it and Waylon Jennings to do his voice-over.) It seems that all Hollywood has to offer is poorly done remakes and special effects driven garbage like this. (Start watching foreign films; you'll be astounded to see real acting!) My only consolation is that I saw it for free on one of my movie channels and didn't waste a Netflix rental or money on a movie ticket.

1006,yknx02,CGI made boring,1,16 July 2010,"Well it's a disaster movie and you don't expect these to be actually good. You know who the bad guys and the good guys are going to be - you know there'll be a big speech making the cynical politician remember his humanity, you know the guy will get back with his ex-wife, you know her current husband (having shown himself a good guy after all) will die while the hero attempts vainly to save him. There was not a single scene in the movie which wasn't a tired cliché.I suppose all the ""last-minute saves"" are supposed to increase tension - but you know what? After 20 last minute saves, you just want the hero to die.The science and engineering in the movie is so painfully stupid it hurts. It's fine to suspend disbelief at some point, but if you have to do that on a once-a-minute basis it just becomes tiring.But there was lots of advanced CGI in the film - watching that should at least be entertaining, right? Well no, it's just the same stuff over and over again. The earthquake splitting the ground just behind the Hero's fleeing car for miles and miles and miles, followed by another earthquake splitting the ground just behind the hero's plane taking off. And then we follow that by a scene of the hero fleeing in a camper van, with the vulcano bombarding the ground just behind the car - for miles and miles. Then the hero has to outrun a starting plane - obviously with an earthquake swallowing the ground just behind him as he dashes along the runway. Climbing into the plane of course the ground is splitting just behind the plane as it takes off.Are you bored yet? No - well that's great because we'll repeat that scene for a few more times before the movie is over. Same with the ""ground swallows up people and buildings"" and ""sky scrapers toppling into the ocean"" and ""national landmarks falling over"" scenes. Hey if it's impressive to watch once, you'll be impressed again if we show it another 15 times, right? In the end Emmerich didn't even spare us the scene where the (vapid looking but really has a heart of gold) Russian mistress off the rich tycoon looses her life trying to save her little dog.He didn't even squash that annoying dog, not even the annoying little dog.",2012
1007,awesomesaucey-94192,"The late, great planet Earth: A thoroughly destroyable show",8,10 June 2021,"It's not so much that the Earth is destroyed, but that it's done so thoroughly. ""2012,"" the mother of all disaster movies (and the father, and the extended family) spends half an hour on ominous set-up scenes (scientists warn, strange events occur, prophets rant and of course a family is introduced) and then unleashes two hours of cataclysmic special events hammering the Earth relentlessly.This is fun. ""2012"" delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else, it will be, for its audiences, one of the most satisfactory films of the year. It even has real actors in it. Like all the best disaster movies, it's funniest at its most hysterical. You think you've seen end-of-the-world movies? This one ends the world, stomps on it, grinds it up and spits it out.It also continues a recent trend toward the wholesale destruction of famous monuments. Roland Emmerich, the director and co-writer, has been vandalizing monuments for years, as in ""Independence Day,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla."" I still hold a grudge against him for that one because he provided New York with a Mayor Ebert and didn't have Godzilla step on me and then squish me.Emmerich thinks on a big scale. Yes, he destroys regular stuff. It will come as little surprise (because at this writing the film's trailer on YouTube alone had more than 7,591,413 views) that the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy rides a tsunami onto the White House. When St. Peter's Basilica is destroyed, Leonardo's God and Adam are split apart just where their fingers touch (the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel having been moved into St. Peter's for the occasion). Then when Emmerich gets warmed up, the globe's tectonic plates shift thousands of miles, water covers the planet, and a giraffe walks aboard an ark.Also on board are the humans chosen to survive, including all the characters who have not already been crushed, drowned or fallen into great crevices opening up in the Earth. These include the heroic Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his estranged wife, Kate (Amanda Peet); President Wilson (Danny Glover), his chief science adviser, Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and his chief of staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt).Many gigantic arks have been secretly constructed inside the Himalayas by the Chinese, funded by a global consortium, and they're the only chance of the human race surviving. Along with the animals on board, there's the maybe well-named Noah (Liam James). In theory, ark ticketholders represent a cross-section of the globe, chosen democratically. In practice, Carl Anheuser pulls strings to benefit the rich and connected, and wants to strand desperate poor people on the dock. I'm thinking, Emmerich often has a twist when he names villains, like Mayor Ebert from ""Godzilla."" So how did this villain get his name? What does ""Anheuser"" make you think of?Such questions pale by comparison with more alarming events. The tectonic plates shift so violently scientists can almost see them on Google Earth. This havoc requires stupendous special effects. Emmerich's budget was $250 million, and ""2012"" may contain more f/x in total running time than any other film. They're impressive. Not always convincing, because how can the flooding of the Himalayas be made convincing? And Emmerich gives us time to regard the effects and appreciate them, even savor them, unlike the ADD generation and its quick-cutting Bay-cams.Emmmerich also constructs dramatic real-scale illusions, as when an earthquake fissure splits a grocery store in half. Cusack is the hero in an elaborate sequence involving his desperate attempts to unblock a jammed hydraulic lift that threatens to sink the ark. He does a lot of heroic stuff in this film, especially for a novelist, like leaping a van over a yawning chasm and riding a small plane through roiling clouds of earthquake dust.The bottom line is: The movie gives you your money's worth. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it one of the year's best? No. Does Emmerich hammer it together with his elbows from parts obtained from the Used Disaster Movie Store? Yes. But is it about as good as a movie in this genre can be? Yes. No doubt it will inflame fears about our demise on Dec. 21, 2012. I'm worried, too. I expect that to be even worse than Y2K.",2012
1008,maxnoxon,Unrealistic but entertaining,5,4 July 2021,"In the film 2012, the cause of the apocalypse was a dramatic increase in temperature of the Earth's core caused by a massive solar flare. The resulting disasters included massive earthquakes and tsunamis that hit every continent in the world. Earth's landmass was shifted more than a thousand miles due to the tectonic plates being destabilized. This resulted in massive volcanic eruptions with lava spewing from fault lines as well. The disasters in the movie killed billions of people and only a select few survived the apocalypse by building massive arks and ships that could withstand the elements.In the movie, a solar flare is the cause of the Earth's apocalypse and the disasters that took place were very dramatized. The earthquakes that occurred in Los Angeles had chunks of land that rose thousands of feet in the air and others that caused canyons and trenches thousands of feet deep. Tsunamis reached heights of over fifteen hundred meters and the aftermath showed Mount Everest being almost completely submerged by water. The movie was clearly influenced, and the disasters exaggerated by Hollywood to make more money in the box office. Planes flying through falling buildings and cars driving through offices during an earthquake make the entire movie seem very unrealistic. The movie is clearly meant to play on people's fear of the end of the world and should not be taken seriously whatsoever. The concept of the Mayans predicting the end of the world thousands of years ago is just a fever dream of superstitious people. For the movie to be more realistic, the scale of the disasters would be no where near as severe and probably would not wipe out all life on every continent. After all, when the dinosaurs went extinct millions of years ago not every species died with them. The human response to these disasters was to build massive ships that could survive the impact and aftermath of Tsunamis. The ships were easily the biggest ever created and were comprised completely of metal that had anchors to dig into the sides of mountains and the ground. The movie may be fiction and the hazard science in the film was blown way out of proportion, but it was entertaining anyways.",2012
1009,ldifalco,Not bad but not great either,6,9 December 2009,"The problem with disaster films anymore is that they are way too cartoonish. 2012 continues this trend. I get it. I know I'm supposed to check my brain at the ticket booth but that doesn't mean the movie can't be made to make me feel that it is real. If you want me to buy into the premise that the world is going to end on 12/21/2012 because the Mayans, who couldn't predict their own demise, somehow figured out ours would end in three years, the director has to make everything else in the story as believable as possible. My main criticism of the film is the way our heroes constantly avoid destruction. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) in his car and later an RV out run every crack in the pavement and rocks hurled from volcanoes. At one point he drives a limousine through a falling skyscraper and manages to come out the other side before the building completely flattens. Later Curtis and his family leave LA in a plane which narrowly takes off as the runway collapses beneath them. The pilot, Kate Curtis's (Amanda Peet) new husband had a few flying lessons, never flew a two engine plane, but yet flies through LA skyscrapers as they are falling all around them. During these moments, and there are many of them, you feel the director is winking at you, letting you know it's just BS. That's the problem, I never felt as if the main characters were in any danger. After these initial stunts, you knew they would make it to the end unscathed except for the one character who predictably buys the farm with little remorse shown for his loss. The special effects were amazing but to me, so were the effects in Star Trek which had a much better storyline. This genre of movie has become nothing more than a vehicle for effects. This film could have been so much better if the characters were close to the danger but never in it. The tension could have been built by wondering how long could the characters stay ahead of harm's way while still having the effects illustrate the horror that was occurring from where they had been. 2012 is not awful but it was not good either. Something as big as the world ending, should have been treated in a more serious way. But Columbia Pictures will make a mint on the film and that's what film making is about these days anyway. Personally, I'd wait for the Blu Ray release.",2012

1012,bobojojok,Just another blockbuster,5,17 November 2009,"""The End of the world"" theme is not new and has always scared the easy-to-believe ones. Death is what people fear most and when there is given an occasion the be frightened why not use it? 2012 is one of those movies showing us what may happen if the Mayas(in this case) were right. The great visual effects( too many at some places, but despite that, really well made) are the only thing that I wanted to see in this movie. The plot is shallow and you know what will happen in every single moment. There are no surprises, we have seen this kind of movies before, nothing new. The actors are not convincing, the romantic scenes and the jokes are quite inappropriate and to my opinion they don't match such a dramatic event as the extinction of the human race. The movie should have been much more serious, darker and make us feel at least a little frightened that such thing might really happen. Even Woody Harrelsons' role couldn't save me from being bored and laughing at all the clichés that Emerich used again in his movie. We see him destroying the world for the third? time and always giving us hope, a happy ending, a boring romantic story and some dumb jokes..Anyways if you don't have anything better to do on a Saturday night and have the wish to see the newest blockbuster with visual effects for some 200 million dollars this is your movie. Otherwise head for something more thought-provoking:)I hope my comment was useful, it is my first one so don't hate me too much;)",2012
1013,j-bittens-1,"Not quite the end of the world, but more than likely the end of Roland Emmerich's career",1,22 November 2009,"There are some movies that should just really not be made. 2012 isn't one of those, but its incredibly awful execution really makes you wish otherwise. What was a good idea (though it was the same good idea we saw in Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow... and so many other films of this nature) had potential. There was a lot of money behind this thing, obviously, but it would appear that all this money went towards the effects. The effects are stellar for the most part, but are so over done that you truly feel the extent to which the filmmakers failed in every other way. The plot is dumb, the acting, with the notable exception of Woody Harrelson playing... himself, is hard to watch, and the effects, believe it or not, are not worth it. I say this not because they were anything short of amazing, but because there is so much effect that you find yourself sick of it. It's not always easy to sit through a brainless movie without good effects. But it's quite difficult to sit through a near 3-hour movie with only effects. The film had nothing else to offer. The attempts to ask moral and ethical question are skewed and ineffective. The characters are so expendable, as you will quickly discover, that it's nearly impossible to care about them. And the few characters that you do end up caring about are the ones that the filmmakers seemed to care the least about, and so they get very little screen time. The camera work is alright at times, though there are a few awkward switches between techniques.If you, however, are only looking for a way to kill three hours, and you have not seen a lot of movies like this before, perhaps 2012 is for you. If you're looking for anything more to this film, though, you will likely be thoroughly disappointed. Don't spend 10 dollars on this, rent it on DVD, watch it on a big HD screen and huff a lot of propane, and this movie will be your favorite film of all time.It is a bit sad, because I must say that Emmerich's films in the past, particularly Independence Day, were quite good. This one just isn't.Hopefully Hollywood will figure out that bigger budget isn't always better movie... someday. For now, let us sit back and wait to see if James Cameron follows in Roland Emmerich's footsteps with his Avatar film.",2012
1014,canefaitrien,Another great experience from Emmerich,9,13 November 2009,"Let me begin by saying that I don't know where the heck all these so-called ""critics"" are coming from. And the fact that these people thrive on negative criticism further bolsters the mystery.I guess what I'm trying to say is this: DO NOT MIND THE ""CRITICS"".About the movie, well, two words: GREAT EXPERIENCE.It really had me sucked into its world and I was virtually lost in it. The special effects were incredible and all the actors (and extras) involved really did an amazing job making this movie. Not once did I look at my watch nor did I hesitate to go the restroom (such are subtle signs of a, um, ""bad"" movie). By all means, the price I paid for my movie ticket was practically a steal. WATCH IT.Probably the only thing I disliked in this project/movie was that it was designed to cater to EVERY audience; henceforth, it just had to have some scenes tailored for different people. In this regard, unnecessary, cheesy and downright out-of-place scenes (among other things) were included (but for other types of audiences, it maybe alright or ""appropriate"").All in all, however, really amazing. Do not believe the ""critics"" who dub this movie ""mindless"" or ""lacking in depth"" or all those poorly used words. In fact, don't listen to any of them, at all. Just go see it, yourself. You'll thank me after the movie.",2012
1015,princeklub,2012 - The world as we know it will come to an end,8,8 November 2009,"I was on my way out of a theater in Plano, Texas when I was lucky enough to be offered a free ticket to a preview showing of 2012 thirty minutes away. So let's just throw this out on the table: you heard and saw the entire premise in the trailers. Expect nothing more, and nothing less. 2012 is your typical disaster story, but it does contains deeper overtones and more spectacular special effects than what recent apocalyptic movies have been feeding us. The first half of the film, akin to The Day After Tomorrow, consists of nature's first ""warning"" signs and scientific exploration of how to prevent the destruction of the world, with, of course, the U.S. government leading the way. As the events lead to the fated date in 2012, we are introduced to the typical dysfunctional family of divorced parents and two kids, with Cusack as a father that neglects his children in order to pursue his writing career. Surprisingly, the large majority of the film is not centered on Cusack's character of Jackson Curtis or his family. A large handful of characters from diverse backgrounds share equal screen time, including Chiwetel Ejiofor as a government adviser, Danny Glover as the President, Woody Harrelson as a crazed fanatic, and Osric Chau as a Tibetan monk. Not to fear, acting was not a considerable problem among any of the actors/actresses. In fact, there were several unexpectedly emotional farewell scenes that were masterfully written in. This was a good move, seeing as a wide range of affected and interlinked characters prevented the clichés that would come from following just one family. That's not to say 2012 doesn't have its clichés. Like I said, the story doesn't deviate far from awesome destruction, to the narrow escapes, to the valiant attempt to preserve mankind. There is one thing I must say though: if you're going to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it on the big screen. If you weren't able to tell from the previews, 2012 boasts some of the most incredible CGI sequences, probably in movie history. The movie consistently bombards the audience with scene after scene of satisfying disasters: the annihilation of California, the eruption of Yellowstone, and the volcanic destruction of Hawaii, to name a few. The action sequences were so thrilling and intense that several times I felt myself shaking in anticipation. When it comes to effects, there's never one second when 2012 fails you. Ultimately, the story winds down to the attempt to save mankind by boarding ""arks"" China has built. One problem: there's 15 minutes to go before tidal waves engulf China along with the rest of the Earth and there are still hundreds of people waiting to get on the arks. Here's where the clichés skyrocket with patriotic speeches and deep interpretations of humanity. Following the pattern of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow, the ending is a happy one (and we'll just ignore that fact that almost every living thing on Earth has been killed)! Needless to say, even though 2012 touches on some deeper overtones involving us as human beings, the ending is slightly awkward and the action somewhat loses its luster.If you wanted to combine Titanic + The Day After Tomorrow + Independence Day, then you've got your perfect movie. As your all-around film, 2012 is satisfying to say the least. But as a disaster film, it takes destruction to a whole new draw-dropping level. Overall, I give 2012 a well deserved 8/10.",2012
1016,d_a_v_e_l_e_e,Epic!,2,19 June 2010,"This movie was EPIC...............LY bad!!!!Never have I seen an idea so poorly executed in all my life. The directors and script writers have taken what was potentially a good premise for a movie and turned it into one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch from beginning to end!The script was terrible and the whole movie was so implausible that it was hard to tell whether it was trying to be a serious film or some kind of cheesy 'carry on' spoof!! (Carry on Apocalypse, anyone?) The characters were very shallow and not remotely believable, there were far too many 'we only just survived' moments, the whole movie was ridiculous! I am actually ashamed for John Cusack for being the lead in such an abomination of a movie - Being John Malkovich this is not! The plot is shallower than a tinker's bath and so ridiculous that I actually felt sorry for the idiot that signed off on it.This is a truly awful movie which deserves to be ridiculed for it's terrible plot, poor execution and flimsy characters.Watching this film made me sad to be human, it really is as bad as that!",2012

Secondly, none of the other geologists or scientists in the world seem to have any idea about the upcoming catastrophe. This just doesn't seem to make sense. If humanity is smart enough which it is, people will let scientists, intellectuals and young people into a safe haven should such a situation arise, not some dumb fat Russian businessman or a Sheikh. Thirdly, why the hell are they carrying cars with them? Where do they want to drive them? Also, all the lead actors seem to have superhuman capabilities each time the world literally falls apart.

1018,sweepingaway,really disappointing,1,22 November 2009,"The first time I watched the stunning trailer was more than one year ago and I kept waiting for the movie. I watched it on the day of release but I felt asleep twice. The concept is old style- heroism which is not bad though. The movie focused on a hero, which encountered difficulties and finally saved the world with love. It doesn't sound any problems with the movie but honestly, the story repeated again and again which was really a waste of time. Personally speaking I don't really care about how much money they put into the movie because for me, it was just like playing video games on HDTV. Further more, some of the content is ridiculous, such as, the engine couldn't start because one of the gates was not able to completely shut though the other inner gates could stop the airflow from outside when flying; guys spent nearly 1 hour sneaking into the ship but finally the gate was open--it doesn't make sense and it could be shortened to about 10 mins long; worst is, those guys stuck the gate which stopped the ship from operating? Lastly, I don't really think the president should stay. It sounds hero but who will be leading a new world after this visitation of providence? They made story similar to Noah's Ark but only allowed a few people getting on the ship. Are these people enough to build a new world? I would rate this movie 7/10 if they shortened the length to around 100 mins and cut some ""love"" part.",2012
1019,Erdal_e,Great action,8,23 February 2010,"2012 is a good movie, loads of good acting actors. These people are on the edge of the world, all is about to die so obviously they will be in panic, no wonder. Some of my personal keywords from this movie: Panic, egoism, Noahs arch. The story itself is not the deepest one, but pure survival instinct and protect your dearest family - which is all you can expect from humans in that situation they are in.It is without doubt one of those movies I've seen, with the best special effects. Not all movies should have a good story. 2012 is great entertaining movie with stunning special effects.Sorry for my poor English skills, hope you understand.",2012
1020,MonteCarlo86,"Nice action, bad, bad script",4,23 November 2009,"I thought this movie was going to be great. I love disaster films and was excited to see it, but sadly, it disappointed me. The script was poorly written. Every cliché you can think of is stuck in this movie. Moments that are supposed to bring you to tears cause you to snicker or roll your eyes. Relationships weren't built up enough to make you care what happened to characters, in my opinion. Some moments seemed to have potential and then they let me down. And yes, it's Hollywood, but it is way too unrealistic. The characters don't seem too terrified when they're trying to escape death. It's more casual, like they're late for work and it's rush hour. All that being said, the special effects are great and especially towards the end, my heart was beating really fast and I was clutching the armrest. So if you want good writing and memorable characters, run in the other direction and watch something else. If you just want that ""rollercoaster ride"" so many action films promise, I think it's worth checking out.",2012

A lot more than anyone expected.the other scenes are filmed like a 60 action movie and i say that in a bad way. At some point you are under the impression that you're watching Charlie's Angels the TV series. the script is a bad mix of Titanic and Day After Tomorrow.

The storyline has too many clichés to count and annoying children to top that off. I was hoping people had learned by now: children are just annoying screamers in this type of movie.As for he storyline: it has a 'wavy motion': something bad happens, will the heroes survive? Good, they lived! And something bad happens again, and they only just survive. This keeps repeating itself over and over.What I found surprising was the fact that on the 21st of December, it was rather sunny and everyone was just wearing shorts and T-shirts.As mentioned before, the only good thing about this movie was the CGI: the effects are amazing as one could see in the trailer.

1027,p-skachova,Good training for what can come once,10,19 November 2009,"First of all, I want to say that I do NOT believe that the world will end in 2012. I saw many scientific documents about this topic and the only truth is - that the Mayas said that the calendar will finish, but not that the world will finish. For them it was just a reason to start a new calendar from year 0. I give 10 stars, because I liked the story and the actors gave all their talent to act in this movie, it was breathtaking, touching and very gripping. I know that many people thing that this scenario is impossible and that in reality the world would behave differently. But - are you really so sure? Didn't you hear in the TV news that today some of the richest people have already bought tickets to travel in a space ship as a holiday trip in a couple of years. And we, normal (with less money) even did not know that they were constructing these space ships, or did you? Actually, if a world would come to the end, there is no other way to survive than go to some other distant planet or stay in a really resistant ships deep in the sea like it was shown in this movie, far from lethal meteorites, eruptions, hot and dirty air. And as I don't think we have found yet a planet so similar to planet Earth where we can all migrate, it just seems that only the chosen ones (VIPs and rich people) would enter in this gigantic sea ships. I have seen a lot of movies about the end of the world, like Deep Impact and The day after, but this one was the best so far. I recommend this to everyone, first you lose all your hopes to survive, but then you can see that the destiny is unpredictable, could be very good with You.",2012
1028,Tada_2000,"I'm one of those few ""idiots"" who liked and enjoyed this movie!",7,28 January 2018,"Firstly some qualifications for this review, and some may hate it. I'm not a conspiracy theorist! I didn't believe any of the 2012 theories. I wasn't expecting this to be some onscreen representation or vindication of the lunatic fringe. Secondly, i'm not a fan of all such disaster, over-the-top Roland Emmerich movies. There were many i thought were really bad and hated. But thirdly, i did NOT watch this movie hoping to debunk the 2012 end of the world mayan prophecies and calling it out for its stupidity if the movie did support that!I watched this movie i think in a very different way. As science fiction disaster movie. Ok, it remains of course a popcorn flick. Scientifically and philosophically, it isn't deep and profound! There are no stand out performances in acting and nothing particularly memorable. Thematically, it was quite simple. There were the usual tropes and ideas of hope, survival, life, sacrifice and friendship, but they were surprising toned down and none of it was particularly emphasised. But as i will come on to say, this actually helped the movie!So why did i like it, and thinks it warrants another watch and perhaps continual rewatches? Firstly, because it was watchable! It didn't take its themes too seriously (though it may have tried), and that the tone was far more mellow. Why do i say this? It was more a survival movie, than ""we save the day"" movie. Indeed, there was no real hero! Because of this, no part of this movie felt forced, overdone, cheesy, or jingoist, unlike Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow. One example of this is the presidential speech made by Danny Glover. It was actually cut short. Emmerich could have done a whole silly ID speech, but he chose not to and this created a sense of realism.Secondly, the acting though not sublime or profound, wasn't actually bad. Everyone played their character well. I'm not sure if this was conscious and perhaps because of the unintentional deemphasis, there was little overacting or personal drama. There were some stereotyping, but it was surprising tame and well-handled. Chiwetel Ejiofor was a diligent scientist. Believable and not a hero. John Cusack was just a normal family man. The Russians were a little more standard Hollywood, but it can be overlooked. The Tibetan monks were spiritual (i wonder whether that monastery on the himalayas existed!), but again it was tame. Thirdly though, and this is personal, i think the premise does work and steps into interesting! Why? Without consideration of scientifically accuracy (none whatsoever!), I think the idea of global catastrophe as depicted in the movie is much more believable. Its works far better than say an earthquake, or freak weather like in The Day After Tomorrow. We know that those weather patterns and earthquakes won't happen the way they are depicted. They are borderline comical! Now, will something like 2012 happen? Again, with no consideration of science...probably not! We know that geological processes are slow. Just as you can't grow an arm in 5 seconds, the earth won't just explode. BUT i guarantee you a science buff has asked the question, ""what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning""! An exceedingly rare geological event will have almost the effects portrayed in the movie! And 2012 does do this! Not brilliantly or in a profound way, but it does! It does it in remarkably evenly handled way and one that is intentionally global in scope. It is also done commanding Emmerich's usual resources in CGI, which have never been bad!So i would argue that this movie is one of those that were good and enjoyable (possibly unintentionally) for me. I do have misgivings with regards to those silly references to the Mayan prophecies. Those should've be more coincidental and comical. Also, the stereotypes give the movie a mundane, routine appearance. But i maintain, the movie isn't half bad and can be an interesting experience!",2012
1029,bingcrosbyb,"Worth Seeing For the F/X, But Check Your Brain At The Door",7,13 November 2009,"I remember sitting in a theater in 1996 waiting for the film ""Independence Day"" to begin. Two hours later, I emerged as a teenager wowed by the special effects and the incredible likability of the emerging Will Smith. Over the past summer, I just happened to catch it on TV and an interesting thing happened. Maybe it was my age, but aside from some of the groundbreaking visuals, the story came through to me as an adult as very disjointed and utterly implausible. Skip forward to 2009. As I left the 2.5 hour extravaganza known as ""2012"", I felt conflicted. As a teenager, I may have been able to just take in the visual spectacle of LA being destroyed or Yellowstone Park exploding into fiery magma. But the adult in me was constantly distracted by the jumps in the script and the superficial characters on screen. As I look back at the film history of Roland Emmerich, it's impossible not to see his main male characters as utterly disposable. Unknown Will Smith? Check. Matthew Broderick? Check. Dennis Quaid? Check. John Cusack? Check. Take any of them (well, maybe not Smith today) and you could just rotate them out through Emmerich's films. It makes the film feel oddly generic even when you see destruction on an immense scale.And man, is the destruction immense. Take every disaster movie the past 30 years and just toss them in the trash. The visuals are spectacular. There is this one moment in the film (you will know it when you see it) where one of the main characters survives despite a nearly 100% chance they shouldn't given the situation. And that is where the ultimate problems is with the film: Big bangs with little to no plausibility.The Good: Chiwetel Ejiofor is incredible given the material and definitely brings some credibility to the film. He's the strongest of the characters and ultimately the one we the audience trust the most. Oh yeah, the special effects are pretty good too.The Bad: Pacing issues abound as the world is pretty much destroyed in the first half of the film and the characters are left to deal with the government's Ark project. The Ugly: Script.7/10 (Almost a 6, but the visuals outweigh the flaws)My Rating System:10 - Classic Film. One that will be remembered long after I'm dead. 9 - Great Film. One of the best of a given year. 8 - Above Average Film. Minor flaws and in the Top 50 of a given year. 7 - Good Film. Flawed film just above average with something ""special"". Top 150 of a given year. 6 - Average Film. Most films fall here. 5 - Below Average Film. Sub-par. 4 - Very Below Average Film. 3 - Poor Film. 2 - Shouldn't Have Been Made Film. 1 - Unwatchable Film.

It landed up to be a flat plot that is so predictable (because we have seen enough of the ""end of the world"" movies.Add some emotions, pick them from the best movies.. titanic? yeah.. a little from there.Such a waste of time and money.

If you've seen Independence Day, Titanic, or any recent vintage of the well-worn disaster film genre, you will not be disappointed at all with any of 2012. Its 2.5 hour+ running time moves at a great clip, and there's enough science and pseudoscience running around to give the film a certain of-the-moment wonder and clarity. The many destruction sequences throughout the film are absolutely breathtaking to behold, and one wonders if Roland Emmerich starts every film imagining how he will destroy the White House. Like all of his other films (except for The Patriot) it has big names but no huge names and really is a blast to watch",2012

I happened to be seriously worried that the ""idiocracy"" society is becoming reality faster than it was expected. This movie is made to please dumb people. Special effects definitely don't make a movie, this special effects are getting easier and easier to be done so , its merit is becoming discussible and less valuable. To know how much money was spent to make this crap is an insult to mankind's commonsense. They could have made this history in anime, it would be much more worth the effort once you would immediately process this crap as a superheroes' animation movie and not a supposed real American family history that escapes so much trouble with an equal probability to winning the lottery 10 times subsequently.",2012
1035,ujwalbharatn,I kind of liked it !!!,8,14 November 2009,"Before you watch this movie, my question is ""what do u look for in a movie?""..Some go for CGI or action or love or just scenes with Megan Fox in it...If u have seen Independence day or The day after tomorrow, you might already know what to expect from this movie. Is it any different from the previous movies? ....Well its not different with regards to some ground breaking CGI(that would make you go ""HOly sh@#$(cow)!"") and similar ""end of the world"" story line.. It is different this time because of one situation(that everyone tries to ignore) ""What would you do in a situation where thousands of people are dying?"" ""Would you save your family or others or just yourself?"" I don't think you can face such a situation like that(neither can I!!) well this is what the movie made me think!! and I feel that's what the director wants you to think about too..My sincere suggestion is - if u want to enjoy these kind of movies, don't look for plot holes(you are not a member of the Oscar committee)... From my side, i loved this movie...It is how a movie should be - ENTERTAINING !I give it an 8 out of 10 !!!",2012

No wonders that this movie will be blockbuster of all time!!!! The film doesn't have great star or big names as actors but who cares!!!

1037,toobigguy69,"Not the worst movie ever, but almost.",2,22 November 2009,"2012 was probably not the worst movie ever made, but it is close to being so. Vapid storyline, silly acting, cartoonish FX, Dukes of Hazard stunts, and 158 minutes long. I never wanted the world to end sooner than when I was enduring this bore of a movie. Out of the six billion people doomed to perish, I had to watch the half-dozen or so morons that I could not care less about. The endless sad goodbye's were terrible, but at least they offered some respite from the cartoon-like scenes of ultimate destruction, with horrible yawning chasms that always seemed to begin opening just where our stupid characters happened to be standing, or driving, or taking off from. The cars narrowly evading disaster and leaping over hazards, I swear I could hear Banjo's and YeeeHawwwwws!!!! in the background. The complete implausibility of the whole experience made me feel sick that I had lost 158 minutes of my finite life staring at the screen, completely un-entertained and wondering if maybe I am just too old to go to the movies anymore.",2012
1038,thakkar1988,CGI is the first of its kind,8,20 November 2009,"This is my first comment on IMDb. The reason I chose this movie was because of the very negative comments it has been receiving. Seeing the trailers you can imagine that the spotlight of the movie is the show-casing of destruction. And that my friends is done beautifully here. When I saw those buildings falling I was left in awe. The CGI effects here are never before seen and you can trust me on that. Of course the film is filled with cliché's and you can guess what will happen next but you have to give credit to the special effect's guys who have done an overwhelming job here. The graphic's cover for all the loopholes and pitfalls in the story. The acting and direction are both good enough for the movie although I agree that the children are a little irritating.My verdict, go see the movie for what it is without expecting too much from it and you will feel more than satisfied for the money that u spent.",2012

The movie i guess was written by a 3 year old or something.The movie goes on for more than 2 hours and a half! John Cusak suddenly becomes the luckiest person in all of the movie world. He probably does about 15 to 17 miraculous escapes.. u know the kind that all the world is falling down and millions are dying but somehow in a way nothing hits him.. even when he's right under the falling building.. he just makes it somehow.. i don't mind fiction in movies.. just don't take me for a moron! For example, Wanted is good fiction cause they exaggerate starting from an intellectual idea! but in 2012 ur just like ""come ooooooon"" all the time! you know these scenes when one person starts to clap slowly and then it turns gradually into a huge applause?? well that doesn't happen here, but u get that feeling that its about to happen.. the cheesy im-about-to-cry-he-just-made-it-AGAIN feeling! BUT..among all the really awful things in this movie it has 2 good things that made me give them 10! Woody Harreslon! Man he's such an awesome actor! he does this eccentric psychotic crazy guy character. not Natural Born Killers psychotic but as close to it as it can possibly get! and the other thing is the visual effects. although they seem fake at some points.. but in general it was played well.. but it was like seeing The Day After Tomorrow!watching important landmarks being destroyed with the great disaster! oooooooh! the pope part was funny! In short, if you are a regular film goer and you good movies.. don't go.. if ur an occasional movie goer.. go you'll have a blast..",2012

It gets down to the core of society and gives a clear insight into social stratification. Unlike Emmerich's ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (both great films), ""2012"" fully depicts society in the face of annihilation from the most key perspectives. You would never see the world end like this unless it were truly ending. ""2012"" draws you in, takes hold of your heart, and leaves you wounded but enlightened to the world as it truly is.Much like Emmerich's past films; the special effects were amazing, the action was copious, and the acting was outstanding.

And what is better than a man driving a limo through a ""going-down"" California ? Nothing ! And as for the scenario, I thought it was OK. Everything was fitting together and the rhythm was perfect.

I couldn't wait to register for an IMDb account just to warn people about this movie. WAIT for it to come to TV if you watch it at all! Bad writing, bad directing, bad screen casting, implausible / stupid scenes, cliché and unimaginative.

1046,astrarudra8,Too many flaws but a must see movies.,7,5 April 2010,"I enjoyed watching this movie. I researched about 2012 long ago & I knew what was coming, so the movie did not scare me at all and it was fun to find how people reacted to this movie.Do not take this movie seriously, if the disasters take place it will and it's useless to be anxious about it. So relax and enjoy the movie. But if u are frustrated and worried about the future, waste some more time watching the documentaries about 2012.Coming to the flaws, (1)The story writer always unnaturally saves the hero like a Bollywood movie. Similar to Die Hard series whatever happens, the hero will never die. (2)The use of mobiles is not possible in such horrific weather conditions. (3)A polar shift , that is shown in the movie , effects the winds in the atmosphere to blow around 300 to 600 km/h , which is avoided in this movie, makes it impossible for planes to fly. (4)Such spaceship or submarine will never help to escape such a disaster and people would die in short of food. (5)Africa's shape can't remain same and should have changed into another shape. (6)The movie shows us only the worse things that might occur and gives us no advice how to survive it.Although the movie comes with several flaws it's a great movie to watch, I'll score it as follows out of 10:- Story – 8 ; Acting – 6 ; Special Effects – 10 ; Sound – 10",2012
1047,antoniosalazarantunes,Utterly disappointing,5,14 November 2009,"Being a sucker for apocalyptic films, I had high expectations towards this movie. The catchphrase ""is the end of the world as we knew it"" was there, so was the flawless CGI stuff. But once the characters start talking, you'll realize what to expect of the whole thing: clichés, moralist speeches, USA in the top of the world, pseudo-dramatic hero performances, and lots of special effects. By now you're already taking the whole picture. Yes, apparently ""Hollywood"" can't get enough of touching people's heart with great style (3D FTW!!!!!!), instead of plot twists, character evolution or complex dialogues, that IMO, would give at least, something to think about after watching the movie. Throughout the movie, I got blockbusters like Titanic, The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Armageddon and War of the Worlds, popping in my mind, thus there's nothing really new here. The acting is cold, sure John Cusack, Danny Glover and the rest of the crew know how to act, however I think they real fail to portrait the emotions such film would ask for. In the end, I felt that only the 3D animations of the world collapsing were worth watching.",2012
1048,jokerVsBatman,Vfx Were best,8,12 November 2009,Though the concept of destroying the planet and destructing famous places or monuments were awesome. The story of the people involved was very boring and made me feel sleepy for the first 30 Min's of the movie.Very similar to the older version the destruction was very good.Worth the money to watch.To have the positives of the movie is the humanity concept which was lacking in his previous movie (Day after tomorrow) there people just cared about their families not about the whole world. In 2012 people cared about other ..... but the reality was very truth in this times even I feel people will care only for the rich and powerful. Overall well done movie.... except the first 30 Min's .... don't worry even if you miss the first 30 Min's there isn't much of things to see ..... except the boring stuff.,2012

It is a prime example of why some people loathe Hollywood excess.Roland Emmerich could have given every man woman and child 50 cents NOT to watch this movie and everyone would have come out ahead. 2 million dollars a minute??? Feed the poor please.I think there is a drinking game in here somewhere but with the bloated length it might end up sending players to the hospital.I know I lost IQ points sitting through this behemoth.Terrible characters. TERRIBLE dialog. The ton of WTF moments in the first action sequence should be your first clue to skip this stinker.

1051,sazza_reedman,"Well done animation, otherwise not impressed.",3,13 December 2009,"CONTAINS SPOILERSHow did this movie end up with a better user rating than 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon'? I have to say that I was impressed by most of the computer generated graphics, including several of the ""escape"" car scenes. It generally looked realistic, even on the huge screen on which it was played. There was some mediocre acting going on in this film. John Cusack failed to impress me as the troubled-divorced-father-who-still-loves-his-ex-wife. It all seemed too familiar.And that's just it. The entire plot of this film (what plot?) contained nothing more than a hastily taped-together collage of clichés. Everything from the back-story of Jackson Curtis as a struggling author with an estranged family (that suddenly becomes a hero to everyone around him in the span of a day despite the fact that just about everything he touches turns to disaster) to the trainee pilot that manages to skilfully maneuver a light aircraft between two falling buildings seems ridiculous. I spent the entire three hours poking fun at the one liners such as ""my God!"" accompanied by the over used pensive-stare-out-the-window-and-contemplate-life.The film had few redeeming qualities. The CGI being one of them. The other being the fact that some people actually died. It becomes tiresome when all of the heroes make it out in the end. Also, there were moments of raw emotion, however scarce (especially from talented Danny Glover as the President).Overall, I recommend this movie if you love a good plot-less action fest filled to the brim with cliché, obviously impossible physics and survival against all odds. You'll be impressed by the CGI, maybe be satisfied with the acting. If not, you'll feel cheated out of your $10 and feel as if you have just wasted three hours of your life.A three out of ten.",2012
1052,gabrieloro,"Remember, you heard it first from Charlie!",7,11 December 2009,"I have to admit that my expectations were not very high when I walked in the movie theater to watch 2012, CGI is an annoying thing and the plot seemed rather opportunist. What a grateful surprise! The movie managed to stay away from a dull routine almost the entire time, those 'touching' moments came in the right moment and in a nice variety, I mean, almost everyone would find something in common with the characters, whether they're fighting for their sons, parents, themselves or even their dogs. Obviously there where some overdone parts, the ""I don't like my dad"" thing was used way too much already, we all know what it leads to. The runaways are quite entertaining, although predicable after some time.The acting was not, as said by some people, over the top, but the plot might have been a little, the cast just followed it, quite well by the way. And it is a good cast, Cusack is probably at the top of his career and Woody Harrelson was, in my opinion, the best actor in the entire movie, incorporated the character in a really intense way.Overall, it's surely not one of the greatest movies of our time, it's not some masterpiece, but surely a good movie, well worth your time, very entertaining, makes you really think about life and the way the world is run, got good actors, good director, some very funny lines and a nice story. It was done before, but not quite like that.",2012
1053,arunkmv,Great Festival for eyes!!!!!,8,13 November 2009,"This film is a festival for eyes. Roland Emmerich destroys the world again and this time, there's no place to hide! If you believe the Mayans than the end of the world is less than 3 years away. Doesn't that sound like something that should be exploited in theaters? If you're a fan of these types of movies, than chances are, you know Roland and you exactly what you're paying to see when you walk into that theater. The film is a triumph for its genre and will not disappoint those looking for to see some major destruction.The Plot:2012 comes and the world comes to an end. Simple and sweet. The whole added thing of a few lucky ones who get to go on an arch (made by the Chinese) to survive is also there, but we know why you're all really going the giant waves! The Good:* Action: When the world first starts falling apart the action is so intense and tangible that you'll literally feel like you can put your hands in the air and go for a ride with the air (and lava) blowing through your hair. If there is one thing that Roland knows how to do it's send nature after humans, and he does so well.* The Topic of Religion: As much as this is a fun film, it isn't afraid to poke fun at the government and religion on it's way to mass destruction. The Queen, the Pope, our Governor, none are spared.* Detail of Mega-Sets: From the tiny men dangling from huge buildings to the huge cracks in the asphalt, nothing in this film was left behind, everything was thought about and well executed. The special effects team on this film were (as expected) absolutely amazing.* Unsympathetic: No one is safe in Roland's world and he makes no apologies when he kills of characters you're almost sure will make it to the end. Of course if you're religious, you're dead.The Bad:Note: Anything that I didn't like only pertains to this movie if you're judging it in terms of a ""normal film."" This is not a film, it's an action pack thrill RIDE. Don't start picking at it because you want everything to be based in facts. This is not an educational film, there are no ""facts"" in Roland land, just enjoy the waves!* Melodrama: As to be expected, but yes it's there. Sometimes you'll be yelling at the screen saying ""I don't care if you all die, lets get to the next way of killing everyone!""* Length: It's a loong wild ride and chances are that by the end of it, your ass will be numb. It could have 20 minutes cut out of it and we'd all be fine with it.* Same Tricks: He does repeat some of the same tricks within the movie. Three times in a row, a plane has the exact same issues taking off. Once or twice would be okay, but three times?Overall:There is nothing really new in the film, but it knows what it is and is honest about it.",2012
1054,gideonsaunders,You will love it...if you don't take it seriously,4,22 November 2009,"Even for Emmerich this is poor. Here he doesn't even bother to give us a half interesting (let alone half credible) plot. We are quickly shown that for some reason the world is ending (something about cosmic rays and planetary alignment that no-one even cares to explain), we are introduced to the obligatory father-with-estranged-children story. In this film the father has apparently written some book about something predicting the end of the world, although we never know exactly what. From here, any semblance at character development, even plot development is quickly thrown into the background in order to focus on the explosions.The film is in effect, a series of impressive CGI set pieces. But, as has previously been mentioned, these quickly become very repetitive (I lost count of the amount of times a plane/car/boat/other form of transport was seen fleeing just metres ahead of an encroaching cloud of ash/fire, tidal wave or an earthquake fault line). From there it is just a matter of killing off the secondary characters whilst sparing the stars and finally, the obligatory ""ambiguous, thought-provoking ending"".This film does nothing well and most things very badly. I gave it a four out of ten because, seen with a good group of friends, it is so cheesy and ridiculous as to be entertaining (think rifftrax bad).My tip: Rent The Day After Tomorrow- even if you have seen it a dozen times you will get more enjoyment out of it than you will seeing this for the first time.",2012

I think every one here is an expert. See the quality of the movies now days, really pathetic. I can list many Sci-Fi/action movies in recent past which people would never like to see again and want their money and time back. Comparatively this movie is a gem. I am sure in coming years people will be remember it. John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor were excellent. It is certainly the best action/Sci-Fi movie of 2009 including ""Star Trek"" and ""knowing"", there are couple like avatar, mutants which i am yet to explore. The momentum was terrific in the movie, action never stopped. The graphic/animation were superb, you wont believe, simply mind blowing. In many years this the movie which i watched thrice in two days and will still love to watch again. Every one played their role well. The movie deserve 10 out of 10. And this rating i am giving because the movie delivered for what it was and that is non stop entertainment. My recommendation is if you love action/thriller/Sci-fi then this one is certainly for you. So just go and watch it and i promise you will have no regrets! 10/10 Regards",2012

The acting was good,The CGI is great and since that is what most viewers expect from a movie, one could say this one is good, but its NOT. The first two thirds are watchable, but then comes the last part which is so full of impossible and unbelievable situations that one has to wonder who is this movie meant for. Children, maybe? There is an Italian saying that says ""Even if it is not true, it is well thought."" Well, this one is the opposite. I am not hard to please, and I can watch and enjoy all genres. While watching this movie, at one point, I was yanked from the make-believe reality by the stupidity of the story, and couldn't go back any more because the story kept getting more and more stupid.

Lots of other reviewers have competently discussed the many, many flaws of ""2012,"" so I won't recap all the problems of this dreadful mess of a movie.

1059,meatarofu,great looking crap fest,3,30 July 2010,"I didn't expect much from this latest endeavor from Ronald Emmerich. and i didn't get much in the end anyway. The story, in case you don't already know is about a group of people who try to out run, out fly, and out drive, the apocalypse. due to the sun. some how the earth has been heating up a lot. this causes the earth to have massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and eventually a massive flood. the government have been building ships that allow them to protect anyone who can pay a very very large fee. the group that the film centers on is John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Liam James. Pretty much everyone in this movie is bad in this film. there are some big stars in this film, like Woody Harrelson, and Danny Glover. I love these actors but they are laughably bad in this film. At least Woody was supposed to be funny. The rest of the crew have no excuse. The script doesn't help these actors either. horrible dialog plague the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the special effects. so many things happening on screen its overwhelming at times. during disaster scenes its amazing the carnage and death on screen. from planes flying through crumbling cities, to limos, driving through a crashing city, to campers going through crumbling national parks (do you get the pattern?). it all looks cool and hectic. its not without faults though. some scenes just look plain awkward. I would recommend you watch this once just for a good laugh, and the special effects, but only once.",2012
1060,cslater1980,Early call...failure.,4,15 November 2009,"On the preview alone, I call failure.Not counting the fact I saw the main characters drive through collapsing buildings, and then somehow get to the airport before anyone else in the city (being chased by a large fracture in the planet mind you...damn that earthquake that can specify a vehicle), find the plane that was already running with a pilot in it, find the time to take off, and then fly UNDERNEATH the surface of the earth (in the previews building are falling into the earth around the plane), and then the pilot doesn't think to pull up on the controls rather then avoid millions of tons of falling debris... They still (I predict anyway) are part of the small group of survivors who inhabit the earth.Not counting all that, I call failure.Say what you will about 'suspending belief for a movie', but Independence Day (with Will Smith) had a far better and more believable plot.",2012
1061,user-74226,Mother Nature will not negotiate,9,14 November 2009,"Roland Emmerich is back with a beautifully worked piece. The 158 mins feature film takes you on a visual adventure where mother nature is relentless, brutal and will not negotiate. The cast are appropriately chosen with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Morgan Lily and John Cusack performing very well. Woody Harrelson is a pleasant addition, adding some colorful moments to the film. This is a movie you should see in the cinema and add to your collection when it becomes available on Blu-Ray. The visuals are breathtaking, stunningly designed and shocking at times. How do you tell the story of Mother Nature's retaliation on humanity? This is it! An entertaining and edge-of-your-seat film worth watching.",2012
1062,seweryn-krzykowski,This could be a great movie... But it's not!,3,13 November 2009,"Probably contains spoilers but believe me this films is NOT about the script. I've had really low expectations, was looking forward to see it. Saw it and it was a massacre.Everybody knows CG effects are what's this film is all about, but the absurdity of actors actions is beyond human recognition. I mean what the hell they ware thinking about while flying right above the ground when all of the city is being trashed by a huge earthquake - they even flew BELOW a train! COME ONE! How stupid is that?! Also seeing 3 times a car flew through a bump and a plain starting right after the airport collapses (2 or 3 times) - not only stupid but got also boring.The plot is also stupid, but as i said before - it's all about CG, though both director and scene writers did there best to make it even more illogical.This could be a really great movie. Drama about loosing ones we love and making decisions that cost lives but save even more of them, about human irrelevance when mother nature gets mad. Instead it's about love and making really stupid decisions when world is collapsing (literally).Fun fact: everyone on the planet speaks English. Doesn't matter if you're from Tibet far away from civilization. It's the ultimate language of communication. Fun fact 2: American cars have the best suspensions in the world. They can withstand every possible bump you can imagine, also limo drivers got some raw skills...Gave it 3/10 but CG - 10/10Hope i got the grammar and spelling wright. Also I hope i saved someones money and time.",2012

I hate it and wish that all people involved would die! Why do such films evoke such weird pleasure from such complete idiots!. What a waste of money!. The cost of this film could solve the issue of homelessness in Cambodia!. Why do they keep making such rubbish?. If I had the amount of money they had to make this film I could poo my pants smear it on a dead cat's face and still come out the winner... as I would have donated all money to charity. Why do these people still make films?. Anyone who liked this film please help us all by giving yourself a massive wedgie and not ever going to the cinema again and giving all your money to a Good cause. Boycott all films of this ilk!.,2012
1064,chris-mitchellclare,Absolutely Amazing. Plays out perfectly.,10,13 November 2009,"I have been following all of the films Viral Campaigns since it all started, watched all the trailers and videos released prior to the film.It was not until I saw the film that I knew how everything played out, it was so well done, I am simply going to have to give it a 10/10, The visual effects was so well done that it had everyone in the theater gasping to several scenes, it felt so real, damn thing gave me shivers.I recommend you all go see this movie, Roland Emmerich is one of the best directors I know. And if anyone knows how to make a great Apocolype film that is entertaining and frightening, its the one and only Roland Emmerich.In the Viral Campaigns, everything seems scattered, you have to figure it out/decipher it yourself, but once you go see the film, Everything is much clearer, yes, they don't mention much about the Mayan Calendar, that's because people are too busy living out their current lives worrying about stuff that is not in stone and I have asked many people myself if they know much about the Mayan Calendar and what it's going on about, and they did not really know about it. so keeping it, ""I don't know much about whats going on"" works well on the audience, it puts them in the same seat as the characters in the story, and makes them want to find out really what is going on (Jackson Curtis meets Charlie Frost), instead of just blasting it out in one go at the start (Stupid).Simply put, I am glad I went to see this movie, it has been a well spent 2 hours.Anyone else who says this movie is crap, or not very good, bad story to the film, don't go see it, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM, they don't know what the hell they are talking about, I however personally recommend you see this movie, I will definitely be getting it when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD?.Just wish the film was in 3D, that would have been too much for everyone to bare.U ever seen the worlds largest volcano blow up?

If you read a negative review, it's apparently because some genius thought it might be an art-house flick and they were disappointed.Yes, leave your brain at the door. Don't over-analyze this one. It's not meant to be.You have your world leaders, your scientists, and your typical American family trying to navigate through and survive this disaster.You have your secondary characters, who get minimal screen time but are still key players in the plot, and, because they are secondary characters, you know they are going to die.You have the assholes thrown into the mix who manage to redeem themselves in their final moments by putting the good of someone else before themselves.And you the have big-budget special effects.It's just like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, Deep Impact, Knowing, etc., etc., etc.What makes 2012 better than those movies is because the acting is a lot better than you'd expect in a disaster flick, and the special effects are state of the art. Sure, in a year or so they'll be outdated, but hey, remember ""Jurassic Park?"" That was in 1993, and those effects were awesome back then.Just take this movie for what it is. If you don't like disaster movies, don't see this one. You get what you pay for. This is a great movie for its genre, nothing more, nothing less.",2012

Although mind-blowing effects, I thought there were endless, completely ridiculous moments and over-use of these effects. The stand-out scene for visual effects is the limo scene (and only one error in the wheels of the limo not turning during a slow-motion jump.) but I'm sure you can find that on youtube.The actor's performances weren't terrible, but were by no means award winning. Certain actors resembles massive, awesome planks of wood.2012, packed full of factual errors and just stupid mistakes is anything but a must-see. It is a film to entertain with an uncomplicated plot you can sit and almost literally chat to your friends through the talky-bits (but don't, some people might not realise how unimportant it all is and find you annoying).

1069,dmg_uk,A Disaster of a Disaster movie.,4,17 November 2009,"Lets start from the beginning...I have been waiting months to see this movie, ever since I saw the first trailer on TV or read news about its production in the papers and online, I couldn't wait to see another one of these ""end of the world"" movies, so before going into the cinema to see this, my expectations were very high, since the guy who directed this also directed one of my all time favourite movies Independace day.Before seeing this movie, I had done a lot of research on the 2012 Mayan prophecy, the Mayan calender and the Mayan people, they didn't exactly predict the world was going to end, just that there will be an alignment in our galaxy between the earth, sun and centre of the milky way & also the ending of their calender, so I hoped this movie would focus a little on this, I mean the movie is called 2012 right? Well this movie didn't, I think maybe twice through-out the entire film they mentioned the Mayans, ridiculous right? but hey thats Hollywood for you.This movie lacked in everything a movie should have, the characters had no meaning, no story about them, the script was terrible, there were cliché after cliché, even LOL moments in the film where I just couldn't stop laughing, reminding me a bit of the Indiana Jones 4 movie, just over the top, cheesy as hell, AS IF moments, OK fair enough the whole movie in itself may be one big AS IF that could ever happen, but it really could, just sometimes I felt like I was being ripped off, dumbed down, and insulted.The only thing that this movie has going for itself is the special effects, and one short cameo from woody, THATS IT, in my opion anyway, classic disaster movies like Armageddon, independence day, twister, they will always be favourites of mine, which I can watch over and over again, but I don't think I will be watching this one again anytime soon, it's even worse than the day after tomorrow.I am just really disappointed this film didn't deliver, it had the potential to be HUGE, if it just concentrated alittle more on telling a story, build up the characters a little, be alittle more realistic, it was so predictable, I could tell from the beginning who was going to live, who was going to die etc, the budget for this movie was over $200 million, a waste of money if you ask me!! Finishing off, if you like to see things get blown up, destroyed then this movie is for you, but if you like a little story, some depth, some feelings, then this isn't the movie for you.Armaggedon made me cry, 2012 made me laugh.",2012

But the best part about the movie ( which I'm sure even the producers of the movie were aware of) were the ludicrous scenes in the movie, three of which I will never forget.**WARNING... CONTAINS SPOILERS** The first one was when john is driving through the city and appears to be the only intelligent person in the whole city dodging cars and planes and what not, while the rest of the populous just crash into each other and die like mindless sheep. The second best scene is this dude who barely knows how to fly a single engine (sports) plane and is co- piloting an Antonov AN220 and maneuvering it like a pro. The third and the most memorable scene in the movie is the massive tsunami wave reaching up to Mount Everest(which is about 9 kms above sea level!) **SPOILER ENDS**All in all, if you are looking for non stop CG and special effects then give this movie a shot.

I heard a lady sharing her first comment to her friend: 'That dog sure was ugly'. What else was there to say? After a while I found out:The action was truly formidable, demonstrating the power of 'mother nature'. Collapsing buildings, jumping flaming cars, planes falling down and manage to pull up a second before touchdown, it was a real trip and a feast for the eyes and ears.But then again... the acting wasn't that good, a bit over the top. In one scene in the movie, where every wasted second could be the cause of a terrible disaster, *they* waste their time being...ROMANTIC! At times like that the acting became very juicy, making me think I was watching 'Titanic' instead.One point of advise: Do not take this movie too seriously. It's almost stuffed with jokes instead of showing us the real drama of an earth that is about to be destroyed. But keep this in mind and you'll have a heck of a 2 hours and 40 minutes(!) in a movie that is made for the cinema.",2012

At 2.5 hrs this movie outstays it's welcome by at least 50 mins, the only reason I gave this film 2 stars is the CGI, obvious in places, but jaw dropping realistic in others, the first hour is weak character build up only, you'll find your self laughing in places you shouldn't, a guilty pleasure of sorts, if you are happy to part with your cash to witness some amazing effects only then this film is for you.

For a short time you can say, ""Well, OK, they just said that Underground Water Tank (??) was TWO MILES deep, and mysteriously there's lights installed inside it to see the miraculous non-pressurizing water boiling in it... but OK, it's only a movie!"" But you finally (and not too long after) get to the point where you're more apt to shout, ""AGAIN?! Again with the airplane not taking off in time and flying underground?!"" And it quickly degenerates into incredulously saying, ""Did they REALLY just say that the fireball/ash cloud that originated in Yellowstone had not yet reached Las Vegas, but somehow just swallowed the Vice President's helicopter OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH?!?"" And finally it culminates into a game of ""I'm-gonna-say-the-most -ridiculous-thing-I-can-think-of -and-they-will-do-it"", like when the Dhali Lama reaches under his robes and I'm all like, ""Oh, what's he gonna do, hand him the keys to the Lama-mobile?"" and he actually DOES IT!!

Inexperienced Pilots: Inexperienced pilots work like charms in disaster zones.

But as the movie drags on, even the smallest character gets his ""i have to say goodbye to my loved ones""-scene - which becomes quite annoying after you've watched this for the 5th time in a row. then comes a great destruction scene and then we're back in soap-opera territory. don't get me wrong, basically that can be said about most of Emmerich's movies - they are just popcorn cinema - leave your brain at the ticket counter. still, i enjoyed the likes of ""Independence Day"" or even ""The Day After Tomorrow"". But the one thing, he can't do properly is ""good""-emotional cinema - which works fine in some of his other movies when his pathos-laden, goofy dialogue writing doesn't get in the way of the big explosions - it fit's, makes them funnier to a point. unfortunately this doesn't work for 2012. if somebody could actually cut this movie down to 90minutes running time, i'd even be lining up for a second ticket.",2012

The only reason I gave it 4/10 is cause of its really great and ultra-realistic special effects that puts us in the center of apocalypse... BUT.. and this is very big BUT- this movie contains almost NOTHING else to offer besides those effects. The storyline is non-existing, characters are.... wait?.. WHAT CHARACTERS?? They are just pile of stereotypes.And even the main ""virtue"" of the movie- special effects, are rolling one after another, working against themselves, because after a first 10 minutes of destruction (seen in trailer anyways), which btw. are the best part of the ""2012"", you became desensitized and detached from the happening in the film and believe me- you will not care if any of the main characters live or die, which is death sentence for any kind of movie.This also has a lot to do with Emmerich's constant forcing of ""nearly escaped death"" sequences which are, in their unbelievability, more appropriate to some action-hero type of film then here. And, bear in mind, that I wasn't looking Oscar-worthy performances, wasn't comparing it to ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Gone with the wind"", just wanted it to be at least as good as ""The day after tomorrow"", or ""Independence day"", but this one is sooo inferior compared to those earlier works of Roland Emmerich...So, all in all, to conclude- 1) Should you watch it- Yes, cause you want, cause everyone else will, and you need to see those effects on big screen. 2) Will you like it- I really really doubt that, unless you are 10 y.o. 3) Is it a good movie- ummmm...

Tried to have too many emotions which made the movie a little loose at those moments; Independence Day had good emotional moments. What amazes me are the depiction of Director's imagination of destruction so well put on the screen without any flaw. Few scenes were unnecessary like Jackon's son trying to help his father specially after an emotional moment with him earlier; Jackon taking his daughter to meet Charlie knowing very well that it could be dangerous. It is also not known how the AirPlanes arrived near China without any Air-Trafic contact when everything down there was destructed. But I guess we can skip all this to be amazed by the special effects. Roland should definitely survive the End of this world :).",2012

Then there were shots that were pretty remarkable. Like, at one scene there was a Indian family kneeling and in sorrow. Then there's this considerable tsunami behind this family whom on their knees, and they have this dismay look on their faces. This was great scenery. Honestly I'ts nothing to waste money on. Just wait till it comes out on HBO, or something. It's entrusting because this movie was written to have this Bible and Titanic perspective. It built this arc and crowded animals and limited people on it. Instead of birds there are helicopters, it also involves to the bible but the greed of David, and a chain of killings. In Titanic their ship gets git by an iceberg, in 2012 the ship gets hit by Mt. Everest...??? Also this one ship type thing hits the other ship type thing. There then is a part were a cruse ship is engaged by this wave. The boat is tipping people are flying of the deck. It's the Titanic only present perfect. Then there's this man named Charlie, the writers stole the material from Charlie the Unicorn. There's this one point where it goes "" Charlie Lead me to the mountain, Charlie wheres the map to this place?"" It was foreseeable after that one part (that leads to another foreseeable part with Charlie). It's ridiculous.",2012

Everything is there from the most breathtaking special effects you will probably ever see on the big screen, absolutely phenomenal. I must admit I was worried about watching this movie before I went due to the mixed reviews I have read, but let me tell you that if you loved Deep Impact and Armageddon then this is probably the best disaster film ever made. I felt as though I was almost crying when things seems like they couldn't get any worse for the population of the planet and the raw emotion you get is fantastic from various on screen performance's.Go and watch this film as soon as you can its what going to the cinema is all about, take your kids, in fact take the whole family because its worth every penny.10/10, fantastic all round film.",2012

1092,bryceman95,What went wrong? SPOILERS.,2,14 November 2009,"Let me start off first by saying that the special effects were pretty good. Maybe even the best ever. And if you like Roland Emmerich movies your going to like this. Now that the only positive thing I have to say is out of the way, let's move on to why this movie is a total disgrace to the art of film. This is an Emmerich movie. If your familiar with THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (hated it), 10,000BC (didn't like it), and INDEPENDENCE DAY (actually liked this one), then you know how this goes. Somehow this ends up in the hands of the high government; Roland makes the govt. look like bad guys;and the world blows up, goes underwater, or gets taken down by aliens. I have no idea why this movie tries to be funny. Cusack is running from the giant earthquake tearing up the road behind him,and ends up behind 2 ninety-year-olds going 20MPH. Why? Why would you randomly cut to disaster scenes after emotional final goodbyes?(Sistine Chapel). Why are there cameras everywhere? On the (big Spoiler) arcs how do they find the perfect closeup of John Cusack? It doesn't make sense why they put this in the film. Oh yeah cheesy lines.Lots!!! (It's Russian!!)But my biggest problem is the characters. There are simply to many. (SPOILER) At one point in the movie, one minor character calls his father who is doing a show on a cruise ship to say goodbye. His partner who he is doing the show with calls Japan to his estranged son in Japan. His daughter picks up the phone and finally meets her grandpa before the phone line dies. That is a minor character who calls an even less important person. That person's partner calls an even less important person, etc. It's just to much.The effects can only carry this movie so far. Yet another fail to Roland E. movie career. He'll be back in a couple of years to blow some more crap up. Until then, this disaster is what he left us.2** out of 10",2012
1093,kilian-hertel,Worst movie ever,1,15 November 2009,"Dear potential viewers, Please don't watch this movie. You will regret this. There is no reason to see this movie. For this I have several reasons:1. Storywriter must have been on drugs 2. Several logical mistakes (A not closed ship door can not create a engine failure. You would see if you watch it) 3. You can pretty much predict at the beginning what happens at the end. 4. The badness is going to get you! 5. If actors are crying does not mean they are good actors. 6. If the heroes just passed all situations (like getting away from the bridge, train, volcano, mountain, very high building, another very high building, the Air Force one etc. before it collapses), the tension does not rise with each situation passed. In effect, you have such a situation every 2 minutes which gets you kind of used to it. 7. Please man! Please don't smoke next time you write a script for the movie!!! 8. A wave in the Himalaya?

1094,paulojdr,To avoid...,3,15 November 2009,"Last night decided to go see 2012. After all the publicity and promotion around it I must say I was really curious to find out what could be happening to the world if all the prophecies reveal to be true. Also, Rolland Emerich directed one of my favorite films, one of those films I always watch as if it was the first time: ""The Day After Tomorrow"". John Cusack also helped.But let me be honest with you, it's really been a long long time since I felt like going out of the cinema after the first half hour of a film. But that happened last night. I think I'm a bit of a masochist for watching it till the end, but I had spent money on it (and was not alone) and I had to see if there was still something that could save this disaster (the film, not what happened to the world).Apart from the visual effects of the worlds destruction that created some really powerful images, all the film, after the plot reaches the year 2012, is filled with some lame and others the most ridiculous, really unimaginable and implausible, not likely to happen situations. No human, in a million years would escape all the main characters managed to escape (or be so lucky) till they reached a ""safe harbor"". Maybe in the world of comics, some kind of super-heroes would be able to do that. Contrary to ""The Day After Tomorrow"", I mentioned before, where Mr.Emerich showed and balanced both the catastrophe and the human struggle to survive sides, all in the right measures without destroying the story and the all film.Some might say it's a film, it's not real and the main characters should always manage to get to end safe and sound, but if I wanted to see what I saw there I'd go see X-Men or some other film of the kind. I know it's a catastrophe film, but the people are real, the mankind is real, and I would like to see that there would be some kind of truth and reality in it.My 3/10 goes out to John Cusack and Woody Harrelson and, as I said, to some of the visual effects. All the rest is really a waste of time and money. Go see it at your own risk.",2012

Just because of the trailer, I was really looking forward to it and I expected it to be a great movie. Strenghts: Really great special effects! I think that couldn't even be better. Despite it's not realistic, it looks very awesome!Weaknesses: - Too long - Poor acting (like the Russians Yuri and Tamara, and especially Yuri's kids, what are they possibly adding to this movie?) - Every 10 minutes a disaster, but somehow, they always manage to escape and save the rest of the family. I can name up several other things like: - they are taking a giraffe and rhinos into the arc, but if they are going to Africa because that continent hasn't been flooded, they will find a whole population of those species. - Instead of getting height with the plane, why are they flying so low, even below a metro train? - The cabins of the Arc look like a Hilton hotel room. Erm, that thing was supposed to save human race instead of having a vacation trip? - as usual in a Hollywood movie, America has to be on top of the world again. Like, why has America one Arc all for itself, while the whole world has to be divided into 2 other Arcs?Well, to make a long story short, despite all those weaknesses I think the movie is worth seeing just because of the special effects.",2012

For me it was a visual treat to watch how the world gets destroyed in ""2012"".Among other movies directed by Roland Emmerich, ""Independence day"" tops my list. Compared to it, ""2012"" lacks a good story line. Apart from that ""2012"" is the best compared to CG effects and it entertains you for the entire running time.I highly recommend this movie for all those who seek for pure entertainment.",2012
1097,rasmodeus1,Beautiful CGI effects in a very bad movie.,4,15 November 2009,"I just had to post about this movie. I saw it last night with some friends in the largest theater in our area...and it was packed.This movie contains some of the best special effects I've yet seen in a movie. HOWEVER, it doesn't make up for the fact that it's so utterly wasted in this film. The plot is silly - it tries to make you care about characters that, quite frankly, you will never care about. The science behind this movie is nonexistent...there are numerous scenes of people running away from explosions! The synchronicity of the events that take place seem to be there to belittle the audience's intelligence; it's like various characters are casting magic spells to make what they said instantly ironic.After the movie was over, in our crowded theater ONE person started clapping his hands. No one joined him. To be honest, if people were gonna clap I was certainly gonna boo.SPOILER AHEAD! When Harrelson's character is standing in Yellowstone as it blows up, he's there like 5 minutes talking about how ""awesome"" it is. I guess Emmerich doesn't realize if Yellowstone erupts, it's not just a little tiny area shooting lava balls out. Then Cusak's character is literally running away from the explosion and it is RIGHT BEHIND HIM. (Are people still so in love with running away from explosions?) And then the main cast is trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow from the Yellowstone eruption in a prop plane, and somehow they go faster than the cloud (even though they got caught in it!!!!)",2012

1099,o-i-m7007,A disappointment that worth seeing !,5,15 November 2009,"When I saw the trailer of this movie I knew it will break a record in the box office which seems happening so far. But I also thought that it will make skeptics more aware about the 2012 legacy and why it is so important. In other words, I thought that this movie will include more fact and reality beside fantasy and entertainment. However, after watching the movie I had a feeling of disappointment because the movie had everything such as huge budget and great actors but it still it could've done better.First I will list what I liked about the movie: 1- John Cusack's performance : Great actor , very enthusiastic and professional.2- Visual effects : Ronald Emmerich is well known for this, enough said.3- The message from the movie : Increase people awareness about humanity and caring for each other, imperialism and how government control and hide such information from being delivered to people.4- Thriller factor : such as catching up on the last minute and so on.What I didn't like about the movie: 1- Casting : Amanda Peet is a great actress but I see her fits more in comedies not in action movies. I personally would've liked to see Charlize Theron or Jennifer Garner in this movie. Danny Glover didn't fit at all as the president of the United States, he was mumbling most of the time and hearing what he was saying is really hard.2- Unrealistic fantasies: Such as passing every obstacle with a limo while the earth is falling apart behind, flying the plane just on time before the ground collapses...etc3- the focus on Jackson's and Adrian's private lives more than the disaster it self.4- The beginning of the movie didn't explain the background about the disaster that well.5- Absence of details.6- Making a happy ending although it is not ! : so most of human beings died and only few billionaires survived. Which means they'll die soon after because there will be no hotels , fancy restaurants, mansions or Bentley's in 2013 Africa. I don't think that bunch of spoiled billionaires will hold to that ! How could've this movie done better:1- the beginning of the movie should've explained the story behind 2012 and a background scene about the Mayans and how accurate their calendar is.2- Remove Amanda Peet and Danny glover from their roles.3- making more realistic scenes instead of the fantasy that I explained above.4- Show more disasters around the world beside earthquakes and volcanoes.5- Include more ""end of the world"" facts from Christianity,Juddaism and Islam would've been more affective on most viewers emotions and feelings of the movie because it will touch their believes.6- Using a sad ending by making all humans die because of their greed of surviving would've been significant to the movie and advertisement to the 2012 as the end of the world not a new beginning.Beside that it'll be an opposite of all what people expected that the hero always survive and thats more thrilling.7- Ending the movie with scientific facts about the unique alignment that will take place in 2012 and what did the Mayan calender proved so far.The bottom line is I expected to walk out of the theater thinking that I got only 2 years left and go back to home and search about 2012 myth, not to walk out of the theater thinking that it was another fantasy-entertainment centered movie.Was it worth seeing ? of course because you'll experience a great visual affects that sometimes you'll feel that you're in a roller coaster not a movie theater. The only thing is don't base high expectations from the movie because you'll get disappointed.",2012
1100,hans-583-777743,Watch the trailer save your money,5,15 November 2009,"First off let me say that I like disaster movies. I've really got a soft spot for them. But this movie 2012 is one that really disappoints on pretty much all counts but the amazing CGI. The movie 2012 I saw had already given away all that was good about it in the trailer; the CGI is stunning and really worthwhile. But as I said, you can see it for free in the trailer in cinema's all over the world. The script felt as if it had been generated by a computer as well, it was bland, unoriginal and tending towards the unbelievable. As for acting; the performance of the actors only very seldom went any deeper than the script they were playing. On the upside; for the first time in a disaster movie I didn't want the children to die a horrible death. They really deserve some credit for that. I know these movies aren't made for 'thinkers', but I would like the makers of disaster movies to consider this: Some of their audience actually *do* think even while sitting in a big screen theater where the end of days is being dished out. And it would really be nice if - without giving any discomfort to the ones who won't give a damn - if some homage is paid to reality. Some escapes in the movie really were more of an exercise in cutting anchors with reality than tension building moments. In the end I know I've also got myself to blame for feeling disappointed about this film; I knew I shouldn't have watched the trailers. And on that count I was proved right - once more.",2012

And that Mr, anders or what ever his name is is such a deuce bag. Moreover, the movie was 2 hours and 30 minutes, it did not feel like much of the story was told, Well that's all that i can say bout the movie, besides that i give the movie a solid 8.

And that is what bothers me.2012 is a movie that is either loved or hated.Yes, the story is incredibly unbelievable, shallow and predictable. Yes, the action is even beyond that And no, the character play doesn't soothe the pain.It did 1 thing however that for me neither godfather, or godfather part II will ever do (Rated #2 & #3 in IMDb top250. And that is entertain me, let alone say ""Wow!"" out loud in the cinema.2012 Is by far the most spectacular disaster movie of all time.It was 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure entertainment and gave me a big smile all the time.If you are a movie critic who expects in-depth character stories and a good background.

From my perspective, I think the movie 2012 = Hollywood effects technology. but unlike previous, more helpful to recall people's environmental awareness, love deep inside.survival=American brave heart + Indian talent + made in china(the trusted big ship), as one of regular audiences, I think plot arrangements for the Russian billionaire was too cruel = burn bridge, we can't disregard his airplane, he was kindly as billionaire.I saw more globalization in Hollywood movie, but they regularly distort the distinguishing characteristic of other countries.this traditions somehow hurt local audiences' feelings. the Chinese characters more like Korean or Japanese, same distort to Tibetan people and their dialogue, i feel weird as a Chinese. If in view of the box-office considerations, no need to add such nondescript,otherwise do more effort to learn about the other countries not only nuclear weapon.But but but we always admire American's calm and unhurried attitude to the imminent disasters : watching for a while in the front line with ""wow"", sometimes essential male and female kissing.read more daily on my blog: http://www.bjdaily.net",2012

This movie is one CGI scene after another. The characters are surviving one event after the other with no real meaning.Anyone watching the movie can predict with 100% certainty what will happen next. If you like special effects with no story or endearing characters then this movie is for you. It is a shame that this movie had such potential and I think it was all flushed down the drain.

The special effects draw attention to themselves and distract you from the storyline, which could have been salvageable if it had been executed better. It's impossible to get engrossed in the film. The action sequences are so unbelievable that your intelligence is insulted, and the acting is so unrealistic that you can't relate to any of the characters. Even though there are a lot of fancy special effects to look at, it's a boring movie because the characters are so obviously fictional that you just don't care if they live or die.

Everything is so pointless. All the ""emotional"" scenes made me wanna throw up. The lines are... don't know how to describe them. I think that you can hear the ""Mister president"" line, about a hundred times which is present in every single one of Mr Roland's movies. Music is so cheesy, every now and then the sad strings come up to pump up the heroics of brave individuals, or to make you cry or at least to make you realize the importance of the situation , and all they do is making it even more disgusting and eventually you end up actually wanting the world to end.

What meaning was this movie supposed to have that you have all been SO disappointed by? The media told all of you brainwashed drones that the awesome CGI computer crap was going to replicate through film what the year 2012 may be like. The movie-going public (especially in the us) have come to believe that some big huge fear-provoking cataclysmic event will happen to end the world. the only reason we think this is because the controllers of media and our worldview have marketed it that way. Open your minds--subliminal msgs are everywhere in film--everywhere. The idea is that they make you believe the film should make you feel or look at the world one way, while at the same time subliminally showing us ways to break the spell they have us under. The world is not run by the ppl u think and only when we come together as humanity--like is shown in 2012 can we begin to ACT rather than just HOPE. You are the exception--they have made you believe these types of characters CANNOT exist",2012
1123,pflock87,day after tomorrow 2,4,26 November 2009,"well first of all, I entirely agree with you in saying that this movie completely lives on its special-effects. neither the story nor the acting is of any positive significance and therefore not worth mentioning.However, it's more than obvious that the guy from Paris, who gets blown up in his car, is the director of the Louvres. Were he to survive, he would have informed the whole world about the fact that serious preparations concerning the preservation of important, historical artifacts were taking place - via the press conference he intended to hold. Ultimately, this would have led to the discovery of the building of the arks.Now, I don't know what Roland Emmerich thought about doing another movie like ""The day after tomorrow"". In fact, this movie shows so many similar features, that I wonder whether directors believe people to be so ignorant, that they are just blinded by the special effects. Some examples:Day after tomorrow: Beginning: scientists find out that the sea temperature is rising. They inform the president of the USA. Rising action: The sea level increases drastically. Eventually the oceans overflow parts of the world. The father of an unimportant family is trying to save his son.Catastrophe and Happy End: Parts of the world are buried under massive pieces of ice. The father manages to save his son. It turns out that not all of the world is lost. The Western civilization finds refuge in Africa, which could withstand the catastrophe in some parts of the continent. In comparison:2012: Beginning: Scientists find out that the earth's core is heating up. They inform the president of the USA.Rising action: The earth's crust becomes unstable. The family flees from the USA to the Tibetian mountains by airplane. They manage to get themselves on board of one of the arks. Huge Tsunamis overflow parts of the world.Catastrophe and Happy End: Humanity including the family survives and finds refuge in Africa (who would have expected that?!), which could withstand the catastrophe in some parts of the continent. How cheap is that?",2012
1124,feitoza01,Garbage. Do not waste your time !!!,1,28 November 2009,"The creators of this mediocre production in the minimum must think we're feeble to spend their time watching the new effects-in this film ridiculous. This is one of this new crap of Hollywood. Only ""it."" 2012 cost 260 million dollars and is 158 minutes long. At roughly 2 million dollars a minute, one might at least expect a thrill-a-second work of exciting entertainment, since one does not go to a Roland Emmerich movie expecting either art or deep meaning. Unfortunately, the many millions spent on this bloated, overblown ""B"" genre programmer could not guarantee the filmmakers a good script with a tight plot and interesting characters. Emmerich treats his own screenplay (co-written by Harold Klausner) with a level of seriousness customarily reserved for the Holocaust or biopics of figures like Jesus Christ or Mahatma Ghandi. There is no plot to speak of - Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the impending end of the world and has to rescue his offspring and ex-wife from danger. That's all that happens in the entire movie - for over 2.5 hours! By the 4th or 5th time we have seen Jackson and his gang escape death (whether by earthquake, plane crash, volcanic eruption, tsunami, etc., etc.) the whole thing has become so turgid and wearisome that one finds oneself rooting for the tsunami to kill them all just so the movie can end and one can go home. The thin plot might not be all that bad if the film were better-paced and more exciting, but Emmerich wants you to know that he is A Serious Auteur and that 2012 is an Important Film About Our Time, so every sequence keeps going WAY past its sell-by date. Watching this movie is like being hit in the head with a wooden plank multiple times - one is eventually stunned into abject submission. Emmerich does everything at least twice, and his respect for his own material seems to have convinced him that 2012 could not have been shorter by one second, when at least 45 minutes of useless sub-plots involving disposable minor characters as well as repetitive sequences of cities collapsing, flames covering the sky, 1500 meter waves drowning everything in sight and famous monuments crumbling into depthless chasms could and should have been left on the cutting-room floor. By the time Jackson saves the high-tech ark containing what's left of North American civilization (don't ask), apparently by channeling Shelley Winters' swim scene from The Poseidon Adventure, any sense of awe which the sight of huge waves washing over the Himalayas should generate in the audience has been replaced by a numb wish that the whole thing will be over soon and a prayer that one's brain death will only be temporary. After watching a whole lot of cities get destroyed again and again, one simply becomes mentally and visually exhausted by the whole bloated mess. Surprisingly strong performances from a thoroughly professional cast are wasted on tissue-thin characterizations - but believe me, these performers earned their money just from being able to say the bland, clichéd lines they are given with a straight face. Furthermore, despite the appearance of realism thanks to some technically flawless CGI, there is no blood or gore - there should be body parts raining down from the sky during the destruction of LA, but somehow no one seems to be on the streets. On the other hand, a lot of blood and gore might have reminded the movie audience that one is in fact watching a film about the extinction of literally billions of living things, but why should something so petty be more important than seeing whether John Cusack will get back together with his ex-wife and become a hero so his whiny, spoiled son will accept him? In any case, what does it say about contemporary society that a movie showing nothing less than the destruction of the entire world is rated ""PG-13""? As far as the ""science"" and ""facts"" behind this utterly ridiculous bit of piffle, the less said about that, the better. Of course, this piece of overblown trash will probably turn hundreds of millions for its makers and secure Emmerich's position as one of the top commercial directors of the day. At least if the world actually ends in 2012, all copies of 2012 will be destroyed.",2012

Emmerich is back on form with blowing stuff up on a huge scale. This is out and out escapist fun, and worth seeing at the cinema for the sheer spectacle of the stunning visuals and sound. There are laugh out loud moments, and several attempts at a plot even! The 'science' is as laughable as the premise, but hey - it's all good fun! This is an END OF THE WORLD movie, and you know what? Seeing cheesy landmark destruction scenes, camper vans outrunning volcanoes - it's what we pay to see.

I mean, come on....with a budget like this they could come up with something much better.The 'story' itself...well...there isn't much of a story. It goes from one cliché to another. I wasn't exactly expecting a 'Shawshank Redemtion', but at least they could give us some more background information about the Maya calender, which predicts the end of the world.I really could NOT relate to the characters, at one point I was like: Just let them all DIE and move on to the ending credits.I'm not going into details, because almost everything has already been written here, but there's 2 things I have to get off my chest: 1. The film makers deserve a kick in the nuts for cheating us; 2. German dubbed porn is more bearable than this piece of crap.",2012
1128,techservices,Less fun than being punched in the face,2,1 December 2009,"How did this film ever get made? More to the point, why did so many talented actors sign up for it?Where to start? Well, okay the special effects are gob-smackingly good. I mean truly brilliant - but sadly that's all that this film has going for it, and after 30 minutes that's not enough to stop you looking for the exit.The story starts reasonably well, albeit with all of the usual disaster movie clichés. Things take a wrong turn pretty fast though and by the time the first of the holes in the ground appear you're wishing that the Earth had opened up and swallowed the scriptwriter and producers instead. One over the top improbable special effects sequence follows another, and whilst they are audio-visual feasts, I wish even one tenth of the same effort had gone into writing a script that didn't hit every cloyingly saccharine cliché ever to come out of Hollywood. I mean truly - you'll cringe at almost every line.The actors seem to be running brain-in-neutral, like they too can't wait for the film to finish. I can see them all thinking the same thing; ""whatever, this is a piece of c**p, but that paycheck has some nice zeroes on it and Madoff did kinda screw us."" John Cusack is one of my favourite actors, but an hour in even I couldn't care less if he died or not. There was just no heart in his acting. Danny Glover was passable, but totally mis-cast as the President. The show-stealer was Oliver Platt who gave an excellent performance as the jaded, cynical politico who is the main antagonist of the film. You really believe in his character and find yourself agreeing with him whilst all the other characters run around spouting unbelievably cheesy platitudes. Woody Harrelson is sadly underused, and his crackpot character given too much credence by John Cusack's protagonist. The other performances are largely forgettable.But the worst - the absolute worst thing - about this film is the lack of any pretence of reality in the story. Ridiculous doesn't even begin to cover it. Over the top is par for course especially in disaster movies, but this one really aims for the stars. It massively overindulges itself, and you find yourself rolling your eyes as science is left for dust and the end of the possibility curve is but a distant memory as each new set-piece rolls out on its embarrassingly ludicrous premise. The clincher is the Cistine Chapel sequence, where one shot - you'll know it when you see it - just had everybody in my cinema groaning and rolling their eyes. After that, it didn't matter how good the visual effects were, because the suspension of disbelief - perilously thin as it was up until then - was totally lost and the audience started looking at their watches and wondering if the football highlights might be more entertaining.So, the good in this film boils down to the visual effects and Oliver Platt. Everything else is either dire, forgettable, or just totally unmemorable. I can't even comment on the score because I genuinely can't remember anything of it.The only reason I could think of to recommend this film is as an example of how bad the genre can be. You'd be hard pressed to find worse; Armageddon, Independence Day, Poseidon, Volcano, Dante's Peak and Day After Tomorrow are all far better than this. That should give you an indicator of how much you need to body-swerve this flick.",2012

The special effects are fantastic and the casting was spot on. Unlike most disaster films there was no long drawn out bits of dialogue discussion on how they're gonna save the Earth, the first 20 minutes gives the background on why the planet's coming to an end and then the action kicks in, and boy does it kick in. Anybody looking for a film with an intricate plot should probably avoid this as you're gonna feel let down, however if you want almost 3 hours of non stop action, excellent effects without having to think too much about what's going on then you'll love this film.

There is probably an hour of collective footage involving John Cusak running from collapsing earth, right on his heels. Or driving/flying through the bottom of structures in the process of falling, but just barely making it through on time.It's as if the director took all of our favorite aspects of ""Independence Day"", and just kept recycling them over and over, but in different scenarios.

There is an absolute overload of clichés (broken families,filled with ""american point of view"" stereotypes). Acting is poor ( even Danny Glover just doesn't do the trick) and in the and you don't actually care whether the characters live or die (Actually for several moments I wished they'd all die so the movie could finally end).

My parents don't watch a lot of Hollywood films, but this one they watched in theatres. Basically what I am saying is that the whole world coming to an end doesn't need a plot or character, or character development; it just needs special effects, and thats exactly what your getting, and a lot of it.When I first heard it had a weak script I thought it really sucked, but the script wasn't too bad. Its the fact that they constantly survive catastrophic events which probably would reduce their chances of survival to a minimum. However this concept of the Mayan calendar is ever so interesting. You would need to research more about it, because almost none was given in the movie, except for a cheap animation recorded from a computer monitor.Basically if you want to watch a nice movie to scare your girlfriend and wrap your arms around her, this one is for you, and be prepared to be shocked.",2012

1141,jameswhitehouseoct251988,Liberal Propaganda once more? Hollywood is out of touch with U.S.,2,14 January 2010,"Why is it in every disaster movie that Roland Emmerich makes the U.S. is the first to be destroyed? And why is it at the end, everyone that lives turns to a third world country. I've almost seen every one of Mr. Emmerich's movies and either he makes a really good one like Independence Day(Will Smith), The Patriot(Mel Gibson), and Stargate (Kurt Russel & James Spader)which was a pretty simple plot but opened up a door for a great TV show which he deserves none of the credit or he makes complete crap like Godzilla(Matthew Broderick), The Day After Tomorrow(Dennis Quaid), or mediocre movie like 10,000 B.C.(Camille Belle). I will agree this movie had great special effects but in a lot of ways they really over did it. They acting was crap like normal for a disaster movie which was sad because John Cusack is a good actor. The thing is Mr. Emmerich is from Germany but you don't see him destroying Berlin in any of his movies. I'm tired of hearing how political Avatar is and how it plays the race card and the mistreatment of the American Indian. 2012 is one of the most disguised unpatriotic movie in the past 5 years. Stop destroying the U.S. Roland and go back to fighting aliens.",2012
1142,mcdoubled,My opinion,4,20 January 2010,"I really thought that this might be another awesome movie as ""The Day after Tomorror"". But i can't express how much i got disappointed... Every time the music gets exciting you already know what will happen. And it will always happen.For example (***SPOLIER***): When Jackson Curtis drives to his (Ex-)Wife to try to save them you see the TV in their kitchen and Schwarzenegger tells that everything will be fine. Its so foreseeable that in the next seconds something will happen because of the music getting louder and the zoom-in of his face...and here the earthquake comes...and of course Jackson is coming though their open (?) door and saves them and makes a joke about the car of his ex-wife's new boyfriend crashing down a huge cliff which opened right next to their old houseother logical mistakes:How could it be a secret when they built huge ships in a few years? There had to be thousands of people working on those ships.",2012

You can see the plot ""unfold"" from a million miles away, no surprises, all clichés, all the time. Horrible acting, how could anyone calling themselves an Actor even sign up for this utter piece of crap? Tobias Fuenke in Arrested Development has more credit as an ""Actor"" (as he puts it so proudly) than John Cusak.Avoid at all cost, it's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen!

After the whole 2.5 hours during movie, i had a enormous headache! I really waisted my by watching it. How is it possible that movies contain so little depth and a real good, united story?The special acts were beautiful, but everything the main character witnessed was so unreal! Flying with an airplane through collapsing skyscrapers, driving with a car over cracking earth plates and other cool stuff that made this movie dull, implausible and maybe even the worst world-disadvantage movie I've ever seen.

I'm sorry to say that there is no adrenaline rush to be had from this one.I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone so I'm not going to provide the detail of my biggest complaint except to say that with all the care they put into not offending Muslims in making this movie, they missed the boat completely for Christians and Jews! The climax of this movie is something that is in complete conflict with the teachings of the Old Testament and the Torah – somewhere over the rainbow.On the positive side, the scenery is breathtaking at times.",2012

After the movie had been released in late 2009, i didn't watch it because of some work related problems. Now in 10/02/2010 , I watched this movie for the first time, You know what - That's the biggest mistake that i did that day. I regret it now.This is a very great comedy genre movie as you can see in the first half of the movie. The second part of the movie is way freaking obvious. I watched this movie from start to end only to find out the how the story ends.You almost never see how Yuri(i think) dies. And one of the crew member at last tell that the damage was not bad as they expect at the start. I mean , come on , that's really bad script in the story The only part i enjoyed is when the timer shows how much time they left before the wave's hit them. At first it shows them like its like only less that a minute left , and suddenly the A.I tells that 28 minute's remaining. That's the only suspense in the movie.Overall, too many close shaves situation , ruined the movie. The director thinks that the graphics can cover the movies flaw, but he's obviously wrong.I absolutely wouldn't recommend this movie. 1/10",2012
1147,Szyga,definitely watch or please read this,10,15 February 2010,"I was here a few days ago and the featured review was one that was very harsh on this movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but that post was disinfo. It lied about what was in the movie repeatedly and gave an extremely inaccurate portrayal of it seemingly in an attempt to keep people from watching it, so I came back as soon as I finally saw the movie to point out all the parts of the post that were nothing but lies. Now the main review has changed already and is certainly better than the other one but it still is misleading and will undoubtedly cause some people who would have watched the movie if they had been given a description by someone who understood the movie to not watch it, and that is wrong. So many people are bashing this movie but every person i read that is bashing it is either missing an aspect of the movie or is an atheist. I used to be an atheist. But being an atheist is just as stupid as being certain that God exists without having proof. Where's your proof God doesn't exist? You think science explains anything? Science gives an explanation for what has happened for the last however many billion years it is currently theorized the universe has existed, but it doesn't even attempt to explain how all this got started. And existence having always existed is so strange that it makes God seem plausible. And also directly contradicts science. Theories of cyclical time flow fare no better, it is still a paradox. As far as the aspect of the movie being missed... You complain that it is not realistic. Yea its not realistic if you don't believe in some force which operates outside of the boundaries of the accepted reality of non-religious thought. But this movie is going on the assumption that there is such a force. Its great you're all openminded enough to not blindly believe in God but being openminded means being open to anything. There is a reason why so many things worked out just right that goes along perfectly with the rest of the movie.",2012
1148,robbyrichards-675-78089,2012 visuals blew me away! Watch in HD!,10,2 March 2010,"2012 is by far and away the best apocalyptic movie I have seen. Personally I didn't like the most notable apocalyptic movies ""Day after tomorrow"" and ""Legend"". I did not go to see this movie in the theaters because I am not a fan of John Cusack and thought that he may annoy me and I wouldn't enjoy the movie. I wish I had because the visual effects are amazing! The action in 2012 is second to no movie! I own hundreds of dvds and usually watch all of the extra features. I am a person who really respects great film making. The camera swings and angles used in this movie are simply amazing. My favorite scene has to be the yellowstone eruption! The scene is a work of art in my opinion. I am simply astonished and disappointed that more people didn't have the experience and adventure that I had during this movie. 2012 is definitely a 9/10 in my opinion but I take it a step further and give it a 10/10 because I feel it is worthy. My only reasoning is perhaps my experience was better because I have a widescreen HD television. When the earth is collapsing in and the huge office buildings come crashing down you can pause it and see people in those buildings. The detail is absolutely amazing! And while the devastation is astonishing it is also saddening to see. To close I will say that this film gave me an amazing experience! Few films have taken me on an adventure and kept me in suspense like 2012 did. Most recently Slumdog millionaire gave me a great movie experience such as this.",2012

Call me a masochist, but even with these reservations, I sat through all of 2012. To call this thing a dog would be an insult to dogs.I am not categorically against using totally implausible science to tell a great story, but when a movie completely ignores all scientific accuracy and also fails to present a compelling narrative (despite a pretty decent cast), that is a zero in my book.Looks like we have a new winner for WORST MOVIE EVER (the previous was John Q.)",2012

The very idea that the world is ending and only the wealthiest will be saved is a page right out of Marx. The white people in this movie are cowardly, selfish, evil, spineless or just clueless. The only decent people are the President, a young scientist and the president's daughter. All African-American. I swear, these people in Hollywood have gotten so self-righteous, they can't even tell a story anymore! Weekend At Bernie's 2 was a better movie than this bloated, hate driven, anti- establishment, Al Gore worshiping waste of two and a half hours. Don't even think about renting it.

Thank God I only rented it and can get this stink out of my house quickly. Also, about 45 mins too long - how this drivel ever made it to a holiday release is beyond me...I guess if it costs enough, a studio can get it in the theaters, no matter what the pre-release test groups show.About the acting...ughh!!!...clearly Cusak and Glover know a bomb when they read it...although I don't think Amanda Peete has a clue...and the other character acting ranges from stiff to way overboard.Personally, I thought the world deserves to end after this piece of film garbage...",2012

There are historical, albeit vague references to this December date in 2012 and the premise is scientifically believable. It could have been a relevant movie.The effects are wonderful; as good or better than any of the top movies in recent years..Where it went wrong: The separated husband winning back his wife is really cliché. It's been a reoccurring theme in movies for that last decade and therefore seems a cheap way to inject conflict into a story.The constant ""deadline effect"" in the movie is so over-worn that it is likely to become a cult joke. Every exciting scene has our protagonists just, and I mean just escaping the oncoming cracks in the world, the falling buildings, the ever increasing range of a volcano blast, The lowering of a heavy metal door, an airplane crashing on a glacier, or the . you pick the disaster, our heroes will just barely escape it. Scene after scene of epic disasters, each outdoing the previous one and every one of them is a miraculous escape. This comic-book thrill-making method is probably more responsible than any other problem in the movie as to why it was panned so badly.The actor playing the President should not have been the wonderful character actor who mumbles and is too much a normal, likable guy. Articulation and elocution are essential in winning office. Danny Glover was not a credible President. All the other key actors are perfect for their roles. In fact, I don't think that such a splendid cast would have signed on to this movie if they had known what the ""Deadline Effect"" would do to the movie.It's a shame, because the premise, the basic story and the special effects were wonderful. It just shows how the control over the craft of these movies is being managed by 20-somethings and their X-box riddled minds with 10 second attention spans. And I don't mean the audience.",2012

You can tell that the $200 million was mostly spent on the cgi and ignoring the storyline and acting quality.Such a shame so much money and fantastic cgi was wasted in this film.

(The film was watched on Blu-Ray disc on a 1080P 50 inch high definition plasma television).Film lovers will agree that there is much more to a film than special effects but with Roland Emerich's films, special effects are the foundation of all his films with the story line built around the visual entertainment (Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, Godzila etc). From experience, the film was not viewed for the credible story line, but for some popcorn fun as that is what the director does best. However, this film failed on all levels and is by far his worst film. The premise of the film is our sun overheats the planets core causing a shift in the earths crust, total land displacement and subsequent earthquakes and Tsunamis.There is a stark resemblance to The Day After Tomorrow (which was considerably better than this) and the film is over 2 1/2 hours long. The first 45 minutes went fine, within reason as the picture set the scene for doomsday but once the action sequences started, I was spitting out my popcorn for the wrong reasons. The effects look shockingly awful and dated for a film produced in 2009 and the use of green screen is evident in most shots. Our feline friends are said to be blessed with 9 lives, but Mr Cusack and his family must have had a cat in each pocket because the first action sequence which sees the destruction of the west coast is just terrible and from that point on, the film loses any credibility and spoilt the enjoyment.

How many times can you escape the same dilemma in one movie....... Come on! The plot however had a lot of potential.

From beginning to end, the earth has begun experiencing terrible seismic tremors all over the world. Massive earthquakes have struck cities such as Los Angeles and have left unforgettable disasters impossible to repair; volcanoes also have erupted all over the world including the Yellowstone Caldara, which is blanketing the United States in ash. The reason for this horrible occurrence as science had warned against and foretold, was because the earth's core was completely melting which was simultaneously causing the earth's plates to shift. As water levels were rising and cities being flooded, people in all parts of the world were falling victims to such disasters. Meanwhile, while all this disaster is taking place, a family consisting of two young children, a mother, her boyfriend, and a divorced father, all do their best to escape the deaths that so many have encountered. Taking a flight to China where immense arks had been built to sustain a flood, the family finally reaches their destination. However, those who had ordered the vessels to be built did so only for themselves and those who could afford a seat. Hoping to catch a ride and save their lives, countless individuals attempt to get inside the vessels but are rejected but the officials. Will society completely come to an end?

1165,andreadfitz,This action-pact film is a must see for those who are strictly searching for an entertaining film.,4,27 July 2010,"The movie ""2012"" is a film that was based off of the Mayan Calendar conspiracy that the world is going to end on December 12th 2012. Director Roland Emmerich pieced together this film by providing the audience with general knowledge that extreme heating of the Earth's core would cause major shifts, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions that would take out the history of man-kind and life on this planet as we know it. One man, Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), desperate to bring peace to his life before the dramatic end, went through leaps and bounds as he fought against the forces of nature in an attempt to save his ex-wife, Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet) and their children from the inevitable destruction of this planet. Discovering a well kept secret from one of his clients, Curtis sends thrill seekers on a journey across the world to fight for a chance to board ""Noah's arch"", the vessel that was built to preserve the human and animal species.The theme of this film is how human kindness can truly prevail over evil, chaos, greed, and destruction. One act of kindness was shown as several of the characters were desperate to mend broken relationships with their estranged family members. The character, who was the sole deliverer of the devastating news, geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was able to say his final good-bye's to his Father, Harry Helmsley (Blu Mankuma); while on the other- hand, Blu's friend and traveling companion Tony Delgatto (George Segal) attempted to mend the relationship between his and his son before it was too late.Another emotional scene in this film that proved how a person in power can choose to save lives instead of abandon the lives of innocent human beings is displayed a powerful scene as Adrian Helmsley desperately sought out help from the World Leaders to ""open the gates"" and save the lives of the ""less fortunate"", not only because they simply could, but because it was the right thing to do. His desperate plea was seconded by President Thomas Wilson's (Danny Glover) daughter, Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton).This story is quite similar to director Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"" (the final battle between good and evil), as far as the destruction of this great planet. Several intense scenes provided the audience with an insight that not even people in power can stop the destruction stemming from forces unknown. In the case of Armageddon, the destructive forces came from outer space and sought to destroy the planet from the outside in, while Roland Emmerich's perception of the end days stemmed from forces that would destroy the planet from the inside out. Both movies provided very similar story lines; satisfy the audience on how it may be during the final days of this planet. There was also an act of kindness that showed how an act of kindness that proved goodness can exist in a world full of chaos and disorder similar to that of ""2012"". Several characters sacrificed their lives to save their loved ones and their beloved planet. At the end of both films, because of their selfless act of kindness, the planet and human lives were saved.Director Roland Emmerich used a tiny dog as a motif throughout the film, perhaps suggesting the dog served as a semblance of innocence and hope. He also used multiple layers of texture in his frames in order to capture the complete chaos and turmoil occurring as the main characters fought through the destruction of the world around them in search of safety and calmness.To conclude, this film is a must see for those looking to be simply entertained. If you are looking for a film that defines logic and reasoning, this may not be the film to view, however; this film does stand true to the true meaning of human kindness and selflessness as the story unfolds to a surprisingly happy ending.",2012
1166,gearhd23,So the world ends again!,4,28 July 2010,"2012 was an OK film for someone not paying a lot of attention to it, because you won't get lost in scene changes. This film was an absolute waste of a good title for what could have been an incredible action drama. John Cusack should rethink his roles in movies and what films he picks to star in. The most gripping part of the entire film was the plane flight to China when you were in suspense not knowing what would happen. The effects were decent and the sets were exceptionally made. The film had all the good eye candy you would expect from a film about the end of the world. It was not so horrible I wouldn't watch it again, but if I did I think I would take it as more of a comedy, action drama twist without any good comedy. The world ending by a flood is old news and if that's what I wanted to hear about or see a reenactment of it I would go to a Sunday school play. It would be more gripping than this movie was. All in all it was mediocre and could have used more suspense and less Sci-Fi effects at the end. The whole 2012 concept would lead one to believe the film was going to relate to the Mayan calendar and that the world was going to end because of a reason only the Mayans knew of and was never reviled. This is why their calendar ended in 2012. If you are going to name a movie after a fictional or yet to be proved prophecy, at least make it interesting enough to capture the viewer, and trying to convince them this may be how it happens if, it ever does happen. The concept of the end of the world should at least somewhat relate to science and religion in the current state of mind and not in the old state of thinking. Noah already survived a flood and repopulated the world; this story line is old news even with cool effects and explosions.",2012
1167,peterbrayshaw,Awful movie even more pointless on the small screen,1,14 August 2010,"Just sat through 2012. Having read many negative reviews i thought i;d judge for myself. Just the worst piece of film making for some time. Surely the studios at some point have to recognise that special effects are not enough to carry a film. This has virtually no plot and possibly the worst script i've ever listened to.I'm struggling to understand what made a number of top quality actors sign up for this drivel? Cusack and Thandi Newton should probably know better but i guess $$$ speaks loudly.Also there's an ""explain it all with a comedy presentation"" which is a complete Jurassic Park rip off.Avoid this!",2012

It seems like the screenwriters got addicted to ""and then ..."" followed by the next wacky thing happening. The result is a truly interminable film. It may have been marginally compelling if it ran 90 minutes or so (and not the 2 hours and 38 minutes of the final cut). Instead, it seeks to consolidate every other disaster film of the last several decades, with elements borrowed from Armageddon, War of the Worlds, Independence Day, even the Poseidon Adventure. Where are the editors when you need them?Certainly among the dopiest sci-fi films ever made (don't get me started about the physics and geology). And certainly worthy of the ""MST 3000"" treatment.",2012
1169,jamie-jamie,"2012 - 7/10 - Poor Plot, Great Effects",7,20 October 2011,"The best thing about this film where the effects. The story line involved with the characters was pretty poor. the lines where also very poor. It was worth watching, but in terms of a good film which needs everything. It didn't make it in my hit list.The effects where admirable, You should expect this when the budget was 200 million. some of the effects seemed a bit too far. the aeroplane flying under the building was slightly stupid. Coming back to reality you would think that the plane would have been hit by falling objects. It wouldn't take much to knock out an engine. Have i watched this film more than once? Yes, It was good enough to watch twiceI admired the effects, It would be interesting to have seen similar effects shot in 3d",2012
1170,www-libros-net,"I liked it, but lacked information",7,6 November 2010,"The movie was good, many effects and quality, but for my taste, lacked relevant content related to 2012: December 21, 2012, the final date of the Long Count Calendar created by the ancient Mayans in Central America. Countless books, journal articles, websites and newspaper headlines discuss its meaning. With fans on the 2 sides, some advocating the end of time and others who speak of a rebirth of Consciousness. Adding fuel to the debate, some scientists see a growing number of natural disasters in recent years as evidence of a catastrophic climax shall entail in 2012 ... They foresaw the coming of Christianity and the Spanish conquest of America. Written over eight hundred years ago, the Mayan prophecies predicted the First World War, the rise of Hitler and the December 2006 tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia. And within a few years, the 21 December 2012 Mayans predict a natural disaster of unspeakable proportions that will destroy the earth and humanity erased.And since the December 21, 2012 approaches, the Mayan prophecies are gaining worldwide attention. In the winter of 2009, the overproduction of Ronald Emmerich disaster leads box office. Emmerich's film tells the story of the prediction of the Maya and how the destruction of the earth can occur. But there is some scientific validity to the Mayan prophecies and the Mayan Code is nothing more than an idea for disaster movies?.",2012
1171,btagent6454,It's worth a watch but turn your brain off,6,4 May 2011,"This did exactly what it said it would do, the special effects were excellent. They were stunning all the way through, the lava, explosions, earthquakes etc. It was visually very impressive and is the sort of movie if made last year would have been in 3d and looked even better.The other side of the coin is the awful dialogue and rushed storytelling. They try and fit too much in so end up rushing everything so there is never a real build up of dread which you need in a disaster movie. The deadline for when things go wrong really jumps about so you never get that slow build which it needs.The other problem this film has it has emotional scenes with characters you know nothing about. You feel as much as seeing strangers saying goodbye to each other at an airport. That is what this film is like, just watching people you could not care less about avoid danger.So in summary, looks brilliant and easy enough to watch when wanting to turn your brain off but don't bother watching it if you want anything more.",2012
1172,jamie147,Go into this film with the right expectations and enjoy it for what it is. Very entertaining.,7,3 December 2009,"I was unsure of what to expect with this movie and so, prior to watching this film, I visited IMDb and read several reviews and message board comments to find out what to expect. I must thank all the IMDb users who have contributed comments for this movie because it really did the trick for me. My expectations were realistically set and this and allowed me to really enjoy the film for what it was.I quickly realised that the best attitude to approach the film was to try to disengage the analytical, thinking part of the brain and not to expect a serious, plausible story. Instead, I decided to just expect plenty of great, non-stop action interspersed with a typical set of cheesy emotional scenes as the disaster starts to unfold and a typically clichéd set of characters. This is exactly what I got and with my expectations appropriately set, I really enjoyed the film.In the first 5 minutes, during the explanation of the impending disaster by the scientists, when the following line was spoken, I realised that I was right not to engage the more intellectual parts of my brain (approximate quote)...""It looks as if the neutrinos have mutated into some other sort of (far more aggressive) sub-atomic particle (that will melt the crust, etc, etc).""Let's face it; you don't have to be Einstein to have issues with that kind of scientific claim! Anyway, the action kicked in pretty soon into the film, and I have to say that the actions scenes truly were brilliantly done. They were probably the best, most impressive action scenes I have ever seen in a film. I was really astounded by the first car chase scene as the film's main characters were rushing from their home to the first small plane in order to escape, and all the flight scenes were truly fantastic. The action scenes did not dip in standard throughout the film - it was real edge of the seat stuff and was highly entertaining.Interspersed with the action, there was the typical set of cheesy disaster movie type clichés to sit through as people started to realise the desperate situation they were all in, but even these could be tolerated with some amusement if approached in the right frame of mind and viewed light-heartedly. I am talking of course about the liberal smattering of emotional, tear-filled phone calls from sons/daughters to fathers/mothers, etc, when they all know that they will soon be toast, the untimely deaths of selected lovable characters (but not the heroes of course!), the self-sacrifice of the US president (we've seen this before, and let's face it, in reality he'd have been the first on that plane!), the numerous near misses e.g. cracks on the runway following the plane just a few feet behind! There was also the inclusion of the rather over-used scenario of an estranged but good, loving, if somewhat unreliable Dad competing for the attentions of his ex-wife and children with the very reliable but geeky step-Dad. It is pretty obvious from the start that the Dad is going to win out in the end, and this is very conveniently effected when the step-Dad is eliminated in rather gory circumstances! At least the step-Dad was given a semi-nice character, was given some good action scenes and kind of made friends with the Dad before his untimely demise instead of being portrayed as and out and out sleaze ball, as usually happens in this type of film!To conclude, I would say that realistic expectations and frame of mind are the keys to enjoying this film. Do not expect too much of the science to really add up or for the plot to be genuinely plausible. Do not expect to be intellectually challenged by the script or the plot. Instead, expect a lot of amusing cheesiness in the script, plenty of clichés and above all expect to enjoy some truly first class action. If you go in with this attitude you won't be disappointed. If anything, the film could have been 20 minutes or so shorter, but in general I really enjoyed it for what it was. Setting my expectations was so vital to this. There are a lot of parallels to Independence Day with this film, but I enjoyed this film 10 times more simply because my expectations and mind-set were far more appropriately, realistically set before the film started.",2012
1173,lamken,Worst crap ever,1,23 January 2010,"Bloody hell, never have I spent almost three hours, waiting for a flick to end. In the beginning you hoped the special effects would be worth waiting for, bot they were C-movie, at most. The script were probably written on a napkin during a coffe break. Let me spare you this movie, when you start hoping all the stupid characters will die a terrible death, they wont...The Russian stripper with silicone-boobs of course survives because she repents her titties in the end of the movieSo help me good, I will never ever see a movie by the retard Emmerich again.",2012
1174,ddj_holloway,"Less Creditable than the Mayan ""predictions"".",2,8 January 2013,"Right, where to begin. I watched 2012 on the 21st of December 2012 as a topical, tongue in check film choice to celebrate yet another ""doomsday"" passing without incident. By the end of the film I had wished the World had actually ended to to save me from such a terrible film. The characters have as much personality as a brick. The plot is weak. The film is full of clichés, the father separated from the children's mother and has to deal with the jealousy of his kids liking their new step-father. Characters (who running for their lives to get in yet another getaway vehicle) will stop to say a ""funny"" one liner that is about as appropriate as giving cheese burger with extra cheese to an acute lactose intolerance sufferer. The film also suffers from what I like to call the ""Armageddon factor"" where the director thinks that constantly throwing near miss after very improbable near miss very 10 seconds will make the film intense, on the edge of your seat nail biting. It doesn't, it makes the film boring and predictable. I can't for the life me understand why it's got such a high rating on here (5.8 at the time of writing). As I joked with a friend ""from this day onwards every single precious second is a bonus and needs to be cherished... and I've just wasted 534,600 of them on this pile of poo (not the word I used but you know what I meant)"". The positive of this film is, the visual effect. They are absolutely stunning. The scene where they take off in plane fly along a newly form gorge with the buildings of L.A. (along with subway trains and the like) falling in over their head is worth a gander, especially if the is a 3D version out there, but is a sequence that last 5 minutes, if that. Not really worth the 2 hours and 25 minute of the rest of the film.Ultimately, I believe that these so-called Mayan predictions have more creditable than this film",2012
1175,kiranvalani,escaping from death,8,9 April 2011,"2012,The movie 2012 is about how the world changes within a few hours and how it affects on people moral and ethical values. The 2012 has atrocious dialog but the story line was good, it was about the whole world is trying to escape from death and people are helping each other and give support for the survival compare to those rich people who bought the tickets to save themselves from death, come on how can anyone escape from his death you can prevent by using precious. For example if you're sick you will go to Doctor and use the prescribe medication rather then still home and suffer to die but in the ends it depends on the disease your suffering with, if your diagnose with Cancer in your liver you cannot escape from the death but you can survive few more years with taking all the precious. Similarly people did everything to escape from death and few of them did survive by getting into those big ships. The Movie had a lot of destruction scenes which was horrifying but entertaining Bottom line is that this film is FUN TO WATCH. But with the open mind otherwise you'll regret spending your time and money",2012
1176,aiko2011,"Good movie, which deserves more credit",10,28 May 2011,"I cannot understand why many people rated this movie so low? they compared it to The Day After Tomorrow.. but the stories are entirely different. They are DIFFERENT in their own way! DAT is based on severe Climate Change. But that effects only parts of the world, There are ways for humans to survive. This movie is based on the Ancient Mayan Civilisations predictions for the date 2012. The emissions from the Sun has an effect on the earth-core which leaves practically nowhere for any type of species to survive. The fight for survival is much more intense in this movie.I'm a big fan of DAT, I watched it 3 times! but 2012 definitely brings a lot more to the table... in terms of Visual Effects, the unique story, the way the Characters all tie in with one another. Yes, there are some miraculous escapes, but it's a movie.. if they made it 100% realistic all humans would be dead. That wouldn't make it a fun movie to watch now would it?.Movies tend to do far-fetched things sometimes, thats what makes it interesting and sometimes even funny... i laughed so much when I saw them land at the right place at the right time, but thats what makes it entertaining too. If they died, that wouldn't make it much of a story.I put off watching the movie, because of the bad reviews for such a long time... but after I watched it, I thought it was much better than people had given it credit for... watch it, and you might just be surprised.",2012
1177,Devris007,Full of Good visual effect but none from the characters,8,1 December 2009,"It is an amazing and awesome movie but like all movies, there's flaws.Characters I don't really feel connected to the character in the story. All I remember is that there's disaster after disaster. Even when the main characters sit down and talk, the conversation was dull. The dialog in every stories should have large contribution to the story but in this movie, I just don't see it. It's like watching your friend talking shyly to the girl he fell in love.Design Okay, there's one fatal flaw in the design of the arks, the windows in the bridge. If you know that the ship is facing tremendous pressure, you wouldn't install a window of glass. It will just break. That's why submarines don't have windows. If it happened in the real words, with that ship design, the first wave would have breached the window in a matter of second and the people in it will die.Plot The fact that the main character drove a limo through the disaster and survived is unbelievable and almost impossible.The fact that the plane(the biplane) that they use is still intact while its surrounding is not for a length the main characters needed to drive from their home to it?! Oh come on, that's just ridiculously stupid. That plane must be a damn lucky bastard.(saying this because all the plane around him is destroyed or immobilize).The pilots, Sasha and Gordon are stupid. They are in a plane with limited fuel and heavy cargo. If Sasha truly is a pilot, he would dumped those freaking cars into the sea and they may have made it farther. But no, the writers just put in the cars so that it would contribute to the scene where they are escaping from the plane. This is called forced situation. Sasha had a chance to live if he had dumped the cargo. And they would have made it to the airport, if not, near it.Clichés I detected many cliché during those two hours of watching it. Here's the list Crazy person with a doomsday board, is tolerated but a bit oldThe Charlie, yet another crazy person looking into the conspiracy, is a dry.Oh, main character who is divorced, teeeet, been used to many timeThe Genesis(the cruise ship) being hit by a rogue wave, that's a bit like Poseidon, isn't it? it's a rip off.There's still other clichés but I forgot it. Later when I watch it again, I'll draft out a new list of cliché in that movie. For me, in a story, two cliché is fine, more than that, well, it will get my negative reviewSo, I praise it for the amazing visual effect but the movie is downed by the lack of character development and a few cliché, I decided to give it a mark of 8 from 10.

Theories like volcanic eruptions, huge floods, earthquakes and the wrath of god. The movie tries to make the losses of life more dramatic than usual by showing places that we can actually relate to, like Manhattan island, The white house and India. The main character is an American called Jackson who lost his wife and 2 kids to a man named Gordon (a pilot in training). While Jackson takes his kids to yellow stone to show them where he and his mother met they find an American military base crawling with scientists surveying the strange core activities of earth. nearby they find a modern hippie camping who owns an RV fully equipped for radio transmissions. The hippie explains to Jackson How the Mayans predicted the end of the world. When they are back in Manhattan they are hit by a lv9 earthquake, So Jackson jumps into a limousine to explain to his ex family and Gordon what was happening. together they escape the island by plane starting their quest for survival. They do a quick landing in Yellowstone to ask the hippie for more information. The find the map in the RV and watch the happy hippie die in Yellowstone's huge explosion and fly away. They land in LA where Gordon's pilot skills profit them again by letting him become co-pilot on the Russian ""Antonov"" carrying cars for a Russian Bilionaire. together they fly to china and crash land in the mountains and by chance get onto the ARKS that save the lives of people who are Bilionaires or Politicly powerful. Only about 10k humans were saves in the end the rest of the world (not including Africa) was lost to human cruelty ""when we stop fighting for each other, THATS when we lose our humanity""This movie's effects and acting are a bit childish at the beginning but later the producers and directors actually put some effort into pulling this out of a Mayan predictions. But its not very focused on the Mayan facts, most of the effort was put into the effects (apprx 80% as good as avatar) ironically enough this movie is also one that you only watch once or twice.",2012

As a production film I could only give it a 6 and that was because it was unintentionally funny and had entertaining CGI otherwise it would be a 4 or 5.John Cusack and the rest of the cast give a good performance despite the Harlequin novel script. Not a single action scene was plausible, the soundtrack was a cheese fest and right on cue with every saving grace.The movie was over dramatic at the end - they could have cut the film by about 25 minutes.What I want to know is how Roland Emmerich pitched this film and was able to get it made!

Of course as of about 10 minutes ago 11:11 Zulu time on the 21st of December, 2012 has passed without incident, rendering countless new age books obsolete and leaving doomsday enthusiasts with a good supply of canned goods and bottled water.

Between the compassionate idealist 'Adrian Helmsley' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the practical, very unfair 'Carl Anheuser' (Oliver Platt). There are many scenes that depict one too many narrow escapes. You need to overlook the drive through the building. Focus on the concept, and battle of wills. In the story, Anheuser has taken charge, and it is set up in such a way that we are to not like him. When you began to know that the life as we know it was going to cease to exist. Helmsley asks Anheuser what he is going to do with his other ticket, that is, his ticket to survive. He replies 'Nothing', that it was not practical for his mother to get on board, and that his relationship with his girlfriend was strained, so too bad for her! Later you find out that he is involved in some sinister plots to get art work into areas that will be saved. How did they finance the building of the saving devices? Anheuser again. ""Sir I have a large family, 1bill dollars is a lot of money?"". ""I'm sorry, it's 1bill euros"". Anheuser orchestrated the sale of tickets! Of course all completely unfair way to make sure people survived, and the program was funded. But if you pay attention to the movie, without Anheuser, there would be no way the whole thing would work. Anheuser says ""What life isn't fair? You can go give your tickets to some of the workers, if you want!"" Of course the thought at that moment was ridiculous. In the end he makes sense. The guy is so wrong, unfair, but at the same time, one of the only ways the whole thing might actually work within the bounds of the 'suspension of disbelief'. Meanwhile Helmsley throughout the movie is trying to save as many as he can. He complains at the size of his cabin, yet it only appears to be about 12x10. Saying: ""You can fit 10 people in here?"" Helmsley has read and aspires to the novel written by the main character 'Jackson Curtis' (John Cusack) which is supposedly overly idealistic novel. At the same time in our real world, it is unfortunately the mean guys like Anheuser who get things done, and get ahead, and become heads of large corporations and/or countries, not the good people like Helmsley.",2012

Obviously they thought exiting moments were more important than developing deeper characters and that's why this story that had great potential stayed so shallow. The dialog was always cheesy and none of the 'hero's' in this film really showed any real emotions nor did they give any of those speeches that give the audience goose bumps. Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent. So to sum up: If you feel like turning your brain off and watching special effects and big explosions with a very shallow storyline then this movie is for you. But if you feel like watching a movie with a bit of depth then go and see something else.",2012

What really stands out in this movie are the special effects, which are absolutely groundbreaking. But the characters are as boring as always and there are absolutely no scenes, that'll make you emotional. With 150 minutes in length, 2010 is about 30 minutes toooooooo long. The last half hour is so forgettable, i nearly screamed for a beer to make the pain go away. Overall, 2012 is a movie you'll probably see just one time, an you'll say that is was okay. But you don't want to get this movie as a birthday or Christmas present. Trust me.",2012
1194,a0302595,"Please, never again",1,27 December 2009,"This movie sucks at so many levels. These types of movies work (if at all) only because of suspension of disbelief. The disbelief is destroyed within the first few minutes and more so with stupid getaway action scenes. The acting is awful, but the script nor apparently the director doesn't give much to work with. The best performance in the movie is given by Woody Harrelson, and it's still one of his personal worst. I fell asleep for the last 15 minutes of the movie, which in retrospect feels like the best part of this picture. This movie does not deserve to be watched by anyone. Ever. This movie makes End of Days and Independence Day look like masterpieces.",2012

1197,pita-quer,The movie ends before the story's getting interesting,2,9 September 2013,"Saw it on TV recently. I thought that the interesting bit of the story starts at the end of the movie:The Africans tell them to bugger off because they have enough problems already. Half the people on board are military troops.Half the cargo is military stuff like weapons, ammo, tanks and probably even jets and missiles.But that is probably too much reality to be depicted in a movie - at least in an American one. Perhaps some European guy is going to make the sequel? I would go into the cinema and pay to see that one. Luckily I didn't do that with this movie.",2012
1198,AZReviews,Awful piece of crap,1,21 October 2013,"I won't go on and on about the MANY things wrong with this movie. A couple typical examples will suffice. In no particular order, a large airplane takes off from LAX just ahead of an crumbling runway. The plane then travels all the way to downtown LA, a distance of a good ten miles and flies between falling skyscrapers. Considering the tallest building in LA is just over 1000 feet tall, you mean to say the plane traveled all that way and is STILL under 1000 feet in the air? Another example, all infrastructure has been destroyed... yet there they are, fall out to sea in an airplane... and their cell phones still work. One more, the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012, yet while things were pretty messed up by the finish of the movie, the world hadn't really ended. And finally, there were all these arks constructed in a huge cavern, also constructed and it was all accomplished in under three years. That in itself is nor very realistic. But what really takes the cake is that these huge vessels, which are constructed to withstand practically ANYTHING, yet a few rocks fall from the ceiling and practically destroy one. WTF?!",2012

However, I really think the American movie or film makers should stop making these movies such as ""2012"". We have already have so many similar movie and films just like ""2012"" with the same theme, story line, predicted out come and acting, and more. These movies and films are all set in the great USA and made by American movie or film makes. Please do discover something new to show your fans, please stop being so self-centred.For now, my self and the world are becoming bored of these similar style disaster movies and films. ""2012"" is so similar to other American disaster films and movies that I predicted the whole outcome from start to finish. It was like in making this movie, they took so many bits from other American disaster movies and put them together to make ""2012"". The whole world know that London Great Britain was the centre of attention for hosting ""London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games"" for the Summer of the year 2012, yet London was only mention and focus on for one second, that was all. How, so self-centred can the American film and movie makes be, this is not good.""2012"" could have been so much more a better movie if only the writer or writers had bother to do there research more better.The only good thing about ""2012"" is that the were some world class famous actors in the movie, but even that is really see as predictable.",2012
1201,thenugget31,What was the worst scene or line in this awful movie for you?,1,17 November 2009,"I had to comment on this movie... I am only 3/4 of the way through watching this movie and I just can't believe how much they hyped up this heap of rubbish. I've read some people on this site asking people to lighten up and like the movie for what it is but really... If it were a comedy then fair enough.. ..it's hilarious... The reason why it's important to hate this film is because these people get paid to make this rubbish and there are hundreds of film-makers out there who would kill to have the resources, money and cast that this guy had and to then produce this rubbish is an insult to these would be film makers and an insult to the audience... Worst scenes for me were the supermarket scene and then the ridiculous escape scene in the car by Cussack and family... The script was just life threateningly awful... The nonchalant acting is excusable because the actors must have realised that this was a bad slapstick comedy quite quickly so I forgive them...People who don't hate this film need to be the first to go when the world does finally end.I still have 30 minutes more to watch so maybe there are even worse scenes yet to come!",2012
1202,ryanyorke,what a waste,3,13 November 2009,"I went into this movie knowing it would lack storyline like previous flicks Roland has directed, but I had hoped the special effects would make up for it. Though the effects did look incredible, the movie had absolutely nothing going for it otherwise. They were on a plane for half the movie and the other half they were saying goodbye to their loved ones over the phone; just garbage. I don't even want to waste any more of my time writing about this movie. I expected more from this movie, but this was just another attempt by Hollywood to capitalize off of people's potential fears. I just hope this movie doesn't give the crazies who believe this will happen any more justification. Do yourself a favor and don't go see this movie; wait for it on DVD.",2012
1203,thechadmer25,No More Pull-ups!,1,15 February 2014,"Well this is my first review on IMDb, but this movie was so awful I was moved to warn everyone not to watch it. I don't know how this movie ended up being so bad, but I feel like this was the major inspiration for the odd sci-fi flick Sharknado. Yup, it was that bad.First of all there were like way too many characters. This was because the producers wanted a big enough character pool to kill off several main characters while still having a nucleus of important characters survive. What made this annoying is that there were so many seemingly unrelated characters that I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them at all. My cousin and I had a fun time trying to decide who was going to die and when. Because I didn't care about any of the people in the movie, when they were in tremendous danger due to all of California falling into a giant hole to the center of the earth it really was not that exciting. In fact the only time I was on the edge of my seat was when I was reaching for my nachos.Speaking of the scene were California was destroyed, it just didn't make any sense. There were buildings falling and explosions and the street was totally gone and somehow the main family managed to escape in a limo. I mean it just was ridic. Everything was totally ridiculous. Everything was destroyed except for some reason China (which is where the magic boats were that would keep everyone safe from the flood.) and for some reason Africa which they found out didn't even get flooded somehow.The climax was horrible. Paris Hilton's dog gets the royal treatment while tons of other people (including a lot of religious people) were shown being violently killed. AND THEN they all get in the boat and are in the water but OH NO there is a leak and the main guys family is drowning and five minutes after launching the boat manages to make it's way from China to Mt. Everest and almost crashes while the main guy dives under the water in an attempt to stop the leak and save everyone even though he might die and somehow everyone on the boat is able to him swim around and fix the gears on camera and when he manages to do it and not die everyone cheers because ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE DEAD, BUT YOU, RANDOM GUY, ARE NOT SO I AM SO HAPPY!! Please do not watch this movie. 2 hours and 40 minutes! I almost couldn't sit though it. And the last line was about the main guy's 7-year-old daughter announcing that she no longer wears diapers to bed. Oh joy.",2012
1204,snazzo-4,A Must See on the Big Screen! Fantastic! A Thrill Ride!,10,26 November 2009,"200 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-o-Scale. OFF THE CHARTS! ""2012"" is SUPERB. You must see it on the Big Screen for the special effects alone. Devastation unlike any ever put to film. Entire cities destroyed, great monuments toppled, and whole countries deluged with massive tidal waves. This movie has almost every disaster movie ever made. Earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, the Titanic, the Poseidon Adventure. The characters are great. Cusack does a fine job as an everyman, a bit of a loser in fact. His wife Amanda Peet is lovely. His daughter Moragn Lily is adorable, weird, and very observant. Woody Harrelson does a great job as a pirate radio nut-job who knows what's really going down. And I think the best character is Oliver Platt as a government official who not only makes the hard decisions but has some great lines. ""What did you think we were going to do, sit around holding hands and sing 'Kumbaya my Lord?'"" Later when an accident cripples the American Ark. ""Something went wrong? SOMETHING WENT WRONG?!? Are you kidding me?!?! Of course something went wrong!!!"" Fun, funny, fantastic and realistic. Although only partially delved into in the movie, 2012 also brings about some great thoughts. Who would you save if the world were ending? WHAT would you save? How would you act if faced with certain death? What regrets would you have? 2012 is worth seeing for the special effects alone but it much more than that.",2012

The language is clean, no ""F"" words so most people can enjoy it. Go see it, you will enjoy it.This is my first review and probably my last because of the stupid requirement 'that you must write 10 lines' before they will accept it.And what in the world do 'spoilers' have to do with it?

1206,Guma163,2012: Roland Emmerich is in a league of his own,10,29 December 2009,"I feel more confused about this movie after having watched it than I did when I watched its trailer. This is one of those films thats so bad its actually good.Roland Emmerich's uniquely special character as a director shines forth in 2012. The man and his films just have a special quality to them that are extremely difficult to pin down and doubly so when any attempt is made to judge Emmerich and his films' merits against other films in the same genres. Emmerich truly out-did himself 2012, and thats saying something if you are familiar with Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow.Somehow, in 2012 Roland Emmerich has become SO completely vintage Roland Emmerich that I can only assume the man has ascended to a spiritual stratosphere beyond Nirvana, kept peerage with other noble souls such as Oliver Stone and Michael Moore. But even then, I highly doubt that after 2012 any film director will occupy the same league Roland Emmerich.Only after explaining the directing brains behind this film can I feel even remotely safe to touch 2012.2012 began innocently enough that, sitting with my girlfriend in the theater, I felt sure I was going to be treated to an apocalyptic masterpiece that would be a little Independence Day rolled in with Day After Tomorrow with a touch of conspiratorial End of the World rhetoric. When the guided tour of the planetary alignment continued a tad longer than I had expected, I half expected the aliens from Independence Day to come cruising back to finish off a middle aged Will Smith. All bets were off the moment this didn't happen, because at least space aliens could have lent some plausibility to the rest of the film.Despite all scientific plausibility, the Sun somehow releases enough neutrinos to microwave the Earth's core and break up the Earth's crust. Obviously the world's governments keep a tight leash on information and no one knows, save our lovable heroes and villains, symbolized by various races and countries.From that vantage point onward suspend all known laws of physics and human nature itself. The earth's crust is cracking apart at an alarming rate, governments are in a secret conspiracy to save the rich from imminent desctruction, everyone is scared and alarmed, and despite it all, no revolutions or demagogic figures such as a Hitler or Lenin appear to woo the masses. There are no major armed struggles. People in fact just passively protest as the ground literally melts beneath them. But thats just the good stuff.Massive earthquakes aside, the attempt is made throughout the film to humanize and develop the major characters of the film that still boggles my mind. The main actress in the film, a divorced mother of two, has eeked out a pretty comfortable upper middle class life with a serious new lover in an up and coming doctor out on the southern coast of California. We are meant to be drawn into the humanity of these two characters as, no joke, a gigantic rift the size of a small canyon opens deep enough to lead straight into the molten mantle of the earth while they are SHOPPING at a grocery store. Then to not skip a beat, just a scene later, the same couple is apparently not traumatized by it all as the former husband/down and out author comes to warn them about impending doom. I don't know. If I had simply been shopping and a canyon formed at the local Jewel/Osco, I'd be pretty shaken about it, and certainly, a crazy man spouting crazy ideas wouldn't really seem to out of bounds for me at that point, but not in this movie. Such earthquakes persist rapid succession, and the doctor/lover remained so skeptical I wanted to punch him. L.A. is only being sunk into a pit of lava and you can't for a moment get off yourself? Scenes like that occurred in such frequency in this movie I can't even touch on them all. That alone would have been enough for Emmerich to maintain his aura if not for some of the other ridiculous scenes. All of Yellowstone national park goes up in a volcanic explosion, and a yuppy doctor just happens to 'know' how to fly a plane, and just happens to find the keys to the plane just few feet away from him on the runaway, then somehow manages to outrun a supersonic shockwave in a little 2 engined propeller airplane (which miraculously had fuel).I could go on. Whole continents just happen to shift in such a way that it saves our heroes from having to make a water landing. Africa somehow escapes the end of the world unscathed (from Roland Emmerich, go figure). Characters we assume are good and even lovable turn out to be dicks in the end. The new Dali Lama just happens to be cruising through Tibet at just the right time to pick up a few stranglers from a plane wreck thats also just a stone's throw away from massive seaships that are for all intents and purposes floating cruiseships with zoos. But it all has a happy ending, because Africa is unscathed and we can all settle there, and begin anew. Need I mention that at this point all of civilization has been utterly wiped out? Wouldn't it be realistic to think men with bad intentions wouldn't want to seize power at that point? Why not, its pure anarchy, there are no governments left after all.If you want to be treated to a movie where the Chinese are characteristically dictatorial, the Russians save the day, where the only continent left intact also happens to be the continent never once filmed in depth in the movie, and where the rich characteristically save themselves while everyone else dies, then see the movie. Really, its not as bad as it sounds.",2012

I must warn people who have OCD, this movie probably isn't for you. So, my take on this movie is very cool CGI effects, cool sounds and you see building collapsing, volcanoes eroding and all that but in all honesty, beyond that - the movie itself is as many people say ""a disaster"".What I found really unnecessary was Tamara's death. How let alone being really pretty, they just left her and forgot about her, showed nothing recovering her body at the end. She had screamed the top of her lungs going through that death. That was just too disturbing. It's a no- brainer as to why Emmerich wrote for Yuri and Gordon to die, but Tamara and Sasha - unnecessary. That would have been good drama to add.",2012
1210,stephen-brailsford,Everything you expect; but nothing else,2,16 November 2009,"I went to see this this film for the big CGI extravaganza that it is; with just a hope that it would have a reasonable story behind it with a little bit of witty dialogue.That is what it gave and not on bit more.The movie is a by the numbers disaster flick. The story is on a par with a TV afternoon flick and the size and amount of plot holes it leaves you with are large enough for crumbling planets to fit through.Close call after close call goes by for our main characters, hardly suffering a scratch let alone the cuts, broken bones and death that would of happened with the things that happen to them. No less than 3 times they manages to 'just' take off on a runway thats crumbling under the plane (stange how the ground comes apart right under the aircraft when other chunks stay intact that amount of times) and it happens twice with the only person at the controls is a guy who has only had a couple of flying lessons! Anyway they get to the boat only for some of our main cast to die off. I personally didn't feel anything when they died, due to the fact that I didn't feel I got to know enough about them to actually care and it happened so quick. It really looked like the characters had served what they needed to do and the script writers didn't know what to do with them, very poor.I also expected to see mainly city's in the USA destroyed, but I really hoped to see a few other country's being wrecked than what they did, overall it was disappointing.But then it didn't offend, It did as I expected, I got what I thought I wanted, but afterword's, I wanted all of the things it didn't deliver",2012

1220,emzy911-1,The cinematic version of a kick to the nuts,5,3 April 2010,"2012, starring that guy from Say Anything, is your run of the mill disaster movie. The director, Roland Emmerich, also wrote it. This is either going to make it a great film (Donnie Darko) or a colossal mess (Southland Tales). Unfortunately this is the latter. The story is slow and weak as are the characters. We follow a dad trying to reconnect with and then save his family from the multitude of natural disasters coming their way. It's been done and done better. War of the Worlds did it, so did The Day After Tomorrow (old mate Ron wrote and directed that one too). The film makers would have been better served to base the story around the Mayan's rather than just referencing them. Or spread the protagonists around like Independence Day did. It should of been better. This movie takes forever to get going. I guess it takes time to set up a very flimsy story with characters I feel nothing for. But when it does get going, sweet baby Jesus, there are some good chase scenes! Finally we have lift off. Now, the story is third rate but the action is off the hizook. It's like the people behind Die Hard and the people behind Armageddon used a lot of crack and then had a baby and the crack baby of crazy good action scenes took some more crack and came up with these action scenes. I am still out of breath I tells ya. The best news is there are Yipee Kai Aye moments galore thanks to the terrible writing, so at least there are plenty of unintentional laughs in between all the death and such. Sadly the insane action scenes aren't enough to overcome the frail story. By the end I am glad that it is over. For me, the end of the world couldn't really come quick enough (I am to assume Australia is OK though, as we were not mentioned). This film coulda been a contender, it had a good idea with a nice twist and some remarkable effects, but in the end nothing could save this movie.",2012

The sad fact is that most probably won't.The only good news is that 2012 has the makings of a great video game or theme park thrill ride since that is essentially all it is already.",2012

1226,who_is_damac,"A very typical movie, with a very predictable ending...",5,3 December 2009,"I personally thought... besides from the BS good luck of the 4 main characters, and the unfortunate death of all those who helped on the way... this movie was altogether funny and entertaining. Unfortunately... not much plot; not much thought... literally following the similar process of all the previous 'end of the world' genre movies.The few big questions that i had while watching this movie are as follows:1) In the many nations that were being 'invited' aboard... it seems we've missed most of the world besides from the few big countries that made news lately - namely -> US, Europe (UK, France and Italy), Russia and China (incld. Tibet). I guess if there is a real end of world crisis - all those other countries can just .... themselves.... See More2)I understand the whole noble idea of 'money' vs. 'integrity' - but to be honest - without those billions of euros from those rich bas****s, there would be no ship, and no lives saved. (not necessarily a bad thing.)3)The government being plain nasty in this movie - coming up with the contingency to build biblical arks, hiding it from the public, assassinating any rich man with a conscience to share this news to the world... I guess that's why the ones that make it to the ark are plain bas****s?! But seriously, this is why society is breaking down, there is no communication between the different classes of society - the rich forming their own society - making money off the poor buggers, and the poor?!... well f*** them, who cares as long as the rich are making money...4)This is a scientific one... if evolution brought us this far, the planets resetting - all life forms starting out again as simple cells... how are these people going to survive?? No animals, no plants... just plain dirt and water again... How long do you think it will take for the earth to repopulate itself, flourished itself with enough life source to sustain the surviving humans... Maybe those animals they carried on board are just going to end up being eaten...5)I am sure it is a great idea to just bring scientists and rich people aboard... but wait... whose going to do the hard labor?? I think there should be at least 2 out of the 3 ships dedicated to laborers, engineers, farmers etc...Those are the skills we need to repopulate... not politicians, geneticist etc..(the ratio as i would have indicated should be at least 2:1) *to be honest, the geologists should not even be allowed aboard... given that it takes another 640,000 years before the next 'reset'Those are the few I need to get of my mind... there are lots more to go... but sleep is calling..zzz.",2012

1230,aunt-agatha,predictable boring movie,1,10 November 2009,"This movie brings nothing new and is filled with - American - stereotypes. Everything that happens in this movie is so predictable that it's unbelievable boring. Even the film music is awful. I was bored to tears and fell asleep towards the end. I got the impression this movie was made by a bunch of 14 year old boys. John Cusack was doing his best to play the hero but honestly, his efforts were wasted. At the end I was totally irritated when he and his son survive a suicide-mission. Oooh sad music, everybody cries, the heroes are dead...wait! no! A miracle happens! There they are again, let's all cheer and hug! Triumphant music! All I could think was 'Did nobody edit this script? Do people really like this kind of boring movies?' Well, I don't. I wish I could get my money and time back.",2012
1231,matseriksson-58807,Yikes what a turkey!,1,28 September 2019,"Hollywood had no new ideas so they combined 'Independence Day, S.O.S. Poseidon, Volcano' and other braindead flicks. It is beyond bad. Waaaaay beyond.",2012
1232,s-e-i-r-i-o-s,the most disastrous disaster movie to date,1,20 November 2009,"I think there is absolutely no excuse for this bad joke of a movie. The plot, screenplay and the story background are miserably infantile, and direction is below any standard. It was one of the very few occasions in my life when I came out furious from a movie theater: furious and frustrated about 2 hours and 20 bucks lost completely in vain.Of course, nobody expects from a movie like 2012 to put you on thoughts for days and reshape your mindset. But to see over two hours of Earth's digital destruction without having at least an acceptable storyline... well that was a shocker. And even visuals are bumpy at times.Apart from a few actors' struggle to make something out of their miserably composed characters, there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to be valued in this film.",2012
