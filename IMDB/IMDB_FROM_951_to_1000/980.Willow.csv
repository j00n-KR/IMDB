0,TheLittleSongbird,Decent fantasy film,7,4 June 2010,"Now I don't think Willow is the best fantasy film ever made(a three way-toss up between Pan's Labyrinth, Edward Scissorhands and The NeverEnding Story) nor is it the worst(Dungeons & Dragons). It does have problems, but I thought it was entertaining.My first problem is Warwick Davis, now his title character is a very charming and likable character, but Davis's performance is somewhat uneven. At first it is uncomfortable and bland, then as the film progressed he got better as we got to know the character better. Another problem is that the special effects are a little dated especially the beast with the two heads. My final flaw is that there are one or two scenes in the middle half that felt a little forced.However, thanks to a quirky, funny and honest script, it is actually entertaining. You may argue that the film is too long, and that the plot is unoriginal and formulaic, but the film does move quickly and a lot happens. The scenery, cinematography and costumes are also really nice to look at, maybe not as stunning as other fantasy films such as the Lord of the Rings movies, NeverEnding Story or Legend(which has one of the most exquisitely rendered forest sets I have ever seen on it) but it at least looks nice. The score by James Horner is also really pleasant though Horner has done better(I still bawl at the main theme for The Land Before Time), the main theme is definitely memorable and is surprisingly not generic. The direction from Ron Howard is good, and the acting is decent as they bring alive somewhat interesting characters. Davis is uneven as I have said already, but Joanne Whalley is alluring as Sorscha, while Val Kilmer does really well in a flashier and darker role with some good lines. Rool and Franjean are the funniest characters, and it is a delight to see Billy Barty again. However, Jean Marsh steals the show as Queen Bavmorda, her performance is the epitome of sheer evil.Overall, flawed but decent fantasy film with some interesting elements. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Willow
1,Leofwine_draca,"A childhood favourite, although it's unforgivably twee and sentimental these days",6,4 December 2016,"The epitome of the '80s cheesy sword and sorcery movie, packed with special effects and action but with little brain or originality behind it. The man responsible for the film's fluid direction is Ron Howard, before he took a break and made decent films instead; the producer and writer is one George Lucas, who seems intent on creating a whole new STAR WARS-style saga for the kids who remained unborn ten years previously. WILLOW is certainly a film that enthralled me as a kid (born in 1981, I was exactly the right age when I saw this) but which has lost a lot of its charm seeing it years later as an adult. What once seemed profound and moving now seems cheesy and ridiculous, especially the dollopy layers of sentimentality forever thrust down our throats by Lucas, Howard, and co. with a baby in a silly wig occupying most of the screen time.Not that the film is totally without magic. It's easy enough viewing, with lots of brainless action to take your mind off the threadbare plot and ill-defined characters. The stunts are good and the special effects highly enjoyable. Incidentally the film is the first to make use of the Industrial Light & Magic morphing effects now common in the movies (they turned up again in THE ABYSS the following year). The defining moment I remember from childhood (where it scared and scarred me in equal measure) is the appearance of the two-headed monster from the moat, which looks like it has been drafted in from RETURN OF THE JEDI. A great moment in a not-so great movie. Unfortunately Lucas is intent on bringing us some bumbling comic relief in the style of C3P0 and R2-D2 and so creates the characters of two utterly repulsive 'brownies', who spoil all of their scenes with kiddie humour. Great for the children but completely annoying for adults – these tiny menaces are ten times worse than Jar-Jar Binks despite their diminutive size.The casting is one element this film has just right. Finally, after years spent sweating it out in rubbery costumes, Warwick Davis is given a chance to shine in a leading role without his mask and Ewok body suit. Davis makes for an unlikely heroic lead but he performs admirably well in everything Howard requests of him. Taking the barely-disguised-Han Solo-alike role is a young Val Kilmer, before he went weird, and surprise, surprise he puts in a halfway decent performance as well. Kudos to Joanne Whalley as the beautiful and feisty female warrior and to the two aged British ladies at the centre of the good vs. evil battle, Patricia Hayes standing in for the good guys and Jean Marsh going over the top for the bad. Watch out for the imposing Pat Roach and Gavan O'Herlihy as armour-clad soldiers. All in all an enjoyable family viewing experience if you are kind to it, a dated and silly rerun of all the old staples if you are not.",Willow
2,SnoopyStyle,pushing the envelop,6,4 October 2016,"A prophecy foresees the downfall of evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda by a baby girl with a special birthmark. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women to check for the birthmark. A nursemaid secrets away the baby floating her down the river. Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) is a struggling Nelwyn farmer. His kids find the baby and decide to keep her despite his objection. Bavmorda sends her daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and General Kael to lead a search for the baby. Nelwyn sorcerer The High Aldwin decide to send Willow to find a Daikini willing to care for the baby. Willow finds Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) locked in a cage. Airk Thaughbaer leads what remains of his army to battle Bavmorda. With no other options, Willow releases Madmartigan and gives the baby to him. The tiny Brownies steal the baby and capture Willow. Fairy queen Cherlindrea explains that the baby is Elora Danan and she chooses him for a quest. Cherlindrea gives him a powerful wand and sends him to find sorcerer Fin Raziel with the help of Rool and Franjean.Lucas is pushing the envelop on what is possible in computer graphics. It is not quite there but it is interesting in the attempt. As for the story, it has all the elements of high adventure. Willow should complain a little less in the first act. He sounds too whiny in that first part especially during the escape in the cart. Val Kilmer is a good cad. The story needs a few more passes to make it flow better. The action could be better choreographed especially the hand-to-hand fighting. This could be a great fantasy adventure but the CGI is not completely ready and the story needs a little more work. Ron Howard needs to worry more about the story and less about the computer work.",Willow
3,claudio_carvalho,A Struggle between Good and Evil,8,10 January 2015,"In a time of dread, seers have foretold the birth of a child that would bring about the downfall of the powerful Queen Banmorda (Jean Marsh) that wants to destroy the baby. When the child is found, her midwife flees with her. But she is hunted down by dog-like creatures and she puts the baby on a wooden raft to be carried out by the river. The Daikini (human) child is found by the Nelwyn (dwarf) family of the farmer and aspirant magician Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife decides to take care of her. But when the dog-like creatures attack the Nelwyn village, Willow discloses the baby to the council. The sorcerer High Aldwin (Billy Barty) decides that Willow shall take the baby back to the crossroad of the Daikini land with a small group and deliver her to a responsible Daikini. But Willow meets the thief Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) locked up in a cage and he believes Madmartigan is not the right person. However he is convinced by his friend to deliver the baby to Madmartigan. But soon the fairy Cherlindrea (Maria Holvöe) tells that the baby is Elora Dana from the omen and is a very special baby. She also tells that he must protect Elora and deliver her to the sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) that will raise her. She also gives a magic wand to him to deliver to Fin Raziel. Willow embarks in his journey with Madmartigan and the Brownies Franjean (Rick Overton) and Rool (Kevin Pollak) but they are chased by Queen Bavmorda's daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and the evil General Kael (Pat Roach). The struggle between good and evil begins.""Willow"" is a magic adventure from the magic 80's, when most of the best recent movies were made. This fantasy has action, adventure and romance in an excellent screenplay and special effects. The characters are charismatic and there are many funny scenes. Unfortunately this type of movie that is pure magic and entertainment has been recently forgotten by the studios. Today I have just watched ""Willow"" on DVD and it was a magic travel to almost twenty-eight years ago. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Willow – Na Terra da Magia"" (""Willow – In the Land of the Magic"")",Willow
4,jboothmillard,Willow,5,5 December 2015,"I had heard about this film hundreds of times, I know it was the film that basically made the young star of Star War: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi a movie star (you could almost ignore the Leprechaun films), so I relieved when I finally watched it, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, The Grinch, A Beautiful Mind, Rush). Basically there is a prophecy that a female child with a special birthmark will cause the downfall of the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh), she therefore imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent the prophecy from happening. The child of the prophecy is born, the midwife reluctantly accepts to take the baby daughter to safety for the mother, leaving Nockmaar castle unnoticed, the mother is executed, the midwife is found, but sends the baby downriver on a makeshift raft before being captured, Bavmorda's daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and General Kael (Indiana Jones's Pat Roach) to find the baby and stop the fulfilment of the prophecy. The baby drifts into a Nelwyn village, populated by dwarfs, she is found by kind farmer and conjurer Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis), he hopes to become a sorcerer, his wife Kiaya (Julie Peters) and children adore the child immediately, and Willow loves her as if she was his own. The village is attacked during a town festival by a Nockmaar hound, village sorcerer High Aldwin (Legend's Billy Barty) learns about the baby, because of Willow's devotion to the child the wizard selects him and a company of volunteers to return the baby to the Daikini (human) people. Along the way they find human warrior Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) trapped in a crow's cage, Willow and his friend Meegosh (David Steinberg) refuse the suggestion of leaving the baby with him so they can go home immediately, after a night at the crossroads, an army, marching against Bavmorda and led by Madmartigan's old friend Airk Thaughbaer (Happy Days' Gavan O'Herlihy), come along, Willow reluctantly frees Madmartigan and gives the baby to him. The baby is later stolen by a group of Brownies (small hobgoblin-like creatures), Willow and Meegosh chase them and get trapped, but fairy queen Cherlindrea (Maria Holvöe) rescues them, she identifies the baby as Elora Danan, the future princess of Tir Asleen and will defeat Bavmorda, she assigns Willow to help the baby fulfil her destiny. Meegosh is sent home by Willow, and two Brownies, Franjean (Rick Overton) and Rool (Kevin Pollak), will guide him to sorceress Fin Razel (The NeverEnding Story's Patricia Hayes), the three of them later stop in a tavern and encounter Madmartigan, Sorsha arrives and causes a scuffle, but Willow, Madmartigan and the Brownies escape. Madmartigan guides them to find Razel, before departing again, the sorceress has been turned into a possum by Bavmorda, Madmartigan has already been captured by Sorsha before catching the others, they are taken to a Nockmaar army camp in the snowbound mountain. Willow tries to restore Razel, but ends up turning her into a rook instead, the Brownies dose Madmartigan with love dust, he declares his undying love for Sorsha, the prisoners escape and reach a mountain village, they re-encounter Airk and his remaining army, Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora. They escape to the castle of Tir Asleen, with Sorsha as their temporary hostage, but the inhabitants have been cursed by Bavmorda, Kael's army and a group of trolls surround the castle. During Kael's assault Sorsha realises she loves Madmartigan and switches sides, Willow accidentally turns a troll into a two-headed monster and turns the tide of the battle, Airk arrives to assist with his army, Kael captures Elora and returns to Nockmaar, he reports Sorsha's betrayal. Wilow, Airk's army and the others arrive at Nockmaar to go against the evil queen, she turns the soldiers into pigs, Willow follows instructions from Razel to protect himself, and after a few transformation attempts he succeeds in turning Razel human, she restores the others to their original forms. Willow's group trick their way into the castle and start to battle, Airk is killed by Kael, he in turn is killed by Madmartigan, Sorsha leads Willow and Razel into the ritual chamber and interrupt Elora's sacrifice, Bavmorda and Razel fight with their powers. During their duel Razel is incapacitated, but Willow his ""disappearing pig trick"" to fool Bavmorda into thinking the baby has been sent elsewhere, lunging at him Bavmorda accidentally triggers the final part of the ritual, she ends up sends and banishes her own soul into oblivion. In the end Willow is rewarded with a magic book to aid him in becoming a sorcerer, Sorsha and Madmartigan remain in Tir Asleen to look after Elora, Willow returns home to a hero's welcome and is happily reunited with his family. Also starring Mark Northover as Burglekutt, Sabrina the Teenage Witch's Phil Fondacaro as Vohnkar, Bad Santa's Tony Cox as Vohnkar Warrior, Kenny Baker as Nelwyn Band Member, Peter Burroughs as Nelwyn Villager, Kim Davis (Warwick's sister) as Nelwyn Villager, Samantha Davis (Warwick's wife) as Nelwyn Villager, Time Bandits' Malcolm Dixon as Nelwyn Band Member, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Rusty Goffe as Nelwyn Villager, Raymond Griffiths as Nelwyn Villager, Jack Purvis as Nelwyn Band Member and The Human Centipede (First Sequence)'s Ashley C. Williams as Nelwyn Villager. Davis proves his stature is no issue, his title character is very charming, Kilmer and Whalley may seem out of sorts at times, but they are okay, this film has mixed opinions, it is predictable at times, but the special effects are good, the action sequences are well paced, it is a nice story filled with sorcery and magical creatures, and it is something the whole family can enjoy, a fun fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!",Willow
5,ccthemovieman-1,You're Better Off With LOTR,5,17 September 2006,"This is another of those old-fashioned medieval fantasy adventures filled with sorcerers, dwarfs, other tiny people and some strange-looking animals. the film has a lot of action, almost too much, especially for little kids. It get a little intense for small kids. Actually, I think it's more of an adult movie, and only so-so at best until the last 30-40 minutes when some very good special-effects made it much more interesting.The movie centers around a cute baby, who is good at making faces for after awhile it becomes routine and obvious that the facial shots were taken elsewhere, not in the scene. Overall, ""fair at best"" describes this movie that wavers between adults and kids and wound up a bit unsatisfying. Thankfully, for fantasy fans there have been far better films since then to whet our appetites.",Willow
6,ma-cortes,"Blockbuster Sword and Witchery fantasy with lots of adventures, fights, monsters and high-quality special effects",7,15 January 2020,"At a stormy and dark night in the bowels of a stronghold whose owner results to be a nasty witch Queen called Bavmorda : Jean Marsh, there takes place the birth of a baby. According to a prophecy, as the innnocent child grows, it means the end of her rule . Howewer, a basket containing the baby carries her at the Munchkins land and darf Willow : Warwick Davis, meets her. Willow carries out his fate by sheperding the abandoned baby on a risked journey to fulfil his destiny as a saviour for good .

Both of whom join and set out to destroy the power of evil, the heinous witch : Jean Marsh and her daughter : Joanna Whaley. Along the way they are helped by two small men : Rick Overton, Kevin Pollack.
This epic fantasy picture has more than a few elements in common with Bible's innocents massacre , Moises history, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and fairytales as Snow White. This is a great adventure movie with too much action-packed, though strangely predictable and the bulk of plot concerns Willow's mission who is assigned the task of returning a child her security , while attempting to free her from the claws of the evil hag and give the baby to the good witch . The picture contains a lot of weird creatures as Death Dogs, Faeries, Brownies, Trolls, dwarfs and a two-head, fire-breathing dragon . Breathtaking climax full of struggles , muscle and magic, providing a thrilling final confrontation . As you can expect from executive producer George Lucas, there is much action and plenty of high-quality FX made by specialists Dennis Muren and Phil Tippet, in addition, stop-motion monsters by Dave Allen. Cast is pretty good with some dwarf actors as Warwick Davis, Billy Barty, David Steinberg, Tony Cox. And popular actors as Val Kilmer and Joanna Walley Kilmer, marriage at the time . As well as a nice secondary cast, such as : Jean Marsh, Gavan O'Herlihy , Kevin Pollack, Rick Overton, Pat Roach and Patricia Hayes as good witch.The film displays a breathtaking, enjoyable, and, nowadays classic, musical score by the great James Horner. Colorful and brilliant cinematography by Adrian Biddle. The motion picture was well directed by the famous actor and director Ron Howard. From his starts as an actor, as he played George Lucas' American Graffiti , he's had a long career, as he went on as a filmmaker, shooting successfully, his film debut was Grand thef auto, following other hits, such as : Night shift, Splash, Cocoon, Gung Ho, Parenthood, Backdraft , Far and away, The Paper , Apollo13, Ransom , EdTv, The Grinch, A beautiful mind, Cinderella man, The Da Vince Code , Frost/Nixon , among others. Rating 7/10. The yarn will appeal to fantasy fans and Sword/witchery genre buffs.",Willow
7,moonspinner55,"Sword-and-sorcery fairy tale with ""Raiders""-like action and humor",5,16 October 2007,"A medieval Nelwyn (or dwarf) must rescue an infant from the clutches of a queen whose throne--the seers say--will one day be usurped by the wee one. Fantasy with joshing humor from director Ron Howard, who loves a good battle between the righteous and the powerful-evil. The film has some raucous good cheer, and Val Kilmer is game and in high spirits playing a prisoner who becomes involved in keeping the infant safe, but what Howard lacks in personality he makes up for in unoriginality. One is acutely aware of the ""Raiders""-like steals in both action and levity, though the cast certainly helps. Joanne Whalley has a slim but still pivotal part as the queen's daughter, while Jean Marsh plays the wicked ruler with unabashed relish. The midsection of the film is mostly filler, and the comedic asides occasionally feel like vaudeville routines, but the production is handsome and James Horner's score is rousing. ** from ****",Willow
8,Hey_Sweden,Likable collaboration between Lucas and Howard.,7,13 July 2013,"Based on a story by George Lucas, this lively fantasy adventure is certain to appeal to kids and those genre fans looking to be transported to a different time and place. A well chosen cast acquits themselves well, with young Warwick Davis, who'd made his breakthrough as the Ewok Wicket in ""Return of the Jedi"", placed front and centre. Davis plays the title role, a little person (or Nelwyn, as they're referred to in this universe) who discovers and protects a Daikini (or big person) baby; said baby has been prophesied to bring about the downfall of an evil queen, Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). Willow grows to love the baby and accept his mission to deliver the baby to safety, acquiring some companions on his way. Thieving sword master Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) is one, tiny imps Rool (Kevin Pollak) and Franjean (Rick Overton) are others.Extremely well shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio by Adrian Biddle, this marked a truly ambitious effort for director Ron Howard, who hadn't done anything of this scope before. He and his crew create some mighty fine atmosphere throughout. Filmed both in the studio and on breathtaking locations in England, Wales, and New Zealand, this carries us from one environment to another - forests, snowy mountains, desolate islands. The special effects are nicely done. James Horner composes a fine score in the tradition of what John Williams had done for Lucas's ""Star Wars"" series. There's plenty of comedy relief, not just from the Rool and Franjean characters but the rascally Madmartigan as well. So it should keep the kids laughing as often as it enchants them. It does get fairly intense at times, so there might be times when they get scared.The endearing Davis does a respectable job of being the heart and soul of the movie, and Kilmer, Pollak, and Overton are all pretty funny. Joanne Whalley (who would go on to marry Kilmer) plays the queens' daughter / henchwoman, Patricia Hayes is a sorceress who's trapped in the form of various animals for much of the story, Billy Barty is an old wizard, Pat Roach the Darth Vader like character General Kael, Gavan O'Herlihy is the proud warrior Airk, and Phil Fondacaro, Tony Cox, and Mark Northover play members of Willow's village.Fans of other fantasy fare like ""The NeverEnding Story"", ""Krull"", and ""Legend"" should take to this one as well. It provides ample entertainment for a well paced 126 minutes.Seven out of 10.",Willow
9,poolandrews,"""Willow, this is war not agriculture."" OK fantasy adventure.",6,27 August 2005,"Willow is set in mystical kingdom slowly being taken over by the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) & her armies lead by her daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) & General Kael (Pat Roach). However she receives a prophecy that a child will be born that will destroy her, Bavmorda is determined to kill the child but it is saved & ends up at the farm of Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) in the dwarf land of Nelwyn. Willow's wife Kaiya (Julie Peters) convinces him to take the baby in. Shortly after their village is attacked by vicious dog like creatures sent by Bavmorda looking for the baby, the people of Nelwyn tell Willow to take the baby to the crossroads between their land & the Daikini (normal sized people to you & me). Upon arrival Willow & a few other dwarfs find Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) stuck in a cage. Madmartigan convinces Willow to give the child to him & he will look after it which he eventually agrees to. They all go their separate ways & that is thought to be that until Willow & Madmartigan meet up again & are forced into a quest to find the great sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) whom has the power to protect the child & help end Queen Bavmorda's evil rule...Directed by Ron Howard I thought Willow was a fairly entertaining fantasy adventure. The script by Bob Dolman based on a story by executive producer George Lucas tries to be another Star Wars (1977) with it's cocky likable hero in Val Kilmer whom is obviously styled after Harrison Ford's Han Solo, an evil & old villain, the usual family conflict with a child who turns good, plenty of child friendly fights & action scenes with rebel armies battling the forces of evil, characters with silly names & an attempt at creating a whole grandiose universe for these characters to live in. The similarities don't stop there either with a romance between the two leads whom at first dislike each other & argue until their true feelings take over & a couple of comic relief characters in two fairies called Rool (Kevin Pollack) & Franjean (Rick Overton) very much in the R2-D2 & C-3PO mould. It all works reasonably well enough & provides decent fun but I found it too long at over 2 hours & I also thought it was a little bit on the slow side. The action scenes feature a lot of slapstick comedy moments which sit at odds with some of the more serious & violent moments, director Howard doesn't create much in the way of pace or excitement but it's all well made & choreographed. There is a cool huge two headed fire breathing monster, some dog creatures & some very fake looking trolls. The special effects are pretty good considering when Willow was made & the technology that was available to the filmmakers with the two headed monster being my favourite effect while some of the optical effects involving the fairies look somewhat dated. With a supposed budget of $35,000,000 Willow is technically a very polished film with some terrific scenery, although it never really convinced me that it was set anywhere other than on Earth with it's snow covered mountain peaks, gravel pits & the unspoilt natural beauty of Welsh & New Zealand forests that these types of fantasy films seem to use as locations. Queen Bavmorda's castle has a nice dark age Gothic feel to it. The acting is OK while stars Kilmer & Whalley went on to marry each other after meeting on this film although they have since divorced. Willow is good solid fantasy adventure that could easily be compared to the recent Lord of the Ring Trilogy (2001 - 2003) in tone & look, I liked it & is perfectly watchable on a Saturday afternoon. Worth a watch.",Willow
10,view_and_review,Nelvin to the Rescue,8,24 September 2019,"Before Frodo and Aragorn hit the screen there was Willow (Warwick Davis) and
Madmartigan (Val Kilmer). The similarities between the two run deep but never mind that.Willow is a Nelvin (a little person) who has to protect baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). Bavmorda must destroy the baby as it was prophesized that this baby would spell the end of Queen Bavmorda. Willow would require the help of many along the way including Brownies and Daikinis.This movie was fantasy, action, and even comedy. The situation is dire but there is a lightheartedness about it all. It's a good movie that could have benefited greatly from being released in the CGI era.",Willow
11,neil-476,Good fantasy,8,3 February 2016,"Little feller Willow has to protect a baby from the depredations of witch Bavmorda, with the help of disgraced warrior Madmartigan and some pixies.From a story by George Lucas, and directed by Ron Howard, this sword and sorcery adventure fantasy introduced the world to 17-year old Warwick Davies. It's great fun, full of action, adventure, humour, magic, dirt, and what were at the time cutting edge special effects. It's interesting to see the first cinematic use of morphing, and the last major use of stop-frame animation (Phil Tippett, who took over the mantle of premiere stop-frame man on Ray Harryhausen's retirement).Some parts might be a bit worrying for the tinies but, generally speaking, this is a pretty enjoyable ride for the family.",Willow

Now don't get me wrong, there are some amazing scenes and the acting is great, especially from Kilmer, but i'm sure if you love this film, you would have had to be at a certain age when it came out to have fond memories of it, which sadly i didn't.The story is good and proves Lucas can do a good movie when he wants, and Howard directs the film with expertise, so why did i not like it? I really wish I knew, but within ten minutes of the film, i knew i wouldn't.",Willow
13,Aaron1375,Pretty good fantasy flick.,7,28 February 2003,"Considering how few really good fantasy movies there are out there, this one has to rate pretty high.  It is a rather good movie that is fast paced and fun, but it does contain flaws.  The main one is Warwick Davis.  In some scenes he is good, but in other scenes his character comes off as a bit too whiny.  The story is kind of a take off of The Lord of the Rings books.  A man, small in statute, has to keep a baby safe from an evil queen who wants to sacrifice it cause it may grow up to kill her.  While protecting the child Willow (Davis' character) runs into a swordsman played by Val Kilmer. He does a great job playing this character and is my favorite character in the movie.  Some of the effects are good, and some quite lame (the two little guys accompanying Willow), but considering this was 1987 you can overlook this.  The battle scenes are ok (the one at the abandoned castle is the best), but they are just not on the scale of other movies of this type. This movie is worth a look though.",Willow
14,siderite,Conan the midget? :) Very nice fantasy film,8,1 October 2007,"Willow has a lot of the story taken from Lord of the Rings: little man has to carry a token of faith from some place to the other in order to defeat the evil sorcerer. Aided by his party, he does transcend into a hero and finishes the quest.But the film has class. For little people they used little people. Only for the ""Brownies"", people that are mouse sized, did they use special effects. There is a lot of humour and the film is overall entertaining. People would be delighted to see Val Kilmer in the role of the lovable scoundrel that pulls through, Joanne Whalley as the evil beauty that turns good and a tiny Kevin Pollak as one of the brownies.Bottom line: a very nice fairy tale, a classic fantasy that I am shocked I did not see before today, good for children and adults alike. It is not a masterpiece, but it has original details, complex characters and a jolly feeling.",Willow
15,elo-equipamentos,Willow the Hobbit's forerunner !!!!,8,22 October 2019,"Lucas Films and Ron Howard after the tremendous success of ""The Never Ending Story"" there was an inestimable niche to exploit, fantasy on a unknown land, Dwarfs and witchcraft in a dark ages, it's have been proved through the years to be a huge box-office, driven for all ages, guaranteed profit, the plot is amazing a couple of Dwarfs find a little girl in a river, they taking her to the village to decide what they can do, the High Aldwin discovered that the girl is a princess and demand a small group to protect her to a long journey to be safe from the mad Queen Bavmorda , arriving there Willow finds a prisoner in a cage, Martimartigan ( Kilmer) beseech to be free, however he wasn't enough trustworthy, he joints force with Willow and a tiny people against the evil Bavmorda's dark army, in my opinion Willow was the forerunner of the Hobbit!!!Resume:First watch: 1994 / How many: 2 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 8",Willow
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Wow, I thought it would have been higher for the rating",10,3 December 2003,"I thought that there would be more than a few hundred fans out there that would defend this film. It's a very charming film by Ron Howard that is very under rated. It has everything a fantasy film could want: action, romance, drama, and humor.The acting abilities are a little average, but you really get into Willow's character. He is just so charming and brave that you root for him all the way as you did for Frodo in Lord of the Rings. Val Kilmer did a pretty decent job as well. Him being a hero was very cool and very funny. Him and the Brownies were absolutely hysterical.The movie itself is wonderful to watch. It makes you feel very good at the end and I would always recommend this film to watch. It's a well made movie and deserves another shot to those who disliked it.10/10",Willow
17,Rainey-Dawn,A Beautiful Fantasy Film,8,26 October 2014,"An older film - but worth watching if you love fantasy. It is a simple story plot ""a reluctant dwarf helps to protect a special baby from an evil queen"" but the movie will take you on an incredible adventure with lots of action and magic. The story is so much better than the film's description.This a film from my teen years - I loved it back then it was one of my favorites and today I still find it a good motion picture.If you like the movie Willow then you might like the following good classic films: ""Legend"", ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Labyrinth"", ""Ladyhawke"", ""Krull"" and ""Time Bandits"".8.5/10",Willow
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The lord of the brownies.,7,16 July 2020,"With a bevy of convincing special effects and fantasy concepts, 'Willow (1988)' remains a breezy and entertaining time throughout. Essentially, it's George Lucas' version of 'The Lord Of The Rings'. To an extent, the story may as well be set in Middle Earth. The picture does distinguish itself in a few areas, though, and it isn't as though J.R.R. Tolkien's work hasn't been used as inspiration before (by the entire fantasy genre, to an extent). As I've mentioned, the flick is an entertaining piece of family-friendly fare, focused on a young man tasked with delivering a baby to a place where she'll be safe from the evil queen who's out to get her. The film has a variety of enjoyable set-pieces and doesn't take itself too seriously. It has moments of humour and moments of danger, typically balancing the two rather well. There are a couple of annoying side-kicks who keep turning up to shout in exaggerated accents which, unsurprisingly, does get pretty old pretty quickly. The idea that seventeen-year-old Warwick Davis is a father of two is, at best, unbelievable and, at worst, quite creepy. These aren't major issues, though. The overall experience may not be the most affecting or, even, exciting entry in its genre, but it's a fair bit of fun once it's underway. 7/10",Willow
19,bowmanblue,A great Saturday afternoon movie,7,13 May 2014,"Willow copies Lord of the Rings. Or at least that is the general consensus. From epic space battles in a galaxy far, far away, George Lucas turned his screen-writing pen to a time of 'sword and sorcery.' Despite the film predating Peter Jackson's (now classic) Lord of the Rings franchise by about thirteen years, it was possible that George read the books a while ago and was heavily influenced.Is that a problem? In my opinion, not really.Willow is set in a time of magic and monsters and follows a dwarf (I forget the technical term for 'little people' they use in the film) called Willow, who finds a human baby washed up on the shores of his village. He is then tasked with protecting the baby on a journey to return it to its own kind. For this is no ordinary baby, but the princess who will later grow up and overthrow the evil queen. Did I mention an evil queen rules the land? No? Okay, well she does. She's evil, powerful and everyone lives in fear of her (actually, that's more Snow White territory than Lord of the Rings, but anyway...).Expect the usual characters to pop up along the way - elves, pixies, heroic knights, sorceresses, two-headed monsters and so on. It's like an early version of Lord of the Rings, only they're on a quest to drop a baby off (as opposed to throw their precious cargo into a fiery pit).I think there are only two groups of people who would appreciate Willow nowadays. One is me, who grew up with films like this in the eighties and looks on it with a sense of nostalgia. The other is very small children, who haven't seen The Lord of the Rings. I think if you showed it to anyone in between (dare I say those dreaded teenagers?) they would see it as cheap, low budget and generally a bit dull. And perhaps they're right? Lord of the Rings captured, on a grand scale, the depth of an entire world and even managed to throw in a good deal of human emotion into the bargain. But was it a fun movie? Could you laugh and cheer at it? Probably not. However, with Willow you can.Yes, Willow is not as well written. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, the effects now look very dated. But if you're bored on a wet Saturday afternoon and happen to stumble on it, sit there and give it a go (taking every battle with a larger pinch of salt than the last).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Willow
20,g-bodyl,A Good Story for the Campfire!,9,13 April 2014,"This fantasy flick, Willow has been seen and loved by many people since it's initial release in 1988. This was my first time seeing it and despite it's age, I really enjoyed the film. Despite putting nothing new on the table, this manages to be escapist fun. Being a huge fan of fantasy/sci-fi films, I knew I would like this film. It's an old-school adventure with great characters, a good story, good special effects, and just a fun tale in the veins of the Lord of the Rings.Ron Howard's film is about a farmer named Willow who goes on a mission to protect and deliver a special baby in order to save the entire kingdom from the threat of the evil tyrannical queen, Queen Bavmorda.As acting goes, it's something you would expect out of a fantasy flick. It may seem campy at times, but all-in-all the actors do a fine job. Warwick Davis does a good job in the lead role as the reluctant Willow and Val Kilmer also does better than expected as the lone swordsman named Madmartigan.Overall, this is the perfect story to tell around the campfire or film to watch when you're in the mood for a well-done fantasy flick. It's not the best fantasy film, but it's not meant to be. It's a good swords and sorcery flick and it has enough action and magic to justify its presence. I rate this film 9/10.",Willow
21,The-Sarkologist,A Great Precursor to Lord of the Rings,9,12 February 2012,"I simply love this movie, despite it being a Ron Howard movie (who played Richie Cunningham in Happy Days), and I will not hold that against it. In fact I think that this is a beautifully made movie, and is one of those rare movies that I saw more than once in the cinema. In fact I have watched this film so many times that not only do I know it back to front, but I can even quote some of the lines (which is a challenge for me, has my memory does not like holding useless information such as lines from a movie, however I will quote Shakespeare, sometimes).Anyway this movie is modeled on Lord of the Rings, and in a sense I see it as an attempt to move towards what was to become the Lord of the Rings epic. It was never going to be easy to make a movie out of Lord of the Rings (and attempts had been made before Peter Jackson, and they had inevitably failed), but this film did help the industry move towards that end, and indeed it did succeed twelve years later.Willow is about a Nelwyn (like the Hobbits) who discovers a baby in a nearby river. When the baby is found, attack dogs suddenly descend upon the village, and it is determined that the baby cannot stay. Willow, however, is a poor farmer struggling to pay his bills, and is tormented by the big man around town, Mr Burglecutt. He desires to become a sorcerer, but is mocked and ridiculed by his peers (with the exception of the wise man, who sees potential, but does not believe Willow is yet ready).Anyhow, off Willow goes on an adventure, and while the others decided that they do not want to go out into the wide world, Willow realises that he has been given responsibility for the baby (and it was magnificent how the baby was handled, particularly since the baby is supposed to have a mind of a mature adult) and must see the quest through to the end. The quest is obviously, allegorically, about how Willow comes on his own, and not only must he take care of the baby, he has the role of the sorcerer thrust upon him.This is a kids film, and it is seen in the middle when Willow is alone with the two faeries (some say that they are really annoying, though not as annoying as Jar-Jar Binks), the baby, and something that I think is a raccoon. To me this scene outlined the idea of the Children's film, though we as adults loved it as well, which is why I have not only owned copies of this film on DVD but on video as well. I simply could not get enough of it. However, it is funny that when the Lord of the Rings appeared, while I did enjoy them, I did not enjoy it anywhere near as much as I did this film. Maybe it had something to do with the length, and also there is a lot more action in Willow, and they also have Mad Mardigan, who, as far as I am concerned, is a legend.",Willow

It has great direction,fantastic color,great battles,creatures,great old castles,beautiful scenery,good acting,and a geat story. What more could yopu ask for? To ME this is Val Kilmer`s best movie and Joanne Whalley looks terrific. Jean Mash played Queen Bavmorda greatly,she is such a great woman. MY favorite character in Willow is General Kael. I love him because of his enormous size,great voice,and how he looks in Willow. Everybody in Willow is good. I can`t say one bad thing about this movie.

25,Dr_Coulardeau,Fantasy sunny side up,9,9 October 2007,"An extremely simple story, nearly a skeleton of a story. A girl is born with a sign on her arm. She has been predicted as the one who will destroy the evil queen of the kingdom. Thus the queen decides to put under surveillance all pregnant women and to check all the babies for the sign. She is not as bad as that after all, and less bad than Herod, though we have here a rewriting of Biblical stories in the feminine mood and gender. But the midwife retrieves the baby and entrusts her to the river. Moses is thus revisited, though in the feminine mood and gender already mentioned. But far from being saved by Pharaoh's daughter she is saved by dwarfs. And there the story starts: to escape the queen, then to save the baby from the queen, trolls and other monsters added into the story for good measure. The best part is that the queen's daughter is going to betray her mother and after all it is the queen's daughter who will recuperate the baby from her direst danger, more or less. The film is charming because of the dwarfs. They definitely give some enticing flesh to that skeleton of a story and they help dangerous situations become nearly harmless, at least agreeably pleasant.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Willow

27,leplatypus,LOTR meets White Snow and ends like Star Wars (tv),4,11 July 2017,"For sure Lucas seems here empty of any original ideas : making a trip with small people carrying a precious luggage has been already done as well as the evil dark queen who wants a murder ! In addition, he wrote it bad because there is no sense of epic but just a video game plot feel : going to place A, then use item B, then going to place C,  And what to say about the final duel ? white against dark, flying objects, deadly lightning : i got the feeling to be with the Emperor or Dark Sidious And i don't develop about the war aspect for which even the good people are allowed to kill as long as it's bad people ??? In all cases, i don't think it's fantasy stuff for kids Visually, the movie is rather poor and the only exotic touch comes from nature : forest, snowy mountains The only good thing here is the cast : you can feel indeed a real chemistry between Whalley & Kilmer and for sure, it's maybe the only movie in which minorities took the stage : for one time, we have real little people and old ones working and not standard, young ones playing them This choice should be praised",Willow

I saw Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer, along with Sinbad and the 7th Voyage on those screens so it is fitting to know this was one of the final movies I saw there.The movie isn't perfect, but it is a good action fantasy adventure with Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley, who later would marry. It also has Warwick Davis, Jean Marsh, Gavan O'Herlihy, Billy Barty, Malcolm Dixon, Jack Purvis, Kenny Baker, and Tony Cox to name a few actors.It's fun and has a good ending.

29,Vartiainen,"Enchanting realm, lackluster characters",6,10 May 2015,"Willow tells the tale of one Willow Ufgood, a middle-aged hobbit... I mean nelwyn, whose children find a young human... I mean daikini baby, who has drifted down the river. His... I mean her name is Moses... I mean Elora, and she is the child of a prophecy, destined to bring the downfall of evil sorceress queen named Voldemort... I mean Bavmorda.Sound familiar? Well, good because that's kind of the point. It's a classic fantasy story, heavily utilizing the hero's journey structure. But it's the execution here that counts, not the seeming clichédness of the basic story. And the execution is not bad at all. Most of the characters are likable, the story captivating and the world they build is more than interesting. Even if they give silly names to what are clearly common fantasy races.The two biggest problems are that some of the characters, like the minuscule brownies, are pretty annoying, needless comic relief more than anything, and that the special effects haven't aged all that well. They're impressive for their time, yes, but the movie focuses on them too much and in a very noticeable way. The story also contains a few hiccups, though nothing major.All in all Willow is just as important for the fantasy film genre as Legend from the same decade. It paved the road for future fantasy epics and is more than decent film in its own right. Definitely worth checking out for all the fans of the genre.",Willow

One day, his children find a baby (Kate & Ruth Greenfield) by the river and decide to take care and name her, Elora. Soon, the town is hunted by killer dogs and discover that the baby they want is really a princess.

32,hellraiser7,Final Fantasy,10,13 March 2013,"I was a kid from the 80's and fantasy was one of the first genres I was into. I was a fan of cartoons like ""He-Man"" so seeing this film was like a dream come true. This believe or not is my favorite film from director Ron Howard, but most importantly it's one of my favorite fantasy films of all time.I really like the plot, it's simplistic it's not complicated which is something I personally feel the fantasy/RPG genre is getting carried away with. To me simplicity was part of what made fantasies great because with a simple premise you have freedom to include and do whatever you want. And I feel the plot is good on a moralistic level, the fact that it's about a child's life in danger from this evil army just all the more make me want the good guys to win.The production value is great, it's one of those rare examples of a big budget used the right way and for the right reasons. I like the locales which really help bring out a time long gone and almost feel as if the fantasy world might have existed. The action is great, I really love the chirography on the swashbuckling action. And there are some memorable action/battle sequences like two chase scenes one with a stage coach and another a sled sequence. Though my favorite battle is the siege in Tiers Lean, as I said before I always love sieges because the interior of a building structure gives you plenty of opportunities to prepare and stragize defenses against the opposition, but just the simple fun concept of few against the world.The effects are also great, there was no CGI which is why I feel they hold up now because their practical. The magic effects look great they don't look fake or cartoonish like most fantasy with CGI effects make the mistake of doing. But I also just like some of the creatures they have like the annoying disgusting trolls, the nasty rat dogs makes me want to get a giant mouse trap, but my favorite is the two headed fire breathing Hydra the stop motion and pupetering effects on the thing were just excellent, they way it moved and behaved.Music score I think is fantastic by one of my favorite composers James Horner, it has that epic adventurous quality that fits like a glove for the film.But of course I really like the characters. You've got some really good supporting characters like the doopleganger sorceress Fin Razel whom is wise but also kinda funny, I like the fact she uses whatever forms she has to her advantage. The two brownies, both aren't just comic relief but their actually useful in places, it just shows how much small size has it's advantages. Sorsha played well by Joanne Whalley whom I think is a solid actress; her character I think is hot not just on an external level but internally she's feisty and has some fire; let alone a female that's capable of kicking butt instead of being a stereotypical damsel in distress. She pretty much the good girl/soldier that is playing for the wrong team, which makes you hope she'll get on the right track. And another good thing she's nothing like her mom.Queen Bamorda (Jean Marsh) she's a good opponent. She just such an unlikeable witch in ever sense of the word. And is also intimidating from how ruthless and heartless she is, as well as the extend of her magic, like one disturbing scene she turns everyone into pigs to both defeat her enemies and sick amusement. Though I really like the subordinate villain General Kale whom is really intimidating with that voice and that skull mask that makes him look like Skelator from ""He-Man"".But of course it's the two main characters that drive the film Willow (Warwick Davis)a down to earth person whom gets the most grief but perfectly capable of doing what's right and my favorite Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) he's just great not just as a man of action but his charisma, brash, and unsmooth nature which give him some of the best lines. Both characters have their strengths and weakness. I really love the back and forth between both Madmartigan and Willow, it's pretty much a buddy cop dynamic since both characters are on the opposite side of the fence. Both at times cause intentional or unintentional grief toward one another. But I really like how both in a way do bond somewhat and really do work well together, without one another they wouldn't of survived or made it very far. But also both have one thing in common, they both want more out of their lives and to be more.Willow is a farmer that has an ambition to be a sorcerer that just needs a chance and confidence. Madmartigan has a lot of useful skills to be a great warrior but has been on the wrong path. I like how as both and others help them out on their quest both do grow to get them where they want to be, Willow becomes more aggressive steps up when he should despite his limitations because there's no one else that will. Same with Madmartigan he starts to go on the right path when he does the right thing whether he wants to or not.Big things can happen to the smallest of people, and the smallest can do the biggest things.Rating: 4 stars",Willow

Take a moment to look at the release date, its 1988. The kids weren't coddled as much then, they weren't treated like adults...but it was understood that they were mentally capable of understanding things better, of dealing with more, of more maturity and were allowed more independence. Parents let their kids watch ""Commando"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" back then And it was understood that we kids could handle it just fine.Today, Willow would be rated ""R"" and certainly not made for children...that is if they made it the same way. So, take a breath, and realize 2 things before we start. 1) Times change and 2) kids are smarter than you give them credit for.Awe man, it came out when I was 8 and, well, it was THE MOVIE TO WATCH back then. All the kids on the block loved ""Willow."" I mean, we used to hum the theme song when we did the stupid crap that little boys do.Swing from a rope, hum the Willow theme. Battle each other with sticks, hum the Willow theme.It's sort of like ""Lord of the Rings"" only entertaining. It's sort of like ""Star Wars"" only in the Dark Ages. It is sort of like the ultimate childhood fantasy movie.And now that I am older, I still love it. It is still entertaining, but it's really the nostalgia that goes along with it.It's a film made of little boys...but one in the 80s that is still sort of dark and would NEVER get made of kids today. Probably because of that, when I watch it, I feel like I'm 8 again.Little kids love adventure movies and this is, well, this was the best adventure any of us had ever seen aside from Star Wars.",Willow

""Willow"" isn't as good as I'd remembered. I still liked it, but it has long passages where my attention wandered, such as chases and bloodless PG battle scenes.The charisma of Davis and the chutzpah of making a movie with a mostly little-person cast (including the legendary Billy Barty) still kind of won me over, but I wish that same bravado could have extended to some of the set pieces, which seemed recycled from other movies.",Willow

Since it's very clearly postured as a children's movie, I can't dock too many points if it's overly silly, hokey and naive, but I do suddenly feel quite sorry for dragging my folks out to see it all those summers ago. Simply put, it's not one of those kid's movies that parents will be surprised to enjoy just as much as their little ones. Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis have a strange sort of charm that manages to shine through the wooden dialog and dated special effects, and the plot has the optimistic, adventurous core of a classic fairy tale, so it's not like there's a total lack of positives. But it also borrows heavily from Tolkien, paling badly by comparison, and it pushes the limits of suspended disbelief too far on more than one occasion. George Lucas's influence is all over the screen, too, from the excessively playful tone to the heavy-handed wipe transitions and stiff, over-proper repartee.

He's aided greatly in this endeavor by his strong cast. Led by Warrick Davis (Who manages to be both strong and vulnerable at the same time) and Val Kilmer (Who creates a memorable askew hero in Madmartigan), they lift the material to another level.It may imitate the classics, but it's not quite a classic itself.

38,snoozejonc,I wish I had watched it in the 80s,8,5 June 2021,"A farmer comes across a special baby girl who is destined for greatness.This is a spectacular fantasy adventure movie with a great premise and excellent production values.The story is a bit of a mix-up of Lord Of The Rings and Snow White with a similar humour to 'The Princess Bride', but it's all done in a very Lucasfilm style. The plot unfolds in an entertaining way but I found it difficult to thoroughly buy into it like Star Wars as the characters are not really compelling enough and the dialogue is generally uninspired. However, as a father of two girls I found myself invested in the fate of Elora, who is one of the most adorable baby girls ever committed to celluloid. Every time she is in danger (lots of times) it gripped me.Willow leaves his village, not unlike the Shire, and goes on a hobbit-like, mcguffin-driven journey. He is noble and likeable but nowhere near a rounded character, because with everything else that goes on, such as the various supporting character introductions and action sequences there is no time.I found some other characters to be enjoyable, but not entirely relatable or as amusing as they are intended to be, such as Madmartigan and the two Brownies who accompany them on the quest. In fact both Rool and Franjean are hideously annoying in virtually every scene. The main villain is basically cross between the queen from Snow White and the Emperor from Star Wars.Things climax in a very Star Wars/LOTR fashion and I did feel like I'd been taken on an epic adventure, but unlike the above mentioned stories it isn't one I'm likely to want to go on too often.It has to be said that as a pure spectacle it is brilliant. Not only is there beautiful cinematography that makes the best out of the stunning scenery of California, New Zealand and North Wales, Ron Howard is adept at creating solid action sequences and great visual storytelling. The effects look slightly dated now, but they serve a purpose and were wonderful in 1988.Warwick Davis carries it fairly well but doesn't have the performance charisma to make Lucas dialogue work. Val Kilmer does a lot better with the material, but for me doesn't quite nail the lovability of the swashbuckling rogue he's trying to be. Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton miss the mark by a mile with their awful noise and accents.I wish I had watched Willow as a child in the 80s as I would undoubtedly enjoyed it more due to the childhood connection. However, a huge plus point for me is that it held my 5 year old daughter from start to finish which a number of other movies cannot, regardless of how well regarded.For me it's a 7.5/10, but I round upwards.",Willow
39,I_Ailurophile,Classic fantasy adventure,9,15 April 2021,"Riveting and heartfelt, the joy and and love of storytelling built into 'Willow' is palpable. This is a movie to foster excitement and childlike wonder for cinema, and in all the years since its release it hasn't lost its magic.I don't know how old I was when I first saw 'Willow,' but I do know unquestionably it was the first movie to completely draw me in. It yields such a great sense of adventure and whimsy that it immediately called to me when I was very young. General Kael, Finn Raziel and her transformations, Bavmorda, the Eborsisk, Tir Asleen, trolls, the crossroads, the siege of Nockmaar - whether we're discussing characters, settings, creatures, or specific scenes, at all points the imagery herein is unforgettable.If I have any criticisms to make, it's really just in the stylistic choices. With production in the hands of LucasFilm and visual effects handled by Industrial Light & Magic, transition effects mirror what George Lucas used effusively in the first three 'Star Wars' films. It's fine, but it gets a little tired after a time. On a like note, the picture is crisp and clean, and special effects are of the high quality we're accustomed to from ILM - but there's a small part of me that feels like sometimes the production is just a little too slick for its own good, especially in contrast to the hard journey that the characters make. Lastly, there's no mistaking that this is a film intended for a general audience, with the youngest of viewers foremost in mind, and so 'Willow' is generally a very light-hearted feature. But at a few points - chiefly at the beginning and end, in Nelwyn Village - the sentimentality becomes overwrought, saccharine to the point of vaguely disrupting our engagement with the narrative.Still, these are all pretty minor points, and it wouldn't be unfair to say I'm nitpicking. By far, 'Willow' is a superb movie, and I have loved it from the time I was but a child.Only 18 years old when the film premiered, the unmistakable Warwick Davis leads the cast as the titular character. Davis needs no introduction to fans of Lucas' works, nor of cinema at large, as his work is spread across a wealth of films. Here he excels in showing us Willow Ufgood's simple livelihood and frustrations, his devotion to his family, and his loyalty - as well as a spark of confidence that grows over the course of the movie, and no small amount of bravery. It's no great exaggeration to say that this is perhaps Davis' most standout role, and he shines.But the rest of the cast is no less notable: Val Kilmer as the great swordsman Madmartigan; Pat Roach as the imposing General Kael; Jean Marsh as evil Queen Bavmorda; Joanne Whalley as the beautiful but dangerous Sorsha. And we're still not done, because prominent roles also go to Patricia Hayes, Kevin Pollak, and Phil Fondacaro. And while his is only a small supporting role, Billy Barty is an absolute joy onscreen.In an era when the quality of special effects in films seemed to be a bit hit or miss, there's no denying that ILM's contribution here is outstanding, even if they're a little too polished. Every display of sorcery and otherwise movie magic looks superb, and this is especially true of Raziel's shapeshifting. Each animal to greet our vision looks very real, as though it's actually on the set - even as the forms are actively changing. That's no small feat when you consider that just a few years before, 'Krull' made great leaps in the same realm of visual effect, but Ergo's transformations still appeared noticeably distinct from his surroundings. ILM definitely worked wonders with 'Willow,' further solidifying their reputation.We must also discuss the fantastic original score composed by James Horner. The stirring main theme sticks in our minds long after we've finished watching, its mixture of woodwinds and strings a gentle companion to the pastoral lifestyle of the Nelwyn - and a notable contrast to the blaring horns that comprise Horner's compositions in the heartier, more action-filled scenes. Horner is dearly missed, but 'Willow' stands as another fine addition to his outstanding body of work.There's a minor, amusing point of familiarity to the narrative: a diminutive protagonist, unfamiliar with the wider world, makes a perilous journey with a MacGuffin that a great evil seeks to consolidate their power, but which also holds the key to their undoing. To be fair, though, at the end of the day any story can be sufficiently reduced to draw comparison to another, and it's the details that define the tale. And 'Willow' certainly bears a great deal of distinct cinematic fare to distinguish it from other pictures and lodge deep in our consciousness.Scenery is beautiful, and every set piece, prop, and costume is vivid and memorable. The cast is fantastic, giving their characters great life and setting them apart from similar figures elsewhere. Super visual effects aid a fun, compelling narrative that keeps us engaged from beginning to end.'Willow' succeeded where many fantasy films of the 1980s failed to become a lasting, adventure-filled classic. It was an essential part of my childhood, capturing my imagination like no other feature before it, and no doubt the same is true for many others. How many movies can truly make such an immediate impression?As worthy today as it was in 1988. Don't miss out!",Willow
40,truemythmedia,Star Wars for the Fantasy Fan,8,26 November 2019,"I have no idea how this movie stayed off my radar for so long. It's not like I had never heard of it but I guess I figured if it was any good I was past the age of appreciating it. I thought, perhaps, that if I watched it now, as an adult, I would surely think it was too childish or slow because of the day in which it was made. I figured it would be like someone in their 40s watching ""Labyrinth"" for the first time.I could not have been more wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would rank it with any of the other classic 80s/90s Fantasy Adventures that I enjoyed in my preteens. I would rank it above certain classics like ""The Dark Crystal,"" or ""Legend,"" for sure.What is it that makes this movie so enjoyable? It's the structure of the film. The characters and plot are built on a structure which is tried and true. George Lucas, producer on ""Willow,"" loves this structure referred to as the hero's journey and has employed it in most of his great films to such an extent that it is difficult to watch ""Willow"" without referring to ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" throughout.While some may look at this as a negative, I see it as a positive. It isn't groundbreaking to model a film after a mythic structure but this film isn't trying to be groundbreaking. It's trying to be good fun and nails that goal right in the bulls-eye. By using common tropes and types, the audience is able to smoothly join a world already in progress with lots of weird creatures and countries and still know who the good guys and bad guys are. This isn't the sort of film that wants you to get lost in too much thinking.Where it lacks in depth ""Willow"" more than makes up for it in humor, earnest heart, and top notch production design. Since LotR, many may have forgotten that fantasy films didn't get much in the way of budgetary consideration from most studios. Big budget means big risk so the number of sets, miniatures, costumes, and special effects in ""Willow"" are simply staggering.The character of Willow is played by Warwick Davis with remarkable accessibility and candor. H isn't the greatest actor but his vulnerability transcends his actual acting ability and creates its own sense of fragility that I did not expect to find in a kid's movie.In addition to Warwick Davis (""The Return of the Jedi""), we get Val Kilmer (""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"") as Madmartigan, the Han Solo of this film. Or maybe he is Indiana Jones. Either way, I think you see what I'm getting at. This is a risky move. Aping popular characters can really backfire and, certainly, Kilmer, is no Harrison Ford, but for the most part he carries the ridiculous, confident, lucky, scoundrel as true as if the Millennium Falcon had set down next to Willow's stone house.I could go on and on, and will, when we record the podcast, about all the Indiana Jones/Star Wars analogues in this film. I suppose it could look cookie cutter or same to some but I prefer familiar.There is the kind of familiar that wears at you, like a joke being told too many times. ""I know the punchline, shut up already!"" The other familiarity is when something is warming and safe and comfortable because it is so familiar it is like our second skin. This is the kind of familiar that ""Willow"" is. I may never have seen it, but I have seen its kind and loved them. When this new unfamiliar expression of the same comes on, I feel like wrapping up in it the way I would grab a blanket and curl up on a cold night by the fire. It just feels so good to be home.",Willow
41,aimless-46,A New Generation of Kids Will Love This Film,8,26 October 2006,"To sum things up, this was really a George Lucus film-with the then relatively inexperienced Ron Howard hired to direct-under the watchful eye of Lucus. Lucus wrote the screenplay, raiding his bookshelf for Tolkein (especially ""The Hobbit"") and Lewis (""Narnia""). Then he simply transferred the hero/heroine romance from his ""Star Wars"" screenplay. Not necessarily a bad thing, it was a simple way for him to build a feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough to entertain the entire family. ""Willow"" has some scary stuff but should not be a problem for the average grade school viewer. My rating is based on comparisons to other films with a similar target audience. I must confess up-front to a positive bias. My favorite part of ""Star Wars"" is the caustic romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia; and in ""Willow"" Lucus has refined his technique and actually improved something that was already close to perfection. Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) substitute nicely for Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, with the added dimension of having them begin the story on opposite sides. The romantic elements are efficiently and subtly inserted into the film. Even though these characters are part of the main storyline, the romance is separate enough to serve as the film's main parallel story. The only downside is that this side story soon becomes more interesting than the main one, so much so that its climatic kiss (occurring about 20 minutes before the ending) unintentionally turns into the film's climax (at least energy wise). The actual resolution of the main story then plays out rather anti-climatically. ""Willow"" is a delivery quest story, much like ""The Hobbit"" where a reluctant Nelwyn (small person) is required to set out on a perilous journey to return a lost baby (even smaller) to a Daikini (tall person). Along the way he is assisted by a couple of Brownies (yet smaller guys who speak with outrageous French accents). The size differentials are the main theme of the film and are especially intriguing to young viewers who easily identify with having to deal with people who tower above them. Howard encourages this identification process by shooting most of the action at child level. If you watch the film with young children you will be amazed at its ability to draw them into the story, this happens because the camera angles intentionally match a child's point-of-view of the world. The viewing child's surrogate is the title character (Warwick Davis-who does a commentary on the DVD), a unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy as he bravely faces the dangers of his journey while gamely putting up with an ever-changing group of irritating companions. There are frequent cutaways to Elora Danan (the baby), mostly for reaction shots. As in ""Raising Arizona"", the producers took enough stock clips to match her expressions to almost any situation. Willow learns early on from Cherlindrea (a dazzling fairy) that Elora Danan is a princess who (it has been foretold) will one day vanquish the evil Queen Baymorda (a fun role for Jean Marsh). Things get a bit Biblical/Narnia here as the Queen is seeking to eliminate the Princess before she becomes a threat. The DVD features: ""Willow:The Making of an Adventure"" (made during production in 1988) and ""Willow: Morf to Morphing"" (made in 2001 for the DVD release), really put the film in historical context relative to its place in the evolution of special effects. It was really the transitional point where photochemical (film) effects were subordinated to digital effects. This gave ""Willow"" a significant place in film history and these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate the continuing challenge to those involved with special effects; any new development is soon overused and no longer an audience draw. Meaning that effects people have to stay on the cutting edge to simply justify their existence. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Willow
42,Rob_Taylor,"Well worth a watch if you want some pure, and somewhat silly, entertainment.",7,24 December 2002,"For its day, Willow was one of the better fantasy movies. The effects look a little dated now (especially the two-headed beastie) but it has enough humour and action to keep most satisfied. It's no LOTR, but then it was made 14 years ago.Warwick Davis plays Willow, a Nelwynn, a race of hobbit-sized folk who don't have anything to do with ""The Big People"" as they call humans. Basically, it's the Shire transplanted into this movie, but without the budget. Billy Barty is the village's wizard and basically plays the character Gweldor again (from Masters of the Universe) but without the silly make-up and stupid musical key.Val Kilmer is Madmartigan, a human warrior who befriends Willow and helps him on his journey with varying degrees of ulterior motive.The acting is all reasonably good. Warwick Davis was only 18 when this film was released so his performance is very good considering his age and lack of experience (prior to this he'd played a goblin in Labyrinth and an ewok in Return of the Jedi). It's also interesting to see Pat Roach here. Pat was a former wrestler and has carved out a little niche for himself playing villains and tough guys. Here he plays General Kael, the right-hand henchman of Queen Bavmorda, played with gusto by Jean Marsh. That woman is truly frightening.It's all good fun and the two funniest characters in the movie are Franjean and Rool, two Brownies, who ""help"" Willow regardless of the latters wishes. They have the funniest double act and reminded me more than a little of Merry and Pippin in LOTR.All in all well worth a watch if you want some pure, and somewhat silly, entertainment.",Willow

45,blumdeluxe,A world full of fantasy,8,21 July 2019,"""Willow"" tells the story of an outsider dwarf that finds a baby and soon has to protect it against mighty and evil forces, finds new friends and grows on his journey.You can surely argue that the film tells a story that in some adaption has already been told more than once in many classical fanatasy movies. Nonetheless, I found it beautiful, how easily I got drawn into the world and began to emphasize with the characters, forgetting about the real world for an instance. The film has its humor and builds up an exciting and varied journey that is entertaining for both children and adults. Thus in my eyes this movie is far too badly recognized compared to its abilities.All in all this is something you can give a watch when you want to escape the troubles of everyday's life and enter a new world. Not a revolution but heart-warming and honest cinema with a lot of work and love put into it.",Willow
46,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Very nit-pickable, but also very entertaining and satisfying",7,26 January 2020,"I know nit-pickable isn't a word. But I like the sound of it and so yeah, it's staying in that title. Also it makes sense to make up such a word when it comes to George Lucas, because Star Wars is surely the most nitpicked, perhaps overly analysed film series in existence. It's likely because he's incredibly creative, and knows how to establish a compelling story, more or less with all the right beats, but falters when it comes to some of the more technical details. Certain minor aspects sometimes come across as cheesy, or forced, and characters aren hardly ever ""deep.""I think what I'm trying to get at is that much of what is wrong with Star Wars could also be complained about in regards to Willow. But, at the same time, both also contain a lot of good. I think a person's enjoyment of Willow will depend on how willing they are to take the good with the bad. I'm not saying to switch your brain off entirely, because that's not what I did either (if I had, maybe I'd consider this more than a pretty good 7/10). But it's quite focused at kids, and also unabashedly fantasy- and specifically, it belongs to that particular genre of fantasy that's most concerned with magic, heroes, fights, witches, monsters, and adventures.So before we gloss over the negatives, we should probably address them. The story is stupendously simple, and the constant action and excitement is surely there to make you forget just how barebones the plot is. Honestly, this strategy worked most of the time, as the film takes you on a ride that's well-shot, for the most part breezily paced, and filled with lots of chases, fights, and special effects. The last of those is both a strength and a weakness- some of the visual effects have aged well, some look fair for their time, and maybe only a few spots here and there look a bit lousy. Not sure it's aged as well as the early Star Wars movies on that front, but they're not absolutely perfect by today's standards either (if we're being honest with ourselves).I'm also mixed on Warwick Davis' performance. I don't think he's a technically great actor, and he also looks too young here to play a father of two, but he has a very likeable screen presence, has charisma, and it's honestly really cool to see a fantasy film with him as the main character, because usually someone of his size would be the dwarf sidekick to somebody like Val Kilmer's character. Speaking of: Val Kilmer is really good here, and brings a lot of humour, and force to the film's action scenes, but he really shouldn't have got top billing. I know how huge of an star he was back then, but come on: this is Davis' movie, and it's named after his character for crying out loud.The humour doesn't always work, particularly in regards to the two tiny men that accompany our heroes for much of their journey. I have vague memories of seeing this movie as a very young child, and I probably really liked those characters back then, but as an adult they're grating more often than they're not. Of course, in eleven years Lucas would create a much more annoying comedic sidekick, but that's a topic that's been discussed to absolute death and also isn't relevant here.Ron Howard's always been a solid director of big movies, and he does a very good job here. It's shot very confidently, moves well, and many of the colours and landscapes are honestly very pretty. At the end of the day, he and Lucas worked together to create a charming and entertaining, albeit very flawed in parts fantasy film. It's perfect for kids, or maybe was... not sure how much current day kids would enjoy it, but it has that spirit that I think makes it appealing to both the young and the young at heart. Even as an adult, there's a decent amount to enjoy and appreciate here. Don't go in expecting Lord of the Rings, and I think there's a decent chance you'll have a good time.",Willow

48,Beta_Gallinger,"Not the greatest fantasy film, but a watchable one",7,27 July 2007,"I like a good fantasy movie, so after ""Willow"" was recommended to me not too long ago, and I had looked on its IMDb page, seeing a fairly high rating and mixed opinions, I watched it without super-high expectations, but not low ones, either. After watching it, I could understand why it has received its fair share of criticism from a good number of fantasy fans, and I wasn't absolutely blown away myself, but certainly couldn't totally trash it like some have. Nothing changed when I watched the movie a second time.A baby girl named Elora Danan is born in the dungeons of the evil Queen Bavmorda, and according to a prophecy, this child will bring the Queen's reign to an end! Aware of this prophecy, Bavmorda plans to have this baby destroyed, but a midwife saves Elora and takes her away in her cradle. When the Queen's Hounds appear, the midwife places the baby in the river before they can reach her. After floating a long distance down the river in her cradle, Elora finally stops by a village of Nelwyns (little people), and is found by the children of Willow Ufgood, a farmer and magician's apprentice in the village. After some persuading, Willow agrees to adopt Elora. Soon, Willow finds himself on a journey, where he is to make sure the prophecy is fulfilled! This movie is over two hours long, so a lot happens in it. Certain plot elements are poorly thought out, such as the scenes with swordsman Madmartigan and the Queen's daughter, Sorsha, some of which don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, although this kind of thing does lower the quality of the movie a bit, it doesn't ruin the entire thing. ""Willow"" has its merits, including some excitement (not as much as there could have been, but still some), as well as occasional funny moments (probably especially the part where Madmartigan, played by Val Kilmer, is introduced). So, if you're a fan medieval fantasy movies, this one isn't guaranteed to blow you away, but it's probably worth a try, and if you start watching and find that you don't like it, well, you can always stop watching.",Willow
49,jhclues,"Lucas, Howard Make Magic",9,5 January 2002,"When Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon in 1969, the whole world paused; now such things are second nature to everyone, veritably taken for granted as more and more science fiction becomes reality every day.  In 1977, when George Lucas made `Star Wars,' it turned the cinematic universe on it's ear with it's scope and vision, offering things neither seen nor experienced by anyone before; now his accomplishments are virtually taken for granted, his vision dismissed by many with a shrug.  But in this original story by Lucas, that vision is captured once again and proffered to the world via the magic of the movies, in `Willow,' directed by Ron Howard.	A long time ago, in a galaxy perhaps far, far away, a baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife, Kaiya (Julie Peters).  The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  But the Queen, too, knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark.  For the sake of his village, as well as the safety of the child, it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda.  So Willow sets out upon his journey, and along the way finds an ally-- maybe-- in the person of the self-proclaimed `World's greatest swordsman,' Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), and together (sort of) they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.	With some help from George Lucas, Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale-- which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch-- with a touch of magic of his own.  A showcase of special F/X-- it pioneered the `morphing' technique so vital to the success of films like `The Abyss' (filmed one year after this one) and `Terminator 2:  Judgment Day' (1991)-- it is nevertheless decidedly not a `special F/X' movie.  The F/X, though a big part of the film, to be sure, do not supersede the story.  And because of that, it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible, and takes the whole film to a higher level.  A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful, in fact, is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story (With Lucas, for example, his `American Graffiti' and even `THX-1138,' and Howard's `Parenthood,' `Night Shift' and `Apollo 13') and knowing how to convey it to their audience.  It's the difference between being a true filmmaker, and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it (Like Adam Shankman with `The Wedding Planner,' Jeff Franklin's `Love Stinks,' Nick Gomez with `Drowning Mona' or Peter Ho-sun Chan's `The Love Letter.'  All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility).	In the title role, Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life, as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan.  Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen, but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh, whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.	In a supporting role, however-- and with extremely limited screen time-- it is Julie Peters who really captures the attention with a sincere and affecting performance as Kaiya.  She has such a pure and natural manner that it's hard to believe this is an actor playing a part; the realism she achieves, in fact, can be compared to that of Harriet Andersson in any one of a number of Ingmar Bergman's films.  Her ability is a true gift that endows her with a quality and a presence that would make her an asset to any film, as she certainly is here.  And it's a shame she has apparently never been afforded the opportunity of plying her craft more-- `Willow' is her only feature film.  It's a singular success, however, and one of which she can be proud.  Her portrayal of Kaiya goes far in demonstrating the positive effect a supporting role can have on a film, especially when it's this well acted.	The supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes (Fin Raziel), Billy Barty (High Aldwin), Pat Roach (General Kael), Gavan O'Herlihy (Airk), David Steinberg (Meegosh), Mark Northover (Burglekutt), Kevin Pollak (Rool), Rick Overton (Franjean) and Maria Holvoe (Cherlindrea).  With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner, `Willow' is an entertaining, enlightening film, rich in characterization and metaphor, with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part; as well as the fact that one person can, indeed, make a difference.  Visually stunning, too, it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic, and a journey definitely worth taking.  I rate this one 9/10.",Willow
50,DarthBill,Both before and after Lord of the Rings,10,23 June 2003,"This was made before the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, but long after the original books of that series were written. There are similarities abound, in terms of how the films look (sets, costumes, props) and the fact that they were both filmed in New Zealand, possibly the last place in the whole wide world that still has that medieval look, and it's just so darned beautiful. It should be noted though that this film probably made possible a lot of the special effects we see in Lord of the Rings.But seeing as how this was one of George Lucas's babies, there is a natural similarity to his other great achievement, the original Star Wars. For example, swordsman and soldier of fortune Madmartigan is more Han Solo than Aragorn/Strider. In fact, Madmartigan is essentially Han Solo only with a sword instead of a blaster, but Val Kilmer plays him with enough flash and gusto and swagger that you don't care.Willow, played by Warwick Davis (previously Wicket in Return of the Jedi), is essentially Luke Skywalker with a family, and Davis is likeable enough in the role that it's kind of a shame he only got third billing under Kilmer and Joanne Whalley. The big similarity between Willow and LOTR lead Frodo Baggins is that they are both short statured heroes in a world of giants. But Willow's task is much easier than Frodo's: Willow simply has to protect a baby, while Frodo had to destroy a ring of power that posions the mind of the bearer.That's the plot, really. An evil queen played by Jean Marsh wants to destroy a baby that is prophesized to destroy her, but the baby is just a catalyst really, because the Queen ultimately destroys herself while trying to destroy Willow.The cast seems to be in the swing of things. As I already said, Davis is a sympathetic hero and he and Kilmer are good foils for each other. Short, steamy British actress Joanne Whalley does what she can with the underwritten role of Sorsha, but admittably she is overshadowed by Jean Marsh as her evil mother and by her future ex-husband Val Kilmer. I remember reading that Sorsha had a backstory concerning her father, a good king her mother bewitched which left Sorsha torn between good and evil, and that originally during the storming of the castle scene with the two headed monster, she saw her father in stone and this provoked her to chose good over evil. Well, Patricia Hayes is good as Fin Raziel and so is Gavan O'Herghly in his small role as Madmartigan's buddy Airk (pronounced like Eric).Great special effects by the way, and a lot of warmth from director Howard.For the record, this was the first film I ever saw in a movie theater, so that's another reason it has a soft spot in my heart.",Willow
51,tbills2,Willow of the '80s,7,1 November 2014,"Willow is a classic, unforgettable, timeless fun fantasy-adventure. It is wonderful for the entire family but is particularly well-suited for kids to enjoy. Willow is a great all around movie experience. It is a fair tale that has strong elements of epic fantasy adventure including genuine drama, entertaining action, uplifting humor, and even some true romance with imaginative creatures, dark magic, an evil queen and one really cute baby. Willow is set to protect the special baby from capture with the help of many allies along the way including the great warrior Madmartigan, the evil queen's daughter Sorsha, and the very, very tiny brownie people, also with many great others along the journey. Willow is a courageous young sorcerer dwarf and Madmartigan is a fearless, and funny warrior man. Warwick Davis is great as Willow. Davis is easily one of the best little person actors I've ever seen. There are many of the good little person actors to be found in Willow. Val Kilmer does a fabulous job in bringing his character to life. Kilmer is a genius. Davis and Kilmer have very good chemistry with each another. I love those guys. Joanne Whalley plays the faithful and beautiful bowstress, Sorsha. Just like Madmartigan, I feel madly in love with Joanne Whalley. During her moving scenes, she is captivatingly gorgeous. Joanne is stunning! I was very young when I first saw Willow so I'll never forget how gazing upon beautiful Joanne made me feel. It had to be one of my very first most intense crushes. See, Val, you weren't the only one. Jean Marsh is specifically mesmerizing as the queen. The scene where Willow first encounters Madmartigan in his cage is a classically clever moment and a really powerful way that the two heroes would come together. There is a great wind of wild adventure on the horizon in their meeting. The story of Willow is made for the movies as are the characters of Willow forever memorable, and the fancy sets and scenery are too. There are many movies that Willow resembles but I cannot even begin to name them here. Labryinth, Robin Hood, Witches, The Princess Bride, Harry Potter and some Lord of the Rings. It's a lovely genre! George Lucas came up with a marvelous story and Ron Howard did a stellar and bright job directing this awesome movie. If you grew up around the time of Willow and haven't seen it or maybe not seen it for awhile, watch it and you're sure to enjoy it.",Willow
52,The_Movie_Cat,Acceptable in the eighties?,4,18 December 2011,"One of the most questionable things about Willow is whether it warrants a PG certificate. Sure, we live in an age where Heath Ledger can talk about having his mouth cut open with a razor blade and censors deem it okay to be viewed by 12 year olds. But even so, there are some genuinely unsettling moments of horror in this one. The bit where Willow (played by a 17-year-old Warwick Davis... thankfully his acting improved) turns a troll into a blood creature is genuinely horrific. The same too with transmogrification effects that turn men into pigs, shots which wouldn't look out of place in An American Werewolf In London, to say nothing of a breast grabbing scene. It's also greatly troubling to see a baby genuinely alarmed on camera, though maybe I'm being prudish on all counts.As a director then Ron Howard makes a great Richie Cunningham in Happy Days, but this film wasn't the flop that underperforming sitcom Life's Too Short would have people believe. Although Davis' constant references to Willow needing to ""make it's money back"" in the indulgent Ricky Gervais programme have perhaps led many to seek out this movie, Willow did actually make a reasonable profit. Seeing it for the first time in 2011 it's difficult to see why, as it's flaccid and uninspiring, with most of the actors involved giving some of their worst performances on celluloid. The film isn't BAD by any means, but all involved had better days than this so-so fantasy fare.",Willow
53,gab-14712,At Least Willow Has a Big Heart!,8,21 September 2021,"Ron Howard's Willow, a vision from Star Wars creator George Lucas, is a fantasy film that has lots of heart, a committed performance from Warwick Davis, and breakthrough special effects. That said the screenplay from Bob Dolman, which has its positive merits, is very simple in its storytelling method with predictable story elements from start to finish. At times, it seemed like the story is being outdone by the special effects. It does not matter because the film ended up being a cult classic with strong home video sales, and people spent years clamoring for a sequel. It looks like people got their wish with the upcoming Disney+ series thirty years after the original release. Personally, I love fantasy/sci-fi films, so I knew this type of movie would be up my alley. I had lots of fun getting to know these characters from the mind of George Lucas despite its simple story that may or may not have been influenced from Star Wars.Lucas conceived the story idea in 1972 as a film about literal interpretation of little people going up against the system, a similar concept to Star Wars. He had to wait until the mid-1980's for his vision to be made because he needed to wait for technology advancement. The film created and incorporated a huge breakthrough for CGI, something called digital morphing. This concept is huge for human-to-animal transitions (as happened in this particular movie) and was successfully incorporated in later films like Terminator 2. One cannot be blamed if they would say the movie had more style over substance. For a 1988 feature, the visual effects are outstanding.Coming off a successful sci-fi film with a lot of heart in Cocoon, Ron Howard was looking to direct a fantasy film. Lucas, who directed Howard in American Graffiti, believed the pair had a symbiotic relationship, so they (along with Bob Dolman) spent months together working on the script. They had their work cut out for them because the fantasy genre was not a working genre for studios at the time considering the failures of features such as Legend. They were able to convince MGM, which had financial troubles at the time, to back their movie. While the film was by no means a box office bomb, it did not blow the roof off. Thankfully, international and home video sales gave the film the boost it needed. In the end, it became a cult classic that everyone loves today.Our story begins with a baby girl being discovered in a river by the children of Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis), a dwarf farmer and magician. When the village is attacked by these dog-like creatures, the wizard named High Aldwin (Billy Barty) gives Willow a task to leave town and return the baby to the humans. Little does he know that the evil Queen Baymorda (Jean Marsh) has given a decree for all human girls to be killed based on a prophecy that one baby girl is destined to bring Baymorda down...which happens to be this particular baby Elora. Along the way, Willow meets allies such as the swordsman Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) and the two brownies, Franjean (Rick Overton) and Rool (Kevin Pollack). They need to keep the girl away from their pursuers: Baymorda's daughter, Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and the evil General Kael (Pat Roach). If they can, perhaps Elora's destiny could be fulfilled.I thought the performances were wonderful. Warwick Davis only receives third billing despite being the titular character, but he still gives a strong performance with lots of heart. He was originally approached by Lucas during Return of the Jedi but it was worth the five-year wait it seems. Val Kilmer is great as the shady, self-centered swordsman. The scene where Davis and Kilmer met for the first time when Kilmer's character is locked in the cage is one of my favorite scenes. I find that when it comes to evil witches, actresses relish at the chance to show off their characters. Jean Marsh is no exception as her performance is deliciously juicy as she truly inhabits the role of Baymorda. I will say that when a lot of things happen throughout the film, the camera pans on the baby's face as it displays different reactions. It was cute at first, but it slowly became annoying for me.Overall, Willow may not be the best fantasy film out there. It took me some time to enjoy the story because the pacing is indeed slow. I may have liked Howard's Cocoon or the similar Princess Bride better, but this remains an engaging adventure that blossoms with a lot of heart and soul. There are some Star Wars references (I think the brownie characters are reminiscent of C-3PO and R2-D2 as comedy relief). Still, a film that is worth watching especially for any fan of the genre. I am curious about the upcoming television series. The special effects are game-changing, and James Horner did craft a beautiful score for the movie.My Grade: B.",Willow
54,joebloggscity,Before there was the Lord of the Rings film trilogy....,6,3 January 2016,"Now the Lord of the Rings film trilogy came out long after this film, but the books were written long past, and in its wake influenced a lot of people. In the 80s there were plenty of medieval fantasy movies, some good mostly bad. One of them in this genre is 'Willow' which had a huge backing in George Lucas.Strictly this is a big homage to Lord of the Rings, and doesn't seem to mask that point. For its time the special effects were kind of new and progressive, although now seems very retro, but it helps the adventure along.Its the heart-warming story that takes it along, and Warwick Davies played his central role wonderfully.We're spoilt now with CGI etc having created almost perfect screen depictions of fantasy movies, back then it was still bit ropey. Don't let that put you off this. It has its flaws but as a Sunday afternoon movie with family & kids it's good.Shame there were no further sequels done, would have been fun to see how they could have expanded on this one.",Willow
55,russem31,A classic fantasy film from the creator of Star Wars!,8,26 December 2005,"Willow is a classic fantasy film from George Lucas, the guy who brought us such classic films as the Star Wars saga and the Indiana Jones trilogy. Willow in its own right is just as good as the aforementioned films, again showing how George Lucas is a master storyteller whose mind is full of many fantastical ideas. And put into the hands of master director, Ron Howard, and at that time, up-and-coming film composer James Horner, it meant that this film would be a home run. Kudos too to Warwick Davis as the title character Willow and especially Val Kilmer as a hilariously funny Madmartigan! For the most part this is a great film that everyone should see at least once - a solid 8 out of 10.",Willow
56,Atreyu_II,I didn't like it,5,28 May 2011,"This movie was rather boring for me. It had some beautiful scenario, some of it almost as beautiful and as spectacular as in the Swedish film 'The Brothers Lionheart'. Also, the baby of the story, which was considered a ""special baby"" in the movie, was very expressive and utterly adorable.But the movie itself was far from being great. Characters were not appealing, both the story and the acting were mediocre, most action scenes were uncharismatic.Many reviewers seemed to find reasons to compare this and 'The Lord of the Rings'. I sort of can see/understand where these comparisons come from, as there are details in common. But that's just what it is: details. Other than that, they couldn't be more different. To be honest, I'd prefer to watch 'The Lord of the Rings' over this, it would serve me better.",Willow
57,FloatingOpera7,"Willow: ""the"" epic fantasy of the 1980's",10,28 May 2008,"Plot: Willow Ufgood is a Nelwyn (if you know what a Hobbit is you'll understand) a member of a dwarf race in a magical fantasy realm that looks, interestingly enough, a lot like New Zealand). He comes across a special baby, Elora Dannen, the heiress to the throne of the land by prophecy. This spells bad news for the wicked Empress Barmovda, who took over the realm through violence and black magic. Her rival, the good witch Raziel was banished and she has a ton of evil minions including wild pigs, a skull-masked General and a great army. Secure in her power, she feels all it will take is to find the baby Elora and destroy her. But Willow, a rebel named Mad Martigan and the wild warrior daughter of Bavmorda herself, will team up with Raziel to save the day. Willow's confrontation with Bavmorda results in goodness' triumph.I've seen Willow two times. The first viewing was as a child of the 1980's, when Willow would show up on television, usually on a Saturday night on either basic TV's Channel 13 (back then called ""Very Independent"", and would also air other children's classic fantasies of the 80's like ""The Never Ending Story"" from '84 and ""Excalibur"" from '81) and or Channel 5 now known as the WB. Willow was larger than life, a huge epic, as I recall and everything about it was pure magic adventure. Basically, it was the Lord of the Rings of the 1980's, and no other fantasy movie of the decade topped Willow. It was unbelievable. I still have strong feelings about this movie connected to the first viewing as a child and this is always the case with children who grew up on adventure fantasy films of the 80's. Everything was like something as epic as the Bible - a child with a destiny who floats down a river on a basket like the baby Moses,an evil Queen and Sorcereress who wants to keep her power from being replaced, a dwarf with a heart of gold and courage, magic spells,beautiful locations, evil characters (the skull-masked General Kael was especially frightening). Being a child, and a sensitive one, certain scenes were violent, scary, beautiful and awe-inspiring. The fairy queen Cherlindrea, who manifests herself to Willow in the forest was a very memorable scene. There were many things I did not understand about the film, particularly the importance of the quest to save the baby, and the grown-up dialog went beyond my understanding. The movie, too, was too long and long-winded for a child to fully pay attention. The battle outside Queen Bavmorda's castle, her evil ritual and her fantastic death (that cloud of red smoke) was all very intense the first time I saw it.The second viewing was as an adult, I hadn't seen it in years, not since probably 1989. I'm a girl so I enjoy romance and adventure films so I have a fondness for the fantasy genre. I sincerely think Willow is one of the best fantasy films of the 80's. It was very special and ahead of its time. Sure, I can be cynical and analytical about it now. The script is intelligently written but the characters are very one-dimensional, underdeveloped and lacking any real complexity. It's just black-and-white in terms of who is good and who is evil. Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) is pure evil as she is a ""bad witch"" as opposed to a good ""witch"" like her rival Raziel (Patricia Hayes). They don't explain just how Bavmorda took over the land and the extent of her evil. Obviously she is unpopular with her own countrymen and she ruled the land with an iron fist like a tyrant. The baby Elora Danan is considered special and magical but there is no hint of magic in her (she would not do one little magic trick) and throughout the movie she just makes cute faces and needs rescuing all the time. Willow, the hero of the film, seems to take second chair when Val Kilmer's character Madmartigan, enters the movie and soon becomes the sword-wielding, paperback novel romantic hero (complete with long Indian-style hair and shirt open to reveal his chest) who can really fight. Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) is the worst character in the film. There is no real conflict in her when she betrays her mother Bavmorda and falls for Madmartigan and joins the good guys. Jean Marsh' Bavmorda is also flat and her scenes could have been extended so that we can see just how wicked she really is. It seems like they toned down her character so as not to be too frightening. Willow is also too much like a Hobbit and Bavmorda is evil without any depth. So, yes, the film has its flaws, these flaws being in the story (apparently there was lots of back story but Ron Howard and Lucas did not want the film to be longer than standard movie time). Both Howard and Lucas did this film because it was their retaliation at their denial of buying the movie rights to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. This is their alternative to Tolkien, a story so right for the late 80's, with special effects and computer graphics, then in its infancy, used sparingly and yet beautifully, never killing the story and in fact appropriately enhancing the action adventure. Today's fantasy movies contain far too many special effects and CG effects that they completely take over the story. Willow is an example of a story that can be told through good acting, fine script, great cinematography and great music (James Horner's second fantasy movie score; his first was Krull in '83). This is a movie that you can escape into. It is perfect in every sense and no fantasy movies made today can compare to Willow.",Willow
58,raymond-15,A baby's smile lightens up a dull and uninspiring film,5,6 January 2009,"The story starts well. We find ourselves in a land of little people. A happy lot living peacefully in idyllic beauty. Just like in the Bible story of Moses floating down stream in a basket, a baby is found on the edge of the river. What's to be done? The problem is that it's not a baby of the little people so someone will have to take it safely back to the land of the big people. Unfortunately the evil Queen has been told of the arrival of the promised child whom she believes will usurp her power over the earth. She calls on her soldiers to find the child and kill it. Didn't Herod have a similar idea? Is this going to be a story based on the Bible? A dwarf called Willow has the unpleasant job of carrying the baby to safety beyond the river through dangerous territory. The evil Queen's soldiers are everywhere so it won't be easy. Willow is a bit of a magician at heart and the wizard has given him some advice. The rest of the story is an adventure as Willow and the baby overcome every imaginable adversity.When Willow reaches the vicinity of the Queen's castle he is in grave danger of the Queen's wrath and cruel intent. Despite their numbers the soldiers are indeed sadly lacking in military manoeuvres. Willow and the baby keep dodging the soldiers as a fierce battle rages around them. I found these battle scenes uninspiring. They did not excite and continued for far too long. The two headed monster brought some relief but on the whole the final overthrow of the Queen should have been much more gripping.The baby has a sweet smile and will warm many hearts in an otherwise dreary film. The character Willow is a man of good and kind heart and has a good rapport with the baby. Val Kilmer plays a likable rogue among the big people. The character of the Queen is nicely portrayed as one of the most cruel and evil kind. The remainder of the cast fit nicely into the fantasy. The weakness is the unimaginative aspects of the story. On the whole very disappointing.",Willow

It was the VHS era, and the version I got to see was a pirated one, obtained from one of numerous video rental shops. What was the result? This already bleak film became even darker due to the tape being the fiftieth copy of the original.But I watched it. At least twice. And I didn't really enjoy it. The story was surprisingly unimaginative, the characters weren't too likable, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't scary... It does have several rather unpleasant moments and a weird, dark tone which really doesn't work in a family film.All in all, it's a weird piece of cinema that only the eighties could have produced.

63,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,1 December 2004,"A true sword and sorcery classic, and a film all LOTR fans should watch or re-watch, if only to remind ourselves of the days before epic CG armies, when such a story would involve a reluctant hero setting out on an adventure against the odds. Willow is given the task of protecting a baby who is destined to bring the downfall of the Evil Queen who rules the land. ON his way, he picks up several friends including Madmartigan, the greatest swordsman who ever lived, and they attempt to thwart the Evil Queen's plans.The plot is typical of this genre, with Lucas again taking elements from Joseph Campbell, but the film overlooks that fact by being fast, exciting, and with enough to keep adult and kids watching. This was a favourite of mine from childhood because it had good fights, effects, and funny moments, and i appreciate it more now i'm older. The effects were excellent for the time, computer animation was just entering its modern phase, and the acting is very good, particularly from Kilmer, Marsh, and Davies who all seem to relish their roles. Lots of memorable scenes, and a film which doesn't deserve to be forgotten with the recent resurrgence of all all things Elvish. 8 out of 10",Willow
64,rooee,Big adventure,6,12 April 2010,"What's astonishing is that the underrated Warwick Davis was only 17 when he starred in this fun fantasy romp. While Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley (then with a single-barrelled surname) were hitting it off halfway up a mountain, it's Davis who carries the film: a small man with a big, big heart.The quest put before our titular hero is simple: he must save a baby who, according to an ancient prophecy, will end the reign of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh, performing with great relish). The story is fashioned by a certain George Lucas; it could have been dismally generic were it not for Ron Howard's energetic direction and Allan ""Highlander"" Cameron's bold production design. Swords swing, arrows fly, and beasties roar; Industrial Light and Magic spice up proceedings with some positively charming special effects.Perhaps it lacks that dreadful dark trim that Spielberg so skilfully weaves; but in terms of action, adventure, and romance, it's a near perfect family movie.",Willow

For those of you who have never seen this movie, all I am asking is-- why the heck not?!? It is definitely a surprise three-and-a-half star film, much like ""2001""-- you should all see that one, too. Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Jean Marsh, and, yes, Warwick Davis do have some over-the-top moments. Granted, it's hard to find an 80s fantasy movie without those moments, but from George Lucas (I saw this movie before Episode II of ""Star Wars""), I really would have expected better. Forests, swords, magic, and mysticism are what still attract me to this movie, and I hope they will attract audiences everywhere until Galadorn Castle freezes over.",Willow

I'm lucky enough that ""Willow"" happens to be just about the only such movie for me.  I just watched it again last night for the first time in more than ten years.This was supposed to be George Lucas' Big Fantasy Epic that doesn't involve Jedi Knights and was basically marketed as such.  Emphasis was placed on the new ""Morphing"" CGI animation effects.  You know, it's a good thing ""Willow"" has those then-revolutionary special effects going for it (they scared the hell out of me when I was little) because otherwise, as pretty as it is to look at, this is possibly the most mediocre fantasy movie ever made.I don't know why I noticed it so badly.  I read _Lord of the Rings_ in a college English Lit class and our very cool professor recommended watching the entire ""Star Wars"" trilogy again if we were finding the Tolkein hard to follow at first.  I don't know why ""Star Wars"" feels like a Tolkein tribute while ""Willow"" feels more like a direct rip-off.  It doesn't help that ""Star Wars"" zips along briskly, while ""Willow"" is REALLY slow.Now, this isn't a terrible movie.  It just runs slowly and takes itself way too seriously.  It's worth a look, but I'd say they could probably cut a good forty minutes out of it.  So long as they leave in the scene with Zaphod Beeblebrox's evil mutant twin. ^_^",Willow

It's also one of the few Val Kilmer movies I actually like (along with The Prince of Egypt). Sure, it does have its parallels with Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but if you're not a Star Wars fan and want a decent fantasy film, try this! And if you don't want to watch a whole series of fantasy films (like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, or even The Hobbit), let this be your one and only fantasy flick.

68,ayoreinf,So George Lucas felt lazy,7,10 January 2013,"It's a nice film with some nice performance of Jean Marsh and Val Kilmer, some fairly nice special effects for the time but with an annoyingly lazy retelling of the Star Wars original saga, in a pure fantasy setting. I mean really, all the original components are here, from the sexless leading hero, through the charming hired hero and the two silly wisecracking characters that join the ride - two robots replaced by two brownies/pixies, all the way to the leading general of the forces of darkness hidden behind a skull mask never showing his human face. What was the purpose of the whole exercise? Did Lucas need some money and decided to resell his old script one more time? Or was he pestered by some one to come up with a new story when he didn't feel like it. I must admit I don't really know the answer, I'm not sure the answer is important, I always found the sheer laziness of this script annoying - just like being asked to pay twice for the same movie.

It is foretold that a born princess will bring the downfall of an evil queen. Queen Bavmorda hunts the child down until the child is picked up by a dwarf named Willow. Willow must protect the princess Elora with the help of Mad-mortigan and he just might become an amazing sorcerer. I had to find this film on youtube since my father wouldn't get me the region-free DVD. This is a film that I just adored from beginning to end. It made me a bigger fan of Warrick Davis. I like that he had a starring where he wasn't wearing some silly costume. Val Kilmer was super funny especially considering his haircut I mean he just looks weird. I think George Lucas was not inspired by the lord of the rings necessarily but the Hobbit because this is what the Hobbit with Martin Freeman should have been. Ron Howard directed this and he opted to make a fantasy film that would stand on its own with other greats.

70,r-c-s,delicious family movie but alas! the screenplay deserves award for plagiarism,8,25 September 2008,"This is a typically charming family movie. Good SFX, good acting (for this kind of movies) and good scenes. The sore spot is the story:not one single bit, not one iota was original...Lord of the Rings, Alice in wonderland, Excalibur, Moses...we have a salad bar of fantasy clichés from all angles: the child delivered to the river...the child born with a 'mark', the evil sorceress/queen...the sorceress turning men into pigs...a tribe of dwarfs opposed to conventional humans, elves, trolls...Lucas must have thought that people are all dumb like rock; at least Star Wars had light sabers to tell it apart from good old 'merry fellows save a princess from evil emperor/sorcerer' stories. Still, some ideas always work, no matter how used, re-used and abused, and this is the case. Merry fellows led by a dwarf shall save 'chosen' infant from the clutch of an evil sorceress/queen. We even watch Val Kilmer climbing his way to A status actor. This is one of those movies one would watch more than once...for various reason I missed it all these years. SFX are good era/genre wise and scenes are even better...higher caliber production than most counterparts.

71,JohnWelles,Exciting but Unoriginal Fantasy Film,7,25 May 2014,"""Willow"", directed by Ron Howard, who won the Academy Award for ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), is a fantasy film that seems to have been influenced not just be legends but by various veins of filmic popularity in the 1980s. In a way, the films and books it 'borrows' from (or steals, depending on your point of view) paint a picture of Hollywood's landscape in the late eighties and was considered a blockbuster.Starring Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood, the titular dwarf, and Val Kilmer as a mercenary swordsman, the script written by Bob Dolman is based off a story by George Lucas. The screenplay is very obviously inspired J.R.R. Tolkein's novels of Middle Earth and Lucas' own ""Star Wars"" trilogy (1977 – 1983). From the hobbit-like characters in Davis' village to the design of Bavmorda's castle, one can trace Lucas' frustrated attempts in the eighties to make a never-realised film adaptation of ""The Hobbit"". Kilmer's cynical but ultimately loyal swordsman is heavily redolent of Han Solo from ""Star Wars"", as is the mask-wearing supporting villain (played by Pat Roach) suspiciously similar to Darth Vader and the horse-and-cart chase is reminiscent of the speeder chase in ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" (1983). The episodic, quest-nature of the overarching story shares common traits with both of them, while the initial hunt for the baby by the Queen's soldiers seems to be inspired by the New Testament. So, coming as it does near the end of the 1980s cycle of sword and sorcery films like ""Dragonslayer"" (1981), ""Krull"" (1983), ""Legend"" (1985), and ""Labyrinth"" (1986), this is not an original film, but one that incorporates a myriad of influences.However, this does not limit its ability to entertain. Shot on location in Wales and New Zealand by cinematographer Adrian Biddle, it captures the epic scope of the fantasy genre, while the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic are of a very high quality, creating a believable world of massing armies and fearsome monsters.Howard's direction though, is remarkable only for its lack of dynamism: he just lets each scene play, sticking close to the script. Only the scene at the crossroads where Davis and Kilmer see an entire army march by displays any directorial panache in capturing the armoured hordes. Nonetheless, the journeyman direction never tarnishes the fun and the leads carry their roles well. It might not be Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" (2001 – 2003), but for those who want a film in a similar vein, this delivers effectively.",Willow

But to my suprise it wasn't. Willow was a little person. I liked the fanstay aspect of this movie. The plot, storyline, characters, characters development. The acting was great. They all did a great job. I like that there were creatures, brownies, little people, normal people and magical people. I thought the baby was really good. The movie had lots of drama and action in it. There was magical becuse there was wizards and wizards in training. There was also medieval knight like people who were fighting. There was a evil Queen that wanted to get rid of all the baby. So when the baby born and the mother tried to save it. the queen wanted it so that why they were fighting to find the baby. So the hero of the movie wasn't a people it was a little person named willow and some normal sized person. Willow and his wife had a great romance and great chemistry together. I highly recommend this movie to everyone becuse it that good. It good for all ages.",Willow
73,arthurclay,A cool fantasy film,10,8 June 2005,"I loved this since I was a small kid and still find it appealing. I did not know for years that the guy with the long hair was Val Kilmer and I am ashamed to even admit it though I have known it was him for several years. Willow is funny, scary, exciting, tense, and even romantic. The characters are cool and the swordplay is exhilarating. It has a great storyline and is a combination of several different kinds of plots. Joanne Whalley never looked more beautiful or more fierce with that white skin and red hair. God I was half in love with her no wonder Val married her I would have too if I had been him. General Kahl is so cool he reminds you a bit of Darth Vader with his huge presence, maliciousness, and of course the mask. Queen Bavmorda is damn scary she looks like she's 200 years old. A great movie I will always treasure it.",Willow
74,moviecollector,a cult classic,9,18 July 2001,"I really enjoy this film, I've seen it every since renting it back in the late 80's. I know have it on video, thanks 2 Ebay. :)   Its 1 of the best fairy tale type movies, along with LEGEND with Tom Cruise.Warwick Davis did a great job as Willow & all the other midgits. They r just sooooo cute!  Val Kilmer did an alright job, sometimes his acting sucked, & the effects were good 4 its time. Some of the effects were easily fake like the entire scenes with the brownies & that 2 headed beast. If u wanna se a great swash-buckling sci-fi fantasy film, see this 1. The dvd comes out on Nov. 17th.  :)",Willow
75,nickboldrini,Undemanding fun,7,27 January 2019,"This is a fairly standard fantasy story, with a few little tweaks that make it stand out a little - mainly the Brownie characters who provide most of the humour. The transformed sorceress is slightly annoying in my view, but there are some good set pieces - the shield sledge, defending a castle and so on. Not very inventive, and the special effects are pretty dated.",Willow

I wish this movie was more known, it's almost a hidden gem.The movie is just one exciting ride after the other.It's one of the best fantasy movies ever made, and if you're a fantasy fan you just got to see this one. I wish there were more movies of that kind, hopefully the upcoming Lord Of The Rings will deliver similar excitement.",Willow
77,Punk19,Nice little film,10,24 June 2005,"I first watched this when I was 7. Man I fell in love.The film starts off with a queen having to save here new born child from certain danger. She sends some old beggar to send the child to a far off place. Needless to say, the child never makes it. She is now in the hands of Willow(Warwick Davis).Soon the film picks up with Willow and this old,needless to say,man that is what you'd call a hostage in a cage. Both he and Willow start off on a quest to give the little babe back to the mother.This movie involves a lot of fighting. A lot of violence and some crossed dressing. Yep heard right. Val dresses up as a woman to get little babe back after he looses her.This is a good movie to sit with your family with.",Willow
78,yettygutschow,Pretty good...for an older Fantasy,6,6 February 2021,"Overall this is a pretty well done movie. The special effects are dated but the plot is solid. Typical of any George Lucas movie ""outside"" of the first 2 Star Wars films there are way too many goofy moments and too many instances of poor dialogue that it almost ruins the movie. However, director Ron Howard pulled it together. It's a family friendly Hobbit wannabe story that (just barely) hits the mark.",Willow
79,Snowgo,The Finest Movie I have Ever Seen,10,1 March 2014,"I can not adequately express, in words, how much I love this movie. Every second, every scene is a heart-warming, encouraging embracement of all that is fine and good (in both Elven and Dahini). This move has it all, humour, redemption (of Mad Martigan), final liberation (of Grizelle) and some of the most perfect displays of love (by Kaia). I can not help but cry as I write this, thinking of when she handed him her braided ponytail for good luck on his voyage. A story for the ages, deftly and expertly handled by Ron Howard.Val Kilmer's battle exploits against Queen Mortimer's army are breath-taking. Some of his lines are classic: Princess Sorcia: ""What are you looking at?"" Mardigan: Your leg. I'd like to break it.""Billy Barty's character, High Aldred, deserves mention, as well. I have never seen a better nor more convincing magi. Aldred: ""Do you have any love at all for this baby?"" Willow, somewhat reluctantly: ""Yes."" Good work, Willow!!",Willow

Good to look at. His career NEVER took off.Where he met the ""Now"" ex-wife.Warwick Davis was good. But, sometimes he could get on your nerves with Willow's point of view & judgments being pushed onto Val's character & other characters.At least he has ""Return of the Jedi"" as Wicket (another W character) in his resume.A good film.",Willow
82,kneiss1,"Great, creative and atmospheric movie with quite some flaws",7,20 September 2010,"While the movie has great visuals and a great atmosphere, it just had too many flaws that destroyed my fun so much, that my rating needed to go down to 7 points.George Lucas used the same ingredients like in all his other stories. Sadly they didn't work as well as in other of his movies. For example the comedy part. Usually one or two funny characters. The two Brownies Rool and Franjean in Willow just haven't been funny. While for example R2D2 and 3PO have been 2 of the greatest characters in movie history. Similarities to Star Wars are amazing. I found it fun to figure them out. But as I said, George Lucas ingredients haven't been used as well in Willow, as they have been used in Star Wars. For example Sorcha wasn't explained as well as Darth Vader. (They have a lot of similarities, I won't go into details, because I don't want to give away spoilers.) Overall, especially her character would have deserved a bit more time on the screen.While this story is very similar to other George Lucas stories, it seems like less heart was put into into it. And probably the movie would have needed more time for a better story telling and a better character development. And like I mentioned before, the humor simply hasn't been funny. It disturbed me quite a bit and threw me out of the nice atmosphere. The same goes for some odd ""mixtures"" in his fantasy world. The evil guys for example have been driving around on roman horse-drawn coaches while throwing around with Japanese ninja stars. - A weird combination.But after all, this is still a good, and fun to watch movie. Val Kilmer rocked in his role. He was almost as cool as Han Solo or Indiana Jones. (Unbelievable similarities are to be found here again.) The story was creative. And compared to all other fantasy movies out there, this is one of the best.",Willow
83,darin-wissbaum,As bad as a film can get...,1,13 October 2009,"What a terrible film by Ron Howard. Not even George Lucas and his magic could save this boring predictable film. Pretty much what you would expect from a fantasy film with the evil king or queen and how they will be defeated at the end by the most unlikely of heroes. In this case a midget. Val Kilmer was so mis-cast in his role here as to be funny and I could not wait for the credits to start rolling....the little baby in this movie, which the plot revolves around serves no useful purpose except to look cute and get a lot of awws from the audience. I mentioned George Lucas and his magic and I have to say I can't believe the special effects where done by his company. Looks like it was done by some bonehead on his home PC. Avoid unless you want a laugh or two.",Willow
84,crowrobot,Utterly freakin' cool.,10,6 May 2005,"Before the days of the great ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, THE great fantasy movie that had the littlest of us all saving the day was ""Willow"". It's a great ride, with Warwick Davis, although he is diminutive, dominating every scene as the title role. Val Kilmer is great here also as Madmartigan, a rogue who is the best swordsman in the land. He joins little Willow (Davis) in his quest to save the kingdom from an evil witch. The special effects are pretty good, considering this movie was made 17 years ago, but the two-headed dragon and the famous ""morphing"" sequence is just wicked to see on screen. The script has a sense of humor, the direction by Ron Howard is fantastic, and the movie looks GREAT. Right up there with 80's fantasy classics like ""The Princess Bride"".",Willow

Willow with what it had made the best of it. It kept true to it's fantasy form, throwing in some humor and irony around Mad Martigan played well by Kilmer, and Willow played by Warwick Davis. I too found the brownies silly and annoying and for the sake of someone else's sanity wished they were never added in.
Until the release of AD&D and Lord of the Rings can prove it wrong, Willow and Conan will remain as the greatest fantasy epics of all-time.",Willow
87,antonjsw1,Something is missing..........,6,21 November 2010,"An enjoyable film but it just lacks something that Lucas's Star Wars Episodes IV to VI films and Raiders of the Lost Ark had.The film borrows heavily from Tolkien, and is a clear attempt to create a new potential franchise. The plot is satisfactory if conventional and unsurprising. It is a journey of a small hobbit like race called Nelwyns, led by a very impressive performance by Warwick Davis as Wilford Ufgood. In fact, the performances by all the actors playing Nelwyns are impressive and enjoyable, and these characters do act as the heart of the film. However, other characters are not as interesting. Val Kilmer's Madmartigan is a stereotype and his performance is very uneven. In some scenes the character works, in others it doesn't. In fact this is part of the films major problem. Individual scenes work, but these scenes don't connect that well to others and the acting performances are in a lot of cases uneven and therefore jar. Some moments performances are broad and over the top, and then the same characters suddenly come across as more restrained. In fact the only consistency of performance is by the Nelwyn characters, and the two miniature Brownie characters, who are well played by Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton. They are very well realised due to ILM's visual effects and some clever over-sized sets. The films action set pieces are generally solid, with a particularly impressive set of action set pieces shot in the snow on location in New Zealand. However, some of the other action sequences feel more impressive than genuinely exciting and don't involve the viewer particularly. Adrian Biddle's photography is gritty and gives the film a realistic look and feel in a very similar way the Andrew Lesnie did on the Lord of the Rings Films so 14 years later. ILM's visual effects work is very impressive, most notably the sequences where we see the first 'morphing' (shape changing) digital effects, overseen by ILM veteran Dennis Muren and digital effects artist Douglas Smythe. He would go on to be associated with a number of early pioneering digital effects sequences, including the water tentacle in the Abyss, and the morphing effects in Terminator 2. He won an academy award for his ingenious work on Death Becomes Her and a series of technical awards for his contribution the development of digital technology in film. Allan Cameron's production design is first rate and gives an authentic and mysterious feel to the film. However, no amount of impressive technical work isn't able to fully compensate for the fact that the film doesn't quite come together. The music and editing are solid, if uninspiring, and its seems that director Ron Howard and executive producer George Lucas had their focus on managing the film's practical issues, the visual effects, the performance of the actors playing Nelwyns, and the two actors playing the main Brownies. These areas of the film are the strong parts, but the film suffers because of the lack of development and performance of the other characters, notably Val Kilmer's Madmartigan, Joanne Whalley's Sorsha, Patricia Hayes's Raziel, Jean Marsh's Queen Bavmorda and Pat Roach's General Kael who all give uneven and inconsistent performances. In all a solidly entertaining film, but not an entirely satisfying one that makes this reviewer feel that something was missing that prevented the film from being truly special.",Willow

89,jtpaladin,Garbage,1,13 September 2001,"If I wanted to watch SW again, I would pop my SW tapes into my VCR and watch them. This pathetic film is an attempt by Lucas to try and capitalize on his name and a desire by audiences to see more fantasy related films.The acting was bad and the story is very familiar. It's a blatant rip off and I wouldn't suggest wasting one minute watching a very bad remake of SW. Consider the following similarities between SW and Willow:
(1) In Star Wars we have Luke Skywalker who is the Main Character; a farmer in a remote area who is swept up in a quest to bring about the downfall of a Tyrannical Ruler. In Willow we have Willow Ufgood who is the the Main Character; a farmer in a remote area who is swept up in a quest to bring about the downfall of a Tyrannical Ruler. 
(2) In SW we have The Force which is a Mystical Power that the main character learns to master during his quest. In Willow we have Magic which is Mystical Power that the main character learns to master during his quest. 
(3) In SW we have The Emperor who is The Tyrannical Ruler, master of the Mystical Power; plans to enslave the universe. In Willow we have Queen Bavmorda who is The Tyrannical Ruler, master of the Mystical Power; plans to enslave the universe. 
(4) In SW we have Alderaan which is The Main Character's Initial Destination; a peace-loving kingdom where he will supposedly be safe. When he gets there, he finds out it has been destroyed by the Tyrannical Ruler.
In Willow we have Tir Asleen which is The Main Character's Initial Destination; a peace-loving kingdom where he will supposedly be safe. When he gets there, he finds out it has been destroyed by the Tyrannical Ruler.(5) In SW we have Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Main Character's older peer who has experience with the Mystical Power; he lets the Main Character know that he too has potential to master the Mystical Power and sends him on his quest.
In Willow we have The High Aldwin, The Main Character's older peer who has experience with the Mystical Power; he lets the Main Character know that he too has potential to master the Mystical Power and sends him on his quest.(6) In SW we have Han Solo, The Rogue-Hero; he starts out as a criminal who reluctantly follows the Main Character on his quest and ends up believing in the cause. In Willow, we have Madmartigan, The Rogue-Hero; he starts out as a criminal who reluctantly follows the Main Character on his quest and ends up believing in the cause. 
(7) In SW we have, Lando Calrissian, The Rogue-Hero's old friend; starts out actually betraying the Rogue-Hero, but eventually redeems himself by joining the quest. In Willow we have Airk Thaughbaer, The Rogue-Hero's old friend; starts out actually betraying the Rogue-Hero, but eventually redeems himself by joining the quest. 
(8) In SW we have Princess Leia, The Princess; daughter of Darth Vader, whom she ends up fighting against. She falls in love with the Rogue-Hero.
In Willow, we have Princess Sorsha, The Princess; daughter of the Tyrannical Ruler, whom she ends up fighting against. She falls in love with the Rogue-Hero. 
(9) In SW we have, Yoda, The Main Character's Mentor; trains the hero in the mystical power; has a humble appearance that teaches ""you can't judge a book by its cover."" In Willow, we have Fin Raziel, The Main Character's Mentor; trains the hero in the mystical power; has a humble appearance that teaches ""you can't judge a book by its cover."" 
(10)In SW we have, C3P0 and R2D2, Bumbling sidekicks of the Main Character; their chemistry provides much comic relief. In Willow, we have Franjean and Rool Bumbling sidekicks of the Main Character; their chemistry provides much comic relief.
(11) In SW we have, Darth Vader, wears a scary mask and is the Emporer's right-hand man. In Willow, General Kael, wears a scary mask and is Queen Bavmorda's right-hand man. 
Other parallels can be drawn as well. Both Darth Vader and Sorsha start out second-in-command on the bad guys' team and end up working for the good guys. Obi-Wan and Cherlindrea both serve as exposition; both send the main character to the Initial Destination; both hook the main character up with his Mentor.",Willow
90,Akira-36,nostalgic fantasy with loveable characters,7,20 May 2001,"I watched Willow when I was 10. Years later I still finds it an uplifting fantasy tale of good vs. evil. I've always liked the myth of the Sky Deity vs. Earth Deity, which is the background myth of the story. Swords-clashing, magic spells, potions and magic wand, Willow has the overall elements that make a fantasy tale into an enjoyable movie, with loveable characters: Kilmer's MadMartigan the rogue swordsman, naive Sorsha, the for-children-only Brownies and especially Davis' good portrayal of Willow, the main man (although he's less than half of the size).Like some of Lucas epic masterpieces, Willow was inspired by preceding stories like those mentioned in the above commentaries. I'd like to add that Star Wars trilogy was mainly inspired by Akira Kurosawa's films, most of all, by Hidden Fortress. The western, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers influences are just tips of the iceberg. Knowing that, don't try to find originality in Willow, instead let the movie entertain you with nice FX and funny dialogues. I find the action sequences were fast-paced and the magic fights were spectacular too.Seeing Willow again as an adult, I find some parts of the movies childish, but the nostalgic element is still there. So go watch it with friends and family, it's a nice show (I enjoyed the Nintendo game too).",Willow

93,Thornfield2,I dwell in darkness without this movie,8,31 May 2001,"What can I add that hasn't already been said? This film is a wonderful treat for all ages.This movie is in my top ten and I don't know why it wasn't well received when it first came out. Willow (a fine performance by Warwick Davis) is the less likely hero that grows and develops into a character that will stand the test of time. Accompanied with the talent of Val Kilmer they are an unbeatable force. Madmartigan was a childhood hero of all my brothers and sisters and I and we ""played pretend"" with the characters. Even though I'm a girl, I always wanted to be Willow, my younger sis was Sorsha, my brother was Vonkart (the guy with a little bone earring-he always wanted to play him and I don't know why)my other brother was Burglecut and we stuffed him with pillows and my other sister was tall enough to be Madmartigan, she didn't mind playing a guy either. Our backyard was turned into Willowland our Cabbage Patch was Ilaura. This film has evoked so many wonderful childhood memories. I love this film and will love it always. My favorite part is, when one of the little Brownies has a dream about rats..., ""Rats! Big Rats!"" and then then other wakes up and says, ""Oh Rooey, you and your stupid rat dreams"" Great!",Willow

95,dorotka24,Fantasy adventure for all,9,4 January 2008,"I positively love the fantasy genre. For every great film in this group, there seem to be dozens of stinkers. A high budget is not always necessary, but in most cases it certainly helps a great deal, and Willow is no exception to this rule.The early to mid 80s was the high point of fantasy adventure, in my opinion. There were a number of great films from that time, including Conan the Barbarian, Excalibur, Krull, Dragonslayer, Clash of the Titans, Nevernending Story, Ladyhawke, Legend, and others I probably have missed. As the decade wound down, so too did the number and quality of fantasy adventures. It seemed the ""Golden Age"" was coming to a close.Then Willow came along and gave us another great one to add to the list. Many of the aforementioned titles (i.e., Conan) were adult movies, with gratuitous amounts of violence and nudity, and were certainly not for everyone. Willow was one for all ages. It had humor, intelligence, a classic storyline, and truly endearing characters. The casting was nearly perfect, and just about everyone was right for their roles. The scope was not quite as epic as other films, but certainly adequate enough. The style of the film was very reminiscent of ""Star Wars,"" both in the action and the introduction of many unusual characters, not to mention frequent circumstantial humor.I think the movie has a very wide appeal and is extremely well made. See for yourself with my recommendations.",Willow
96,JohnLennon1985,A Spectacular Fantasy Adventure,10,20 July 2002,"I've grown up with Willow. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid. Willow is one of my all-time favorite movies! Who would not love this film? It blends action, adventure, fantasy, romance, and a sprinkle of comedy into one fantastic movie.The acting itself cannot be looked down upon. The story is unique, yet familiar. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this movie. James Horner did a wonderful job composing this music.I recommend this movie mostly for people who like to read Fantasy novels such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" or play Roleplaying games such as ""Final Fantasy"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"". If you haven't seen this movie before, rent the DVD. This movie is a classic.",Willow
97,abyoussef,"Sorry To Say, But Willow Comes Up Short",4,29 December 2007,"by Dane Youssef This one wasn't much when it first came out. The budget was extravagant and the box-office returns just barely covered the big fat price tag. And as measly as a movie as this was for it's day on it's own merits, it's dwarfed even further by the immortal ""Lord Of The Rings"" saga.""Willow"" is the film the impish Warwick Davis is renown for his participation in most, not counting the never-ending ""Leprechaun"" schlock movies.This was his first lead role and he brings a likable and earnest charisma to the role instead of just trying to be little and cute like so many child performers and other midget actors. Thankfully, he proves himself as to be more than just a cheap gimmick like so many other ""bit-players."" He allows himself to really give a true performance and the film itself doesn't go for the cheapest of shots with any of the height of it's little people.As a filmmaker, George Lucas is and has always been a homage-payer. He's one of those filmmakers who always tries to re-make those old films he loved during his own adolescence. With space operas: ""Star Wars,"" With Matinée Adventure flicks: ""Indiana Jones,"" With futuristic sci-fi adventures, ""THX 1138."" And now with ""Willow,"" he attempts to do the same for the sword-and-sorcery genre.The whole universe is derived from the whole medieval sword-and-sorcery genre. And it's a full bar and buffet smörgåsbord here: We've got ""Lord Of The Rings,"" ""The Story of Moses,"" ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Gulliver's Travels"" just to name a few.Val Kilmer is pound-for-pound one of the great heavyweight champion actors from here The 20th century and the 21st saw few better thespians. He truly delivered an Oscar for his re-birth as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's ""The Doors."" Here, anyone could have done the same job he does. It's his most unremarkable performance to date. They didn't need the great Kilmer for this one.Any stock actor with a SAG card or with one year of high school drama class experience could have done as good a job.Jean Marsh does a good job as Queen Bavmorda, but just about any random British actress on the planet could have done the same and gotten the same results.Sadly, this one just stands toe-to-toe with the He-Man ""Master Of The Universe"" movie from 1987.Even though Ron Howard Opie Cunningham was at the helm for this one, just about any hack with access to a tripod (that tilts low) could have done the same and gotten the same results.The real problem with ""Willow"" is that it's totally unremarkable. It's about a likable little guy with a big heart for his family. He has a magical gift and uses it to make a name for himself. He meets a great warrior with a shady record who may find love along the way.They do battle with a wicked queen who happens to be a powerful witch with a great army, a two-headed dragon, a menacing lieutenant General who wears a mask scarier than his own face, yada yada yada yada. Do you even care? There are two little like the 3-inch tall people in ""Gulliver's Travels"" called Brownies named Rool and Franjean with helium voices and ethnic caricatured French accents that would have been considered embarrassing in the '30's. They irritate and confuse, but never amuse. Unlike R2D2 and C3PO or Marcus Brody, they never provoke as much as a smile.Lucas planned for this to be something of a series saga of films. But since this one barely made any return whatsoever, Lucas wound up scrapping the film ""trilogy"" and continuing the story in books. Hey, anyone out there ever actually so much as read a copy of the continuing ""Willow"" story? With ""Star Wars,"" ""THX 1138"" and ""American Graffiti,"" Lucas swung for the fence like a dominant male gorilla. He pulled out all stops and then some. This one is on-par with your average episode of a Saturday Morning TV series, even for the day.You can see anything just as good and inspired/thrilling/etc. every Saturday morning on just about any network.Unlike ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Cocoon,"" this is not a product of theirs that defines the genre it's from.And what is it with baby Elora Danan? She's so much of the damn plot and yet, all she does really is smile and cry on cue. There are babies in diaper commercials who have characters with more depth.I like the two-headed dragon. It doesn't look like the traditional fire-breathing dragon. It hardly even looks like a serpent. This one is kind of inspired. As a change of pace, it has more of an ugly look to it with long and furry serpent necks, almost like an ostrich. It's really weird.Although, it's one of the few inspired touches in this routine medieval epic.It's a Lucasfilm Ltd. production, so the special effects are (as it goes without saying) in the Oscar nomination territory. Enthralling for the day, some even by today's standards still shine. Lucas has made a bigger name for himself as a innovator of special effects than as a filmmaker.While it was a defining role for actor Warwick Davis and it employs more midgets and dwarfs than any other production (and respectively), for anyone else, ""Willow"" is never anything special, nor does it attempt to be.Even for it's day ""Willow"" was unremarkable. Seriously, how many tales of swords, sorcery, kings, queens, dwarfs, dragons, trolls had we seen in movies, TV, books, fairy tales and what-have-you before this came along? Yet another case of, ""Too little, too late."" Nearly 20 years later, that old axiom proves even more true.--For The Little People, Dane Youssef",Willow
98,Bing-18,A surprisingly enjoyable fantasy.,8,17 May 1999,"I must say that I have never been a big fan of 'Magical Fantasies' such as The Dark Crystal etc., but this is a wonderful exception.The film follows the journey of Willow as he attempts to return a mystical Princess to her rightful crown and end the reign of the evil Queen Bavmorda, who obviously isn't very happy with the idea.The scenery and cinematography are superb, the script and plot well crafted, and the acting just brilliant throughout the cast.With great humour throughout, a wonderful romance between Kilmer and Whalley, and some deeply touching moments between Willow and his wife, this movie has something for everyone and anyone to enjoy.Just one question, who invited Skeletor to take part?",Willow
99,jonathanmark-77048,My Favorite Fantasy Movie,10,11 August 2015,"Plot: Willow, a small farmer/apprentice magician, meets Madmartigan, a great swordsman, and together they journey through a war-torn land of magic and monsters, to save a baby princess from death at the hands of an evil queen.This is easily my favorite fantasy film. The reason why I call it my favorite is because of the simple story that it creates, the movie doesn't try to over explain what's going on like they did in the Lord of the Rings films. Warwick Davis does a great job playing a farmer who has abilities that he never explored before. His character is very well-developed, likable, and interesting. Val Kilmer gives the best performance based on his wits, charm, and overall vulnerable traits that make his character stand out the most. Joanne Whalley, Jean Marsh, and Billy Barry all give great performances and are never overshadowed unlike in other fantasy films.My only problem with the film is the two comic reliefs played by Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton who get very annoying and are only there for the kids. Besides that, this is my favorite fantasy film of all time. I hope you give it a chance, I believe it is worth your time especially if you love these types of films.",Willow
100,DevastationBob-3,"I don't love Sorscha, she kicked me in the face!",10,3 December 2000,"The word ""Tolkienesque"" popped up a lot in the other reviews, I would like to inject, if I may, that ALL contemporary fantasy is Tolkienesque. The whole concept of the fantasy genre is blatant plagery of Tolkien with the names changed to protect the guilty.  Not that I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I've read and enjoyed not a few fantasy books, it's just that I feel the word Fantasy can be easily switched with Tolkienesque with no loss of meaning.  Now on to the midgets. Willow is a pretty kickass movie.  Val Kilmer is a drunken, lecherous, arrogant brawler, and Madmartigan is a fun character too.  There are some great one liners in this movie, I find it to be endlessy quotable.  Also, it's got multi-generational appeal.  Kids and adults can watch and enjoy this, for completely different reasons.  I have to say I love midgets. After Rainbow Motel, this is the best midget movie I've ever seen.  It beat out Jedi because the midgets had to wear little bear suits.  I asked a midget if he preferred to be called a Nellwyn, and, boy did I get a fierce shin-thrashing.  A lot of people thought the Brownies were annoying...they are, but Kevin Pollack makes it funny at the same time.  Billy Barty! Billy Barty is in it. Women were represented a lot stronger here than in the normal fantasy movie genre.  The evil heavy Bavmorda is a chick, (I think), the baby savior, the possum-crow-goat lady, and Joanne Whalley all have a strong presence in the film.  However the goat-possum-anteater lady had an annoying voice as an animal, but that added to the quotability of anything she said. ""Willowwww use the waaaandd.""  Sadly  we also have baby-puke and troll-poop, images I don't need to see in movies, but it's a minor complaint. All in all, Willow is a movie that holds up, thanks to midgets. Peace.",Willow
101,jwhale9382,"Little Hero, Big Movie",10,25 January 2005,"Willow is one of my favorite movies of the '80's. It was so funny and action-packed. In some ways, it was better than Lord of the Rings.In the movie, Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) is given the job of protecting a baby princess from an evil sorceress. He is later joined by Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), two Brownies (Kevin Pollack & Rick Overton), and a good sorceress (Patricia Hayes).Willow is a lovable character. He's a family man and is trying to prove himself as a sorcerer. But he doubts his own abilities and no one takes him seriously until he confronts the evil queen, Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). I could easily have seen Angelica Huston in that role. Although he's supposed to be the dashing swashbuckler, Madmartigan supplies a lot of comic relief in the movie. But despite his clumsiness, he still proved that he was ""the greatest swordsman that ever lived."" An since Val Kilmer improvised most of his lines, Madmartigan always had some great lines.The special effects were good. Like most of George Lucas's movies of the '80's, this movie introduced some cutting-edge effects. We get to see some good shots of Patricia Hayes changing into several different animals. Unlike Lord of the Rings, the midgets in this movie were real. This was a great breakout role for a lot of midget actors. It certainly got us to notice Warwick Davis. One of my favorite parts was the dragon, Eborsisk. (They said it was modeled after Clint Howard; I just don't see it.) In 1988, with the help of George Lucas, Warwick Davis proved that little people can rock the world (and save it, too.) This classic fantasy is great fun for adventure seekers of all ages.",Willow
102,paulsrobinson,An average fantasy film,6,19 April 2013,"""Magic is the bloodstream of the universe. Forget all you know, or think you know. All that you require is your intuition.""This average fantasy adventure film, written by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard. Willow, could of been so much more. The film is technically fine great effects (for the time), good cinematography, and some decent acting. But is let down down by a poor story and for me lacks wonder and excitement.The story follows Willow Ufgood who finds a baby, and must protect it from an evil Queen. The title character played by Warwick Davis is a character influenced from Tolkien novels, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, etc, and Davis gives an admirable effort. Val Kilmer though is the real star of the film, giving a funny, charismatic performance. Which is quite tragic considering how his career has dipped in recent years. Special praise also has to be given to Jane March, and Patricia Hayes who play Queen Bavmorda and Fin Raziel respectively.The real problem i had with the film is i did not have as much fun watching as i should have, in respects to the fantasy element of the film not taking me in, and gripping me. I don't know if this is a problems from a writing or a directing position. Or if the film was just missing that specific IT/Wow factor.In the end this film is not bad nor good. Children of a very young age may be taken in easier than i was. But for me it did not quite work.",Willow

105,ackthpt,"A fair effort from Lucas, but nothing like the hype",7,8 April 2007,"Perhaps many viewers of this film were not around or have forgotten the teasers for this film. After plugging through Star Wars episodes IV (A New Hope), V (The Empire Strikes Back) and VI (Return of the Jedi), George Lucas elected to take a break and do other projects. A few years after Return of the Jedi, filmgoers were teased by Lucas with something which would redefine films and the filmgoing experience. Needless to say, fans of Star Wars were practically writhing in joy and agony as this W*I*L*L*L*O*W thing was still over a year away.It has been mentioned Willow advents some new techniques in film-making, combining state of the art digital effects, at least for 1986-1988 period. As for digital effects the two headed dragon looked no more convincing than the Rancor Beast from his last film or even King Kong from several decades before and the trolls crawling about look about the grade for poor television special effects. Lucas had done far better digital effects on the prior Star Wars films. From my visit to the theatre to see this film I recall feeling somewhat let-down, as many others including film critics of the day were. Lucas received no small amount of criticism after his sell failed to meet the expectations of the audience.All in all, it's still an enjoyable film. The story appears to borrow from the early life of Moses, pursuit of the child the prophet spoke of, even to the point of it left in a reed basket; and Lord of the Rings, the theme of a diminutive person delivering the item which would bring down an evil sorcerer/ess.Val Kilmer provides some comic relief, there's some spectacular vistas (though not apparent unless you are watching a very large screen), and lots of baddies and magic, plus the dragon (which comes across rather campy and dated by now), the action is pretty good and the story lightly entertaining.",Willow

I thought the movie was terrific back then and my opinion didn't change after watching it again. Willow has some similarities to the Lord of the Rings movies. The setting is a Medieval fantasy world that has various creatures and a group of characters goes on a quest to conquer evil. This movie though is more lighthearted than LOTR. There are some funny moments with Val Kilmer. Thus, it is a bit more suitable for children than LOTR. Fans of the fantasy adventure genre should like this. It's LOTR but on a smaller scale.",Willow

109,bmk2001,The most Tolkien like fantasy adventure ever put on film.,10,10 December 2000,"For those that say that this film is like Star Wars because George Lucas wrote it, let me tell you people something: George Lucas wrote Star Wars after watching a lot of good movies, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon comic books, westerns, and a lot of science fiction. Now, the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's master piece, is like Star Wars in telling an epic story, in a fantasy world, with unlikely heroes. In other words, it's hard to come up with an original film nowadays. And if you, the audience, don't like it, consider this quote from a popular author(I don't remember his name, but I remember he was popular): If I want to read a good book, I write one. Now back to the movie. This film is incredibly rich with fantastic scenery, magnificent special effects, and extremely likable characters. Val Kilmer and especially Warwick Davis are fantastic in this movie. It is extremely enchanting, and (unless the live action versions of the Lord of the Rings movies are absolutely spectacular) it is about as close to Tolkien as we can get. And who better to do that than George Lucas and Ron Howard? So quite your carping and enjoy it!",Willow
110,mmintz,A strong start does not a good movie make.,5,14 September 2001,"SPOILERS!  BEWARE!For the first thirty minutes, ""Willow"" isn't half-bad.  The score is rousing.  The premise is interesting.  Who doesn't get stirred up by a little infanticide?  The characters look good too.  Willow Ulfgood is suitably doughty.  His kids are adorable!  Queen Bavmorda is a good harridan in the tradition of Morgana and Maleficent and Boorman's influence is apparent in the design of her henchmen's costumes (as well as their horse's get-up).  The evil dog/wolf/rat/boar creatures are appropriately terrifying. And I really like Val Kilmer's first scene as Madmartigan.  He's hilarious! A true scoundrel that makes Han Solo look like an acolyte.  The scenery is exceptional.  One scene in particular (as they are crossing a very high bridge) elicited from me and audible, ""Wow!""  The movie is full of cascading waterfalls, blood-red mountain sunsets, and moss-covered rocks.  Much of it is simply beautiful.  But, folks, despite a promising start, Willow, in its entirety, is downright bad.Coinciding with (but not entirely the fault of) the introduction of the Brownies, it takes a dizzying nose dive from which it never recovers.  The focus quickly goes from the epic to the banal.  As in farts, bird crap, spit-up, love potions, and the inane chatter of the Brownies (which is supposed to be funny just because it's sped up).  Ha ha.  I don't know how much a hand Lucas had in the Brownies but here we see a characteristic Lucas weakness that is nowhere more blatant than here in ""Willow"".  As talented as he is, Lucas' dealings with actual characters are regularly (and often mechanically) formulaic.  You can sense that much of his humor initially looks something like this:FUNNY-LOOKING CREATURE SAYS SOMETHING FUNNY IN FUNNY-SOUNDING VOICE...ALL LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY!  THEN, BEFORE LAUGHTER COMPLETELY DIES DOWN, SOMEONE ELSE ALSO SAYS SOMETHING EVEN FUNNIER...The obvious problem is that knowing when and where to put humor does not necessarily make one funny.  Jar Jar Binks is a good example of how this desire to be funny isn't enough.The movie gets a little better as it progresses and there are a few memorable moments before its (long-overdue) end.  The bridge trolls are great!  (But the moat monster is ridiculous, a far cry from ""Return of the Jedi""s Rancor).  The burgeoning love affair between Mat and Sorsha could've been worse but it's only mildly interesting.  I don't know how excited I'd be about entering into a committed relationship with someone who, until a few hours before, was my sworn enemy and out to destroy the world.  I like conversions (such as Darth Vader's eleventh hour repentance) but this one is nowhere near as careful, convincing, or even interesting.
The ending, where Willow rescues the ""Chosen Child"" from the clutches of the Evil Queen and interrupts her devilish rite is mildly interesting. Fortunately for the good guys, the ceremony for killing baby princess' is quite lengthy and Willow is able to rescue her just in the nick of time. To do so, he relies on an old stand-by: the old disappearing piglet (or baby) trick.  Whew, was I relieved.  I now knew that this would all soon be over! Surely my feat of endurance was at least as commendable as Willow Ulfgood's.
In cosing, I want to list some of the interesting parallels between ""Willow"" and ""Star Wars"".  In fairness, these parallels are pointed out more out of novelty than actual criticism.  It was about the only thing that kept me keepin' on through the last half.  Though most are pretty obvious, I still found them somewhat interesting...QUEEN BAVMORDA = Darth Vader and the Emperor.  One of her first lines is ""I want them alive!"".  This is very similar to one of Vader's first lines in Episode IV.  Also, as she dies, she is lit up with blue-ish lightning and we even see her skull as we do with the Emperor in his last moments.FIN RAZEL = Yoda.  She is Willow's mentor.  She is trying to get him to realize the magic inside of him despite his lack of faith.  Also, like Yoda she is initially not much to look at (being a muskrat and all) and has trouble convincing the others that she is, in fact, a great teacher. Finally, (when she is finally returned to her human self) she is white haired and feeble and dies as Yoda did.MATMARTIGAN = Han Solo.  He is handsome, roguish, develops a crush on the indomitable female lead and (through much cajoling) eventually gets her. One of the first things said to Matmartigan in the movie is, ""You serve no one.""  This is clearly similar to Han's insistence that he takes orders from no one but himself.  Finally, just as does Han, Matmartigan (due to a variety of motives) eventually sees the emptiness of his solipcistic existence and joins the cause.ERIC = Lando.  Eric is a former associate of Matmartigan who's relationship to him is tenuous at best.  In their first encounter, he recognizes Matmartigan but wishes him dead.  He is also incredulous at Matmartigan's involvement with the good guys.  ""Since when are you a crusader?"" he asks. Finally, he and Matmartigan are reconciled and he joins the cause as well.So there you have it.  Willow is not good but...it was produced by a really famous guy who did do some stuff that was.",Willow
111,tacmovies,Someone Give Warwick Davis More Work!,8,8 January 2010,"Story: This is the archetypal David and Goliath style story of a little man (literally) vs. the big bad. It's also the quest style of fantasy story. It has more than a few similarities to the Lord of the Rings, not to mention some parallels with the story of Moses from Bible, but it does it in it's own way. All around, aside from some startling badass decay, which we'll explore in the acting section, the only real complaint I have with the story is that the ending is not terribly self explanatory. Whenever I make someone watch this movie for the first time, they always turn to me and ask, ""What just happened there?"" and I do consider this a failure on the part of the movie. They could have explained it after the fact. B Acting: Val Kilmer is my favorite actor, largely because of this movie, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Spartan, and At First Sight, and while he's really, really good in this movie, I don't understand why he and Joanne Whalley got higher billing that Warwick Davis. Warwick is in nearly every shot of this movie, he's the titular character, and he really was the meat the holds the movie together. I guess it was a marketing decision. Anyhow, Warwick is awesome in this movie and really needs to be given more to do than be a side character in every Star Wars, Harry Potter, or odd ball fantasy movie/miniseries that comes down the pipes. Don't believe me? Watch Ray. He's in it, he's a little man, and it doesn't matter. It doesn't impact the story practically at all. He gives a strong performance and it works.Anyhow, back to Val. Madmartigan is probably the loudest, most animated character that Val has ever played, which is cool when you consider that he usually plays very thoughtful, understated characters (like his Ice Man character in Top Gun). He sort of plays this movie's version of Han Solo, the skeptic, smart mouthed fighter. His character does experience a certain level of badass decay as the movie approaches its climax, as he loses his smart mouth in favor of being the generic, noble warrior character. To a certain extent, this understandable, but I would like to have seen him retain more of his personality. That said, his sword fight with Pat Roach more than makes up for this.Madmartigan may experience badass decay, but not nearly as badly as Sorsha, the character played by Joanne Whalley. She starts out tough as nails with a strong personality. She's got a sword that looks like pain harnessed in steel form, and she's here to kick your ass... until she falls in love with Val Kilmer. After this, she barely gets two lines in for the rest of the movie and also devolves into an idealized sort of warrior woman.However, I think the real star of this movie is Jean Marsh. Queen Bavmorda is evil and powerful. She's knows magic spells to kill you in many painful ways and a enough of a lacking conscience to use it. When the Nostalgia Chick listed her top lady villains, I was quite disappointed to see that Bavmorda didn't make the list when the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of Oz did (I realize that I'm about to utter blasphemy, but the witch didn't do anything in that movie except laugh in an over the top manner. Oh, and she used flowers to put people to sleep and employed an hour glass of doom, oh the horror!) Her acting is almost over the top, but not quite. She hits her note perfectly.Lastly, they got the cutest, most expressive baby in the world to play Elora Danan. She smiles and laughs at all the right times. B Visuals: This movie was really revolutionary at the time for raising the bar on visual effects with the whole process of morphing. The special effects hold up to this day and look better than a lot of digital effects you'll see on a Sci-Fi (or is it Sy Fy?) channel original. Also, may I say that Nockmaar castle is the most evil looking castle ever (sorry Orthanc and Barad-dur). I realize that sixty percent of it is a painting, but seriously I love the look of that castle. A Sound: The music in this movie is beyond epic, although I know I heard the same music in an ad for Disney's the Three Musketeers, so I don't know who borrowed it from whom. Whatever, it works in this movie. The sound effects are awesome, they completely compliment what we're seeing on screen. A Overall: This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, not to mention my favorite NES game. I probably drove my parents crazy between the two of them. However, this is one of the few childhood memories that held up over the years. I definitely can't say the same for the Thundercats.

112,NightOfTheLivingDon,Willow is a great film...unless you are a joyless dipwad,9,22 February 2007,"While reading many of the reviews to this movie, most of them (and almost all of the negative ones) invoke the names of George Lucas and JRR Tolkien. These said negative reviews go something like this: blah blah blah Star Wars blah blah Lucas cashing in blah blah Darth Vader blah blah. OR this: blah blah Tolkien was better blah blah rip-off blah blah. Well, first I have to say is that I'm sure a lot of these people knocking Willow for being ""Tolkienesque"" wouldn't know who and how Tolkien wrote if Lord of the Rings was never made into a film. Those people can stuff it. A very good point was made by someone else reviewing Willow, in the fact that comparing something to Tolkien, or referring to something as Tolkienesque is far too easy. Tolkien is to fantasy as Dracula is to vampires. You can't get very far with either theme without bumping into something similar. On the Lucas front, please, can we stop with all of these comparisons to Star Wars and Darth Vader. No wonder you didn't like the film, you were far too busy thinking about Star Wars! Are you going to start brushing American Graffiti, another Howard/Lucas film, with that fine tooth comb from a galaxy far far away? Don't make it sound like this was Lucas' film, it was Howard's! Georgey didn't start getting completely egotistical until the 90s. Some of the naysayers even knock it for not being a straight up good vs. evil film! Some even called it far-fetched! It's a friggin' fantasy movie!! Are you people nuts? What person in their right mind condemns a fantasy film for being too fantastic?! Willow is what it is, and that's an action-adventure slice of unreality with plenty of sorcery, sword fights, and fictional creatures. Sure, it's not cliché free and it hasn't got the comedic timing of the Marx Brothers. So what? If you can discredit all that is good with Willow for the scant bad, then your favorite movie is probably Anchorman.",Willow
113,jetgraphics,A good effort ruined by shaky cam,5,13 October 2021,"My usual gripe about shaky cam action sequences still hold true as they mar this decent attempt at world creating.Good points for cultural backstory for the little people.But for some reason, the movie doesn't quite gel. I've seen better, done with far smaller budgets, such as ""The History of Future Folk."" That movie just clicks along, with endearing scenes juxtaposed with utter strangeness - like a ""torture"" scene via banjo medley.Lucas and Howard have the big bucks and technicians, but the story makes no sense, when you stop and think. How does an infant threaten a powerful wizard? And it really doesn't matter, in the end.At times it feels like a documentary, lacking dramatic emphasis. A good example is the sword play. That should be ... theatrical. I compare it with such swordplay in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" and it is so flat in comparison. You don't care when the bad guys are getting beaten. Or when the good guys . . . Oh well. . . Won't spoil it.Ironically, Kilmer and Whalley had some real ""chemistry"" that resulted in a marriage, but it didn't show in the film. Sometimes it does show up, like Tony Curtis, in ""Taras Bulba."" He fell for his co-star and later wed her (after divorcing his wife).Someone once pointed out that the ""best"" movies allow us to vicariously experience being the unlikely hero, or successful suitor, or survivor of a catastrophe. I just didn't identify with any of the characters, and that's probably the reason.",Willow
114,Erik G.,mixed feelings,7,22 February 1999,"I don't know about this movie.  I mean, I like it--sort of.  There are some great things about it, and there are some annoying things.  For one, the plot.  It's like Snow White meets the Story of Moses meets the Lord of the Rings.  I mean derivativeness has its place, but this is just too derivative.  It has all the elements of a great fantasy (great battles, weird monsters, interesting characters, great journeys) except one:  a sense of awe and wonder.  I was just never convinced that that baby (who we see entirely too much of) could save the world, or that all the mumbo jumbo about ancient witches and monsters was real to the characters.  The brownies quickly wear out their welcome, though they never become outright annoying. They just become redundant.  General Kale is given little to do other than ride around looking mean, and he is obviously a poor man's Darth Vader (Lucas referring to himself, I guess).  Bavmorda is more irritating than terrifying, and the story really went off in too many directions, lacking urgency and focus.  OK, with that said, I can now say what I liked about the movie.  First, it was pretty funny.  There are a lot of humorous moments, especially with Mad Martigan.  The FX are very good (of course, from ILM) and there are many very good little actors (like Warwick Davis) in Willow. The scenery is great, and even though the plot goes off on tangents, you are always left guessing as to what will happen next (if you just forget the inevitable showdown between Good and Evil).  So all-in-all, I liked it, but I think it could have been much better.  Still, there are precious few good fantasy movies around, so I still would have to give this one a 'thumbs up.'",Willow
115,PhilipJames1980,It marks the end of an era.,7,29 June 2013,"Willow (1988) is an interesting movie to me because I am interested in cinema history, and, at least for me, it represents the end of an era in that history.That era perhaps began in 1981 with the release of Jon Boorman's Excalibur, and continued with Conan the Barbarian (1982) and its various imitations. By the time Willow was released, audiences at the time were well-acquainted (perhaps even a little overly familiar) with sword-and-sorcery movies.Recently I rented this movie through Netflix because I could not remember if I had ever seen it. After watching it, I have to be honest and admit that I am not sure that I ever saw it before, even as a child.I only remembered it at all because I believe in my childhood I had a Willow action figure, the evil queen's guard, if I remember correctly. I lost the toy a long time ago, but I figured I might as well watch the movie.If I had seen this movie as a child, I might perhaps have liked it better than I do as an adult. Watching it as an adult, what struck me most about the movie is that it is a surprisingly big production for a 1988 fantasy movie.Audiences today, accustomed to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy and other epic-scale fantasies with computer-generated effects, might not be impressed by Willow. But I am old enough to remember the 1980s, and I can safely say that this movie has everything that money could buy in 1988.Since George Lucas produced this movie, the scale of the production should perhaps not be a surprise. He also had the advantage of producing this movie after several years of sword-and-sorcery movies, which enabled him to see what other filmmakers had done and make a bigger, more elaborate fantasy than any of the previous ones.Bigger, however, does not necessarily mean better. Ironically, the main flaw with Willow, in my opinion, is that it has too much of everything: lots of chases, lots of monsters, lots of special effects, lots of sword-fights, as though George Lucas wanted to wear out the audience.It almost seems pointless to discuss performances in a movie like this, which depends so much upon special effects. But as far as acting goes, my favorite performance in the movie was by Val Kilmer, as the rogue who helps Willow on his quest. He even survives the indignity of having to dress in drag for an extended sequence. It is easy to see why he went on to other things.Warwick Davis, as Willow, grew on me as the movie progressed. My only objection is that, at times, it is difficult to watch a little person in so many dangerous situations, and being insulted by almost everyone he encounters (obviously that is the movie's point, that Willow perseveres despite the prejudice against him, but it is still hard to watch at times).Fantasy movies are not noted for their terrific screenplays, and Willow unfortunately is not an exception. As I watched it, I could not help by notice where all the ideas were coming from—the Book of Exodus, Gulliver's Travels, the Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz, etc. Since it lacks the literary origins of most of the best movie fantasies like Lord of the Rings, I also cannot think of any memorable lines from Willow.I do not watch fantasy movies for their acting and writing, however. What interests me most about fantasy movies are their production design, and their visual ideas.For example, I liked the sequence in which Willow and Kilmer escaped from the enemy camp by using a shield as a sled. It reminded me of a similar escape sequence in The Living Daylights (1987). I also liked the scene in which a troll, after being struck by Willow's magic wand, fell into a castle moat and emerged as a two-headed fire-breathing dragon. And I liked some of the unique design ideas, such as the wolves that are made up to look like giant rats.James Horner's musical score is beautiful and suits the movie perfectly. I also have to commend Ron Howard's direction, as he finds just the right tone for this material. Back when this movie was released film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that it was too intense for its target audience of children, but at least it is not overly condescending and juvenile like so many fantasy movies of the 1980s.For all of its fine ingredients, however, after watching Willow it is easy to see why movie audiences in the late 1980s were willing to forget about fantasy movies for a while. Audience tastes were changing, and in any case nothing more could be achieved with the special effects available at that time.While it would be incorrect to say that no fantasy movies were produced between Willow in 1988 and the first Lord of the Rings movie in 2001 (Dragonheart, released in 1996, comes to mind) I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that this movie marks the end of an era.When the first Lord of the Rings movie was released in 2001, it not only added computer-generated effects but was more adult in tone than any of the fantasy movies of decades past. The era of Willow, with its old-fashioned special effects and relatively simple storyline, is genuinely gone.",Willow
116,refill,"A fantasy without imagination, a romance without heart",1,15 May 2000,"This is a disgusting, discouraging, desolate, dog's breakfast of a movie.  It's a fantasy without imagination, a romance without heart, a saga without a plot, and a ""family movie"" filled with relentless and gratuitous violence.George Lucas' biggest mistake in Willow  is that he fails to trust in the power of a simple tale simply told.  Star Wars, for all its special effects, was just that -- a straightforward fable of good versus evil.  In Willow, Lucas starts with a small, appealing story, and then buries it in an avalanche of cliches, botched special effects, and violence.The special effects generally have no justification in terms of the plot.  And what's worse, they're poorly executed.  Most laughable is the two-headed Ebersisk, a monster who appears for no discernible reason, and who looks like a refugee from some old Sinbad movie.Some of my other favourite low-lights include the unfunny and clumsily matted-in brownies (anyone remember The Gnome-Mobile?).  ""They were so darned cute,""  cooed one of my companions, ""I just wanted to step on them!""  And let's not forget the talking possum (I'm not kidding), who is really a good sorceress under an evil spell.",Willow
117,dmturner,"Friendly, funky story, sweeping, grand scenery and a long-haired Val Kilmer.",8,26 May 2005,"Though the scenery is grand and sweeping, this fantasy movie has a friendly, funky heart. Unsurprisingly for a movie directed by Ron Howard, the comedy avoids crudity and over-cuteness but the characters have a pleasant, classic narrative superficiality. Consistent with a George Lucas production, its plot is thin in spots and over-reliant on sudden epiphanies. Even the much-vaunted special effects already seemed a little hokey when I saw it in 1988. Yet it is one of my favorites. Why? Well, Warwick Davis, for one, with his fresh young face, nimble acting, and energetic motions. A close second, one of the most adorable babies ever to raise her eyebrows, played by Ruth and Kate Greenwood. Jean Marsh, whose face in the final scenes is one of the most horrifying things I've ever seen. Billy Barty. And, essential for a lady's complete enjoyment of a movie, a good-looking man: a funny, mugging, handsome, clowning heroic Val Kilmer looking scrumptious in everything between a blowsy gown, a bloomer-like loincloth, a suit of vaguely Persian armor, and woodsman attire.I admit it: I re-watch the movie every once in a while, but though I enjoy the story and it really is delightful, my main motivation is Val Kilmer as the blustering, shallow, moonstruck, valiant Madmartigan.",Willow
118,clint-cole,Fantastic,8,7 December 2005,"Versatility is the key to this movie. You can watch it with the kids, by yourself, or with the guys(for some reason us men find midgets intriguing). You've got elements of humor, adventure, and suspense that are unparalleled by most movies of today's time.Made back in the 80s this movie exhibits special effects with an element of fantasy. As far as fantasy movies go, this movie was not surpassed until the release of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring. George Lucas again displays brilliance in another genre of movies. This movie achieved for fantasy what Indiana Jones did for Action/Adventure and Star Wars did for Sci-Fi.A must see!",Willow
119,Bryan-15,Great fun,8,19 August 1998,"This movie is one of the best sword and sorcery movies ever.  It was wit, charm, and lots of action.  There is a serious need for more fantasy movies like this.  Dragonheart was close but didn't have the feel of a D&D environment.  It's a nice change to see Val Kilmer actually having fun with a role.  He does a nice job. Warwick Davis obviously cast for his size still puts forth a great effort.  The special fx are good.  If this movie gets remade with today's cgi then it would be even better.  Another plus for this is that it never loses anything even after you've seen it 10 times.  It's fun to watch on a rainy Saturday or any day basically. Recommended for everyone 8 out of 10.",Willow
120,Bryan-15,Lots of magic and adventure,8,7 September 1998,"This is a really fun movie.  It's innocent and is great for people of any age.  It's one you can watch over and over again and have just as much fun as the first time.  There is plenty of action and even good doses of humor to keep the somewhat weak plot moving.It's nice to see Val Kilmer at least looking like he's having a good time making.  His portrayal of Madmartigan exudes arrogance but he's also charming and quite romantic.  Warwick Davis was obviously cast for his size but nonetheless he makes us like him and we want his mission to succeed. 
Willow (Davis), must bring the infant Elora Danon to Tir Asleen where she will be safe from evil and someday take over the reign of the evil and merciless Queen Bavmorda.  If he fails the whole realm faces years of darkness and terror.  This is a highly enjoyable film, 8 out of 10.",Willow
121,hdcole,Willow gave me the creeps,5,22 May 1999,I mean the actual character Willow gave me the creeps.  The movie did absolutely nothing for me at all.  There are so many things I didn't like about this movie that I don't know where to start.  I guess the main character just turned me off in the beginning and I tuned the movie out after that.  It seemed more of a kiddie movie.,Willow
122,rcuppen79,The best fantasy movie ever,10,30 April 2001,"Willow is a production of George Lucas, which means great action, a good story and dazzling effects. Willow is kind of a mixture between Star Wars and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I first saw the movie when I was just a small child, but even now I think it's a great movie. The story is good and is very funny as well. Warwick Davis is excellent as Willow and also Val Kilmer plays one of his best roles. The costume and set designs are perfect and the visual effects are very well made. Also the music of James Horner is brilliant. Willow is still my all-time favorite movie and the best fantasy movie ever.",Willow
123,theninja,A Classic Film...,10,15 November 2002,This movie is fantastic. It has been one of my favourite films since i was 6 years old. I have just recently purchased this film on DVD and i couldn't be happier with it. It is one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over again and it is still as enjoyable every time.I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings and similar movies.This film truly is a classic and deserves a place in the top 100 films.,Willow
124,witheld,Best fantasy adventure ever...,10,28 July 2003,"George Lucas knows how to make myths and legends.  He proved that with Star Wars.  All the classical elements--a great warrior who's a rogue in need of redemption, a farmboy looking to become great, an evil warrior woman who just needs a good man--are here, as well as a baby fated to destroy an evil queen, comic relief in the form of brownies, great sorceresses, etc.And to this all one of my favorite directors of all time adds his personal trademark.  Ron Howard makes this film terrific by adding a human touch, making the people seem real.  He and Val Kilmer should get back together; this project together is, IMO, the best of Kilmer's career.  He's more animated than in any other movie (with the possible exception of Real Genius).  Warwick Davis is at his best here (most of his roles being less acting and more just being short for the laughs that generates).Magic, dragons, swords...unfortunately, that only attracts a limited audience.  Unless you're Tolkien.  This is one of the best movies of all time.",Willow

It centers around a little person taking a very long walk to accomplish a very specific goal, while encountering a forest fairy queen that prophesies his important role... meanwhile, meeting a sword swinging companion to accompany them, providing safety as they come upon resistance from a magical entity... sound familiar? Upon viewing this as a grown up I came to the realization that this movie did Lord of the Rings before LOTH was a thing, and did it quite well. It's stands the test of time and ages gracefully... I'm appreciative there's no remake to tarnish this undervalued gem. Certainly worth the watch, albeit a bit out dated prior to decent cgi.",Willow

Of course, the f/x from 1988 begin to look a little old, but they are still very enjoyable. And the plot, the characters, they're all very nice and different from the ""usual hero"". The babies playing Elora Danan are really cute, too.",Willow
129,the_cave_troll,fairy tale masquerades as fantasy-action flick,6,27 December 2003,"My rating:  5 out of 10. Willow was a breakthrough fantasy film in the late 1980's, largely for special effects improvements.  The story centers around a young ""peck"" (dwarf) farmer, Willow, who finds a baby on the shore of a river.  The baby is prophecied to bring about the downfall of the evil queen and is being hunted by her servants.  Willow joins forces with a crazy rebel warrior ""Madmartigan"" to protect the baby from the Queen's forces.Willow is a fairy tale disguised as a fantasy.  The film attempts to show how a small person (common man) can triumph over evil.  Indeed, Howard goes to great lengths to film the ""peck"" culture at work and play.  Ron Howard's devotion to Willow's culture shows how Howard appears to take the film away from the fairy tale and ground the story in three-dimensional characters with actual feelings and lives.Once we cut away from Willow to the evil queen, or Willow stops being the protagonist (led by Madmartigan or the shape-changing scorcerer), the film's sense of reality falls apart.  If this were a true fantasy, grounded in some alternate reality, would Ron Howard coach his actress, ""can I get that cackle a little more devilish?"".  I can only guess that Lucas' script and direction of the project had more to do with this embarrassment.  We've seen what Howard can do with a good script.In the DVD extras, Ron Howard appears to suggest that the film was really George Lucas project, and it shows, as most special effects from Star Wars-Return of the Jedi have been reinserted 5 years later (two-headed monster, scene change style, score, etc.).Kilmer has flashes of brilliance as crazy rebel Madmartigan.  His love interest, Joanne Whalley, is unnecessary to the plot but not unpleasant to look at.  These two have considerable chemistry (they were later married) but Lucas doesn't seem to have a reason for bringing them together.Warwick Davis (Willow), first ""noticed"" playing an Ewok for Lucas in Return of the Jedi, plays his role with intelligence and passion.  He is really the one bright spot in the film.The Brownies are annoying and do not have any real purpose in the film (a.k.a. Jar Jar Binks).This film also contains the first use of morphing, a tool used to make images appear to change from one form to another.  It was later used in many other films and has led us into the CGI age.The action leading up to the climax was intense, however the ""siege"" at the queen's castle and scorcerers duel appeared anticlimactic and used a ""God in the Machine"" plot device to end the film.If you want a film with action and some heart, then you will enjoy Willow. If you have a difficut time believing a prophecy that a baby will determine the fate of the world, then this film really isn't your cup of tea.  If you are somewhere in the middle, then you are like me and wishing Ron Howard could have had someone other than George Lucas write the script.",Willow

131,monika-woods,The Wonderful World of Willow,9,18 November 2006,"Our whole family loved ""Willow"". From the adorable, yet mischievous Brownies, to the wicked queen, this movie had every element of a life lived in it. As always the chameleon, Val Kilmer, was splendid. His acting is altruistic and heart-warming. He is like a prodigal son in the movie, but that's enough info, I would not want anyone to not watch this because they think they know what it is about. It is nice to see a movie that shows, especially to the younger generations, that what we take for granted, food, clean water, freedom, has not been, and is not always something so easily gained. The good vs evil is a wonderful classic plot theme, especially for younger audiences. The movie is simple yet the complex themes and sceneries make it easy to watch 2 or 3 times, if not more. An excellent family movie. We have watched it many times before, and will continue to watch it in the future.",Willow

135,JEve264470,Truly spell binding adventure,10,2 January 2005,"Willow is one of the truly greatest films I have ever seen. Not only is the story fantastic but the acting carries it off brilliantly.The story is centred around a dwarf called, funnily enough Willow. He finds a human baby in the river and sets off to return the little one to it's people, not knowing how special the kid is or what danger he is in! But the main star of the film is Val Kilmer who wonderfully portrays the crazy yet brilliant Madmartigan, a truly gifted warrior with a past. He makes this film. Val Kilmer is one of my favourite actors who is truly underrated.one of the best films ever made if not definitely the best movie of the 80s. Ron Howard and George Lucas deserve all the credit in the world for this truly brilliant fantasy epic, as does Val Kilmers. I also loved the fact that the legendary Billy Barty had a cameo.Legendary movie.",Willow
136,bart-942-944948,The only one,10,17 January 2021,"I've seen this movie when I was 8 years old, and granted, the trolls did give me a few nightmares. But till this day hearing the soundtrack makes me emotional and makes me longing for those days, when i still believed in dragons, trolls, evil Queens, Daikini, Nelwyns, .... That magic is gone, but if I see this movie again I forget I am 40 years old and I am right back in the big cinema when I was 8.
Sorsha is getting prettier each year that passes and I am proud to say she was my first crush!I think everyone has 1 movie, that pulls all strings in just that matter that is perfect for you. For me it is Willow.
I am just glad that when I had to pick a movie in 1988 (I still know I was at summer camp and I could pick 1 movie out of 5, and I was one of the few that choose Willow)
When I left the cinema, I didn't know what just happened but in the years after I actually forgot the movie.
Then i've heard the soundtrack from some movie in which James Horner reused the trumpets.
Vaguely remembering somthing about a dragon with many heads, trolls, and little people. Google came to my rescue and as soon as I saw the name, I knew I had found it again.
As soon as the opening credits began, I was right back in that Cinema.Fantasy has only 1 name in my book, and that is Willow !",Willow
137,alexanderpetreski,Not much of a fantasy epic,4,1 November 2021,"As one of the movies that was always on my watchlist, this became quite the disappointment of the year so far. The movie is unfortunately a drag and strangely it's the action scenes that are quite the snoozefest. They're loud but lack direction, go on for far too long and rarely have a satisfying resolution. Val Kilmer's performance is amusing at times and it certainly helps but can not carry the movie.To be honest, I like how the movie started and I was more immersed with the village and their troubles and how Willow will become repected among his people. I wished the movie would have just focused on that part and didn't try to go big, there is a genuine story here. Like I said the actual 'adventure' left me pretty cold, since most of it was borrowed heavily from Lord of the Rings, Star Wars etc but alas those movies did a much better job in terms of pacing, editing & storytelling.Some positive things to note about the movie:
Fantasy movies from this era are often beautifully shot because there is not much CGI involved: sets, production design and location shoots are nice. Same goes for the ""beasts"" that are real dogs in some kind of special costume. Other things like the trolls were very underwhelming in terms of makeup effects. Unfortunately the movie does have some early visual effects, in particular blue screen effects which aren't very well integrated.Overall a nicely shot film with a rather predictable and unengaging story.",Willow
138,ManofClay64,Wonderful,9,12 May 2018,"Warwick Davis is great as a Willow, an Everyman thrown into a world rather bigger than he feels able to cope with. Great fun with a clever script and Ron Howard's ability to give characters depth and plausibility, even small cameos.
I've seen the film many times and the whole family still love this tale of a little guy in a big world.
Some people slate the film, I think just because of its naive charm, but I think it's a gem.",Willow
139,tortply,"Fun Story, Some Brilliant Balances, A Few Serious Flaws",8,15 April 2020,"First, contrary to some reviews, this is far from a copy of ""Lord of the Rings"". Someone compiled clever comparisons with ""Star Wars"", but plot parallels with either movie are superficial. Unlike LOTR (a philologist's life's study evolved into a complex plot weaving cultures, languages, and ancient history) this is human-scale and simple, Lucas at his entertaining-storyteller best. ""Willow"" has kid appeal but ages well; it's cute but not cutesy or patronizing.Where it does mirror LOTR is in two compelling themes: First, a safe, warm little home life can be difficult to leave behind, but it's also worth fighting for. Second, heroism is a choice; not only can a character without overwhelming (and plot-distorting) physical prowess, brilliance, or supernatural ability take on great responsibility and effect great change, but it is all the more admirable, relatable, and meaningful. Like LOTR (but unlike many ""underdog"" stories), this is presented without preachy hostility to traditional heroes; ""balance"" like this is one of the film's great strengths.There is much to admire in the art and science of filmmaking and acting here. The score is rousing, memorable, and conveys the theme of each scene. Location shots and general visuals are beautiful. Effects (both technical, and human stunts) ""sell"" but do not overwhelm the story. Fight sequences are very skilled: never gratuitous or gory, they are rigorous enough to convey urgency and danger, rather than the superficial and stagy fencing of some older movies.Magic is subtle and doesn't upstage characters or plot. Humor is spot-on as well: lighthearted, but never descending into absurdity or self-parody.As with the first three ""Star Wars"" (and despite the fact that there are serious plot holes with people who happen to be female) this is a brilliant, balanced portrayal of strong female characters. None of the three pivotal women are old-fashioned stereotypes, nor are they bitter, masculine or genderless. The two who are sorcerers are skilled sorcerers. All are strong and respected leaders. The female warrior is skilled and effective, but not so powerful (like in EVERY 2010s action movie) as to strain credibility or the laws of physics.Negatives? The queen is scripted and acted as a VERY stereotypical villain (constantly scowling and gloating). She seems intelligent, and the infant prophesied as her nemesis has no apparent powers, yet she never thinks to choke or drop the baby (or maybe just not feed her) rather than squandering many advantages to plot an ""overly elaborate and easily escapable death"".Worse still is her daughter's lightswitch-flip in lieu of character development. I didn't know until reading IMDB trivia, but the pivotal scene was filmed and cut. What's left is a character so dedicated to her mother that she hunts down the baby with minimal hesitation - suddenly fighting for the good guys (cutting and stabbing men she'd led up until that moment) why? Because she likes Val Kilmer? Nevertheless, ""Willow""'s many positive qualities make it possible to overlook even these significant holes.",Willow

I've read people's comments that this is a rip off the lord of the rings. #1) Half of you out there didn't even know the lord of the rings until they made it a movie, a fine job, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth considering Hllywood has run of ideas so now they take fantastic stories from our past and turn them into money. Sacriledge! cat in the hat, grinch, little rascals etc Why not take the movie for what it is and leave well enough alone. Every movie can't possibly be an academy award winner.

What most directors fail to see is that Fantasy movies need a touch of the dark ages to succeed; they must convey a sense of harshness... hard people for hard times. As is the norm with American action/adventure movies, there is little real sense of darkness and evil in this tale of halflings and heroes. More war, less children!

149,Eldorodo,"A Real rarity, a fantasy film that isn't a B-Movie",9,10 January 2001,"From the opening scenes Willow presents a grand and epic storyline. The film places the viewer squarely in a fully realized Fantasy world, comparable (of course) to Tolkien's Lord of The Rings. The biggest draw of the film is the fact that the setting apparently contains a vast amount of history and backstory, Much like Lucas' Star Wars trilogy. Willow has potentially hundreds of years of backstory, and again, like the Star Wars trilogy, the viewer isn't bombarded with this history, it remains squarely in the background, and is barely hinted at. The cinematography is nothing short of beautiful, with lush green landscapes and beautiful imagery. Also a comment must be made on the phenomenal production design, the sets, armor, weaponry, and costumes are fantastic. In the end it provides plenty of adventure, drama, and an epic feel making it a true Hollywood rarity, a true Fantasy ""A-Movie"" in a genre filled with hack em up B-flicks. My biggest hope is that Willow soon hits DVD, now would be the perfect time to ride the wave of hype surrounding Lord Of The Rings, and garner this under-rated film a whole new audience of fans!",Willow

Jean Marsh's role as Queen Bavmorda is similar in ways that remind me somewhat of the evil queen in the Snow White story (only meaner).

This was the introduction of morphing but if the characters and the story didn't introduce the film well, the next revolution in films might not have been so magnificent but it is.The seers, capable of for telling the future discover a baby that will kill the evil queen although the baby falls into willow's hands and he must undertake a journey to protect the baby from death through trolls and dragons. The story shows that no matter how small you are, people as small as willow can achieve what giants can.This is a charming film with a good story and some great laughing moments, it is great for people for all ages though there are minor setbacks of which is shown by some of the lacking dialog and cheesy romance.

157,RokkenDokken,Willow rules!!,10,6 August 2002,"Willow is the type of film you just watch if you feel like it or not! its one of the best fantasy films you'll ever have the honour to watch! Its extremely entertaining and a joy to watch. Its also a very original and unique movie in many ways. Its a must see for everyone and anyone who likes watching great and fantastic movies. Its absolutely magnificent. You can watch it alone, you can watch it with your family and love it no matter what! When I watched it the first time I thought it was funny and exciting, just simply stupendous! I thought it was weird the way the baby in it had such good acting! I Recommended it to everyone!! Queen Bavmorda is the queen of links!!",Willow
158,joshjgs300,A Stunning 80s Epic,8,26 June 2000,"I remember seeing this film in theaters back in '88 and long to see it again on the big screen. There is a motherload of crappy fantasy flicks out there and this one is better than most. I was kinda young when I saw it and didn't find it too violent but some parents may think it gruesome at times. I myself feel that gave it an edge. Along with swordplay there are nasty trolls,a 2-headed beast,mean-spirited characters and some intense scenes at the end. Of course there are lots of special effects. This was a technically well made film with awesome cinematography and interesting locations. Every now and again Fox airs the movie but it's 2 1/2 hr running  can be really cut. Ya gotta see it!",Willow
159,g_vaccarezza,Easier to swallow and sweeter to look at than LOTR,10,14 October 2003,"This is a movie intended for younger audiences, and that shows when the dialogue and story get a little dumb at parts. However, Willow has a very magical heart and it lives up to the fantasy genre. Val Kilmer's character is a very enjoyable comic relief, with suitable great hero tones. The story is straight and easy to follow, there aren't plot twists and the line between good and evil is clearly defined.People might find the special effects a little outdated, however I think that the stop motion work and other special effects are still very enjoyable and pretty to look at. All in all, I found this movie easier to follow and ultimately more enjoyable than the Lord of the Rings. I do like the latter one, but Peter Jackson's direction stumbles quite often.Willow has a great atmosphere and gorgeous settings. The overall feel of the movie comes right out of those fantasy books we used to read when we were kids, with a strong, touching music, and enjoyable characters.Highly recommended.",Willow
160,aerochickie,A fantasy classic,10,7 April 2002,"i first saw Willow when i was 8, and although it scared me quite a bit, it remains to this day one of my favourite movies. To those who speak of the obvious similarities between Willow and LoTR, i think that it's hard not to make a fantasy movie that is entirely different from LoTR. This is simply because of how influential LoTR has been on the fantasy world.  And while there are similarities, the story of Willow is unique and has its own special charm. The weird grotesque dogs instilled a fear that no other movie quite matched, and the element of humour in Willow sets it apart from other fantasy movies.",Willow
161,Alkyran,First Fantasy Movie I fell in love with,7,11 October 2002,"Maybe it was the magical music, or the fairy-tale setting. Maybe because it was one of the first high-budget fantasy films with a magical feel in it. Maybe it was the charming swordsman (Val Kimler), the struggle against the darkness. The funny incidents occurring to the wandering halfling. The mystical fairies and brownies. Whatever it was I can still sit back and enjoy this film even if I see it for a 1000th time.",Willow
162,sences,Better than Lord of the Rings,8,24 November 2003,"I Like it mor than lord of the rings because it's in one part and not in three parts so you have to buy everything. The world of Willow looks like the world of Lord of the Rings. With Dwarfs, trolls, magicians,... And the story is never boring, always action, with one mission, see that the child can stop the evil queen Bavmorda. Perfect story for younger people to. It all looks realistic for being made in 1988.",Willow
163,thatherodotcom,an entertaining fantasy classic,8,19 February 2004,"Well, it can't compete very well with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but for what it is Willow will always be a classic. The story is pretty straightforward but keeps you interested in what will happen next, and Val Kilmer plays an extremely funny and likeable hero. While not a comedy, many parts of this movie are super funny without wrecking the flow of things at all. The special effects are dated but still decent even by today's standards; again, their age takes nothing from the believableness of the movie. If you like fantasy films you can't do a whole lot better than Willow. What else could you expect from Ron Howard and George Lucas?",Willow

A whole new fairy tale world has been created that you feel really exists. I like that there is not just this story, but background stories as well: how do Madmartigan and Airk know each other? What was Fin Raziel's life like before she was transformed, how do people in Willow's village live their lifes? And the brownies? There are enough hooks to start a new story, but unfortunately no sequel has been made. In contrary to the Star Wars films. I would have preferred Willow 2,3 4 and more.",Willow

169,nassty_hobbitses9,Too cute!,7,19 June 2005,"Oh dear, this movie was too cute! I just melt over little people, and Willow waddling around clutching a baby over half his size just made me wanna go ""aaaaaaww!"" As coming from the age of CG and multi-million dollar effects budgets, I suppose I have been too spoiled to complain about how absolutely TERRIBLE the effects and costumes and several of the sets were, but I stuck it in there anyway. As per the acting, I have never been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and, while he got the nutter part right on, I thought every other aspect of his character was shallow and hardly played. *SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING, ALTHOUGH NOT PLOT RELEVANT* with regards to the rather, uh, RELUCTANT romance that took place between him and Sorsha, I was practically ready to JUMP OUT THE WINDOW to make it stop- HORRIBLE. In Warwick Davis' case, although he offered more depth of character than Kilmer, I found his voice- inflection, sincerity, etc- quite unbelievable, and his face never seemed to change expressions throughout practically the whole film- but I suppose allowances must be made for his age and inexperience- he was only 18 when the film was made. Now, I don't even KNOW what actors played the little fairy sidekicks, but they cracked me up more than absolutely anything! I suppose it would be a rather diminuative experience for a male to play a fairy, but they seemed to genuinely have fun doing it, and it showed.But oh, don't even get me STARTED on the script! It may have been low-budget and from the 80's, but to me there is NEVER an excuse for having a script THAT BAD. Perhaps time has made it more acute in my memory, but somehow in my head I keep hearing Willow shouting and Madmartigan, after he just saved his tiny butt from being killed by some form of ruffian or other, ""What were you thinking?! You NEVER drive that fast with an infant!"" *shudder* I suppose I can't FULLY blame Kilmer- I think Denzel Washington would be hard pressed with a script like that.When it came to aspects such as cinematography and music, there was nothing special or out of the ordinary. I also quite enjoyed the fact that all the outdoor scenes were actually OUT DOORS, something that was not done far too often in the 80's and earlier.While, from a critical and technical point of view this movie is nothing too great, it gets all its points on sheer charm and the genuine enjoyment one gets from such an innocent, sweet movie. Certainly more enjoyable if you're watching it with a bunch of your like-minded female friends, and a GREAT summer movie. Now, I know loyal fans will absolutely KILL me for saying this, but I really do hope someone will a remake of this film, with minimal to no plot changes, updated effects and IMPROVED script. The only problem with remakes is that you can't use the same actors, and that to me is the greatest loss.All around: Definitely worth seeing as it is pretty much a classic, and definitely more worth it with your friends.",Willow

173,jason_hille,Lord of the Rings Comedy,9,16 April 2006,"When I first saw this movie, I was 8 years old. I've always been intrigued with the idea of a magical world in which even the smallest of creatures can become heroes.Warwick Davis (Willow Ufgood) was what we commonly refer to now as a Hobbits of the Shire. In many ways, this movie reminded me of a comedic portrayal of some side story from The Lord of the Rings (but with far less people). The story line is fantastic, on key, and non-stop.Val Kilmer couldn't have played the role any better. His antics were fun and timeless. My favorite being the fairy dust which causes all kinds of problems with the ""love"" thing.Jean Marsh and Joanne Whalley (Queen and Daughter) were picked to match, but personalities clashed. It actually made sense to put these two in one room because there are times when you understand the clash.Over all, an excellent movie if you're tired of all the bloody happy-go-lucky endings of Lord of the Rings. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat while laughing! Enjoy",Willow

The main villains are a mortal version of Skeletor & a female Mum-ra to boot. Yes it rips off better & worse fantasy predecessors, but makes those themes it's own, landing somewhere near the top of the great 80s fantasy wave.

175,shizaquawn,"Wow. The most fun I've had with a movie, probably ever ...",10,25 October 2006,"I attended a screen writing class once, and the teacher said that the worst movie ever made was ""Willow"" ... he also defended ""White Chicks"" (in the same class) as being some sort of underrated theatrical gem.What an idiot. Obviously, this man has no soul.Anyway, it must have been this sort of ""I'm too good for that"" attitude that killed ""Willow"" in the theaters. I remember seeing previews for it when I was a kid, and there was nothing more in the world that I had wanted to watch. I was raised on ""The Neverending Story,"" ""Legend,"" ""Krull,"" ""The Beastmaster,"" and ""The Dark Crystal."" So, sure, I loved fantasy. It was my favorite genre. And even though many will say that ""Lord of the Rings"" is better, I have to disagree. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a good melding of drama, real-life struggle and fantasy, but's it not fun to watch. ""Willow,"" on the other hand, is a blast to watch.The music from Horner's great ... I can still whistle the adventure theme song, and often do sometimes. Val Kilmer as Madmartigan was a great rogue hero, who had plenty of great lines, laughs. Sorcia was by Joanne Whalley, was hot as hell ... a fiery redhead who just refused to be ordered or commanded. General Kael (who was supposedly based on one of Lucas' critics) is awesome. His look spawned an entire decade of me thinking that people with skull masks were horribly cool. The woman who played Fin Razel (sp?) was great. The Brownies were hysterical. And last but not least, give it up for Billy Barty and Warwick Davis, little people with big roles. I think little people probably thank Mr. Lucas and Ron Howard for making them stars for once, for giving them a showcase piece. Davis really had no better role in his life than this one. And he shined in it.Well, if that particular teacher is reading this by any chance, I hope you go back and re-watch this as a kid. For me, and obviously many others on this website, the movie was more than a fun, little escape ... it was almost a genre-leading film. If there's one thing that pre-prequel George Lucas was good at, it was at giving the audience a good time ... Indiana Jones, Willow, Star Wars ... the best adventure/fantasy films ever to come out. Each of them with charming heroes, obvious bad guys, magic, swords, and humor.""Pirates of the Carribbean"" resurrected this sort of cinema, I think, and the American public responded to it with verve. I still remember hard-nosed critic Lisa Schwarzbaum giving ""Pirates"" a D rating in Entertainment Weekly. I bet she about choked on her own vomit when she saw how much fun everyone had with the film.And ""Willow"" is the same thing. It's pure magic. Pure escape. Especially good for children, but good for the adults, too. If you can't have fun with this one, than you better go get your laughs from movies like ""White Chicks"" ... just don't be surprised when the kids come out making jokes about d*cks and p*ssies afterward.",Willow
176,BeamReacher,Great fantasy fun!,8,26 November 2001,"Many reviewers are trying to compare this to Lord of the Rings or Star Wars, and say that it takes itself too seriously. Well, it isn't, and it doesn't.There can only be a few archetypes. Whatever their flaws, LotR and SW stand alone. Willow isn't in their league, nor does it aspire to be. Instead, it's a lighthearted adventure in the *spirit* of Tolkein (not a rip-off, IMHO). It has its serious side, but a number of lighthearted moments that had me rolling in the aisles!I saw this during its theatrical release in '88, and not since. What surprises me is that I barely remember the supposed headliners, Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley. Can't even get a picture of their characters in my head. The evil queen was well done, but even she was more of a foil for the good guys. The ones I remember are Raziel and Willow himself. In true Tolkeinian spirit, Willow begins as an inconsequential, comedic figure, and grows in strength to embrace the task thrust on him without ever losing his identity. Very good character development!If nothing else, rent this one for the Disappearing Pig Trick. I howled with laughter!",Willow

179,SprngsEternal,Fantastical failure.,4,13 April 2014,"As a youngster, ""Willow"" was one of my absolute favorites, but with the critical perspective granted by a distance of more than 25 years, I am disappointed to find that it does not hold up in many important respects. Foremost among them, the plot bears clumsily obvious similarities to ""The Lord of the Rings"" but does not remotely approach the dimensions of its scale or sophistication. I count myself fortunate to have owned the accompanying novel (and, yes, video game) which smoothed over the film's narrative gaps and inconsistencies, highlighted details that were barely touched upon, and clarified various aspects that simply defied sense or understanding. For all those who do not benefit in like fashion, however, ""Willow"" might not make for pleasurable viewing. Though easier said than done, it probably would not have required a great deal of effort to instill the film with elements of the unique atmosphere that were present in the source material – not the ""concept"" handed down by George Lucas, but the story as detailed and elaborated upon by the actual screenwriter, Bob Dolman, and adapted into book form by Wayland Drew – thereby making it into something that could stand on its own throughout the years.I imagine Warwick Davis was grateful for the chance to shed the ratty pelt of Wicket the Ewok in his first major role. Yet the primary arc of Willow Ufgood's development – gaining confidence through the mastery of magic – is not altogether convincing, let alone substantial, enough to make for a dynamic, engaging, or ultimately satisfying character. His fundamental passivity, intractable aversion to risk, and persistent lack of self-determination hardly recommends him as a figure worthy of respect, all of which necessarily interferes with the sort of personal identification that would otherwise result in catharsis by journey's end. In general, the Nelwyns are rendered in a manner that is rather precious and patronizing for my taste – inviting comparisons to the Munchkins in ""The Wizard of Oz"": ""They're people, too... but aren't they just the dearest little things?"" This works against them being taken seriously, and even goes so far as to undermine their dignity.Val Kilmer's portrayal of Madmartigan is often stilted, artificial, and smirkingly insincere. I had trouble detecting any trace of authentic nobility at his core. As a consequence, the path of redemption he travels from dissolute scoundrel to manifest hero does not feel organic, let alone honest. To say that I loathe Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton as the Brownies is an understatement of the most egregious sort. Not unlike the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi"", the leaden hijinks of these vile faeries are a heavy-handed means of providing ""comic relief"" in order to keep the kiddies distracted. I recall their nauseating banter induced me to eye-rolling contempt at ten years of age, and it has not acquired any charm with the passage of time. In a similar respect, the talent of Patricia Hayes (while hardly evident here) as Fin Raziel is squandered in a series of animal voices that are perhaps intended to be ""cute"" but instead come across as shrill, particularly on those numerous occasions when she upbraids Willow for his shortcomings (pun intended) as a sorcerer. This inevitably detracts from Raziel's one-note authority – to say nothing of her simple likability – in human form. Jean Marsh, on the other hand, is a genuine delight in her campy but nonetheless menacing turn as Queen Bavmorda. Nobody would begrudge the inimitable Billy Barty the fun he is clearly having in his brief appearances as the crotchety High Aldwin. And even without displaying much range, Pat Roach is well-used as the brutish General Kael; at least here he is given a chance to talk, as opposed to his high-profile though mute role in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".By far, the most outstanding performances, in my opinion, are given by characters with mere minutes of screen time, one of whom almost has no speaking lines to her credit, which makes her accomplishment in this regard all the more impressive: Zulema Dene as Ethna, the nursemaid who spirits the newborn child of prophecy, Elora Danan, out of Bavmorda's grasp and sets the events of our story in motion; and Julie Peters as Kiaya, Willow's wife (the touching scene in which she gives him a braided lock of her hair always brings a tear to my eye).The actors' accents are literally all over the map. Fight scenes are risible in their staged fakery. Production design is stylistically chaotic (e.g., the Nockmaar army looks more like a rag-tag band of mercenaries than an unstoppable kingdom-conquering force). The special effects, innovative if not ground-breaking for their time, now seem antiquated, and so the film, being heavily dependent upon them, loses some of its appeal as a result. Conversely, the beautiful score by James Horner – unfairly burdened by having to compensate for the frequent inadequacy of script, direction, and performance to heft their share of the film's emotional weight – retains the full measure of its stirring quality after more than two decades of repeated viewing, and has become one of the main reasons I continue to watch ""Willow"".Although formulating this thought feels like an act of betrayal to the child I once was – and, to an extent, still am – I have at last determined that ""Willow"" fails to meet the most fundamental objective of all such work in the category to which it purportedly belongs: providing a rich, immersive, self-contained, internally coherent, personally relevant and meaningful fantasy-adventure experience. This is not to say the film is entirely without merit; indeed, in the final analysis, perhaps it is better than it has any right to be. Any enjoyment I derive from watching it, however, is propelled in no small part at this late remove by the momentum of nostalgia. Insofar as I am concerned, ""Willow"" is entertaining, but nothing more profound than that.",Willow

183,BlueCorsair,A very well done fantasy flick,10,5 December 2006,"Being a university history major, trained to examine documents and videos for hidden meanings, and imbued with a skeptical and analytical mind, one might expect that someone like me wouldn't appreciate this kind of film. It's one dimensional, it plays on typical fantasy stereotypes, and it doesn't really have anything that previous fantasy films didn't except for... style.Yes, I consider this a stylish film. Mostly because even after 'growing up', I can still watch this film and be as wrapped up in the story and characters as I was when I was a little boy. It's formulaic plot and generally one-dimensional characters are a large part of that reason - the film makes no pretensions of being something it isn't. It's honest, a quality lacking in so very many films these days which seem to be produced only to suit the latest fashion.The characters are all well acted - there's no ham acting to be found here in my opinion. Clearly, the actors had fun with the roles and gave them as much life as they could. Madmartigan is man with a dark past, clearly an anti-hero redeemed by the end of the film. Airk, the 'good' general is everything one expects in a 'knight in shining armor' - chivalrous, dedicated, brave. Bavmorda is the quintessential 'wicked witch', scheming, maniacal, obsessed with power. It is these characters that play so well into the average person's conception of fantasy fare that is precisely what makes the film a success - it entertains us because it knows what we like, and what we expect to see, and then delivers it with action and a bombastic musical score.Critics panned it for being unoriginal, but being original wasn't the point of this movie. The point was to entertain, to make us thrill to a tale of high adventure of dragons, of far away lands, of swords and sorcery. On this account, no other fantasy film (with the possible exception of Conan the Barbarian) has ever done this so exceedingly well.",Willow

It's got everything ones needs from a family friendly fantasy film; dazzling sword fights, amazing sorcery, cure babies, whirlwind romances, good witches, bad witches, very tiny people and slightly larger small people, faeries and fairy dust, do I need to say more, it's even got some sort of dragon/hydra thingie!!",Willow
185,surfscoter,Before LotR there was Willow,7,16 April 2005,"This is one of my favorite fantasy films of all time! For some reason I know a lot of people that think very poorly of it simply because it leans so closely on the Lord of the Rings -small person ventures out in the big man's world to bring a prophecised baby to defeat the evil queen, aided by a sorceress and a lone fighter... It's true, you have to acknowledge the similarities, but this movie came out long before anyone had even thought of a decent LotR-film, and Lucas has managed to paraphrase the story very well. There is a true grandeur and a feeling of magic of adventure throughout the movie that is just thrilling. All performances are nicely done, and the casting is great -always had a soft spot for Kilmer, who just rules as MadMartigan. I think what makes this film truly great, however, is that it combines the scope of a contemporary blockbuster-fantasy, with that pleasant, happy feel you get from the old time greats. It's good solid entertainment and adventure all the way, and deserves more attention within the genre than I feel it gets these days!",Willow

It has nothing to do with the way it ends and about everyone knows it before it come, the most important thing is seeing you in the role of the main characters, this is the most important thing on that film. (Excuse my english. Thanks).",Willow

193,geckopsych,Under-rated adventure,9,17 August 2002,This often overlooked tale of a struggle between good and evil in an alternative magical medieval world has a lot to recomend it.  The acting is unusually refined and sensitive; unlike the usual high-school dropout characterizations of heros in fantasy adventures.  The heroic little-people family is one that the viewer can actually care about.  The magic effects are spectacular and Val Kilmer plays a comic scoundrel as good as Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice.,Willow
194,2many4me,"Warwick Davis is a cult Character, Great Movie!",10,21 August 2000,"This Is a classic, and a must see for all Star Wars Fans, along with Troops and Labyrinth, Adventure doesn't come any better than this, and the the quote ""help I'm drowning - wait BEER!"" is a memorable one that could be on a top 100 quote list.",Willow
195,tessa_brucebrown,An Excellent Film,10,12 November 2000,"I have loved this movie from the time I was five years old; I'm now 17 and my affection for it has only grown.  It's brilliantly acted and very well written.  It has a sense of humour without taking away from the plot.  It is at least as good as the original Star Wars; a true epic fantasy film.  It is the perfect movie for both children and adults; my parents enjoy it just as much as I do.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an imagination; if you're don't have one, this probably isn't the movie for you.",Willow
196,sterlingpryce,Charming and ageless,10,6 March 2019,"He effects are more than special, the set-pieces suitably epic but it just doesn't fulfill the promise of certain other fantasy films. Val is always a pleasure to watch. George Lucas tried the trick again in 1988, this time producing Ron Howard's fantasy flick, which both filled a large, LOTR-shaped gap. American eBox is where I watched this flick while managing ecommerce returns to UK which was the ideal location for a Star Wars inspired super flick.",Willow
197,ChipFio,"An excellent movie with a great blend of fantasy, drama & comedy",10,27 February 2001,"To me, this movie is a classic story of good vs evil with beautiful scenery in a familiar storyline for all audiences.Ron Howard has done an excellent job portraying a world of fantasy with swords and sorcery as well as adding in some humor.I cannot say that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, but it is one of my all time favorites anyway.",Willow
198,jcassell-88962,The best family adventure film ever made.,10,18 October 2020,One of my all time adventure films. For me it never gets old. I hope that the rumored series will come into fruition.,Willow
199,IsabelNecessaryOnABike,A Great Film,10,19 June 2006,"I love this film. The music composed by James Horner is fantastic, the plot is excellent. A 17 year old Warkick Davis(Willow Ufgood) steals the show in this film. It is a good story written by George Lucas of how even the smallest person can make the biggest difference. This film has some brilliant special effects which are not computer generated and are done the old fashioned way which probably took along time to do.Val Kilmer(Madmartigan) in this film is very amusing because he does not get many opportunities to play these types of characters.This is my favourite film directed by Ron Howard, I urge you to watch this film and i hope you enjoy it as much as I did. A great film for kids and big kids.",Willow
200,bound_and_gagged,Break out the grog and let's pillage!!!,10,19 May 2001,"This movie among the likes of Krull, Sword and the Sorccerer, and Conan follow a simple rule of many weapons, many monsters, many effects cheasy or otherwise, women with a well built chest, men with a well built chest, major or minor womanizing. One end all evil being or witch, several companions both annoying and useful. Horses, spirits, a drunken scene, and magic. Thus making Willow possibly one the greates fantasy films of our time if not one of the greatest films in general. And slapping Lucas on the credits doesn't hurt. Sure the cliches shine like Patrick Stewarts head but that's the beuaty you get what you came for swordplay and magic, with beautiful woman and midgets. In some cases midget sized midgets. The apple to bird to pooping on people scene is worth the price alone as is the baby vomit, has there ever been a movie in which a man holding a baby he didn't want doesn't get spewed on? Also bobsleding on a shield, a chase scene on a horse cart, the word ""peck"". The oh so annoying wisecracking sidekick brownies. This movie is a gem is has everything one looks for and yet it doesn't make you feel like you've seen it all before. Val Kilmer and Johanne Whaley ignite sparks with there on screen charisma harking back to days of Grant and Hepburn. If want a good ol no brainer party flick this is definitely one to watch and one to cherish as one of the greatest films ever put to celluloid.",Willow
201,asphyxiate69,Loved it.,10,8 July 2001,"I loved this movie immensely, even though I was only 3 when it was released. But I am a sucker for anything fantasy.  But it lived up to it's expectations.  Even though I have not seen alot of good fantasy movies.  I have read alot of the best fantasy.  TLOTR, Wheel Of Time etc.....And this movie has IMO done well against classics like that.",Willow
202,hannah_gorman-1,Fun film to watch again!,8,2 May 2010,"I haven't watched this film for a long time I decided to get it on DVD as it was so cheap and I was very pleasantly surprised! It's a great adventure fantasy film and brought back some good memories. Val Kilmer is brilliant in his role as Mad Mordigan - I love his character. The locations for the scenes are really good too, however the special effects such as the gigantic troll monster creature were very dated. The trolls themselves were actually a little scary as were the dog/wolf creatures, they might frighten younger children. Jean Marsh is good as the evil queen; she is very good in dark roles like in Return to Oz as Mombi. Overall a very enjoyable film to watch, I didn't get bored at all or switch off as it is full of action the whole way through and definitely worth the money!!",Willow
203,m_wibble,A really enjoyable fun magical film!,8,10 March 2007,As I child I loved this film and I still do! It is very good. A real fun and charming movie. It is a real magical treat! Warwick Davis is acting ability very good. He really shows the range of his acting ability in this film! The stunts are really professionally done. The film is full of action and adventure. It is a great journey movie. It is also very funny film. The film has a simple yet effective message of anyone can make a difference no matter your size. There are similaries to Lord of the Rings which I feel are not real issues. They are similaries stories in the way the character have to go on a long journey like in the Wizards of Oz. The Star Wars similaries if there are any are very clear. Star wars is futuristic where as Williow is a fantasy.,Willow
204,noelharnett,"Enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight.",6,20 December 2001,"Willow is a fun movie. It will keep you entertained for it's duration, and you'll be smiling and humming afterwards. But you'll probably not remember why after an hour or two.Its a standard fantasy romp, a cross between Star Wars and the Hobbit. The main actors are fine in their roles - they do they job, though only barely in places. While not strictly a children's movie, it will be enjoyed most by the young - but there are probably too many ""scary parts"" for the very young.",Willow
205,crustynick,Effect's rule in Lucas/Howard fantasy comedy.,10,27 February 2002,"Before Lucas there was darkness all around in the special effect's galaxy, and then came industrial light and magic. Before Willow the only way to change a goat into an ostrich was film overlay or the painfully slow process of stop motion, Willow changed all that in the marvelous scene in which Willow morphes Finn Raziel from goat to human visiting many other incarnations on the way. For this history making scene Willow should be high up on any fantasy fans list of favourites. The script aint bad and the acting is ok (I love Kilmer and Whalleys falling in love scene)but the only real stars of this movie were the never seen before out of this world(for there day) special effects If you ever have a spare evening and you have never seen Willow its well worth a visit.",Willow
206,jfuji,Pivotal,10,26 January 2003,"As with all of George Lucas' films this one starts a great story. Ron Howard weaves the scenes into a huge tapestry of light and dark. It is a film of contrasts: size, goodness and evilness. The effect scenes add to the story and do not become the focus. Asking ""How did they do that?"" doesn't occur because you are immersed in the story so deep you Belive.",Willow
207,Znakez,A very underestimated movie,10,16 October 2002,"This is a movie that to me is a mystery. I mean, if LOTR causes a smaller fever, then why did this one pass so quitely?Actually, there are many similarities to LOTR, the ring is in this movie a wonder child, that still can't walk... Cross LOTR with Mose (the guy with the ten commandments :)) and you know pretty well what to expect.Add dwarfs, brownies, warriors and fairies, and you know even better. In my opinion, are you a fan of fantasy and against all odds did miss this one, take a look. Actually, this is a movie that hardly no one can resist.A hot tip, buy the Special Edition DVD, and see and learn the first morph ever occur!",Willow
208,john012,The starting was great but not the finishing.,7,3 December 2009,"Nothing else to say....my title said it all. But considering the fact that it was a 1988 movie and the director was young enough.....this could be forgiven. Still, I am disappointed with the Hollywood director. They start everything well but after some chapters, they just get lost with the reality and flow of the story. This is so embarrassing. They should be more careful about what they are creating...not creating, but producing. The characters were good. I liked the 'Bad Martigan'....but the princess and the witch was poor considering the reality of the situation. They acted poor and the dialogues made their character poorer. Beside these, the overall performance was good.Good movie to watch and to enjoy.",Willow
209,rrwalton,Such a wonderful film!,10,9 June 2021,"I was reminded again of this movie by all things through a stray kitten we've adopted.I named HIM 'Willow'.It's such a beautiful, and in my opinion genderless, name. I've had to defend my choice a few times, so I always refer folks back to this movie.My best friend and I saw it in the theatre when it first released and it was absolutely fantastic. I'm 55 this year, and have many, MANY theatre experiences under my belt. This is the only movie I've ever seen that received a standing ovation... and I'm not exaggerating.Standing.Ovation.And I saw the original theatre release of the first (4th in chronology) 'Star Wars'.",Willow
210,pinkbabe126,"It made me cry, it was so bad!",1,21 November 2004,"it was one of the worst movies i had ever seen! it took parts from a bunch of different fantasy/myths and put them together (baby floating down the river... moses) i would rate it 1/10 or less! the only people who would like it were people who were raised on Disney sequels. They used the skull mask right out of star wars. everything was so predictable. near the end, my family and i were sitting on the couch and explaining exactly what was going to happen next! we were right! how could the producer of of star wars let such a bad movie come out under his name?!? there were so many holes in the movie. one time there was a woman wrapped in a jacket. the next time you see her she's in a white dress. the only thing that made it bearable to watch was the adorable baby. The best actor in the movie was the baby!",Willow
211,Stephskitz,This has been my favorite movie since I was 3 years old!!,10,18 January 2005,"This movie is special to me, it is the very first movie I ever watched and owned!! It came out the year I was born. My mom used to watch it non-stop when she was pregnant with me. So I guess I have an unexplainable connection to it. But what can I say, it is one awesome movie. But a movie from such a great directer as Ron Howard it is obvious it is great. The characters and their personality's are so incredible. They definitely did great casting for this movie, I mean Val Kilmer did a great job at portraying Madmartigan, and there couldn't have been a better pick than Warwick Davis for the role of Willow. Joanne Whalley was also great as Sorsha in the beginning you love to hate her, but when she falls in love with Madmartigan, you just plain love her. Willow is outstanding in so many ways. It is and will always be my favorite movie.",Willow

It's a very well made movie, It has a good simple story, plenty of action, humor, and some romance. I also enjoyed the actors (Val Kilmers best role I seen him in) and the locations they chose for the movie were beautiful. Even though the special effects might be little out of date and some of the jokes might not be that funny. An I felt it needed a least 10 or 15 more minutes for the ending. I still enjoy it every time I watch it and it's a great movie for kids and adults. On my opinion every one should have this in there collection, because it is a classic. 10 out of 10.",Willow

This movie is so wild, it is so dark yet so light at the same time. I have no idea how this movie is rated pg. While watching this I couldn't help but feel like i was watching a lord of the rings movie. But this movie was so much more it made me laugh and the fight scenes were amazing. Definitely can tell some cgi screens but over all I loved this movie. I am definitely going to force my friends to watch this.",Willow

217,ilikebeatles,"avoid this movie--save money, time, and sanity!!!",1,28 February 2006,"--MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!-- George Lucas was involved in this movie. George Lucas created the horrible Star Wars. 'Nuff said.Willow is a terrible movie about a terrible, overconfident magic trick/pseudo-sorcerer Willow, who believes that, although he cannot even perform simple ""Disappearing Pig Tricks"" he is the most magic-knowing person in the universe. Anyway, his annoying kids discover a full-sized baby (Willow's village is Nelwyn, meaning dwarfs live there) in a river, and Willow decides to keep it. But he can't, because evil queen Bavmorda wants to kill the baby and she needs to be taken to safety with the Big People *gasp!*. and so, willow sets off with a few useless sub-characters. so, he meets cross-dressing soldier Madmartigan (who lives up to the 1st three letters of his name EXTREMELY well)and gives him the kid. But, Maddy is irresponsible and a glowing fairy lady decides that baby (Elora, we find is baby's name) wants WILLOW to save her (for reasons still unknown to this day)! and so, willow and Maddy set off with baby to a magical place that they assume will *somehow* be safe for Elora (even though Bavmorda seems to be a queen who rules the entire world..hmm), Tir Asleen. But, alas, it's not. and so, Maddy fights trolls and dark armies whilst willow *tries* to cast spells (and fails miserably, just like this movie...hmm...). anyhow, in the end (not to spoil it anymore), willow and co. succeed, Maddy & evil queen's daughter fall in love (wtf??) and it turns out THEY will care for Elora! meanwhile, the audience sits and thinks of all the wonderful things they could've done in lieu of watching this movie. :( willow, the character, being as well the ""hero"", causes this movie to fall into galloping ruin. because he seems to be the ""hero"", the fact that he doesn't actually DO anything but wave a stick around, chant words, and frown when he fails, placing him as the title character has NO POINT! and neither does watching this movie-it will just rile you up, confuse you, and make you pound the nearest hard surface with anger while crying ""MAKE IT STOP!!!"" so save your time, money and sanity, go rent lord of the rings or the princess bride. you'll be glad you did.",Willow
218,iwatchtoomanymovies,good movie,9,3 March 2006,"i like this movies story, its very harmless, and easy to watch. most fantasy movies are hard to catch on to, while this one is very easy to grasp and watch. there is nothing too lewd about this movie to make it where you would want to hide the young ones. even as an older viewer, i find that there are many parts to this movie that are good simple fun. Ron howard and george lucas definitely need to make more films like this, unlike lucas's starwars Christmas special (lemon). each role seems to be so perfectly filled in this movie that its almost like the story was written to be acted by the people that were selected for the parts that they filled",Willow

I can't stress enough how much you have to see this film! Willow is a great fantasy film, as a child it just captures your imagination and transports you to a different world. I don't wanna give anything away because i don't wanna spoil it 4 anyone but this film has romance, comedy, adventure.. something for everybody. The effects could be better but it was made in the 80s! Also, Val Kilmer is disturbingly attractive in this film! If you like this film then try watching other quirky 80s fantasy films such as 'Labyrinth' and 'legend'",Willow
