0,MartinHafer,"Just like other versions of the book, don't expect it to be THAT close to the original story",9,4 January 2008,"Generally, I am a real purist when it comes to movies made from books. In practically every case (with an exception being PATRIOT GAMES), the books are better or at least I can't stop myself from unfavorably comparing the movie to the book. This was certainly true of the three other versions I've already seen of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. However, since this is a musical version and it was so lovely, I found myself able to let go of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Weber completely screwed up the book. It was a great book, but this is still a great film.Unfortunately, while I can compare this film to the book, I cannot compare it to the play as I still haven't seen it. Fortunately, the songs have remained pretty much intact from the play and the only major changes, so I've been told, are the sets.As far as the movie goes, the songs are amazing and lovely. While I am not a huge fan of musicals, I couldn't help but fall in love with the lovely songs. In particular, the actress who played Christine had an almost angelic voice and I adored every times she sang. Also, the choreography and sets were just magnificent--perfect in every way. While I loved the role played by Minnie Driver, I also read that her singing was dubbed---too bad, I would like to have heard her voice as I read she COULD sing. Maybe singing badly like the part demanded was beyond her capacity.About the only negative I can think of is the finale--where you see the Phantom's face revealed for the first time. Despite living in hiding all those years, he only looked as if he had a bad case of acne!! What a letdown--but otherwise, it's a lovely and worthwhile film--even if, like me, you're not a huge fan of musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Lavishly-designed, with wonderful music!",8,17 June 2009,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage hit is given justice in this sumptuous film version, that benefits from stunning sets and extravagant costumes, making the attention to detail evident here. Joel Schummacher's direction is very good in this film, it is hard to believe that this is the same director who directed the disastrous Batman and Robin. The music is just wonderful, with dark and poignant melodies and motifs that fit the very dark story, not to mention sad. People have complained that the film has too much music, almost all of it is sung, but it is a musical, set in an opera house bear in mind. The performances are excellent, Gerard Butler quite terrifying as Phantom, and Emmy Rosum as beautiful as ever as Christine. I liked the performances of Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver(as Carlotta). The film does have some truly sad moments, like Christine at the grave yard and of course the heart-rending ending, though I didn't understand it when I first saw it. My only complaints are that the film is a little too long, and also in Angel of Music particularly, there were times when the lips of the actors weren't in time with the singing. Apart from these flaws, a truly beautiful film, one that is dark and sad, and one that is once seen never-forgotten. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",The Phantom of the Opera
2,Leofwine_draca,A pretty good musical adaptation for the screen,6,12 October 2016,"There have been many versions of the Phantom story over the years, some great, some not so good. This one is slightly different in that it's a film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, rather than being just another remake or version of the Gaston Leroux novel. I enjoy watching musicals from time to time and I have to say I liked this one. Obviously the quality of the songs is what makes a good musical and they're all absolutely fine here, with some wonderful breathtaking moments dotted throughout the lengthy production.Joel Schumacher can be a hit and miss director, but he seems to have come on more strongly in the past decade, counting PHONE BOOTH and 8MM among his successes. This is one of his better films, a fine adaptation that makes good use of the genuine vocal talent of the leading actors and actresses. Emmy Rossum is astonishing as Christine, and she's ably matched by Gerard Butler as the Phantom; this is Butler in a star-making role, and very good he does too. Some overbearing supporting actresses flesh out the cast – Minnie Driver, Jennifer Ellison – while Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds have a fine comedy double act although they just kind of disappear towards the end of the movie.The film is shot through with Gothic sensibility and makes repeated use of beautiful visuals. The scene in the snowy graveyard is a highlight and of course the catacomb climax is another strong element. Complaints were made that the costumes were toned down for the movie but I can understand this; the camera's close up to the action rather than sitting away like an audience and bright red hats and skull masks would have become a distraction unlike in the theatre. In all, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a solid musical and a film I enjoyed.",The Phantom of the Opera
3,SnoopyStyle,Emmy Rossum shows her singing,6,8 February 2015,"It's 1919 Paris. The crumbling Opera House holds an auction and an elderly Viscount Raoul de Chagny attends. The chandelier is raised and the movie flashes back to 1870 with the opera house in its prime. Richard Firmin (Ciarán Hinds) and Gilles André (Simon Callow) are the new owners. Carlotta Giudicelli (Minnie Driver) is the demanding diva of the show. Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) introduces her daughter Meg (Jennifer Ellison)'s friend Christine Daaé (Emmy Rossum). Raoul (Patrick Wilson) is surprised by his childhood friend Christine's performance at the opera. She believes her father sent a spirit ""Opera Ghost"" (Gerard Butler) to watch over her. The Ghost sends a letter demanding Christine be the lead. After Carlotta Giudicelli gets embarrassed, she quits and Christine is picked as the new lead.This is a melodramatic opera and the movie is no different. It doesn't have enough tension but I don't expect it to be. Joel Schumacher doesn't help and adds nothing to Andrew Lloyd Webber's work. The guys valiantly try to do their best theatrical singing. Butler is not particularly good. On the other hand, Emmy Rossum shows her superior singing and also shows some acting ability. She's probably the only saving grace for this movie. The movie just doesn't get beyond the opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
4,Hitchcoc,Better than you think,8,15 March 2006,"I have seen it on stage a couple times. I know that critics don't like Andrew Lloyd Weber. There is this automatic response to anything he does. I know that there are some better musicals. I know there is better music. But I feel that you can fool some of the people, but not for as long as people say he has. He has presented wonderful stories, created very memorable music. The first time I heard the music from ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was when the Cadets of Bergen Country, a nationally known drum corps, used it for their field show. I thought, ""What is that music?"" Since then, I've been in love with this show. Granted, both stage shows work better than this movie (although the opening credits deserve their own place--they are awesome), it still captures much of the romance of the play. Some of the scenes away from the opera house and away from the sewers take a bit of the original punch out of the movie. The singers are not as strong. This always amazes me. I would think that singing would take precedence over acting. There must be some wonderful people out there. But they are not terrible. And the music wins out in the end.",The Phantom of the Opera
5,Prismark10,The music of the night,6,6 October 2018,"Joel Schumacher brings Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical to the screen.The film starts off in 1919 Paris as an auction is held for the artefacts of the old Opera House before the audience goes back to its heyday in 1870.It is a dazzling, kinetic opening as the chandelier is raised and the new owners of the opera house placate the opera diva as the previous owner rushes off to Australia.The opera house is overseen by an opera ghost, who is in reality the twisted, demented Phantom (Gerard Butler.) He does not think much of the voice of the diva Carlotta Giudicelli (Minnie Driver) but enchanted by the talents of Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum.)Christine is pursued by the wealthy patron of the opera house Raoul (Patrick Wilson) who knew Christine from childhood. His relationship with Christine drives the Phantom in a fury.Butler is just too young to be the Phantom. The film was too long and needed to be shortened to make it more snappy. As the film went on it was a bit overripe and ponderous.During the first hour it was a compelling musical adaptation. The biggest problem I realised was that outside of its few famous show tunes, it was not that much of an interesting musical.",The Phantom of the Opera
6,claudio_carvalho,Awesome Movie,10,30 July 2005,"I have just watched this awesome movie on DVD, and I deeply regret that I did not see it in the movie theaters. The cinematography, the music, the art direction, the direction, the cast, the screenplay, the special effects, everything works perfectly in this wonderful musical. I was amazed with the magnificent voices of Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson. I am a fan of the underrated actor Gerard Butler, and I was really impressed with the tune of his powerful voice, showing that he is not only a great actor, but also a fantastic singer. I have never had the chance of watching the play, which has never been presented in my country, and I have many DVDs, VHSs and CDs of Sarah Brightman and the music of Andrew Lloyd Weber, but this stunning movie superseded my best expectations. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Fantasma da Ópera""(""The Phantom of the Opera"")",The Phantom of the Opera
7,lee_eisenberg,"suffers the same problem as Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" and Kenneth Branagh's ""Frankenstein""",4,28 October 2006,"First, I should admit that I've never seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version of Gaston Leroux's novel. Prior to having seen this version, I'd only seen the 1943 version starring Claude Rains as the title character (although some people may also count Brian DePalma's ""Phantom of the Paradise""). So there may be a question as to how qualified I am to review a movie version of Webber's play.Well, what I can say is that this ""Phantom of the Opera"" has the same problem as Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" and Kenneth Branagh's ""Frankenstein"": excessive emphasis on lavish sets. Whereas previous versions have maintained a sense of humility, this one suffers under its own pomp. It certainly has its visuals - I will admit that Emmy Rossum looks mighty fine in some of those dresses - but that's about it.If the movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it adds something new to the story: the whole sequence set in 1919. Then again, that could have been something from the play. I don't actually know. But my overall recommendation is to stick with the 1943 version, and with ""Phantom of the Paradise"". You'll have a much better experience.",The Phantom of the Opera
8,jboothmillard,The Phantom of the Opera,4,14 February 2008,"Based on the stage show by Lord Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber (creator of Cats, Jesus Christ Superstar and Joseph) and directed by Joel Schumacher (Falling Down), I was hoping this to be a little better, but it wasn't completely rubbish. Basically at the French Opera Populaire house the manager has left and been replaced. They are having problems though with the leading diva refusing to perform, due to the mysterious Phantom (300's Gerard Butler). Eventually the new diva Christine (Golden Globe nominated Emmy Rossum) meets this man in person, and he is obviously in love with her. The rest of the story is mainly The Phantom demanding an opera for him, trying to get Christine to love him, showing his deformed face behind that white mask, and an ending of despair (that I can't remember). Also starring Patrick Wilson as Vicompte Raoul De Chagny, Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, Ciarán Hinds as Richard Firmin, Simon Callow as Gilles Andre, Victor McGuire as Piangi, Brookside's Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry, Murray Melvin as Reyer and James Fleet as Lefevre. To be honest, the only memorable song for me was ""The Phantom of the Opera"", which before this I saw Rhydian on The X Factor perform (he was great), the rest of the film isn't really my thing. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Song for ""Learn To Be Lonely"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Okay!",The Phantom of the Opera
9,ma-cortes,Superb but overlong Andrew Lloyd Webber musicalization of the Phantom by Gaston Leroux,6,2 February 2007,"The film illustrates segments of the well- known story about a phantom by staging sets, sumptuous Opera and drama to go along with the soundtrack.It concerns a deformed young(Gerard Butler)living into the sewers underneath of the Paris Opera House.He falls in love with a secondary chorus dancer called Christine(Emmy Rossum).Worshopping the young soprano he's demanding to the proprietaries that be given her the main roles substituting to lead singer(Minnie Driver),being terrorized the rest Opera.But Christine finds her childhood acquaintance(Patrick Wilson) who is now Opera's owner and she falls in love with him.The disfigured phantom is jealous and decides to abduct her and jail her in his lair.This lavish adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical is exuberant and stylishly staged with clever musical dance involving the classic story.It's an elaborated version but also plodding and with only occasional moments of terror.Overabundance of singing hurts this otherwise good musical remake of Phantom of Opera though remains enjoyable and fresh.Production values is high with overwhelming sets by Anthony Pratt and colorful cinematography by John Mathieson.As pageant,it works although there is no emotional center ,leaving the spectator aloof from its leading characters.Acting is great ,strong presence Gerard Butler who brings stunningly to life the disfigured young with scarred countenance.Emily Rossoun is charming ,she parades and sings well enough along with Patrick Wilson .The motion picture is deftly rendered by Joel Schumacher with grateful direction by way of some fine performances and songs especially by protagonist trio.The timeless Gaston Leroux novel has been smashing success in every form in which it has been presented as stage as cinema.",The Phantom of the Opera
10,moonspinner55,Romance in a musical hyperbole...,5,8 April 2006,"The long-awaited film-adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Broadway success comes to the screen encumbered, with sets, actors and the story narrative squeezed together. The opening moments at the Parisian opera house in 1870 are terribly hectic, with Minnie Driver way over-the-top as a diva soprano, but about 20 minutes into the picture the plot-pieces fall into place, and this is where director Joel Schumacher can't possibly go wrong. With the pretty new soprano and the opera house's ""ghost"" quickly enamored of and inspired by each other, the film is able to rest on the old story structure, and even Schumacher eases up a bit on the razzle-dazzle (although sometimes the music is keyed-up for no reason, with awful ""rock"" interludes). Stealing from other visual sources (like Jean Cocteau), derivative Schumacher nearly turns this ""Phantom"" into a disaster, with a prologue that is too obtuse and a fawning male lover who is too contemporary. But the opening shot with the photograph and the lead performances are quite lovely. Gerard Butler is a younger, robustly handsome Phantom with a bit of a bottom-lip drawl, yet he's just what's needed, and you can believe a young woman like Emmy Rossum might be infatuated with him (her shifting of affections towards the kid are confusing however, and I sympathized more with the Phantom). The singing is flawless--almost too flawless. The stars do hit some gorgeous notes, but the beauty almost gets lost in the plastic din. ** from ****",The Phantom of the Opera
11,blanche-2,"A sexier ""Phantom"" that isn't without its problems",7,1 October 2006,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-running Broadway show, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has been brought to the screen in a sumptuous, lush production. There have been many versions of this tale, dating back to Lon Chaney's scary performance in silent film. In the Claude Rains version, the Phantom seems to have been Christine's father and the victim of a terrible misunderstanding. The reasons for the Phantom's problems always vary, but the bottom line is - this guy is one sandwich short of a picnic due to his face being deformed. He hides away in the sewers of the Paris Opera. In this version, as the ""Angel of Music"" he has been coaching the beautiful dancer/singer Christine for the day when she will make her opera debut - probably by the Phantom clunking a diva over the head, which is the way it's been done in past films. Minnie Driver is the unfortunate Carlotta, but her life is spared in Webber's Phantom. Driver is hilarious as the temperamental, Italian opera star, and she's perhaps the best thing in the film.You know there's a problem when the Phantom is better looking than Christine's boyfriend, Raoul, which is the case here. Gerard Butler is plenty handsome for a deformed man - he sings in an appropriately rough, desperate manner, and his scenes with Christine are hot. Broadway star Patrick Wilson is a very good Raoul, tender and loving. Emily Rossum is beautiful as Christine. She has a sweet voice, but Webber insists upon these very light, small voices singing Christine; thus, we lose some of the glorious music - not to mention the words - in the lower registers. Also, it was interesting how her gowns went from demure to Victoria's Secret slutty whenever she wound up with the Phantom. She looked great in everything.The music in Phantom is its best feature, and it's not compromised in this production. For the most part, the score is well sung. The usual problem is that someone with Christine's voice is not an appropriate replacement for a diva with Carlotta's voice - in fact, she's not really appropriate for much opera. It wasn't an issue in this version, as Christine replaces Carlotta singing a simple song, but it usually is.People had a lot of problems with this film, but I didn't see ""Phantom"" in the theater; perhaps it played better on television. What I liked the best was the clarification at the end of something that happens in the beginning of the show, which I had always wondered about. This is a popular ""Beauty and the Beast"" type story which holds a lot of classic appeal. Added to Webber's best score, you really can't beat it. It's about the timelessness and power of love, and there's no argument with a message like that.",The Phantom of the Opera
12,tavm,Joel Schumacher's filming of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is such an awesome spectacle!,10,20 September 2012,"For years, all I knew about Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera was that song ""The Music of the Night"" as performed by Michael Crawford on various variety shows of the time. So now that I've seen the whole movie version as directed by Joel Schumacher with Gerald Butler in the title role, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and Emmy Rossum as Christine, and also hearing them sing the music of Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe, and then seeing the spectacle as produced by Lloyd Webber, all I can say is WOW! I mean, the whole thing was just awesome scene after awesome scene especially the back and forth of the color and then black & white for period transitions. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend this astounding movie musical version of The Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
13,jotix100,"Love it, or hate it!",6,31 December 2004,"Went to see Joel Schumacher's film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" out of curiosity and because everything else playing in the Loew's cineplex was sold out. This was the only available film that we hadn't seen. The theater was about less than half full, which speaks volumes for a movie based on the Broadway hit that's been playing forever, so it seems.First of all, Joel Schumacher bears all responsibility as to why this movie is adored by consumed fans, and hated with a passion by the ones that are turned off by it. Sure, he has delivered a product that will charm and delight, but there are things that with another director, someone with more experience with musical films, this Phantom would have fared much better.There is an excess of everything. We are taken back to the Paris of the late XIX century, to the Opera Populaire, and its demise. It's a story of rags to riches, at best, as we see how a young, and inexperienced chorus singer makes a surprising appearance in an ""opera""? that the great diva of the time, Carlota, having been injured, can't sing.From there we are transported, as if by magic to the subterranean world of the Phantom, who is madly in love with the young Christine. Those scenes are about as good as this movie will get. The sexy Phantom is an opera composer, we learn. Without knowing what's wrong with this man, Christine would have been crazy not to take advantage of getting 'cozy' with the Phantom, he is such a hunk and it's clear he adores her.The thing I found annoying with the movie was the music of Andrew LLoyd Webber. Instead of having a dialog mixed with songs that are sung at the appropriate moment to convey the mood, the creators have insisted in have only songs. That's when this film loses its appeal, as the songs all sound the same! There are basically only a few songs that are repeated throughout the film. The lip synching is a problem that none of the actors have mastered. It must be extremely difficult to match the recorded voice with the moment it's done in front of the not too forgiving camera that captures every wrong movement.All the actors make an excellent contribution. Gerard Butler cuts a sexy figure and his Phantom comes alive. His final scenes show he has the range and he can act. Emmy Rossum is a beautiful and sweet Christine, the girl courted by Raoul but desired by the Phantom. Patrick Wilson is good as Raoul, and Miranda Richardson, as always, makes a compelling Mme. Giry.Love this film, or hate it! You'll be the judge.",The Phantom of the Opera
14,Doylenf,Visually as sumptuous as any version of 'Phantom' you are likely to see...,9,28 December 2004,"After reading some indifferent reviews from several so-called qualified ""critics"", I kept my fingers crossed and hoped for the best because, frankly, I love the Andrew Lloyd Webber score that I had only heard on recordings. Never saw the stage version.I loved it!! And if you appreciate musicals of this caliber (it's operatic in concept), you'll find much to admire.Handsome Gerard Butler has been unfairly attacked for giving a poor vocal performance because he doesn't have the high tenor capabilities of Michael Crawford. Forget about it--he's in fine shape, physically and vocally and delivers a strong, sometimes tender and always masculine performance that is altogether in keeping with this concept of the story. He is strong in conveying the pain of the tortured creature he plays.Others are well cast too. Emmy Rossum has a clear, lyric soprano voice and is clearly up to the task of performing the demanding songs in a pleasing fashion while projecting youthful innocence and luminous beauty.Patrick Wilson is very effective as Raoul. His diction is impeccable, even in song. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of the other singers--many times the lack of clear enunciation leaves the lyrics inexplicable, which was true in the stage version too.Aside from minor flaws, the film is gorgeous to look at, brilliantly staged for maximum effect from the very opening shot of the Paris Opera Populaire in 1916 (photographed in black and white) until the final climactic scenes beneath the famed opera house. All of it is filmed in a continually moving and prowling camera movement that makes us feel that the phantom's prowling has become part of our viewing experience.It all has a dark, glittering style that is entirely in keeping with the atmosphere needed to make this kind of story ring true. Richly photographed and sensuous in its appeal, it will keep you absorbed throughout its entire running time. The full orchestra orchestrations of the 110 piece orchestra are an added bonus for the movie version, particularly when rendering the Phantom theme at full throttle.All I can say is, if you like the Webber score, you'll love what they've accomplished here, giving lush cinematic style to the prowling camera-work that seems to cover every corner of the mysterious stage settings.Minnie Driver provides effective comic relief as La Carlotta in her over-the-top performance, as do Ciarin Hinds and Simon Callow as the new opera owners. Settings, costumes and John Mathieson's stunning cinematography cannot be praised highly enough.Don't believe those negative reviews. No doubt this will be regarded as a masterpiece in years to come, when strict adherence to the stage version is no longer important and comparisons to Brightman and Crawford are relegated to the past.Visually, it's one of the most sumptuous productions of this story that you are ever likely to see.",The Phantom of the Opera
15,preppy-3,Very good...but lacking,8,27 December 2004,"In the 1800s singer Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) is being taught to sing by a voice she hears in her dressing room--she thinks it's the Angel of Music but it's actually the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler), a disfigured genius who lives under the Opera House. He loves Christine but she loves Raoul (Patrick Wilson) and the Phantom goes mad with anger...I've seen the stage musical at least 7 times and loved it. I was expecting the worst from this (all the reviews have been negative). I was surprised...it actually is pretty good. They follow the stage version pretty faithfully except they add dialogue and have the chandelier falling at a different place in the movie (but it still DOES fit). The movie looks just beautiful--lavish interiors, beautiful costumes, the marvelous score by Andrew Lloyd Webber and some really great dances. Also the opening number, showing the opera coming to life, is just GREAT! But this film does have some serious problems.For one thing...Butler. He's a great actor, very tall and handsome...but that's actually a problem--he's TOO good-looking to play the Phantom. Also his singing is off. Previously he only sang for a rock'n'roll band--it shows. He seems unsure of how to sing this and it comes off sometimes sounding strange. Also the makeup on his face at the end is just silly--he wouldn't scare a 2 year old. He looks just mildly scarred--not disfigured. And his Scottish accent kept slipping through. Still his acting was great.Rossum, on the other hand, CAN sing extremely well. She's very beautiful and what a voice! Her acting is pretty impressive too. Patrick Wilson is dreadful as Raoul. For one thing he looks silly with the long hair--his hair should be cut short. He can sing but he was pretty wooden with his acting.Miranda Richardson was wonderful as Madeame Giry and Minnie Driver was hysterical as the overbearing Carlotta.All in all it was very good but it just lacked that certain feeling to make it great. It just misses the mark of being a great musical. Still it IS worth seeing for the sets and score alone. I give it a 8.",The Phantom of the Opera
16,CinemaSerf,Brings the story to life.,7,1 August 2020,"I was fortunate enough to see this on stage and this version holds up quite well, by comparison. Sure, some of the dialogue scenes are cheesy, almost Disney-esque, but the quality of the music is consistently high with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Charles Hart's wonderful music and lyrics delivered well by Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson - who is surprisingly engaging as ""Raoul"". It hasn't the impact nor menace of either the 1923 or 1943 iterations, the colour and glamour of the costumes and sets see to that; but that doesn't impact too negatively on the story of a young opera singer ""Christine"" who becomes the obsession of the murderous ""Phantom"" who lives in the sewers beneath the Opéra Populaire in Paris. Luckily, she has the dashing, chivalrous ""Vicomte de Chagny"" to keep her from her scarred pursuer. Minnie Driver is great as the ultimate diva ""Carlotta"", and Simon Callow and Ciarán Hinds as the sort of ""Stadler and Waldorf"" of theatre management create some light comical breathing space now and again from the continuous pace of this sumptuous drama. Miranda Richardson doesn't quite cut it as ""Madama Giry"", nor Jennifer Ellison as ""Meg"" - but all in all, Joel Schumacher has created a feast for the eyes that does some justice to Gaston Leroux' original story, and even more to the magnificent musical theatre adaptation from 1986 with rousing performances of ""Think of Me""; ""Music of the Night"" and the eponymous title track made famous by Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman to entertain us.",The Phantom of the Opera

I bought it for my wife because she was in love with Andrew Lloyd Webber's music. I think she was more in love with the Michael Crawford CD. She can dream of Michael Crawford as long as she doesn't mind me dreaming of Halle Berry.I like Webber's music also, especially Evita and the end title song from Notting Hill, but I was not prepared for the visual and auditory feast that was The Phantom of the Opera. The sets were magnificent, especially the graveyard and the catacombs, which seemed to go on forever. The singing by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum was incredible!

Filmmaker Joel Schumacher's ornate and opulent grandstanding theatrics work best for him here in the long-anticipated big-screen adaptation of the vastly popular musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber based on Gaston Leroux's thriller about a disfigured madman (decidedly hunky yet bland Butler) running rampant in the Parisian Opera House that is home to him and his beautiful young protégé Christine (Rossum acquitting herself nicely with an impressive set of lungs) as he attempts to mold her into a chanteuse only for him to desire. Gorgeous sets and colorful costumes shine over some of the slower parts  namely the music and its forgettable songs (at least for me and I saw the Broadway version years ago enjoying it then too for the most part  and exquisite cinematography by John Mathieson brings it all too spectacular life.",The Phantom of the Opera
20,neil-476,Not bad if you like musicals,7,20 April 2011,"I'm not a big fan of the newer generation of film musicals, and I'm not a big fan of Lloyd-Webber, although I admit his tunes are eminently hummable. And, despite having caught at least a couple of the Phantom's on-screen outings (Lon Chaney and Herbert Lom spring to mind), I'm not a big Phantom fan either. So I wasn't exactly dragged kicking and screaming to this, but it wasn't too far away either.I was pleasantly surprised, for the most part. It was well staged, with a wonderful effects shot at the start replacing what I understand is a breathtaking stage effect in the show. Gerard Butler, as a non-singer, does well as the Phantom - he is in tune, delivers a good vocal performance (as opposed to singing) and maintains control well at the very difficult ending of Music Of The Night. Emmy Rossum is wonderful - adorable, vulnerable, and with a terrific voice.

21,evanston_dad,Nothing Is Safe in the Hands of Joel Schumacher,4,3 September 2010,"The curse of Joel Schumacher strikes again. He's surely the worst director consistently given such high-profile projects, no? The film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" Andrew Lloyd Weber's blockbuster stage musical, does nothing but play up the flimsiness of the source material. The songs are lovely, but they're not enough to keep you engaged over the course of a feature length movie.Gerard Butler's mouth drives me crazy -- he only talks out of one side of it, a tic that is only exacerbated by the fact that he wears a mask that does nothing but draw attention to his mouth.

22,anaconda-40658,New Opera.,9,10 March 2016,"Phantom of the Opera (2004): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson: Perhaps the most strikingly beautiful version of the phantom tale ever made. It is almost completely musical including its dialogue, which doesn't always work within the conversations, but it is nonetheless a feast to the eyes. Seen in flashbacks regarding the phantom's terrorizing a theatre in order to pursue the talents of a young woman he is smitten with. When a wealthy young bachelor enters the picture on a quest for her hand the phantom becomes enraged and strikes again. Joel Schumacher's triumphant entry into musicals is a remarkable success. He previously had success with Batman Forever and Eight Millimeter, and this is somewhere between comic book and thriller. Gerard Butler is fascinating as the phantom whose mask hides scars. Emmy Rossum is the symbol of love and eventually sacrifice. Patrick Wilson plays her lover in a role that goes beyond conventions as he becomes the phantom's target. Minnie Driver steals scenes as a demanding theatrical performer who could have used more time. Miranda Richardson is cast as someone who knows where the Phantom dwells. There have been many versions of this story produced but Schumacher's version will be difficult to upstage. This updated version is the most striking of them all.

23,JamesHitchcock,Visually Lavish and Generally Enjoyable,7,5 January 2005,"The rise of the musical in the theatre in recent years has coincided with a decline of the musical in the cinema. During the 1950s, possibly the golden age of the Hollywood musical, musicals in London's West End were greatly outnumbered by straight plays. Today, theatreland is dominated by the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh and it is straight plays that are in the minority. Lloyd Webber may be Britain's greatest living composer of musicals, but they are rarely filmed. The works of America's greatest living composer of musicals, Stephen Sondheim, have similarly been neglected.""Phantom of the Opera"" is the first Lloyd Webber musical to be filmed since ""Evita"" in 1996, which in turn was the first since ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" in 1973. The plot is set in the Paris Opera House in the 1870s and revolves around the two men who are in love with Christine, a beautiful young opera singer. One of these is Raoul, a conventionally handsome young aristocrat. The other is the Phantom himself, a man with a disfigured face who has escaped from a circus freak show and has hidden himself in the Opera House ever since. The Phantom is also supposed to be a musical genius who has taught Christine how to sing; where he acquired his musical knowledge is something that is never explained.One of the difficulties of filming this story is the baroque nature of the plot, which smacks strongly of the penny dreadful. The film-makers deal with this problem by avoiding any attempt at realism; the whole atmosphere of the film, with its subterranean caverns complete with underground lakes and rivers, mediaeval vaults complete with stained-glass windows and snow-bound cemeteries (that scene reminded me strongly of a Caspar David Friedrich painting) is that of a Gothic dreamworld. The imagery of the film, like its plot, is centred upon death, sorrow and loss, an impression strengthened by the opening and closing scenes which are set in a neglected and dilapidated Opera House in 1919 and shot in a grainy black and white.The film has two great advantages. One is Lloyd Webber's music, the other is the performance of Emmy Rossum as Christine. The composer has a great gift for writing melody; some of the tunes in this show, especially ""All I Ask of You"", would be worthy of a Tchaikovsky. The role of Christine is a difficult one to cast because the character is both a brilliant opera singer and an innocent teenager. This is a combination not generally found in nature, if only because the female voice does not normally develop to its full advantage until later in life. Charlotte Church may be an exception, but even she was not taking the lead in operatic productions at the age of sixteen. The film-makers therefore had two possibilities, either of casting an older and more experienced singer in the role or of going for a young girl who could better suggest Christine's freshness and innocence. They went for the latter option, and in my opinion they were right to do so. Emmy Rossum is not only strikingly attractive, with the looks of a young Julia Roberts, but also has a lovely voice. True, she does not sound much like an authentic operatic diva, but that does not matter. ""Phantom"", although it is set in an opera house, is a musical rather than an opera and calls for a quite different style of singing. (Some opera stars can sound embarrassingly florid when they try and cross over into the musical theatre). There were also good performances in minor roles from Miranda Richardson and,surprisingly, from Jennifer Ellison, hitherto better known as a tabloid pin-up than as a serious actress.Unfortunately, the film also had some disadvantages, quite apart from the lurid plot. The lyrics of the songs are unmemorable and not in the same category as Tim Rice's lyrics to some of the earlier Lloyd Webber musicals. Neither of the two male leads were as good as Emmy Rossum. Patrick Wilson made a capable if uninspiring Raoul, at his best in their duets, but Gerard Butler's voice was not equal to the demands placed upon it by his role as the Phantom. He is also insufficiently ugly; his supposed disfigurement, revealed when Christine removes the mask that has covered one half of his face, is hardly serious enough to earn him a place in a freak show. My overall impression, however, was of a visually lavish and generally enjoyable production, despite these weaknesses. 7/10",The Phantom of the Opera
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Phantom of the Opera is here,8,22 May 2005,"OK, now if I wanted to see the musical, I would've bought tickets. That was my only complaint, because even though I enjoy the musical, I was looking for more of a horror movie to be honest.But the movie was very excellent. The sets, costumes, music, and acting were very up to par. I was impressed. But to be honest this new girl, Emmy Rosen, I've seen her in ""The Day after Tomorrow"" and I didn't like her as an actress. So, for some reason I couldn't let go of my opinion of her. I thought, no offense to her, that they could have picked someone a little more beautiful to play Christine. The Phantom I have seen in ""Dracula 2000"" and he has come a long way. He is the only part in the movie that you really enjoy watching and listening too. Raoul kind of looked like the lost Hanson brother. :D This is a good movie and musical. If you enjoy musicals, I of course would always recommend.8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
25,MovieAddict2016,Joel Schumacher ruins another film,4,12 June 2005,"I guess before production started on this it was Joel Schumacher's goal to cast the most unsuitable actors in the roles of the singers. Gerard Butler, as the titular Phantom, couldn't sing if his life depended on it - every time he hits a high note (or any note, for that matter) his voice sounds like a whale bellowing under the ocean, or a 90-year-old letting some wind loose. It's pretty upsetting.Emmy Rossum is better but she's no kid wonder, either. Speaking of kid wonders - did anyone else get weird pedophilic vibes from the Phantom's relationship with Rossum? I mean, she looks like she just got out of high school. Oh wait, that's because she did.Schumacher probably purposely cast bad singers to make it ""more realistic"" and ""different"" from the stage show. Well guess what Joel, you succeeded - this movie stinks.He's got his ""Batman and Robin""-esquire awkward camera angles going on, and he even crams modern special effects into it - in a ""Phantom of the Opera"" film! Can you believe it! The man is mad! Apart from the poor direction, awful singing and bad acting (when people are actually talking and not singing, that is) there's the fact that the film is just plain boring.If you want to see ""Phantom of the Opera,"" here's some advice - go to London, watch the musical. It's great. Or, if you're too lazy, buy a recording of the musical.Just don't buy this.On an aside note, the last time Joel Schumacher made a good film was in 1993 with ""Falling Down."" I'm still waiting for something as good as that. He needs to tackle outrageous material, because that's what he is - an outrageous director. When he gets his hands on normal stuff - Batman or, say, the Phantom of the Opera - his insanity spreads into the material itself. Then we have Bat-nipples and singing whales, and we don't want that.",The Phantom of the Opera
26,DKosty123,Great Re-Staging of Classic Thriller,8,23 April 2008,"To fully appreciate this film, what I did by accident is watch the original silent film starring Lon Chaney Senior. Doing this gives you a sense of what Andrew Lloyd Webber accomplished here.The story fully follows the exact story of the silent film. Many of the sets look very much like the silent sets. Nothing from the silent Master piece is disturbed.The opening of the film is different from Lon Chaneys & the ending in the cemetery is different. The phantom is not as hideous in this updated musical.Musically, this film is fantastic. The music does not distract from the story. Everything is here & in abundance. I just think that it might not have sold as many tickets because of the fact that the musical was on Broadway & beyond many years before it was finally made into the film.If you haven't seen Chaney's silent, watch it after watching this & you will be amazed at how close the 2 films are in story when this was done nearly 80 years afterwords. It is a classic story that must be seen once to be appreciated.",The Phantom of the Opera
27,Buddy-51,impressively mounted adaptation,7,27 November 2005,"""Opulent"" is the defining term for ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" Joel Schumacher's lavish film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber mega stage hit from the 1980's. Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, the film tells the story of a mysterious, masked specter, his face disfigured from birth, who haunts a Paris opera house in the 1870's. Embittered by the treatment he's received all his life from a callous, cruel society that could never see past his physical deformity, the Phantom lives an isolated, lonely existence in the rafters and bowels of the theater until he falls in love with a beautiful young ingénue named Christine whom he both inspires and terrifies with his actions and demeanor.The original production relied heavily on feats of stagecraft and theatrical legerdemain - the boat rowing across the stage, the chandelier crashing to the floor - to wow its awestruck audience. Since such special effects are de rigueur in the world of film, Schumacher has had to retain much of the theatricality of the original to make these moments work as well here as they did on the stage. This he achieves through the use of elaborate, larger-than-life sets - soaring architecture for the scenes above stage and cavernous causeways for the ones below. Yet, Schumacher keeps it all reasonably cinematic through fluid camera-work and an occasional excursion into the great outdoors.Like most musicals, ""Phantom"" rises or falls on the quality of its score. Although many have noted that the songs all tend to sound the same after awhile, this criticism does an injustice to some of the really stirring melodies Webber has come up with. Although a few of the pieces do, indeed, feel like filler, the music, on the whole, perfectly captures the high flown romanticism of what is, let's face it, a pretty florid piece of Victorian melodrama at its core. Needless to say, the songs are impeccably sung, with Emmy Rossum's clear, shining soprano a thing of beauty. Gerald Butler as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson as Raoul, his rival for Christine's affections, both lack charisma as actors, although Butler has a few touching moments at the end (Wilson, on the other hand, has been stuck playing one of those bland, white bread hero types Victorian audiences seemed to adore so much, so, unlike Butler, he has little or no chance of redeeming himself at any point in the movie).",The Phantom of the Opera
28,Robert_duder,Beautiful but belongs on stage,8,1 March 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom is mysterious and beautiful and touching and emotional and without a doubt the greatest musical stage achievement I have ever seen. It only made sense to bring it to the big screen, and sadly with the current state of cinema, The Phantom Of The Opera is many years too late. Nowadays musicals are not film commodity. Nonetheless the film is breathtaking as is the stage show.The Phantom Of The Opera is in essence an Opera about a mysterious, hideously disfigured man who lives in the basement of a Paris Opera House. He demands a lot from the Opera House owners in exchange for his silence and not causing any trouble. He loves music, and is a beautiful composer and brilliant musical genius but his disfigurement causes him to keep to the shadows. Then enters the stunning Christine Daae whom the Phantom becomes obsessively romantic about. He teaches her in secret and grooms her musical talent to become his star. She finally gets her chance and blows everyone away including her former lover Raoul who immediately comes back to her. The Phantom doesn't like this and becomes enraged and jealous as his anger and obsessiveness borders dangerous. Eventually he takes Christine as his prisoner not able to live without her. Fortunally love will overcome his madness.Webber managed to make an opera that is almost impossible even for the average person to not enjoy. It has everything and the music is what really pulls it all together. The music is breathtaking and brings out emotions in such a big way. It's no different seeing it in the film. I find it quite odd that Webber chose Joel Schumacher as his director, not that he's not a great director but his choices for this film were offbeat and perhaps he was trying to mainstream it but in effect he possibly lost some of the quality he could have gained by bringing on board a more musically inclined director and cast in some cases. Nonetheless Schumacher does an adequate job of bringing to life the grit and darkness of the Phantom's world and his obsession with Christine. The addition of the black and white, dreary world of the future in which the story is narrated from is a creepy and well done addition as well and adds a certain setting to the film. Newcomer Emmy Rossum is absolutely stunning in her lead role as Christine. Much better than anyone I have seen in her role, on stage or otherwise. Her voice is just remarkable (and at only 16 when she filmed the role.) She brings an innocence and naivety to the role that is perfection. She should have gotten an Academy Award nomination hands down. Gerard Butler as The Phantom is a rather odd pick to me, especially for Webber who has worked with more brilliant musicals than anyone. Butler can sing but nowhere near to the caliber of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical or even further from the Caliber of Rossum. He looks the part of the Phantom, and plays his role well as the hidden and mysterious stranger but his singing is disastrous. Nonetheless he has great chemistry with Rossum. The rest of the cast is well done and don't play a big role. Casting Minnie Driver is another questionable decision as she doesn't even sing. She's funny and tolerable which for her is a feat but pointless as far as I'm concerned. Anyone who loves musicals will be blown away by Webber's masterpiece and it's a must see for anyone who won't get the chance to see the play. It is a great film!!! 8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
29,MLDinTN,couldn't understand the story....,3,27 December 2005,"because it was too hard to understand what the characters were singing or saying. I have never seen the phantom before, so I didn't know anything about the story. And from this film version, I still don't know what a lot of it was about. It seemed like the story was too complex for a 2.5 hour film and that a lot of plot details were left out.What I did get was Christine is picked to take the place of Carlotta who has gotten mad for some reason. Christine has learned to sing well with help from the Phantom. Raoul becomes involved with the theater; he previously knew Christine. He loves her and she loves him. She has compassion for the Phantom who also wants her. The Phantom sends letters to those in the theater demanding Christine get the lead and that Carlotta be given a no speaking part. They do not comply and the Phantom interrupts the opera. He also kills a stagehand before escaping.So, I don't get why Christine still likes the Phantom when she knows he is a murderer and gone mad. There were other characters I couldn't tell much about. When they sing in such high voices, it is hard to understand. I liked recent musicals of Chicago and Moulin Rouge, but I didn't care for this one. It was too long and needed better sound editing.FINAL VERDICT: Too long and difficult to understand. If you don't already know the story before seeing this, you will be lost because it just seemed a lot of plot details were left out.",The Phantom of the Opera
30,Cineanalyst,Musical Phantoms Reductio ad Absurdum,4,28 November 2018,"""The Phantom of the Opera,"" of course, began as a novel by Gaston Leroux. One of the first adaptations to the screen was one that still largely had to be read--a silent film starring Lon Chaney. It also had a glorious production design, including the auditorium replicating that of the Palais Garnier. It was so magnificent (and steel reinforced) that the studio, Universal, reused it in many films thereafter, including its 1943 remake. While the 1925 Chaney version added sound for its re-release, the Phantom remained silent. A loose Chinese reworking of the story, ""Song at Midnight"" (1937) made the Phantom a singer. The 1943 remake, along with its imitators such as the 1962 Hammer film, added a backstage musical--an opera, which was appropriate on one hand, but, on the other, it entirely disregarded the point of the ""Faust"" play-within-a-play aspect from the book, so the inner opera had nothing to do with the Phantom menace of the main narrative. It was just a sop to the mainstream crossover appeal of a baritone like Nelson Eddy, who actually received top billing over the film's Phantom, Claude Rains. Brian De Palma's ""Phantom of the Paradise"" (1974) restored the Faustian layers while retaining the backstage musical, and it's the one to see for those who want a good Phantom musical. Anyways, now, there's this movie based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage version, which is an integrated musical where the singing takes up so much time that despite lasting nearly 2 and 1/2 hours, the whole Faustian thing had to be thrown out. Besides the music, what's left is an inane love triangle, but the movie does restore one important aspect, and that's the glorious production design.Jerrold E Hogle's critique of the stage version in ""The Undergrounds of The Phantom of the Opera"" sums up this screen adaptation just as well: as the romance consisting of arrested adolescence and Freudian Oedipus complexes. Christine is misled by the attraction for her dead father, who she mistakes as the Phantom, and the Phantom is like a teenager with a bad case of acne who desires the pleasures of the flesh to sooth his rejection from his mother. They sing about this ad nauseam, so it's blatant, and despite the characters being portrayed by adults, the treatment is of characters with no shared sexual experiences. On top of this, the screen version, at least, adds a Disney-fied iteration of Raoul as a long-haired Prince Charming for the princess of the opera. To prove their love, the men also perform feats of physical aggression, whether its Prince Charming employing his muscles in slow motion to escape a trap that conveniently offers its own escape route, or the Phantom merely killing everyone who gets in his way.The design of the opera does look grand, though, and I like the electric lights of the chandelier lighting up the color of the opera house; yet, the camera tends to twirl around it and cuts away quickly often times in a fashion derivative of ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001). There's the entering of the mirror, as per the book and other adaptations from the 1925 version to ""Phantom of the Paradise,"" to reach the Phantom's subterranean lair, plus the funhouse mirrors trap, but, unfortunately, shots only tend to linger during singing and on lovelorn faces. The 1943 iteration had similar problems. Playing into the arrested adolescence and the emphasis on architecture, the Phantom plays with dolls on his model opera stage. Even more creepy, he keeps a full-size model of Christine in a wedding dress.Despite being seemingly plot-less at times and scrapping so much of the original narrative in service of the songs, it still adds a pointless origins story for the Phantom, again like the 1943 remake except for this time as a flashback, and adds some equally irrelevant black-and-white future scenes. Moreover, the main payoffs of the unmasking and the final confrontation over the love triangle are teased and, then, withdrawn, only to inevitably come back for the climax. Even the songs, music and lyrics, are repeated. One interesting addition here is the staging of the Phantom's opera ""Don Juan Triumphant,"" although even this was done better in the staging of ""Faust"" in ""Phantom of the Paradise."" Minnie Driver is amusing as a prima donna, although the transitioning between her Faux French accent and the more-English sounding singing and the still-different Soprano shrieking can be disorienting, and most of the opera parts in general seem more like what one would imagine to be how horrible opera might be rather than what it is or was. And, I didn't like any of the songs, which made this quite a chore to get through. The masquerade ball, one of the most memorable moments from the 1925 version, with its two-strip Technicolor standing out in a mostly black-and-white film, was the worst part here with that singing in unison.",The Phantom of the Opera

33,tabuno,Almost Perfect,8,23 January 2019,"21 May 2005. The screen adaptation of Phantom of the Opera is majestic and its transformation into a movie rather remarkable. The music changed somewhat with various elements opera, modern rock/jazz, and the traditional musical. Unfortunately this movie isn't for everybody. Unlike Mouline Rouge and Chicago, Phantom didn't possess the intriguing special effects and somewhat quirky aspects as those two musical renewal adaptations used to pull in the general audience. The seductive power of the Phantom over Christine was remarkable, as with Dracula and the music of the night. Beneath the surface elements, Andrew Lloyd Weber and Gaston Leroux created a much more mesmerizing and dramatic humanistic lure between selfish love and pure love. The movie-musical would have been interesting with a slight more emphasis on modernizing its musical versions and with the seduction element that faded somewhat towards the end. Overall, however, this movie didn't rely on its stage version rendition but became something else in a lush and big screen way that brought to subtle and rich life the treasures of music, torn despair, and the turmoil of the inner desires and pains within all of us.

It had some very good interpretations made by its cast, beautiful music and a good direction which was made by Joel Schumacher who did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretations of the cast I have to mention that I was amazed by the performance of Gerard Butler who played as the Phantom and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Patrick Wilson's who played as Raoul and Emmy Rossum's who played as Christine, and they were both very good. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to be amazed by it.",The Phantom of the Opera
36,filipemanuelneto,One of the best films based on stage musicals.,9,24 October 2020,"I confess that I am not particularly fond of films based on musicals. It's not the kind of film that attracts me, but I loved this film. I already knew the story, written by Gaston Leroux, and I was not badly impressed by the fact that the film did not literally follow the book. The film preferred to rely closely on the American musical inspired by it, which makes perfect sense since it is also a musical film and there were already several regular feature films, mostly horror, inspired by Leroux's book. About the story, there is much to tell and some believe that some parts of the story was based on people and facts that really happened. I will not enter into conjectures, but it is still a seductive idea.The film begins in 1919, with the auction of objects from the decadent ""Opera Populaire"" in Paris. One of the objects is acquired by the elderly Viscount de Chagny and, together with the pieces of the old theater chandelier, its the starting point for a flashback until 1870, when the theater was at its peak and the events of the film are taking place: the arrival of new managers to the theater leads to a manifestation of the Phantom. Its an evil and perverse entity that no one knows about, but that manifests itself punctually and sometimes causes accidents if it is contradicted. And this time the Phantom decides to demand that the lyric singer Christine Daaé be the new star of the show. His obsession will lead him to a series of dramatic and fatal events, where his madness will be highlighted and will lead the still young Viscount de Chagny, in love with Christine, to take a drastic attitude and to defend the woman he loves.Living in Europe, far from the American musical circuit, I can't say that I saw, or think one day I could see Andrew Lloyd Webber's original musical. Anyway, if the critics and experts are right and the film was quite true to it, it would be something I would pay to see in person. Joel Schumacher was an excellent director, the ideal man for the film, with an attention to detail and very attentive to how it all came together. The result is a wonderful film, like a fairy tale, with an excellent pace where there are no dead moments. The scenes where the Phantom takes Christine to his lair, on an island under the theater, are truly unforgettable, more than the famous fall of the chandelier, which is quite unimpressive, to be honest. I was also not impressed by the ending, which seemed predictable and somewhat anticlimactic.The cast has big names, most of them already proven in singing: for example, the film's protagonist, Emmy Rossum, began her artistic career as a lyrical singer at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. She has an excellent voice and charms with every melody. Also Patrick Wilson, who gave life to the young Viscount Raoul, was notable in his work and knows how to interpret as well as sing, with a very soft voice that makes an excellent counterpoint to the deep profound voice of Gerard Butler, who gave life to the Phantom who, in this film, never sees his name revealed. In addition to this remarkable trio, the film features excellent participation's by Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver (the only actress who doesn't sing), Ciarán Hinds, Simon Callow and Jennifer Ellison.Technically, the film bets all the chips on the music and does it right, taking into account that it is the cement that holds everything else together in a cohesive and solid work. From what I was reading at the time of writing this review, all the songs were taken from the American stage musical, with the exception of ""Learn To Be Lonely"", sung by Minnie Driver, used in the final credits and composed specifically for the film by Andrew Lloyd Webber. From the wide range of songs its difficult to choose the best ones but I especially liked ""All I Ask Of You"", ""Music of The Night"", ""Masquerade"", ""The Point of No Return"" and, of course, the famous ""Overture"" that has become almost a cultural icon. In addition to this set of great melodies, the film presents excellent choreographies. The sets and costumes are also very good and there is a certain notion of visual and aesthetic grandeur that looks good and is welcome. On the other hand, I did not particularly like the makeup of Gerard Butler, who is too handsome without a mask, far from being hideous and similar to the living death, as described by Leroux. A kind of visual skillfully used by horror movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
37,leplatypus,Review written at the very real Opera in Paris (DVD),7,18 March 2011,"This isn't every day that i got the opportunity to write a review in the real exact location of a movie.That's why i took my laptop to Opera Garnier in Paris (20 minutes from my accommodation) but this Sunday, the Opera was closed and above all, i discovered that it is put under a total wood shell for renovation. Thus i couldn't enter nor see anything! At least, i can say that what it's show at the enter in the movie is actually the exit. Now people enter from the other side. Unfortunately, i can't compare the copy and the original but people can also watch french iconic comedy ""La grande vadrouille"" because Fufu is actually shots in the real opera. For having been there once, i can remember that the movie eye gives place wide space and more luminosity: actually, the real opera seems little and a bit dark inside! If i pick this movie, it's because i search for recent movies with Minnie because after having done great movies between 1995-2000, she seemed to have disappeared. Here, she plays a diva (why not la Bellucci so?) but the role isn't a reward! I was surprised to meet again King Leonidas (that i have branded one sad day the future Pacino) and to discover Emmy Rossum, the sister of Jessica Alba, more talented.I was afraid nevertheless to see that Scumacher was the director because he destroyed the Batman franchise: Here, his style is patent: filled with details, light and darkness but it's OK as the Phantom is as Gothic as Rococco. For a musical, i never listened to Loyd Weber before but he has found two great themes: the Gothic one and the ""music of the night"".If the movie is my weakest 7 because it drags, some songs are boring, there's a real mystery, poetry that I fell under. Or maybe is-it its Parisian roots: in all cases, i don't understand why a french classic turn as a cult Gothic icon in Hollywood, as a classic play in England and now an American blockbuster ? In other words, where are my french fellows?",The Phantom of the Opera

Also, I watched it on the theater (the Broadway production).I had low expectations towards this movie but man! It's really good mainly because of the spectacular musical numbers, art direction, cinematography, and dynamic direction. The two main characters have very good chemistry between them and I wonder why if they are such good actors why they haven't become huge stars (Gerard Butler is almost there). Emmy Rossum is extremely nice to look at; she's sexy, has long legs and a powerful voice.The movie is spectacular if not perfect on technical aspects.

39,Anonymous_Maxine,The Phantom was a lot uglier in 1925,10,12 January 2005,"Speaking of 1925, I'm curious about the statement on the movie's poster, which claims that the classic musical is being brought to the big screen for the first time. I'm wondering who authored that statement and what is different about this time the classic musical is brought to the big screen and the times that it was brought to the big screen in 1916, 1925, 1943, 1962, 1989, and 1998, and now 2004. I guess ""The Classic Musical Is Brought to the Big Screen for the Seventh Time"" just didn't sound as powerful. Then again, all of those film versions have not always been true to the source material (in many cases wildly untrue to the source material), which is one of the things that irritates me more than anything when a work of literature is adapted into a film (although this is more an adaptation of the stage play to film than the book). This film very competently rivals the Lon Chaney version as the best film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera ever made.I saw Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom a few hours after I had watched the 1925 Lon Chaney version, and of course the thing that just about knocked me out of my seat was when the orchestra kicked in as the chandelier is being raised at the beginning of the film. The 1925 version is a silent film, of course, and the music that accompanies the film is not the Phantom of the Opera music that you probably know by now. I saw a live production of Phantom at a theatre in London two years ago, which is where I primarily know the music from.It is to be expected that many people will condemn this film immediately for being directed by Joel Schumacher, who many viewers have yet to forgive for Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Roger Ebert, however, makes a valid point that the Phantom's mask has turned from a means to cover his hideously damaged face and into a fashion accessory, while half of the Phantom's face that remains visible is about as unattractive as Brad Pitt's not-quite-hideous mug. Indeed, the first thing that struck me about the movie (besides that music, which is tremendously powerful), was how good-looking the Phantom was. And in a movie about a man who has quarantined himself in the dungeons under the Paris Opera House because of his ""cursed ugliness"" (as Lon Chaney's Phantom describes it), it is certainly unsettling for even half of his face to be so good-looking.On the other hand, Ebert also called the music ""maddeningly repetitious,"" which I can't help disagreeing with. But maybe I just found the sheer magnitude of the orchestra to be so moving that I could have listened to it over and over all night. Ordinarily I tend to be uninterested in musicals, I just have a hard time watching movies in which people burst into song, performing complex musical numbers as though spontaneously, even though the acceptance of the musical aspect is a given in such productions. I was initially disappointed when I realized that the majority of the movie would be sung, I guess I found it easier to accept in the stage adaptation than the film, but I soon found myself readily accepting the singing even if only for the spectacular beauty and my own growing interest in the Phantom franchise (by now, it can indeed be referred to as none less).It is interesting to consider deviations from the original material, particularly in the two lead roles of the Phantom and Raoul, Christine's love interest. The Phantom has changed from a hideous creature forced to live underground because of his ferocious appearance and into an undeniable heartthrob, while Raoul has remained the somewhat dislikable but socially acceptable man seeking Christine's true love. But the important element to consider in regards to this film version is that it plays like the stage play put on film. The performances are geared for the theater rather than film, which gives it a very authentic feel.But the overarching story is the one thing that Schumacher couldn't really touch, and it's good that he didn't. The Phantom's fate is decidedly different than in the 1925 version, but Schumacher seems to have concentrated on the look of the film and the direction rather than anything about the story. The film is wonderful to look at and to listen to, but the love story falls flat. The love between Christine and the Phantom, who is the villain, is by leaps and bounds more convincing than that between Christine and Raoul, which serves really as an obstacle for the Phantom, a catalyst by which he can measure Christine's willingness to devote her love to him rather than Raoul, who she clearly can't be in love with.Nonetheless, Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera is a tremendously impressive film, despite what tends to be cynical response from indifferent critics. It's a celebration of the classic Phantom story, an effort to bring it back from the obscurity quite likely brought on in no small part by the numerous remakes which took more liberties than they had any right to. The new version makes the story bigger and louder, which modern audiences tend to respond to more than they do to pure artistry, and it is truly refreshing to see a director like Schumacher, who is a Hollywood filmmaker no matter how unpopular his two Batman films were, take on such historical and artistic material. If a stage play has ever been literally made into a film, this is it.",The Phantom of the Opera
40,Vartiainen,"Glorious visuals, lacklustre storytelling",6,23 January 2016,"In 1800s a young soprano opera singer is given a chance to perform in place of the lead soprano of Opéra Populaire. Surprising all her doubters, she gives a stunning performance. When questioned about her skills, she simply answers that she has had an excellent teacher. In reality this teacher is none other than the mysterious opera ghost, the phantom of the opera, played by Gerard Butler.Christine Daaé's (Emmy Rossum) career was now on the rise, but things get complicated when her old childhood friend Raoul (Patrick Wilson), the Opéra's new patron, recognizes her and becomes infatuated, thus enraging the jealous ghost.This adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera was directed by Joel Schumacher and that definitely shows, both in the film's strengths as well as its weaknesses. Meaning that the visuals are fantastic, but the story could have been better told.The film looks stunning. The costumes are majestic, detailed and rich in textures. The sets, especially the opera itself, look amazing and Schumacher uses wonderful angles and shadows to evoke the feeling of fantasy, of dream. The music is based on the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, arguably the most successful musical of all time, so you know that aspect of the film will work. Whenever the main theme starts blasting, you cannot help but shiver.Unfortunately, Schumacher has never been the strongest of storytellers. His films have a tendency of focusing on inconsequential moments and on evoking mood and looking as Gothic as possible. Likewise here. You get the basic story alright, but because so much time is spent on simply admiring the set pieces, you don't really get into the heads of the characters. Not helping the matter are the actors. Rossum is fantastic in her role, fully capturing the youth and innocence of the character, but both Butler and Wilson don't quite fit their roles. Wilson is too much of a storybook prince, a shining knight on a white horse - at one point literally - making it hard to take him seriously. And while Butler has some range as an actor, his singing voice isn't quite what it needs to be, though it's by no means awful. Notably he was the only one of the main actors not to have any previous singing experience.In the end this makes this particular adaptation of the old classic tale something of a hit and miss. Those that can appreciate films simply because of their visual splendour can easily get lost into this film and get a lot out of it. But those requiring a good story will be left disappointed.",The Phantom of the Opera

It's the real deal, more music, plenty of theatrical work, and music scores that will make this movie a true musical. I've read the books I've seen earlier versions of the movie, this one is my ultimate favorite. I was eating dinner, because this is dealing with French royalty. Many languages were used a lot in the movie. French, English, Italian, and Spanish. What a blend for the movie. And some of the outfits used in the movie were pretty naughty. Of course this was France, but did they really showed that much flesh in the 19th Century Opera? Whatever, it was robust, bold, and full of flair. And it was rich in content. The Phantom in the movie went on without a real name, I think his first name was Eric. The face of the Phantom wasn't as scary, yet his moves around the opera house were as swift as a real apparition. This movie is real good, and the originals are always a classic.

43,PWNYCNY,The Titanic of Movie Musicals.,2,12 August 2005,"Normally I don't make reference to other reviewer's comments. But in this case I must make an exception. For those reviewers who rated this movie at 8 or 9 or 10, I must conclude that either they confused ""Phantom"" with another movie or are employees of the production company that produced what has to be one of the worst movie musicals in the history of movie musicals. ""Phantom"" is so bad that it makes ""Evita"" seem like ""West Side Story"" or ""Chicago."" The story was pretentious, the acting, with the exception of the leading lady who played Caroline, was abysmal, but above all, the music was awful. It was the music that ultimately sinks this movie. In fact, this movie is the equivalent of a musical Titanic - big, gaudy, doomed to fail, and fail BIG! If the movie jettisoned the music and stuck with the story, it may have worked. But the music was the iceberg that sunk this ship. Maybe on the stage this story plays well as a musical, but on the screen it is a flop. Nothing could save it except a major re-write. It may interest you to know that the original story was based on a novel. This movie is proof that it's best to leave well enough alone. I rate this movie a 2 only because of the young lady who plays Caroline. She deserved better. As for the Phantom, I have one bit of advice - stop being such a grouch.",The Phantom of the Opera
44,meeza,I slightly opt for this Opera flick,7,25 January 2005,"Many play enthusiasticos think that the infamous play ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is the best next thing to ""Three's Company"" reruns on TV Land. Many throughout the years have been caught up in the web of Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic Broadway endeavor. The bizarre love triangle story of a phantom battling out chorally with a nemesis for the love of a young innocent opera beauty has been playing at playhouses throughout the world for some years now. So finally Director Joel Schumacher & Webber decided that it was time to give it a ""Hollywood Operation"" by adapting this classic into a major motion picture. Was it a successful operation? Well, I tend to think so; even though I do not think it was all that ""phantastic"". Gerard Butler stars as our famous phantom. I don't know but this Butler did not do it for me. Emmy Rossum was quite divine as Christine, the centerpiece of the phantom story. Rossum is a doll! Her opera singing & thespian contributions were delectable to watch. If she keeps it up, Emmy might end up winning some Oscars, Grammys, and you guessed it- Emmys! Patrick Wilson was prosaic as Raoul, the childhood love of Christine. Somebody should have ""Eaten Raoul"" out of this picture. What I thought spoke volumes of this musical was the vibrant art direction; what a piece of art! Frontrunner for an Oscar accolade! If you are not a musical film lover, than you will be tortured by this phantom. But if musicals are your cup of tea, then you will adore the majesty of ""The Phantom of the Opera"". *** Average",The Phantom of the Opera
45,MBunge,Another notch on Schumacher's headboard of shame,4,17 November 2010,"This big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's legendary musical is shockingly bad. I mean, the music is great and you can listen to it foreverbut watching it becomes an extended bother. A fairly stark refusal to adjust the story from a play to a film, combined with some especially shoddy filmmaking, minimizes every theatrical strength and emphasizes every dramatic weakness.Much like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, if you don't know the plot of The Phantom of the Opera by now, you've led a sad and deprived life. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) is a disfigured genius who skulks and hides around a Paris opera house. He trains a beautiful young girl named Christine (Emmy Rossum) in song and becomes obsessed with her. Christine falls in love with the handsome young Raoul (Patrick Wilson) and is torn between that love and her ethereal attraction to the mysterious Phantom. Christine and Raoul's love wins out, sending the Phantom into a jealous rage that eventually dooms him. Lloyd Webber puffs up a few of the minor characters, like the opera house's new owners and the reigning diva of the stage, to give him an excuse for a few more musical numbers to fill out the piece.If the only thing you care about in a musical is whether the music is any good, you'll probably love this film. The songs are great and this cast has got the pipes to carry them off. They may not quite reach the heights of their counterparts on the stage, but they're more than good enough. The costumes are also very pretty and some of the sets are impressive. That's about all the legitimately positive aspects of this movie.For the restugh. The plot, as it plays out in this film, doesn't make a lot of sense, is poorly presented and just staggers on and on until you're ready to collapse before it does. Even by the lax standards of musicals, it's very hard to explain or justify why many of these characters behave the way they do and how their actions are supposed to achieve their goals. To the extent things make sense, far too often it's due to characters bluntly explaining the story through song. That's often necessary when working within the confines of a play, even a very expensive and elaborate production. Those limitations don't apply to the silver screen and there's a decent amount of stuff here that needed to be cut out and refashioned to work in a different medium.This film also had some rather poor quality control. From the frequently cheap-looking make up job on Butler to more than a few moments when the actors' mouths are not synced up with what they're singing to the quite crappy, community-theater-looking layout of the Phantom's lair, there are times when this thing looks like some kind of low-rent production out of the late 1970s.The music IS great and there's a scene where you get a gander at Emmy Rossum's heaving cleavage. Miranda Richardson is also perversely attractive in a small role. But when you're making a movie out of a famed and beloved musical, you should be able to come up with more than that. I'm not sure who deserves more of the blame for The Phantom of the Opera being a lot better than what it is. However, when in doubt, always blame Joel Schumacher.Damn you, Joel Schumacher! Damn you straight to hell!",The Phantom of the Opera
46,CubsandCulture,Would be a lot better if the lyrics/dialog was cut...,7,25 November 2018,"This film absolutely moves. It is filled with intimate yet grand visuals; the cinematography is moody, operatic, scary and romantic. Schumacher is at the top top of his form and he does his own thing; the mise-en-scene is often more engaging than the plot. Likewise, Webber's score (the music itself) is hauntingly beautiful and captures the stories sinister obsession and uneasy romance. Sadly, the actors have to open their mouths.First none of the principals give a great vocal performance. They are not bad, but you can tell that the parts are just beyond their musical ability. But more importantly the lyrics are awful. Melodramatic, pitched and stilted they turn a story that is on the verge of being too operatic into a near self-parody. The ""music of the night"" indeed; give me a break.Re-watching the film today it struck me that it works far better as silent film with only Webber's music remaining. Schumacher's visual direction is expressive enough that the storytelling is clear just from the action. This is truly the unicorn of musicals in which the worse part of the film is sung.I must also note that the Phantom's make-up is far too understated. His alleged disfigurement looks no worse than a puffy bad sunburn. I realize that given that the film is stressing the romantic aspects of the story the Phantom would not be like, say, the 1929 horror version. Yet the make-up did not go far enough. The Phantom simply doesn't look like the Devil's child.I am glad I re-watched this; it is a lot better than I gave it credit for back in 2004.",The Phantom of the Opera
47,Chris_Docker,Very difficult to justify such tedious and superficial extravagance,4,12 December 2004,"Phantom of the Opera 4/10(review contains very minor spoilers)The film opens in Paris 1919, atmospheric and moody in black and white. The scene is an auction in what appears to be in an almost derelict theatre. An old musical clapping monkey machine is sold, and then a gigantic chandelier is introduced for purchase. As attention goes to a partially repaired chandelier, we jump back in time and the movie turns into full colour. It also turns into perhaps what could be termed the biggest and most disappointing blockbuster disaster since Pearl Harbor.Phantom of the Opera is a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical and has little to recommend it. Some of the singing is excellent - Emmy Rossum (as the heroine Christine) has a wonderful voice, but in this film-of-a-musical-of-an-opera many of the cast are firmly of 'musical' rather than 'operatic' quality. Exaggerated expressions as are much in evidence can look great on the stage, but have a ludicrous pantomime quality in cinematic close up. The acting is worthy of an amateur dramatics group and, although there are some nice sets, they can hardly justify the obvious cost and lack of skill that has gone into the production.It has been said that this is maybe more of a girlie film - appealing, perhaps, as the heroine achieves a star like voice with ethereal coaching rather than hard work, and is torn between an insipidly dashing good guy and an almost supernatural father-figure cum bad boy. When the two protagonists fight each other over her - one of them arriving on a white charger to do so - it must surely be every little girl's fairytale fantasy. That she is a whimpering starlet with no backbone of her own is a minor detail.Phantom of the Opera, in any hands other than Lloyd Webber, has all the ingredients for a great Gothic romance. It could be on a level with such classics as La Belle et La Bete, and at a fraction of the budget of this present shambles. But the moral vacuity, not to mention superficiality, of the play and this (copycat) film, appeals to an industry that knows how to part unthinking audiences from their pocket monies. Who cares if the Phantom is about as chilling as the fake snow, or the emotional depths as warming as an overheated stage light? The predictable flashback returns us to 1919 and there is a tiny glimpse of our monkey machine, the age old symbol of imitativeness: here, the bad guy tries to destroy his own image, and this is probably the most creative bit of the film - but hardly worth waiting so long for. There's a few reasonable songs, and the film will perhaps appeal to Webber diehards, but buying the soundtrack would not only let you pick and choose the best tracks, but save you sitting through two and a half hours of utter drivel.",The Phantom of the Opera
48,dwpollar,Captivating and well made adaptation...,8,6 September 2009,"1st watched 8/15/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Joel Schumacher): Captivating and well made adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical keeps you interested, for the most part, throughout the whole movie. It gets a little slow three quarters of the way in, but overall there is a good pace. The story is about a mysterious masked inhabitant of an opera house who wreaks havoc and expects to be heard and obeyed. The side story is about a new singer who gets caught in a love triangle with the Phantom and the new owner of the theatre. All the characters are well played by mostly newcomers and a new director to musical's in Joel Schumacher, who does a wonderful job in keeping the production lovely and watchable. The songs are pretty much the same as the Broadway version with a little added guitar and drums on an early piece, and most of them are very singable and catchy(which is probably why this musical lasted so long). This is a unique film in an era where musicals are not really that popular. The story has added backstories and flash forward black and white sequences to help round out the characters and understand where they came from, which definitely helps as well. All in all, a very well done movie that can be watched over and over – if only just to enjoy the music. Well done on this adaptation to everyone involved.",The Phantom of the Opera
49,noralee,"Alas, Is This the Death Knoll for New Movie Musicals?",3,23 December 2004,"My knowledge of the story or the music of ""Phantom of the Opera"" was only based on what has filtered into general popular culture. As I like movie musicals, I was prepared to sit back and enjoy on opening day, even when I cursorily looked at the few stars critics gave it in the morning papers.So I really wasn't prepared to discover that director Joel Schumacher is to movie musicals what Oliver Stone is to sword-and-sandal epics-- completely out of his element. I am very disappointed that the brief shining hope that a new Golden Age of Movie Musicals is upon us is gone.It seems that Schumacher has learned more from the leaden, overblown musicals of the '60's than the Technicolor Golden Age of fluid dancing and singing on screen. One yearns for at least Baz Luhrmann. The masked ball scene choreography suddenly echoes Bob Fosse, leading to the bemusement of what he might have done to insert more some razzle dazzle into a musical that thinks elaborate production design and costumes (and awkward wigs) --all of which will be lost on DVD/TV--will fill the eye when nothing else does.Schumacher was probably greatly handicapped by the overwhelming involvement of Andrew Lloyd Webber, as writer, producer, etc. because the music drags down the movie terribly with overblown orchestrations that drown some lovely melodies and slow the pacing inexorably. The recitatives did not sparkle and were not helped by slow camera work and editing.But the film also stops dead whenever Emmy Rossum is on the screen. I can only understand the accolades and nominations her performance is garnering based on the appeal of how she looks in lingerie, which she wears throughout most of the film, with a heaving bodice. The woman barely moves, giving the camera plenty of time to leer at her. What a relief that this ingénue is just barely legal as the Phantom's interest in her is creepy enough.While Minnie Driver is over the top as the Diva, at least she's lively.Miranda Richardson seems to be in a different movie, maybe as the housekeeper in that other ghost movie ""The Others."" Patrick Wilson, who was so good in HBO's ""Angels in America,"" strives manfully to put life into the stock Nice Guy and he succeeds when he gets to move into action hero mode.Just when the long movie makes sitting uncomfortable, Gerard Butler's Phantom ramps up the emotions and enlivens the screen.This is just the kind of opera that Gilbert & Sullivan would puncture.",The Phantom of the Opera
50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Brilliant. Beautiful. Breathtaking.,10,18 July 2016,"I've never seen The Phantom Of The Opera on stage, so so I have nothing to really compare Joel Shumacher's 2004 cinematic vision to, but I know that it was one of the most glorious and formative theatre going experiences for me, so much so that I think I probably went and saw the thing like eight times when it came out. I had never heard a single of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music before then and had not a clue as to what the story was. My extant of Phantom knowledge at that point was only of a chalky faced, emaciated Lon Chaney Jr. skulking around a silent black and white frame.I was cosmically blown away by the magic of it, the story, the songs, the rich production design and especially the two elemental lead performances from Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum. Again, no idea how the stage actors compare to these two, but Gerard and Emmy's take on the Phantom and Christine are now scorched into my psyche as the definitive versions. Butler nails the formula perfectly: scary when he needs to be, tender when he wants to be and always a formidable force of dark romanticism and tragic damnation. Rossum is like an angelic comet as Christine Daae, with the best singing voice of the cast and a presence that will bring the viewer to tears and make you instantly fall in love with her. Christine works in the prestigious Opera Populaire as a chorus girl, until she is shunted into the limelight when their prima donna of a star singer (a flat out brilliant Minnie Driver) walks off in a huff. Rossum then proceeds to move heaven and earth with her rendition of 'Think Of Me', accompanied by some of the most incredible camera work I've seen, sweeping through the elegant halls along with her crystal clear voice. The mysterious Phantom watches her from dark alcoves and hidden buttresses, entranced by her talent and brimming with love sickness. He has love in him no doubt, but we all know there is hate there too, catalyzed by an unfortunate deformation and a cruel past that has left him in exile. He basically runs the show from the shadows though, with utmost class and heaps of theatrical menace. Christine also has eyes for her childhood friend Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Wilson is the only player who seems a bit out of his depth, perhaps because he hadn't yet found the assurance in stride and charisma he has in his roles these days. Miranda Richardson is excellent as ever in an understated turn as Christine's aunt and teacher. Jennifer Ellison is her friend and fellow singer Meg. Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow are inspired as the comic relief duo who purchases the opera house, and watch for Kevin R. McNally as well. Every song is a winner, every frame composed of grandiose ambition and every ounce of vocal strength thrown forth by the cast, particularly Rossum and Butler who go a mile and then some, holding their own individual presence as well as pulling off the sorrowful chemistry between the Phantom and Christine. There's a few key sequences that should go down in the history books on how to stage a scene, including a dazzling masquerade ball, a wintry swordfight in a cemetery, the aforementioned Think Of Me, and my personal favourite: a mournful black and white prologue set decades after the story, kicking the film off with a rousing flourish of motion and music. I'm sure there are scores of people who swear by the stage production and want nothing to do with this, or simply weren't wowed to the levels I was. That's fine. For me though, I don't see any version ever topping this jewel of a film, and the classic two disc DVD sits proudly on my shelf, daring any other rendition, cinematic or otherwise to give it a run for it's money.",The Phantom of the Opera

But yet I was completely overcome by the movie's grand sets, attractive costumes and awesome cinematography - the very gorgeous appearance of this film was a sight to behold. Though I doubted her ability when I first laid eyes on her, I was quickly impressed with Emmy Rossum as the beautiful Christine. I was also entertained by the frequently humorous fits of Minnie Driver, who often stole the show with her comical approach to the obnoxious Carlotta. As for the Phantom himself, I have nothing to compare him with as I never saw the stage show, but I liked the fact that we could feel both pity for him and also despise him at the same time. He was enough of a villain when he needed to be, yet a sad and tragic character too -- and that was a hit with me. And I appreciated the fact that he was given an origin. I more readily accept crooning when it's kept onstage, but I tend to cringe when characters ""sing"" regular dialogue to each other in casual conversation.

55,EUyeshima,Opulent But Short-Sighted Adaptation of the Love-It-or-Hate-It Andrew Lloyd Webber Hit,5,26 December 2005,"The inarguable victory of this 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage hit is the artistry behind the elaborate sets, which can be credited primarily to art director Anthony Pratt and set decorator Celia Bobak. Otherwise your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much you love Lloyd Webber's music and the rapt romanticism at the heart of the old Gaston Leroux story. Personally, I much prefer the sheer musicality of Rodgers and Hammerstein, the razzle-dazzle of Ebb and Kander or the incisive witticism of Sondheim before giving a listen to Lloyd Webber's mostly overwrought work. His personal stamp is so indelible here that director Joel Schumacher's chief role seems to be to not get in the way with his own well-known commercially driven and often artistically deprived instincts.Regardless, I have to give credit to Lloyd Webber for his original inspiration to transform a standard horror story with Freudian implications into a swooning romantic operetta. On that level, the story succeeds in both live and filmed versions. Unfortunately, the journey from stage to screen is far more problematic beginning with the 1980's-sounding musical arrangements which severely date the movie. Surprisingly, no effort was made to update the sound of several musical numbers that have insistent electronic drum beats more fitting in a Studio 54-type venue. Another problem is the black-and-white framing device set in 1919 that Schumacher uses to treat the 1870-set story like a memory flashback. This technique is overused not only at the beginning and the end but at various unnecessary points throughout the film. Moreover, the movie feels overlong at 143 minutes, as Schumacher's storytelling feels lethargic and oddly underdeveloped, especially when compared to a live performance. There is a feeling of endlessness during the final stretch that proves exhausting despite the melodramatic resolution.Casting is also a challenge here but not because the three leads, all talented singers, are relative newcomers to films. Gerard Butler has the unenviable task of attempting to eradicate Michael Crawford's legendary stage performance as the Phantom. He is a rather lunkish presence for such a dashing, shadowy figure, and as a singer, he is somewhat of a shouter unable to display much emotional nuance. Butler becomes more effective in the final act but merely because he seems liberated after his character's unmasking. As the pursued Christine, Emmy Rossum is a lovely presence with a bright, bell-like soprano singing voice. Interestingly though, she is more successful as an actress than a singer here since her arias feel somewhat vacuous and worse, start to feel repetitive as the movie goes on. Patrick Wilson - memorable as the closeted Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' ""Angels in America"" - has the looks and voice to play Raoul effectively, but he seems misguided here as his character alternates between heroism and vengeance in a mercurial fashion that should be reserved for the Phantom.Far more effective in supporting roles are Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, the woman who seems to know all the secrets; Ciran Hinds and Simon Callow as Firmin and Andre, the new owners of the Opera House; and Minnie Driver at her most flamboyantly comical as the reigning opera diva Carlotta speaking a most unrecognizable Neapolitan accent. Ultimately, the Baroque nature of the film's story, coupled with its Gothic setting, still feels at odds with the Broadway-style musical numbers with the exception of the lovely rooftop duet between Rossum and Wilson on ""All I Ask of You"", as beautiful a ballad to come from Lloyd Webber as any of his other hits. At the same time, those who were enthralled with the stage version should find enough to please them with this version. For me, it was simply an underwhelming experience.",The Phantom of the Opera
56,TOMNEL,Really not all it's hyped up to be.,1,20 September 2006,"This is such a great musical with excellent music. But in order to deliver the music, you need good voices. The leading man playing the Phantom was mediocre at best. The direction was really bright and flashy and not really what the Phantom's about. Joel Schumaker's good at messing things up, and this is no exception. To explain the plot they added about 30 minutes of annoying dialogue. Emmy Rossum did a good job and has a good voice as Christine though. I saw the stage play a while ago with Michael Crawford and it was fantastic, while this was just average. Really disappointing! My rating: **/*****. 141 mins. PG-13 for violence.",The Phantom of the Opera
57,aharmas,a very romantic film,9,9 January 2005,"What's going on with most critics? Have they forgotten what it felt like to put together a work that is able to overwhelm you and recreate an emotion as powerful as love? If I went by their recommendations, I would be missing on something as magnificent as this film. True, some of the singing is not what it could have been, but 99% of what I saw impressed and touched me.The adaptation of the play is almost flawless. The performers do an outstanding job bringing to life the complexity of the characters and their emotional connections. The art decoration and costumes recreate an era that is no more, and the directing job of Mr. Schumaker truly eclipses other critical favorites out there. I wonder if there are guidelines that directors must adhere to in order to be recognized as doing good work.In the meantime, I look forward to seeing this again in the big screen, and will definitely buy it when it is released on DVD. On the other hand there will be some critical favorites that I would not revisit and will end up seeing them reevaluated six months from now when they are really seen for what they are: just a critical flash in the pan.",The Phantom of the Opera
58,triple8,Never loses it's beauty....,9,8 January 2005,"I have just come from seeing phantom and was completely swept away. The stage show is my all time favorite Broadway show and I was a bit nervous as to how Phantom and the music of the night would hold up on the big screen but I needn't have worried because it was very definitely worth the price of the ticket-and then some.The movie, for the most part, retains much of the stage show, I'd say about 85 percent true to the show, though there were slight differences. The magic present in the show live, is still, for the most part, here on film. In fact, I was wondering if I would cry during the movie and of coarse I did. Phantom of the Opera's's loveliness is still so luminous and the movie just fills your senses. I don't think there was a sound in the theater during the whole movie.The film's look-among the most riveting I've ever seen-colorful, rich and oozing vibrancy, the look and feel are just magnificent. I sure hope this movie wins some awards for it's costumes and Cinematography. At times, there was almost a bit TO much going on which, as my friends and I discussed takes the focus away from the music a bit and maybe(though I'm torn on this) they should have toned it down just a tiny tiny bit. Still, the look was so spectacular I'm not even sure I'd definitely have done that myself. But still, 10 of 10 for atmosphere.The casting-pretty good for the most part. I simply cannot believe Emmy Rossum is only 18 years old, she is magnificent and I am in awe of her. She was a beautiful, lovely Christine and I think we'll be seeing a lot of her in the future.Gerard Butler has been getting some flack. I actually liked him in the role of the phantom although I began to feel more strongly about his rightness as the movie went on, not right at the beginning. That is not because he wasn't good in the role, just different then the stage version. To me, his singing got more and more soulful as the movie went on and his acting was an A plus, he wasn't just there to sing and look pretty, he acted the heck out of the role and succeeded in elevating the phantom from just a presence to a tortured individual. People have been saying he's to good looking, well that's certainly not his fault!(though they really could have gotten a more realistic looking mask for him to wear.) And besides, his looks are transcended by the end, they lose their focus until we are barely aware of them. He did a really good job. Patrick Wilson surprised me the most, I think in a way, I enjoyed his voice the most. He was simply Superb, and he too, embodied Raoul. He is a talented actor with a moving, gently powerful voice and he was great. Minnie Driver, Miranda Richarardson-all great. Good casting choices.All in all a great night at the movies-I am giving this a 9 and I think if I had to say why it's not a perfect 10, it's just that this story was meant to, first be, a theatrical production, and as good as the movie was, and as many tears as I cried, it did not haunt me in the same way as the stage show. That does not take away from the movie's power or magnificence, I'm not even sure it could have been any better at all as a movie. It's just that seeing it live sends chills down my spine and haunts in a way that only a stage musical can do. I can actually understand how some people are not impressed by Phantom because, the bottom line is, this is as much about the music as the story and if one isn't a fan of this type of music, one probably won't simply find a lot here. But for those who have seen the beauty of Phantom on stage, they'll (probebly) love it and better yet, for those lucky enough to come into this film, and love it, WITHOUT having ever seen the play-see the play-because if you think the movie version is the stuff that magnificence is made of, think about all that live on stage right in front of you. This movie is good and I admiringly give it a 9 of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
59,onepotato2,irrelevant,2,23 January 2007,"As movie properties go, this one had to be fished from deep in the irrelevance bin to get made. It was filmed much too late, after the last persons interest in the show expired. This is typical with musicals, a number of which come to mind: Hair, Evita, Chicago, on average all made a quarter of a century after first appearing on stage. (!)It has grimy, nervous executive fingerprints all over it, no place worse than in the casting. Fearful of losing the adolescent male ticket buyer, who is interested in neither musicals or romances, they cast a Christine that can't be more than about 17, and to find the very numb, Emily Rossum's 17-year-old compelling enough to put this plot in motion, the phantom appears to be about 23 years old. Perhaps most ridiculous is that the movie posits that a guy who is in all respects a male model, with what amounts to about 4 sq inches of funky flesh, would find reason to become a self-loathing recluse. Uh, yeah you're built, buff, hot and young. gee; gosh, that's rough. I don't recall that Lloyd Webber even gets around to his back story, so what sits there on screen is pretty flimsy.Making it all much flimsier is Joel Schumacher's (the lightweight's lightweight) phony conception of space in the movie; exteriors are clearly interiors, interiors are clearly sets. Only musicals feel they can get away with this (Oklahoma's night scenes, Pirates of Penzance, One from the Heart, nearly all MGM musicals) Could the last person interested in this turn the lights out in the theater when it's done?",The Phantom of the Opera

61,rosscinema,"After this, maybe it's Webber who should go into hiding!",4,14 January 2005,"I'm one of those that never saw the stage rendition with Michael Crawford but from all accounts the critics never considered it a great show despite it's huge success. The casting is interesting in both a good and bad sense with little known Gerard Butler cast in the title role as the Phantom. It seems that the Phantom has been teaching up and coming singer Christine (Emmy Rossum) the finer points of his genius in opera and after a falling out between the new owners of the opera house and they're current diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver) young Christine steps in and becomes the new star in town.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Christine's secret with the Phantom is known only by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) but when the wealthy patron Raoul (Patrick Wilson) starts to get romantic with Christine than the Phantom becomes head over heels jealous and his presence becomes more open to everyone.Joel Schumacher was chosen by Andrew Lloyd Webber to direct probably because of his diverse range of film projects in his career and like his previous efforts he has put together a lavish looking film but while it looks great on the surface this is still something that for me didn't work on any level. I do think Emmy Rossum is a major talent and considering that she was a real opera singer at the tender age of 7 than she seems to be well cast. Two of the biggest problems comes from the casting of Butler and Wilson since neither one of them generate much in terms of charisma, charm, or screen presence for that matter. We can understand Christine's curiosity for the Phantom but as far as romance is concerned it seems ludicrous especially after his mask comes off and his face is revealed. From that point on this Phantom is more of a pathetic stalker than the mad genius he's originally thought to be. The mask itself is more of a fashion statement and you had to wonder how it stays on. The songs are a big issue if audiences are going to enjoy this musical and for me I found them overly dramatic and unconvincing especially during the scene when Raoul comes to rescue Christine towards the end of the film and we are subjected to musical numbers with ridiculous lines such as ""Free her, I love her"" but basically the music is just unmemorable. The film looks good and there is even some interesting uses of color but other than that (and the talent of Rossum) this is a completely empty spectacle with some of the dullest actors cast in lead roles since Miles O'Keeffe in ""Tarzan, The Ape Man"" but I think the real nail in the coffin is that for a musical it's one that doesn't possess a single song that's memorable which ultimately leaves the film pointless.",The Phantom of the Opera
62,Galina_movie_fan,"The Phantom of the Opera is there, inside my mind...",8,3 January 2006,"I love ""The Phantom of the Opera"" - what a fun, grand movie - it's got all the right components to entertain, to take you into the different dimensions for 143 minutes of its duration - sweet innocence with an angel voice, mysterious creature of the dark - genius and madman, prince charming (who in this case is just a viscount but who cares?). The film itself is spectacular, gorgeous, sparkling with the colors so powerful, images so magic and real, and melodies so...familiar.I don't know if it was the new cinema born in front of me or just a return to old good times when cinema was supposed to entertain, to take you to the Dream Worlds - someone said once that new is well forgotten old. Anyway, whatever it was, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" directed by Joel Schumacher, the way ""how it moves, how it looks, and how it plays"" is perfection itself and who cares that the story is silly and naive? Certainly, not me.",The Phantom of the Opera
63,nycritic,The Music of the Night Lives On,10,17 January 2006,"It's a given: the musical is here to stay. It never went away. As a genre it went underground for almost thirty years, popping up with the frequency of a Kim Stanley film performance, until Baz Luhrmann and his Red Curtain musicals and the success of CHICAGO made it ""cool"" for moviegoers.Andrew Lloyd Webber's massive stage success ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (still running, still going strong all over) gets the film treatment that many believe has been long overdue since the last memorable version was Universal's 1943 remake of the 1925 classic. This one bears no resemblance to either version, being a lavish vision of a Gothic romance, but is still a stunning film which grew on me after the second, more relaxed viewing free of prejudices and cynicism.I've never been one to like Joel Schumacher as a film director -- nothing personal, of course -- but looking back at his filmography and seeing his incursions into the Gothic genre despite a lack of a trademark style I can see why he was a great choice for this film version. He stays as faithful to the stage version as possible, as much as making his name in the credits an afterthought. His camera loves photographing everything and everyone it lays its eyes on and that is crucial in telling such an atmospheric tale.I don't think Schumacher made a casting mistake in having Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson, and Emmy Rossum play the leads: Butler's sad, masculine beauty and piercing eyes bring forth his inner torture. Wilson, while being the one who gets the girl, is supposed to be the milquetoast and nothing else -- it's been done since the beginning of film-making. Rossum is enchanting as Christine Vaae and benefits even more due to her young age where forbidden, dark love would fit. An older woman would not work. And I loved Minnie Driver as Carlotta! What a diva.Somehow I believe the amount of negative reviews from established film critics is based on a preference to the Lon Chaney film. I don't believe this version should be made to measure against Chaney's -- the styles are too dissimilar, the former being a straight-out horror classic and this being what it is: an opera, therefore high on emotion. Maybe time will grant ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER'S PHANTOM OF THE OPERA the cinematic value it has.",The Phantom of the Opera
64,lemon_magic,"May not entirely please fans of the Broadway cast, but well crafted and performed",7,2 January 2006,"Musical Theater - especially the faux-opera spectacles from Andrew Lloyd Webber - is not my favorite genre. IMO ""Moulin Rouge"" was a chaotic,unconvincing mess, and ""Chicago"" left me cold. But I did take my girlfriend to ""Phantom"" when it came through town, and I was interested in seeing what Schumacher could do with it. Schumacher has done some very good things (""Phone Booth"") and some very bad things (""Batman and Robin""), so I had no clue as to which side of the continuum this film adaptation would fall. To my relief, ""Phantom"" was very well done, and very compelling. I was especially pleased and surprised to see how well Gerard Butler filled the part of the Phantom. I knew he had a lot on the ball, but he was wasted in the male lead of two previous films (""Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life"" and ""Dracula 2000""), which is to say, he wasn't able to ""carry"" them or lift them above mediocrity. But he's excellent here...if fact, it almost seems as if acting from behind a mask enhanced his performances somehow. The film version takes advantage of the medium to do things (sets, live locations, medium range shots, closeups, zooms, etc) and add story elements that the stage version couldn't (or wouldn't), and in fact adds an additional story thread (filmed in grainy black-and-white) that actually adds a very lovely finish to the story. In fact, I may be a guy, but it brought a lump to my throat that the original stage play never could. It didn't try to just be a filmed stage play - although they did manage to include to big chandelier crash. In addition, the fact that you can actually see the actors' faces in closer shots allows the movie to put some heft and credibility to the whole idea of ""The Phantom Of the Opera Is In My Mind"". I had a lot of trouble buying into this in the stage play because everyone on stage had to bellow their emotions and reactions at the top of their lungs. But because the actors don't have to pitch their gestures and expressions (and voices) to the back row of the auditorium, they are able to flesh out the characters and make them more complete and believable to the audience. Butler can be more more of a sensual and seductive mystery man and less of a caricature of Svengali, and Rossum can be more a tempted woman and not so much a plaything. And the supporting cast really get a chance to shine and be more than simple background noise to the drama. The 'hero' who tries to rescue Christine especially benefits from this - he is allowed to sling a sword around and dash through tunnels, etc., As a result he is much more here that a lout who stands around and lets the Phantom drop a noose around his neck (as in the play). This is a gorgeously staged film. It can be tricky to pull off a 'play within a play', especially in a movie adaptation, but the production here offers some of the lushest eye candy, costumes and sets that a movie goer could ever hope for. If you are a fan of Merchant-Ivory and spectacle in general, you'll want to see this version of ""Phantom"". As for the actual music, well...I played in pit orchestras for years, and Weber doesn't really impress me. He's OK, but rewarded far out of proportion to his talent and effort. He's especially stingy with melodies - there are maybe 2 and 1/2 memorable melodies in ""Phantom"" (we all know 'em) and there's a whole bunch of really awkward and lazy rhymes and phrases in the libretto. But the cast and orchestra work like demons to get the music across. It's not quite the soundtrack with the Original Broadway Cast, but it is fervently performed and beautifully recorded. I only give ""Phantom"" 7 out of 10, but it's a ""strong"" 7, bumped up by the touching ending scene added by the film and the surprisingly impressive performance by Butler - it's great to see him coming into his own like this when I was afraid he would be what sank the film. Even if you have a shrine to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in your bedroom, you should give the movie version a try. I actually prefer it to the stage version I saw, if only because of the expanded story elements and the clearer vocals and staging. And again, I don't especially like musical theater.",The Phantom of the Opera

67,stensson,Much better than expected,7,30 January 2005,"But I didn't expect much. There is much to be said about Lloyd Webber's urge to have control. If you for example want to produce ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on the stage, you are obliged to direct move by move, letter by letter, according to the concept. And there are people from the Really Useful Group traveling to watch performances from time to time. What is the composer afraid of? But it's impossible to have that control in a movie. Or maybe it's not, but that won't make it a good film, and Lloyd Webber seems to have realized that. This is an example of really skilled cutting. It is according to the rhythm every second; the rhythm of the music, the plot and the acting.If you can call this acting really, because Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson aren't performing, they are mostly figuring. Miranda Richardson is an exception.

68,valadas,Rapturous music,7,26 January 2005,"I must begin to confess that I have not seen A. L. Webber's The Phantom of the Opera on stage. My only reference in terms of the story is the book by Gaston Leroux that I had read before seeing the movie. The movie stays reasonably faithful to the story of the book but avoids many details which are not needed here and it chooses to tell the whole story in flashback beginning with a romantic scene in black and white that continues in the end which in my opinion is totally dispensable since it doesn't add anything to its beauty. These scenes are excessively sentimental spoiling a bit the spirit of the opera and are not in the book, doing nothing to improve the story. Of course in an opera the story is always a mere pretext to the musical score with its arias and songs. Therefore we don't require there the same verisimilitude that we demand for a written novel. And here the score is simply beautiful and full of rapturous melodies which raise our minds and souls to the highest level of pleasure and ecstasy. The visual scenes are also beautiful though not as exceptional as the music. But they combine rather well for instance the brightness of the ballet sequences with the gloom of the scenes where the phantom appears. The performers do a very good job particularly Emmy Rossum in the role of Christine the maiden singer torn between the love she feels for the young viscount and the seduction which the Phantom exercises in her. Certain scenes particularly the last ones have great dramatic intensity mainly in what refers to the expression of inner feelings and sentiments. I think that those who have read the book will like this movie even more, which goes against the grain of the general tendency of movies made of books being usually not so good as them.",The Phantom of the Opera
69,KUAlum26,Haunting!,8,29 June 2005,"I feel like a lot of people are pretty familiar with the story of ""The Pahntom of the Opera"",so I think I'll skip much of the plot summary of this movie. THis,the third(?) adaptation of Gaston LeRoux's novel and the first genuine attempt to capture the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice musical treatment of the story to film. Filling Michael Crawford(among others)'s daunting half-mask and cape is Scotish actor Gerard Butler. I am not rightly familiar with his work to date,but this movie showcases his charisma and (I'm assuming here)his vocal talents. Emmy Rossum,who's been on quite a hot-streak lately with movies(Oscar-winning opus ""Mystic River"" and blockbuster behemoth ""The Day After Tomorrow"")shines as the ingénue Christine Daie. I have to assume that,too,is her voice in the movie and if so,SHE WAS AWESOME! Patrick Wilson is an earnest Rauol,who also spouts some great pipes! Minnie Driver(funny and strong as the short-tempered Italian diva),Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison are among the actors that round out this adaptation.The costumes,cinematography,sets,use of special effects and,of course,musical score are all lush and beautiful. A particularly good touch to this film was the use of contrasts between shots of the then-present,1919 and the storied past,1870,making the present cold and gray as opposed to the bright,vibrant colors of the past(""Big Fish"" also used this touch,more subtle and quite effective as well).I fear that fans of the stage production will feel shorted of the intimacy of the show in favor of a larger-than-life camera-friendly treatment. They shouldn't. This is about as fair a treatment of a Broadway production as possible.Last but not least...ah,yes,the music. Very familiar melodies that are as haunting now as they were when they were first put to stage! I dare anyone who sees this film NOT to be humming these tunes after they see this. Or at the very least,still hearing the music in their heads.",The Phantom of the Opera
70,pyrocitor,"More aesthetic experience than cohesive film, yet compelling enough to warrant viewing",7,21 April 2009,"The Phantom of the Opera marks a perfect example of a cultural text which manages to both be almost universally known within the realm of popular culture, yet have very little actually known about it, apart from an array of truncated facets (the mask, the cavern and, in the case of the musical, the Phantom's theme). As such, this widespread yet limited awareness makes the narrative a prime source (if any were to be) for revamping, with diverse adaptations ranging in tone from classical horror (Lon Chaney's 1925 original) to a straightforward slasher film (Robert Englund's 1989 version) to the stage musical, bringing fresh takes and further exposure to the story in different contexts. And in this respect, Joel Schumacher's version of the classic story proves decently successful, staying vigilantly faithful to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical text while incorporating an appropriately cinematic veneer, making the film an uncommonly justifiable and intriguing remake.While Schumacher's remaining generally faithful to Lloyd Webber's stage version is commendable, in many cases the adaptation stumbles in terms of translating fluidly to a cinematic text, feeling overly drawn out, long and poorly paced. The film's skeletal plot is mainly told in lengthy, repetitive song numbers which prove more distancing in film format than they would in a stage production, suggesting disciplined faithfulness being overruled in favour of judicious trimming might have been an uncommonly wise choice. While certain appealing artistic additions, such as the transitioning from a black and white 'present' to the almost full film 'flashback' in a side-scrolling sweep of vibrant colour help the film feel more alive and Schumacher's action credentials help the fight and chase scenes light up with punchy enthusiasm, these moments are few and far between, making the film frequently lag and feel in want of more happening (however, watch for an intriguing added last shot). Similarly, even the adaptation of the foundational text itself falls short of its true potential, as Schumacher appears to be content to somewhat coast by on the reputation of the story's traumatic love triangle rather than extracting all its possible devastating melodramatic punch, making the dialogue scenes comprised of characters talking at, not to, each other and the film's allegedly timeless love story feel strangely static and fall somewhat flat. Nonetheless, the musical genre is one recognised as being primarily spectacle driven, a perspective Schumacher seemingly takes to heart, as his film is not only a realm almost entirely governed by aesthetics. The majority of the film's bounty is in its visuals: the lush set and costume design, the sumptuously Gothic ambiance of the Phantom's dripping underground cavern contrasted with the almost ominously pristine luxury of the theater setting. Furthermore, having the majority of the film sung rather than spoken allows Schumacher to relish the largely exceptional vocals of his talented cast, ensuring that even if dramatically they may coast by, at least they sound engaging. However, even on the film's aesthetic front there remains room for improvement. While Schumacher's treatment of the Phantom's backstory is appropriately gruesome and tragic, come the dramatic reveal of his deformed face, an overly minimalist makeup job detracts from the built up horror. This adds an intriguing dimension suggesting the Phantom's ostracizing being cruelly unnecessary, yet also serves to deflate the narrative's most pivotal dramatic moment.Although Emmy Rossum does little to sympathise an occasionally frustratingly underwritten character, her impressively grand singing voice and quiet dignity make her nonetheless an appealing piece of casting as the romantically conflicted Christine. Gerard Butler is a more contentious choice as the titular character, demonstrating his lack of singing experience but delivering a powerfully fierce and wounded performance, turning the Phantom into a more sympathetic, tortured soul rather than mysterious monster. Patrick Wilson makes conventional romantic lead Raoul impressively compelling, adding interesting morally ambiguous notes in the midst of his dashing charisma. Minnie Driver, despite having her opera singing dubbed, masticates scenery with wonderful relish as conceited diva Carlotta, but Miranda Richardson feels mostly wasted, her subtly mysterious performance doing little to make her underwritten Madam Giry an appealing character. More of a visual and auditory experience than cohesive narrative film, Schumacher's take on the classic story still boasts sufficient Gothic ambiance to remain decently haunting and engaging, in spite of its frequent pitfalls. Almost certainly bound to be treasured by fans of the stage musical, the film's leisurely, uneventful pacing and repetitive song numbers may repel certain audiences, but is just as likely to entrance inexperienced viewers, ensuring that The Phantom of the Opera will remain in the minds of the general public.-7/10",The Phantom of the Opera
71,sarastro7,Loud enough to be grand - and yet a partial failure,7,14 January 2005,"My expectations for this movie version of The Phantom of the Opera were very high indeed. I went to the Danish opening today - the 6:30 PM screening -, and throughout the day I had the music churning around in my head, so you can say I was well prepared. As the movie began, I was thrilled. The initial transition from the black and white to the color coming alive along with the deliciously loud music was truly grand - for long minutes I had chills down my spine. And when Emmy Rossum sang her first opera part, I sat spellbound and elated by her marvelous voice.But, as the story went on, it became boring. It couldn't keep my attention very well. The music was not that great; too many of the same themes repeated again and again, and not enough cinematic atmosphere to substantiate them. The story didn't have a terrible lot of depth; it is really only there to provide a structure for the music and the singing.Still, towards the end of the movie it started captivating me again. And the way Christine forgave the Phantom when he pleaded for her love, kissing him, and probably would have given up Raoul for his sake, I was again very moved.But it wasn't enough. As the movie ended, I found myself disappointed. The movie had not managed to underscore the songs with a sufficiently memorable visual environment. Pictures and music had not become conjoined to form a suitably impressive artistic achievement. I must conclude that, in most cases, a musical such as this is better fit for the stage, where the scarce set pieces do not detract from what is really important: the music and the voices.On the other hand, as a principle I do not believe that one medium cannot be successfully merged with another; given enough inspiration and artistic ability, anything is possible. So the final conclusion is that the film-makers in this case simply did not manage to create a visual universe spectacular enough to really give the music and songs meaning.My rating for this movie cannot be higher than a ""6"" or a ""7"" - because I'm in a generous mood I will make it a ""7"". But I thought it was something of a wasted opportunity. The songs may not be timeless classics, but they deserved to be given some more memorable scenes and situations than this movie managed to give them.",The Phantom of the Opera
72,mentalcritic,One of the better musicals of the past ten years,8,24 April 2005,"In the past couple of years, someone in Hollywood decided that musicals were the in thing again, and a minor slew of them flooded into theatres. Unfortunately, and to be as brutally honest as my people are renowned for, many of them were just plain execrable. Chicago and its flat, lifeless performances that totally fail to capture the essences of the characters being a good example. The difference here is that unlike Chicago, I have never seen The Phantom Of The Opera on stage. Some would argue that this allowed me to judge the film on its own merits, which is fair enough. But I believe the best judge of an adaptation is one who is extremely familiar with the source material, so take this comment for what it is worth. Having said all that, however, I watched POTO on the recommendation of another IMDb boards user, and I am glad that I did.At its heart, POTO is the tale of a lost outcast from polite society who is quite disfigured, even by today's standards, and cannot live in anything but shadow. He has lived a good portion of his life in the Opera house where most of the action is set. For reasons that are not fully explored in the film, he considers this Opera house to be his, in spite of the fact that it has been bought by scrap metal merchants. The previous owner paid him quite a large sum of francs to not interfere in the running of the house, an arrangement he attempts to enforce upon the new owners. The real meat of the story is when the young chorus girl whom he has trained (or so the film implies) is given a chance to step into the limelight. At several points in the story, she competes with the bitchy diva known as Carlotta for the centre stage. The house's owners want Carlotta to attract an audience, while the Phantom's artistic sensibilities demand that Christine take her place. As the Phantom himself says, Carlotta might be demanding and vocally talented, but she cannot act worth a damn.Aside from Miranda Richardson, who put in a delightful performance ages ago as Elizabeth I of England, along with Minnie Driver, whom some will remember from Grosse Point Blank, the cast is mostly made up of European or British unknowns. To its advantage, this allows the audience to look past their expectations of the stars and focus on the performances. When the cast are merely acting, the performances work wonderfully. The scrap metal merchants in particular are wonderfully played, with their prissy, fussy manners often providing much of the comedy. The title role is played by a man the same person who recommended the film to me cannot stop raving about: Gerard Butler. Butler's presence in the film, well, let's just say that the success or failure of the film, to a large extent, rested on his shoulders. That he succeeds in spite of the obvious pressure ensures he will be worth watching in years to come.The film is not without its fair share of flaws, however. The 2.35:1 frame is used with variable elegance. Some shots are beautifully dynamic, although not as much so as some films I could name. Others seem so empty and flat that it is enough to make one wonder why a variable aspect ratio approach was not used. But the real problem in this film is that the musical numbers and the dialogue sequences do not seem to gel together. I realise this is not the fault of the film itself, but some of the songs feel just too repetitive for my ears, and others contain far too much operatic wailing. Yes, we are impressed that the voices of Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver's vocal double can reach so high, but Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey have done an excellent job of killing what little there was to be gained from showing this off excessively. A musician is far more impressive when he (or she) fits in properly with the rest of the band. Add to this that the musical numbers often interrupt the flow of the dialogue sequences, and it is yet another credit to the actors that the audience can stay so immersed in the story. In the grand scheme of things, these flaws are easily outweighed by the strengths, but they still should be taken into account.Out of ten, I am giving The Phantom Of The Opera, circa 2004, an eight. It is not the best musical I have ever seen, but compared to others whose producers mistakenly believe to have revived the genre, this one is the genuine article. Even if you are not a fan of musicals, and have never seen an opera, this is worth watching twice.",The Phantom of the Opera
73,marcin_kukuczka,Movie spectacle and music at its peak of splendor. True WORK of ART!,9,1 February 2005,"Paris, 1919, black and white world. Old Count de Chagny visits the auction in Opera Populaire, a place filled with the ghosts of the past, haunted by the memories of his youth, now neglected and seriously touched by the tooth of time. Suddenly, when a mysterious chandelier is uncovered, the visually stunning moment brings us back to the heyday of this place and to mysterious events that took place 49 years earlier...I went to the cinema to see this movie because I thought it would be another musical with nice decorations, costumes, and, of course, music. A kind of relaxation for these 2 hours in a comfortable movie theater seat. What I saw from the very beginning was far beyond my expectations! A visually stunning movie with gorgeous music, talented cast, beautiful decorations, and a thrilling content. It's difficult to fully express my admiration with words.The music is absolutely wonderful! All hits, from sentimental ""Think of Me"" through ""Angel Of Music"", ""Music of the Night"", ""Prima Donna"", lavish ""Mascarade"" to the bit filled with sexual desire, ""Point of No Return"" are of high quality. If you like the musicals or opera music, you will absolutely love the hits from this film.The cast give wonderful performances. Truly memorable Emmy Rossum is great as Christine Daae. Very young, beautiful... no doubt the phantom fell in love with her head over heels... Minnie Driver as Carlotta is EXCELLENT! This accent (English combined with Italian and several English varieties), her mimics - she really supplies the movie with funny moments beautifully portraying Carlotta's panic combined with anger and jealousy. Gerard Butler presents a sympathetic portrayal of the phantom, Patrick Wilson as Raoul focuses on his delicate love to Christine, and Jennifer Ellison... her beauty and sex appeal are equally worth your attention as Emmy Rossum's. Some people considered her too sweet, but I loved her performance as Meg Giry. Moreover, isn't she strikingly similar to Miranda Richardson (Madame Giry), as her movie mother? The whole movie is very, very good, but for me, personally, two moments were of utmost interest and admiration. First, when the phantom shows Christine his illusive world of darkness. The atmosphere is intensified by the title hit: ""The Phantom of the Opera"". And second, when Christine visits the cemetery with her father's grave. The mystic atmosphere, some moments of silence, the images of sculpted angels covered with snow are really hard to be skipped. And from the technical point of view, the scene is a masterpiece.Do see the movie. Critics do not realize that they don't allow others to see the beauty in this film. THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA combines the most important aspects of cinema in general: thrilling atmosphere, music, love story, splendor, fun, EVERYTHING! It is a movie that talks to the very core of human desire for beauty, splendor, magnificence, and, most importantly, love. A real WORK OF ART!",The Phantom of the Opera
74,gftbiloxi,"Weak Direction, Cinematography, and Adaptation Blunts Stage Spectacular",6,11 June 2007,"Very loosely based on both the Gaston Leroux novel and its several film versions, Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has always been considered something of an artistic flyweight with little substance but tremendous flash. And flash it did on the stage: stunning performances and spectacular set pieces coupled with bombastic music made for a truly exciting show. It was a huge success in London and New York, and it is still very much alive and kicking on stages from one end of the world to the other.Unfortunately, the film version doesn't really manage to catch the character the show has in live performance. This is partly due to the cast--Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson are unexpectedly weak in both vocals and acting skill--but the real damage is done by director Joel Shumacher and cinematographer John Mathieson, who have bitten off quite a bit more than they can chew. Most of the set pieces that looked so great on stage seem very small indeed on the screen, and by and large they can't come up with anything to equal or replace them.The result is a film that constantly teeters between glorious and insipid. On the glorious side, Emmy Rossum has tremendous personal charm and a truly magnificent voice; she is utterly unaffected and makes the improbabilities of the leading role seem quite believable. Minnie Diver is also memorable in the role of the temperamental Carlotta, ridiculous, over the top, and utterly convincing; the supporting cast, which includes Miranda Richardson, is also quite fine. And certainly no one could complain about the production values: there's a lot of money on display.But the first two thirds of the film drag, and again it is largely due to Shumacher's incredibly passive direction and Mathieson's truly uninspired cinematography--it is hard to imagine how one could take ""Masquerade,"" one of the stage show's most brilliantly realized numbers, and arrive at such total sterility. Nor does it help that, with Webber's approval, the show has been fiddled a bit, with bits and pieces of the plot moved around in sequence; it must have seemed like a good idea to some one at the time, but it has the result of bunching up all the really good stuff at the end.But fortunately for all concerned, it's the end that really works. From the moment that ""Don Juan Triumphant"" takes the opera stage everything from orchestration to performances to action is flawless. I give the film six stars for Rossum's performance and the final third--but without them, sad to say, this would be a three-star show.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Phantom of the Opera

It is a cinematic masterpiece with rich, artfully crafted cinematography. They have added some scenes and changed a few things to adapt the project to film. And film allows special effects that would be far more difficult on a theatre stage. It's also interesting that they have delivered such a superb production without big names.

76,DarthBill,The Opera of the Phantom,8,27 February 2006,"Based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that was based on the book that inspired one of the great Lon Chaney films, this is one highly out of its head film that will take you up, put you down and throw you down. But it's still better than ""Moulin Rouge"".It is the story of the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler), the disfigured musical genius who just wants to be loved when not hearing or making or assisting in the creation of great music with a mad hard on for teeny bop-per singing sensation ingénue Christine (Emmy Rossum). The only thing standing in his way is Christine's lover Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Music and mayhem ensue.Gerard Butler has undeniable presence - he really knows how to work that cape - but at times the quality of his singing voice wavered. In some songs he rocked, but in other songs it felt like you could hear his voice cracking and straining and just plain falling down as he tried to get the emotion across. A tenor with a background in singing for a rock band, Butler was widely criticized when the film was released for not having the vocal range necessary to portray the character, which is not good since the bulk of the Phantom's dialogue is sung rather than spoken. But like I said, Butler's got a strong enough presence that he's able to balance out his sometimes unpolished singing with just standing there in all the Phantom's black glory (too bad much of mystery and appeal is lost towards the end when Christine rips off not only the mask but reveals that his slicked back black hair was actually a toupee covering a long mane of gray hair - how he got so much of it under one tiny hair piece is a mystery, as is how the hairpiece came off so easily towards the end when he managed to keep it in place for the bulk of the movie).Rossum and Wilson are quite fine in their roles. Grandiose staging and atmosphere is also a plus. If Schumacher keeps this up people might finally forgive him for the latter two Batman films.",The Phantom of the Opera
77,gkeith_1,Excellent,10,27 December 2004,"Beautiful. Happy. Sad. Haunting. Christianity vs. evil. Lots of religious symbolism. I love musicals. Song and dance movies are my absolute favorite. The dancing/choreography was superb. Music loud, boisterous and lovely. Phantom turned out to have a sad, ""hurt little boy"" side. The actor pulled it off well. He was a tall, driven, dashing figure. Too bad he had to live underground. Christine was beautiful, with a lovely soprano voice. She needed to enunciate better, though. Her song word endings could have been much sharper and clearer (she needs my voice coach). Her young age is no excuse. I kept looking for her mouth to form the words to these songs, but I was disappointed. Raoul was sweet and kind, but a bit too meager in body size. His singing voice is quite nice, and I wish I could have heard more of it. Carlotta was a total trip, and Driver played the role with rollicking camp. Madame Giry was a beautiful, pathetic figure with a big heart and wise demeanor... This Christine is so sweet, and certainly carried the movie... I was waiting for the big chandelier crash scene, and it was spectacular. The auction at the beginning of the movie was quite telling; the black and white cemetery scene near the end was heartbreaking. The earlier cemetery scene with Christine at her father's tomb actually turned out to be an exciting and dashing swashbuckler between O.G. (Opera Ghost) and Raoul -- both fighting over the beautiful woman they love... The black, gray and white flashbacks/flash forwards were chilling, and the contrast of the full color pickups of the main story were superb. Overall, an excellent movie. Keep bringing back the song and dance musicals, the ballet, the opera, the awesome musicians, the wonderful costumes: the storytelling via beautiful soprano, baritone and tenor voices. 12/10.",The Phantom of the Opera

Also a young lady living at the opera house is Christine Daae, who has been taught singing by a man she has never seen. When the new opera starts an accident causes Carlotta, to be taken off stage and Christine takes her place and does very well.

Also on the night of her performance Christine, meets a childhood sweetheart named Raoul, and soon fall in love again. And soon the legendary phantom begins to make himself more evident in the opera house and Christine, and Raoul can no longer keep their love a secret from the phantom who is also in love with Christine. To finally capture the phantom, Christine must perform in a play he wrote to finally relieve her and Raoul of his madness. The film itself is an opera and is told through singing. Winner of The BFCA Award for Best Actress (Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine Daae) at The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, The NBR Award for Best Breakthrough Performance By An Actress at The National Board Of Review and The SDFCS for Best Cinematography at The San Diego Film Critics Society Awards.

The film (which was originally in development for over 10 years) is a lavish and beautiful production down to every last detail. The film looks beautiful with it's cinematography, costumes, art direction, set and makeup and the music is great and the film is extremely well crafted. The actors and actresses can also sing and act and bring the whole story together with great and solid direction by Joel Schumacher, who I have been disappointed by in the past but proves himself a stylish director with this film. The film is dreamlike, compelling and extremely entertaining as well. I did see the stage play of The Phantom Of The Opera several years ago and it did nothing for me but on screen it really left an impact on me and I've talked to those who like the stage play a lot and they agreed the screen gives a lot more to the film that couldn't be done on stage.

80,Danusha_Goska,Oooo! Aaaa! The Incoherence! The Ripped Bodices! The Spectacle!,6,1 January 2005,"""The Phantom"" is spectacular to look at. The music is still bad, and the plot has been weakened and distorted to where it doesn't make much sense. But the movie is fun, because the visuals are so well done.The plot, of course, concerns a disfigured musical madman who lives out his days beneath an opera house in Gilded Age Paris, pining away for the girl he loves, a singer, Christine.The Phantom and Christine enjoy a few bosom-heaving clinches; there are a couple of duels; there is a visit to a cemetery with spectacular statuary; there is a masked ball; there is a visit to an underground love nest that's part Playboy Mansion and part Madame Tussaud's wax museum; there are a few operas.If you like seeing bare-chested men wearing bright turquoise eye shadow, and Minnie Driver in a three-foot high powdered wig, and wooden elephants, and stallions, and naked, gilded statues, and yearning caresses that never get to second base, this is your movie.I really enjoyed ""Phantom"" for all those high camp, ultra kitsch, Cecil B. DeMille features. Really, there aren't enough movies out there featuring bare chested men in bright turquoise eye shadow.Oh, and Gerard Butler as The Phantom is male heat on a stick. Women are gonna be swooning over this performance for as long as there are DVDs. If he doesn't have one already, Butler has got to hire a body guard -- the same type that Elvis used.Emmy Rossum is as beautiful as a bouquet of roses, and as sweet.The costumes are to die for. All those ""puffy shirts"" from Seinfeld are used here. Emmy Rossum is dressed in yards and yards of white lace; even with all those yards, her heaving bosoms, very pretty, and legs are on full view.I was resigned to the music. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who can't stand Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, and people who need to be sent to musical reeducation camp. But, the sets, in the previews, looked so great, I thought, I can put up with the aural assault.But I really wish the plot had at least been coherent.You go in knowing that ""Phantom"" is a romantic fantasy, a confection, a fairy tale.But you can make a fairy tale that is coherent and has some depth -- see Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which has much in common with ""The Phantom."" That film is also a romantic fantasy, delicious to look at, but it hangs together. It makes some sense.Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom"" just does not.The possible passions and tensions between Christine and the Phantom are only hinted at. The film could have dramatized Christine's artistic ambition. The Phantom, as her singing teacher and author of an opera in which she stars, offers her the allure of stage success, which Raoul, her suitor, could never give her. This potent source of tension is never explored.Too, characters' actions, especially Christine's, are weirdly unmotivated. Why does the Phantom show up at a party where he could easily be apprehended? Why does no one apprehend him? Why do his facial deformities not show at this party, as they will later? Why does a key character, in a key scene, promise to do something, and then, moments later, not do that very thing? Etc.It's all a big mess. And that's a shame, because there is so much there.But, it's lovely to look at. Gerard Butler as the lovely Phantom is worth the price of admission.",The Phantom of the Opera

I also saw the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version with my Mom, and it was awesome.

Patrick Wilson was perfect as Raoul: handsome, and with a voice as smooth as silk. And about Gerard Butler, his emotional range is absolutely stunning. Not since Richard Burton in Doctor Faustus or Laurence Olivier in Richard III have I seen an actor who can encompass so many levels on the turn of a dime: murderous rage; intense sexuality and longing; incredible vulnerability. And as for his singing. His voice was beautiful, sensuous, and the amazing thing was his singing matched every emotion he was feeling from highest to lowest.Overall, all I have to say is I really love this film.

82,TheNorthernMonkee,decent attempt but it will age badly,6,17 December 2004,"SPOILERS When asking the general public about musical theatre, the one name which will come up time and time again is that of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Responsible for some of the finest plays to his the London West End, arguably his finest piece has now been transformed into a major Hollywood blockbuster. The result is a decent enough try, but it drags in the middle, was made ten years too late and will age very badly.In Paris in the late 1800s, the Operahouse is a place and passion and sound. With arrogant singers (Minnie Driver as Carlotta) and drunken backstage crew, it is a far from perfect surroundings. Once a beauty called Christine (Emmy Rossum) opens her mouth however, everyone takes notice and everyone experiences the beauty of the music. In the dark shadows beneath the building however, Christine's teacher, The Phantom (Gerard Butler), sits and plans his next move.At the theatre, this musical piece of genius has been playing for longer than anyone can remember. Staring Michael Crawford as the Phantom, it made millions as people flocked from around the world to see it. Now relocated to the big screen and with a new cast, it is given a new life by performances from Crawford's replacement Butler and the beautiful Emmy Rossum.From the opening black and white scene in Paris, this film gives a polished and professional look. Ultimately though, it has some key flaws.Whilst there is no denial that Gerard Butler is not as good as Michael Crawford, any criticism on Butler would be harsh. Slotting into the role of the Phantom, he gives a credible performance which is worthy of merit. Since the start of filming he's gone from tone deaf to a man with a decent singing voice. He's put a LOT of effort into mastering a difficult skill and for that he deserves praise. Sometimes though, experience and a natural talent are necessary and whether Butler can put out a superb tune or not (which he can), the most famous Phantom of them all would have been preferable.The fact that Michael Crawford is superior leads onto the key main problem with this film. Basically it was made ten years too late. For years Andrew Lloyd Webber has wanted to make a film of the musical, but for one reason or another he failed. As a result, this recent version feels dated before it's even finished it's run at the cinema. With the way technology and special effects are today, the director Joel Schumacher (perhaps one of the finest, modern directors never to win a major award) could have helped Webber to bring his story into the new millennium. The film could quite easily have been a vastly superior event with advancements on the stage production. Sadly though, and one suspects this might be something to do with Webber's ego, what we have been given is the age old play simply put on the big screen with minimal improvement. The key examples of this are a stunning piece of graphic involving a fire at the Opera House and the way that it keeps switching between the black and white future and the colour of the past. These techniques could have been used throughout the film and created something special. Sadly though this never happened.All in all, the true point of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is the music, and on this point it personally feels like they've done a superb job. Fans of the stage production will no doubt adore this film (either that or pine for Michael Crawford) and claim it is a successful film. Truthfully, for what they and Webber desire, that's probably accurate. For the up and coming generations though who might never have seen the musical before, this could, and should, have been something significantly better. Sorry Lord Webber, but keep your musicals on the West End where they belong.",The Phantom of the Opera
83,johnstonjames,"Liked The Stage Play, Loved The Movie.",8,10 January 2011,"i saw 'POTO' on stage at the music center back in the late eighties. i also had the privilege of seeing the legendary Michael Crawford do his most famous role. i really enjoyed it, but i couldn't help thinking as good as it was it all seemed a little superficial and cold, high-gloss, entertainment.i pretty much expected the same of the movie version, but having enjoyed the play and having seen it on stage i felt a certain curiosity about the movie. i was surprised to find i enjoyed as much or even more than i did the stage version. it almost seemed as if the musical version was always meant to be on screen.so much of the scenes from original cinema versions are here. the crashing chandelier which was featured in the Claude Rains version, the subterranean water canals and the gondola from the B&W Lon Chaney version. these touches give the 2004 film a very cinematic feel for a stage musical.and with due respect to Michael Crawford, who is a better actor, Gerard Butler was a more masculine phantom with a deeper less feminine sounding voice. Crawford was great on stage, but his high pitched long notes might have seemed a little too soprano for a film aimed at a broader audience. i mean Joel Schumacher probably didn't want to totally turn this into a chick flick.it still sort of ends up being kind of a grandiose chick/date flick kind of movie. as good as Butler's performance is, Emmy Rossum is better as Christine. and she is a little better than Sarah Brightman was in the role originally. something hard to do since Brightman was so brilliant. but that was the problem with Brightman, she was always a little over-powering as Christine. Christine should seem a little softer and understated, something Rossum does better.there is also a captivating hilarious performance by Minnie Driver as the clownish diva Carlotta.it's also great to see Miranada Richardson as always, and interesting to note that this film featured Patrick Wilson just prior to his powerful performance in the amazing 'Hard Candy'.the production was lavish, the direction top notch and the songs are la la webby fun. i sing 'em in the shower all the time. la la.",The Phantom of the Opera
84,Libretio,Visually stunning adaptation of the old literary warhorse,7,6 March 2005,"THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)France, 1870: The Paris Opera House is haunted by a mysterious figure (Gerard Butler) who tutors a young opera ingénue (Emmy Rossum) and becomes enraged when she falls in love with a handsome nobleman (Patrick Wilson).Joel Schumacher's long-planned adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ultra-successful stage musical opens with the greatest set-piece of this director's career: A spine-tingling shift from grainy monochrome to saturated color as the timeframe switches from 1919 to 1870, restoring the dilapidated Opera House to its former glory in a swirl of visual effects trickery. It's a powerful moment, one which encapsulates the very essence of this venerable cinematic warhorse. What follows is every bit as sumptuous as the stage show, with a younger cast in familiar roles: Newcomer Rossum is an angelic Christine, beautiful and talented in equal measure, while Wilson shines as her lovestruck admirer, whose dalliance with Christine invites the Phantom's wrath, played with strength and conviction by Butler. Simon Callow and Ciarán Hinds provide comic relief as the Opera's new owners, and there's strong support from Miranda Richardson (the Opera's ballet mistress, bound to the Phantom by more than mere coincidence), Minnie Driver (generously eccentric as the obstinate diva whose monstrous ego and limited talent prove to be her undoing), and veteran Murray Melvin as the frazzled orchestra conductor (a sublime, near-wordless performance).The film is a spectacle in all senses of the word, designed and photographed to glorious cinematic excess. Webber and Schumacher financed the production independently, so the finished product is true to their respective vision, but while the results are a feast for the senses, it's also compromised in unusual ways: Except for the chandelier sequence and an earlier scene in which the Phantom murders a nosy stagehand (Kevin McNally), Schumacher de-emphasizes the horrific elements of Gaston Leroux's original novel in favor of Gothic visuals (note the Cocteau homage during Christine's first visit to the Phantom's subterranean lair), and he's too quick to reveal the Phantom as a flesh-and-blood creature without any supernatural trappings, which undermines his potency. Those unfamiliar with the stage show may also bristle at the amount of dialogue which is SUNG rather than spoken, draining several crucial scenes of their dramatic urgency, especially during the film's final stretch, though the climactic pay-off is genuinely heartfelt. Romantic, resplendent, defiantly old-fashioned, this 'Phantom' overcomes its minor obstacles to emerge as a triumph in every department.",The Phantom of the Opera
85,FloatingOpera7,Phantom Of The Opera: An Oscar Worthy Musical Film,10,1 February 2005,"Phantom Of The Opera (2004): Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, Jennifer Ellison, Simon Callow, Ciaran Hinds, Victor McGuire, James Fleet, Director Joel Schumacher, Music and Lyrics By Andrew Lloyd Webber, Based On The Novel By Gaston Leroux.""When will the flames of love at last consume us ? "".....This is director Joel Schumacher's stunning film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's successful 1986 Broadway musical based on Gaston Leroux's classic dark romance. Originally set for release in 1990, and to star Broadway stars Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, Webber canceled the making of the film as he dealt with his divorce from Sarah Brightman. Schumacher(of Batman movie fame) was not used to directing this type of film, allowed Webber to handle production. And what a brilliant production. While many snubbed it, including the Oscars and hardcore fans of the original Broadway stage musical, I find it to be the most beautiful and emotionally moving musicals on film. Gerard Butler provides the right amount of youthful intensity and sex appeal to the otherwise ""monstrous"" role of a psychotic, disfigured outcast and his strong baritone voice is wholly suited to the tortured Phantom, who far from the creepy, airy, older-sounding, whimsical Crawford portrayal, is more real and therefore more sympathetic. His Phantom should not be judged according to his singing but through his acting. Ultimately, his Phantom is the most romantic and most agreeable to younger audiences. When Christine makes it clear she chooses Raoul Comte De Chagny (Patrick Wilson) over him, his heart is broken and we feel his pain. Patrick Wilson, on the other hand, is a little less interesting, playing the role of Raoul as if to honor the old ""pretty boy of silent films"" or at least a Fabio, romance novel style hero and naturally, his performance is pale in comparison to the more compelling Gerad Butler. Rising star Emmy Rossum, trained to sing at the Metropolitan Opera but choosing film actress as her career, makes a very feminine, vulnerable and dulcet Christine Daee and she encompasses the spirit of the literary heroine, who is only a teenage ingénue made into a reluctant diva, quite well. British star Miranda Richardson, in French accent and credible acting (she is the only one that doesn't really sing!) portrays Madame Giry, Christine's adopted mother and the ballet mistress, who rescues the Phantom from a dire fate as a child and harbors his dark secret from all members of the Opera company. Minnie Driver hams it up as the vainglorious and bitchy company diva Carlotta. The rest of the film, in terms of its production values and cinematography, is breathtaking. It's the little touches here and there that give it real strength. For an independent film, it ranks as the most expensive. A large, French Second Empire opera-house set and chandelier was created to replicate the Paris Opera (called Opera Populaire in the musical) and the art direction and costume design is evocative of Paris in the 1870's and pays homage to Leroux's Gothic romance, most especially in the cemetery scene in which the Phantom and Raoul fight a duel, in the historically correct element of poor city ballerinas living in the dorms of the Opera (at one point, as the Overture plays early in the film, the ballerinas rushing down a winding staircase even evoke a Degas painting. The costumes are authentic to the time period. Especially noteworthy is Christine's opera debut gown- a white diaphanous gown with full, billowing skirt, as well as the diamond star-bursts in her hair and earrings, which resembles the portrait of Elisabeth of Austria/Vienna. This is not surprising when one considers the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of the most important collectors of artwork from this period, and would be familiar with the portrait. He suffused the whole film with details that are authentic to the time period and employed imagery and visual effects not possible on a stage. The greatest example of this is the structure of the film. We are treated to the older Raoul's point of view. Christine has died, he buys the monkey music box at the Auction of the newly built Opera where, upon seeing the restored chandelier, he remembers everything that happened. All this is shot in black and white like a silent film but when we are in the past, we see everything in color. For the first time, we experience the Phantom's traumatic childhood when he was showcased as a circus freak before being rescued by the young Madame Giry. So much to admire: The Phantom's underground lair, where candelabra rises up from the water, his ""musical kingdom"" where he has an organ and has recreated diminutive figurines of the members of the Company and even a wax mold doll of Christine, the celebrated ""Phantom"" duet in which the Phantom takes Christine via a black barge to his lair, the ""Past the Point of No Return"" sequence (which resembles a cross between Zorro and Mozart's Don Giovanni), Christine and Raoul's duet at the top of the Paris Opera on a snowy night, the magnificently shot graveyard scene, the burning opera house and crashing, falling chandelier and the moving finale in which the Phantom, having given up Christine to Raoul, disappears, is all very moving. The film's ending is very poignant and impossible to stage. Raoul visits Christine's grave and notes a curious thing: the Phantom's signature rose is also on Christine's grave, indicating that the Phantom is very much alive, possibly as old as he is and also fondly remembering his tragic love. The tiny rose is therefore a symbol of the Phantom's great love. This film is a must have for Phantom fans everywhere. Sit back and enjoy a vibrant, youth-oriented Phantom. All the original songs - Think Of Me, Prima Donna, All I Ask Of You, Masquerade and Point Of No Return are all still here.",The Phantom of the Opera
86,Christian_Dimartino,"It's over sung, but worth seeing at some point.",7,23 March 2012,"For years, people have been telling me about Phantom of the Opera and just how great is was, but I never wanted to see it. I recently looked it up on rotten tomatoes, and it received a 33%, which didn't sound so great to me. But, now, after many years, I have seen it. The film is based off of Andrew Lloyd Webber's famous musical of the same title, and revolves around an ingénue named Christine Daae(the gorgeous Emmy Rossum) who is an aspiring young talent in the eyes of the opera owners. She has a gorgeous voice, and she's hot. What's her secret? A mysterious man who gives her music lessons. That man is a phantom(played by Gerard Butler).The Phantom may give her lessons, but he sabotages everything that doesn't go his way. It turns out that he's in love with her. It also turns out that she has a slight crush for Raoul(played by Patrick Wilson), who used to know Christine when they were children. My favorite musical is Sweeney Todd, because it's dark, beautiful, all of the songs work, the acting is spectacular, and it never overstays it's welcome, while having an awesome set. Most of Phantom's songs work, some don't like Masquerade. The set is nice on the eyes, and the direction by Joel Schumacher, yes, Joel Schumacher, is well done. But the actors over sing.It's not their fault, but there is way too much singing. Nobody sings that much. Normal people do this thing called TALKING. I wonder if these people have heard of that before. The actors do well and have nice voices, but it's a shame that they use them too much. Also, I thought that this Phantom guy was supposed to be incredibly disfigured. I may be wrong on that though. Overall, I like the movie, not love, like. But it could be better if it were literally TONED down. B",The Phantom of the Opera
87,timdalton007,The Phantom Lives!,10,4 April 2009,"After seeing the musical The Phantom Of The Opera on Broadway in early 2005 that I was overjoyed when I learned that there was not only a movie but a DVD coming out shortly. I bought a copy soon after its release and watched it, unsure as to what to expect. I was blown away by the film and soon it became a bit of a favorite. However after having not seen it in over a year, some friends got me to watch the film with them again. Sure enough the film lived up to my memories as being a fine example of not only a successful adaptation but as a fine film musical as well.Much of the success goes down to the trio of young actors leading the cast: Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine and Patrick Wilson as Raoul. Butler might not be on the same singing level as the famed original stage Phantom Michael Crawford but he is a fine Phantom nonetheless. Butler's vocal work is quite well done as the Phantom and if you can say nothing else his physical performance along with his chemistry with Emmy Rossum sell him as a fine Phantom. Emmy Rossum gives a stand-out and exceptional performance as Christine with a beautiful singing voice, use of a great range of emotions over the course of the film and her chemistry with both Butler and Patrick Wilson come together to make her an ideal (if not perfect) Christine. Patrick Wilson, armed not only a fine vocal performance but a fine performance as a swash-buckling yet sensitive young aristocrat, proves to be a near-perfect embodiment of Raoul. Together these three actors are the life and soul of the film almost.There is also a fine supporting cast. They range from the diva Carlotta played well (but not sung by) Minnie Driverto the theater managers played by Ciarán Hinds and Simon Callow to dance instructor Madame Giry (played well by the ever talented Miranda Richardson) to Christine's friend (and Madame Giry's daughter) played to perfection by Jennifer Ellison. All together the result is that there is a great range of not only fine singing but fine performances to be seen in the film.Whiel it might be a musical much of the film's excellence lies in its visuals. Anthony Pratt's production design captures much of the visual flavor of the stage version of the musical though there are contrasts with that version that clash (the very dark Phantom's lair of the stage version being counter-parted by the films brightly lit set being perhaps the best example of this). Yet looking past the differences between the two versions and judging them on their own the sets are fantastic pieces of work in themselves from the interior of the opera house to its exteriors right down even to the Phantom's lair, The costume work of Alexandra Byrne captures not only the costumes of the original stage version but branches out into creating its own little world within the film itself. Add on the fine Cinematography of John Mathieson and the result is as fine a visual film musical as you are likely to see.As an adaptation the musical succeeds in not only being largely faithful to the original but being original at the same time. As a necessity of changing formats from stage to screen, changes were inevitable and those that are in the film work for the most part. In particular the addition of two ""action"" sequences (the first being a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom and the second a water sequence towards the end of the film) help to keep the film moving but also surprise those who have seen the musical on stage. That said there are some changes that really don't work such as the major change to the Phantom's costume in the masquerade sequence but the chopping up of the ""Notes.../Twisted every way..."" song from the stage version. yet these are complaints from someone that has seen the stage version and the people I know personally who haven't found these changes unobjectionable and I think in the end they are right: this is a film not a recording of the stage version after all.With fine performances from its young leads to a fine supporting cast and strong visuals, this film version of The Phantom Of The Opera is a successful film musical. While it may differ from the stage version considerably at times it is still capable of bringing about the same emotions in this viewer at least as it did the first time I saw it on stage in early 2005. As both an film adaptation and as a film musical on its own The Phantom Of The Opera is a triumph that must be seen to be believed so go see it!",The Phantom of the Opera
88,lawprof,"Extraordinary, Wonderful, Brilliant (I Liked It a Lot!)",10,24 December 2004,"Director Joel Schumacher's film version of the mega-Broadway hit, ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" is the finest movie realization of a stage musical since ""My Fair Lady."" Elegant, powerful, romantic in a sometimes bizarre but always gripping way and with songs that will ever be a high water mark of musical theater, ""Phantom"" is a wonder.Based on Gaston Leroux's nineteenth century novel, composer and script adapter Andrew Lloyd Webber created what he now admits is a runaway hit that he will never be able to duplicate much less exceed.Who now doesn't know the story line? In the latter half of the nineteenth century a Parisian light opera company presents glittering productions, their star being one Carlotta (Minnie Driver). Mysteriously Carlotta, a high strung diva with an attitude, is rendered song-less, her ultra-pitched normal screeching turning to infernal caterwauling that would embarrass a respectable alley cat.To the rescue, as a result of the machinations of a slowly emerging denizen of the flooded lower precincts of the opera house, The Phantom (Gerard Butler), comes Christine (Emmy Rossum). Unknown to the house managers, parvenu entrepreneurs with ambition and no taste, The Phantom is engineering Christine's soon-to-be-riotously-acclaimed debut.A dashing young nobleman, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), the opera company's aristocratic patron, immediately recognizes Christine as a childhood friend. A brief reunion plunges the two into feverish devotion and love. The Phantom, who because of childhood experiences, is somewhat maladjusted can't deal with HIS Christine being wooed by another and worse returning, with interest, amour.The rest of the story centers on The Phantom's increasingly disturbing, anti-social behavior and Raoul's attempt to keep and then snatch Christine from the, um, ah, homicidal madman's obsessive attentions.""Phantom"" blazingly shows how film can complement a stage production without detracting from the very special experience live performance insures. I attended the Broadway opening of ""Phantom"" and I've returned several times. The visceral experience of the stage can't be duplicated through film and the show incorporates a host of special effects that virtually descends on theater-goers.But film allows probing of emotions in ways that can not always be achieved in a theater, at least not for anyone past the first couple of rows. And not for a complex, sprawling production like ""Phantom."" Film makes the story intimate. The outstanding cinematography creates a kaleidescope of shifting colors closely attuned to the drama being played out. The Phantom's tortured mien in closeup is compelling, perhaps also repelling. Larger sets than can be employed on Broadway do not make the story less intimate - rather they create a fascinating make-belief world (very much as was done in ""Moulin Rouge"" several years ago).The real star is quite young but experienced actress and singer, Emmy Rossum. Transcendently beautiful, her deep portrayal of Christine and her marvelous, light but lustrous voice eclipse that of the role's theater originator, Sarah Brightman. And Ms. Rossum keeps her eye on the ball - keeping Raoul whole while dealing with The Phantom - with a depth I didn't see in the first Christine.Patrick Wilson is a fine Raoul, a nobleman deeply in love. As The Phantom, Gerard is no Michael Crawford when it comes to singing (high notes are an effort for him) but his acting is wonderful. Salaciously, irrefragably evil he also projects a wounded humanity.Miranda Richardson turns in a fine performance as the theater's amanuensis, the mother superior of chorines. And Minnie Driver is funny - I bet she had a blast playing an over-the-top self-worshiping diva.""The Phantom of the Opera"" has been knocked by some film critics who don't get the fact that central to appreciating any opera (Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, Wagner) is the imperative to suspend disbelief. This IS an opera. Leave skepticism and analysis at the ticket booth with this wonderful film and you'll want to see it again and again.And the soundtrack is terrific-I'm on my third listening.10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
89,Antagonisten,Enjoyable,7,18 February 2005,"I'm no fan of musicals myself. Not on stage nor on film. But the ""Phantom of the Opera"" has always attracted me somehow, mostly due to the fantastic music. Myself i would rather have had the angelic voice of Sarah Brightman here, but despite her missing i decided to check this out.Starting out with the casting i thought it was pretty well done. Finding actors that can both act and sing properly can be quite hard, especially considering how many musicals have sub-standard levels of either acting or singing... Gerard Butler is no great singer but he manages the part alright and looks just about right for the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is certainly cute and she can sing, but her acting is stiff to say the least. Most of the time her acting is composed mostly of opening her big eyes wide and trying to look as cute as possible. The one i thought was most fun was Minne Driver as the opera-diva.The music is simply amazing in my opinion. That is where this movie shines, with other music this would have been mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful with nice sets and very nice cinematography.I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. In my opinion it was strong where it matters for a musical to be strong. Mostly in the singing and the music. And i also prefer this movie to the more frantic, almost hysterical, ""Moulin Rouge"". I rate this a 7/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
90,beresfordjd,What a crock!!,3,16 January 2010,"This film is lousy in almost every respect. It's worse fault is that it is so BORING!! My only concession to quality is to say that the scenery and costume design is superb. However that cannot make up for the dreadful cheesy music and acting. I like Gerard Butler but he is not good in this. Miranda Richardson is one of my favourite actresses but is only ordinary in Phantom. If you want to see a good modern musical then see anything written by Sondheim- avoid anything by Lloyd-Webber. It may well have worked on stage but perhaps it lost a lot on its way to film. Using an actress in the cast whose last outing was Brookside(in which she sucked too) has got to be some kind of aberration. I know that lots of people fawn over owt by ALW and his cronies but his output leaves me cold. I had the same reaction to Evita too, so maybe it is me. (I do not think so as my wife feels the same).

I cannot say that I agree with the negative reviews who said that the singing was not good, but do agree that the production was very very long. There was very little dialog, and most of the spoken word, was sung. It was like going to an opera performance. If you like musicals go see the Phantom, but if you don't like l o n g movies wait for the DVD so you can get up and stretch and come back to the movie after.",The Phantom of the Opera
92,domino1003,Beautiful Wonderful Adaptation of Broadway Classic,10,29 May 2005,"I have been a fan of ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" ever since I was a kid. I've seen the movie version, from the silent classic with Lon Chaney (Which still creeps me), to Claude Rains version. To ""Phantom of The Paradise"" to ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" with Charles Dance.Then many years ago I watched the Tony Awards and caught Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman doing scenes from ""The Phantom Of The Opera."" When I first heard Crawford sing ""The Music Of The Night,"" I was totally hooked. I've bought countless copies of the album after pretty much wearing ever copy I had. When the musical came to San Francisco over 10 years ago, I bought my ticket and enjoyed the show (My seat was actually under the chandelier!). So, you can pretty much say that I am a fan of the musical.Part of me was skeptical when I heard that Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera was finally hitting the screen. I, being a Michael Crawford fan, couldn't see anyone but him playing the part (Although I knew that by Hollywood standards, he was too old to play the part).I was glad to be wrong.This was, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful works of art that I had ever seen. Joel Schumacher has done such an incredible job on this film that I can finally forgive him for putting nipples on the Batsuit (See ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin.""). The costumes, the scenery and just the look of the film was awesome. But it was the performances of Gerard Butler (The Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) that gives the film its heart and soul. The moment that Butler sings ""The Music Of The Night,"" tears just fell from my eyes and, as I am typing this after watching the film, they haven't stopped. Other great performances include Minnie Driver as Carlotta (At least she sang the Academy Award nominated song, ""Learn To Be Lonely.""), and Miranda Richardson as Madam Giry.Fans of the classic musical will not be disappointed.",The Phantom of the Opera
93,majikstl,Unfathomable opera...,5,25 January 2005,"There is a scene in ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER'S THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in which the heroine, Christine, is walking through a graveyard, in the middle of the night, in the dead of winter, singing a prayer to her long-dead father. If ever there was a scene that begged for stillness, for a song to be sang a cappella or with the barest minimum orchestration and the subtlest of intonation, this is it. But in this movie, there seems to be a full orchestra hidden amid the tombstones, playing so loud it could wake the dead, not to mention threatening to render Christine's words inaudible. Indeed, much of the plot of the film is hard to follow simply because the music steamrolls over so much of the lyrics. There is a good reason that opera doesn't work well on film, and it isn't because opera is too highbrow for popular tastes. The problem is that film is an up-close-and-personal media. It takes the viewer so close that you can almost see the actor's tonsils and hear his softest whisper. Opera, by its design and tradition, is made to be heard past the highest balcony, beyond the lobby and down into the street. On film, when two lovers declare their undying devotion to each other, and their faces are a half inch apart, they do not need to screech at the top of their lungs. When they do in a film like PHANTOM, the results are more than just false, the sentiments come off as insincere and down right irritating. As with the screen version of Lloyd Webber's EVITA, the sheer oppressiveness of the music is unrelenting; there is little variation and modulation, only the glorification of the music as noise.Opera, unlike film -- or for that matter, even musical comedy -- is all about performance; to some degree it is an elaborate concert where the drama is in the musical sounds, which overshadow the niceties of plot and the importance of acting. If the music is powerful enough, it can mesmerize and, I suppose, compensate for the flimsiest of stories. Thus, foreign language operas remain a staple, though few in the audience actually understand them word for word. By contrast, film is a medium of story and character; more than in opera, we are urged to identify with the characters and their situations. Opera is performed before us; film should absorb us into the world being created. Opera is emotional; film is cerebral. As he did in the disastrous BATMAN AND ROBIN, director Joel Schumacher seems desperate to make PHANTOM a ceaseless adrenaline rush. The film is all high points and climaxes, with no room for delicate characterization or simple details. Even though there really isn't all that much story to tell over the film's two and half hour running time, it still seems strangely rushed. Schumacher seems to want the drama to be as overpowering as the set the design, but it all seems to be more overwrought then emotionally stimulating. The storytelling suffers, since there is no space allowed for building suspense or establishing mood, let alone character development. As such, the actors are cheated of opportunities to make sense of their characters. When your mouth is agape and your voice is emitting at a high pitch, you can display only the most rudimentary of emotions. Joy, anger, fear, sadness all sound pretty much the same. The principle actors -- Emmy Rossum as Christine, Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson as Christine's beau, Raoul -- do their own singing quite well, but they aren't given much of an opportunity to lend their characters much depth or insight. With the more flamboyant horror elements of the story pretty much eliminated -- the mysterious Phantom is now an alluring leading man rather than a mysterious, threatening stalker -- PHANTOM all hinges on the basic love triangle, with Christine's choice between the Phantom and her lover Raoul pivotal. By the time she faces that choice it is hard to see what she sees in either of them because all they have done is sing duets, not interact as human beings. The film looks gorgeous -- Schumacher was once a production designer and costumer -- but it is all two-dimensional, superficial ornamentation. Everything is so over the top, musically as well as stylistically, that it dwarfs the frail and largely predictable story being told, rendering it inconsequential.",The Phantom of the Opera

When he falls fatally in love with the lovely Christine, the Phantom devotes himself to creating a new star for the Opera--exerting a strange sense of control over the young soprano as he nurtures her extraordinary talents. If you can get on its dank and heavy wavelength, the whole project is so aesthetically rich that it manages to transcend that it's, at heart, a lot of dressed-up goofiness.

95,PyrolyticCarbon,"An excellent Phantom, but other weak characters let the film down",6,7 August 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is an old tale written by Gaston Leroux in 1910. Andrew Lloyd Webber made it truly famous with his musical version, and Joel Schumacher has consulted both to bring the musical to the big screen.The story tells of a disfigured child who lives beneath the Paris Opera House and has grown to become an embittered and angry man whose genius lies in music and architecture. He controls the occupants and the owner of the Opera House through a regime of fear, allowing him to collect a tidy wage and have final say over all the shows performed.He sees a young orphaned chorus girl join the troupe and decides to nurture her musical talent from afar. Slowly he falls in love with her and decides to reveal himself to her, yet she is in love with another man and as the love grows so does the Phantoms anger and hatred.The show is a world renowned musical and carries with it a mammoth fan base, so the movie of the musical surely has a lot to live up to. Yet it took a huge hit instantly when Joel Schumacher was confirmed and the general opinion was that the movie was going to be seriously hurt. The casting of Gerard Butler was another huge unknown that took many by surprise, this Scottish actor did not carry such career weight as many expected and with no singing experience behind him there was a lot of concern over the film. However, watching the movie you can't help but be taken in through some of the transition effects between the past and present, the comic moments, some of the excellent actors, and above all the superb performance by Butler.Without a doubt he is the biggest surprise of the movie. His voice can at times sound raw and harsh, yet this adds something real to the character of the Phantom, anger and embitterment seem to creep into his voice at key moments. There's no doubt that Butler has shown the critics that he can make an excellent Phantom, and he is the strongest actor in the movie. Much like the old Hollywood actors, in this film his stage presence is commanding, and his performance utterly believable.Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson and Simon Callow provide some excellent support, with Driver showing some excellent comic and character acting. Her take on the poor Opera singer Carlotta is wonderful, and provides for many amusing moments.Emmy Rossum as Christine is unfortunately not so good. Her role in the movie is weak and merely entails standing looking confused and dumbfounded for much of the film, miming weakly to her musical numbers. Where Butler provides passion and feeling behind his role, Rossum seems to be humming along. Jennifer Ellison is another weak portrayal, and acts as a conduit for a quick duet early on in the movie and nothing more, it's hard to see why her role was even included.Patrick Wilson as Raoul also provided a very weak performance, totally overshadowed by those around him. He appeared more as a meek teenage Royal rather than a Viscount who could woo such a lady and fight for her honour.Schumacher's treatment was strong, but in places somewhat lacking. During the duet between Christine and Meg for example, both characters were in total darkness at times, and the lighting and camera positioning seemed very wrong. There were also quite a few examples of big scenes with huge sets that just didn't quite come across, the size and grandeur of the set or the moment diminished in some way. This can be seen in the rooftop scene between Raoul and Christine, compared to the similar scene between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, it falls well short and doesn't carry the same impact.The story is strong though, and provides for a lot of entertainment. The musical numbers are never out of place, apart from the duet, and they build very well to the conclusion of the movie. However there are a couple of points that stick out for me. One is the fact that everyone just stayed at the Opera house and never considered leaving. For some this is very slightly hinted at, as Carlotta is so bad that no one else would employ her, and Madame Giry was brought up there. Yet I never understood why people just left as did the original owner at the start of the tale.The second issue I had with the story is the speed at which events happen. When Christine falls for Raoul, or the Phantom turns on them all, these events are quite big, especially in terms of characters choice, yet they are handled quite flippantly and the characters turn on a coin.There seemed with both points a need for the events to fit the score and the pace of the movie rather than the story being written and then the musical numbers fitted into the story.Still the musical numbers were for the most part good, the story enjoyable and some of the effects, sets and transitions making for a visually engaging movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
96,TaylorYee94,"The movie captured all the ""good""s of the Musical",8,26 May 2020,"When I first heard of the ""film"" The Phantom of the Opera, I thought it will never live up to my expectation because musical itself was such a masterpiece. However, this film is the epitome of how musicals, operas, plays, or books should be adapted into.
1. Storyline
Screenplay of adapted plays sometimes seems chopped and awkward because a writer cuts out important parts of the original play and patches them poorly. However, the film smoothly glues each piece of narratives together by adding Phantom's background story. One of the movie's advantages of telling the story is that it can go back and forth from past to present without so many obstacles, and the writer exploited this strength of the movie by inserting black & white scenes to portray Paris 1919.2. Settings and Costumes
The movie accurately adapted the musical's glamorous, grand and gloomy settings and costumes. Candles, mirrors, and masks are crucial symbol of the original work, and the movie does not fail to pinpoint these symbols. Additionally, I love how the movie utilizes ""water"" (which is similar to mirror) to indicate two-sided, opaque, and dark nature of the Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera
97,supertom-3,"Not bad, but Rossum is astonishing!",7,4 May 2005,"Damn you Lloyd-Webber, damn you! Yes Sir Andrew is a man of dark powers, for when you hear his music, no matter how overblown or camp, you will not shake it from your memory for a long time. Having watched this filmed I had several of the songs jammed in my head, repeating on me all through the following day. I must admit though that while I'm no fan of West End musicals, Phantom is one I don't mind. Truth be told this is due to having a mother who was the numero uno, chief stalker of all Phantom fans, particularly Michael Crawford. As a child I was subjected to countless hours of Lloyd-Webbers music (pause for breath, compose myself and take deep breaths for this painful childhood memory!) yet several of the songs are memorable. So I knew many of the songs but was never dragged to see the actual stage play. In the end though does the musical version translate well to film? Yes and no. First things first in a musical: Is the music good? The answer to that is on the most part good. However problems arise because the film is 95% voiced in song, rather than dialogue and some songs are weak. To add to that the dialogue when used, is grating. Still this film is undeniably a handsome production. Joel Schumacher is a director who, while he may lack subtlety, has a definite visual flair.So when the film has ended and the credits are rolling, what didn't work during the running time? Well in terms of narrative the film has problems. The film is virtually all music and as such the narrative suffers. As handsome as the film is and as dramatic as it gets, the connecting sections between the films best moments don't quite gel. Also aside from Raoul's appalling mullet one thing that causes severe problems are the two male leads. Firstly Patrick Wilson as Raoul. One problem is that although he has experience of musicals (whether or not in the operatic style) his voice isn't the greatest and really and truly I couldn't help but dislike the character, although having said that Raoul is apparently not the most popular of characters when you ask fans of the stage play anyway. Wilson just got on my nerves and his singing voice wasn't as good as some of the songs deserved. That was a severe problem with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. It has been pointed out quite often that his voice isn't that good. He does hold a tune but at the end of the day those with half a musical hear will realise he is getting by on crash course training and mucho help from the computer. Some of the computer assistance in helping keep his voice in tune, or to maintain lengthy notes is pretty obvious and it is distracting. However on the plus side I thought the Butler gave a good performance, in particular when the characters disfigurement is revealed, even though the make-up job is under whelming and not a patch on the stage-play prosthetics (which I have seen a picture of). Another problem I found was the sound and in particular the dubbing of the singing. From the actors who did their own to Minnie Driver who was dubbed by someone else, they pretty much all (except Rossum) looked as if they were not singing. Obviously they can't sing live and have to re-dub their singing but somewhere between the actors miming, to the sound job, the singing sequences don't work that well. The vocals have a very studio sound, not in fitting with the characters surroundings. This is very obvious with the two male leads and secondary characters played by Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison. Plus points though: The films look. It looks outstanding. Great sets, great cinematography, fanciful costumes. The film has a great atmosphere. Schumacher at least creates a lush visual palette for the audience to savour. Also when the film is good, it's very good. The best songs are well done and dramatic and the film is at times truly spectacular, although the good bits are usually followed by a resounding thud! However as good as the film is at times and how good it looks the main strength of the film is Emmy Rossum. The youngest actress on show and in a demanding role, yet she gives her performance such a maturity that she steals all her scenes pretty easily. Rossum has had operatic training and as such she has a marvellous voice and what is great is that prior to this film she was an unknown. They could have got any number of star name, flavour of the month young actresses (Kiera Knightly reportedly auditioned) however Schumacher made a bold choice to cast Rossum and it pays off. She is fantastic. A great actress, singer, incredibly gorgeous and incredibly young (only 16!) when this was made, yet she looks so mature. When Rossum isn't on screen the film suffers. When the big musical numbers kick in she kicks ass! She also brings out the best in Butler and Wilson who suffer immensely when they aren't acting opposite her. At points when she leaves the film for a short periods the film begins to bore and you itch for her return, particularly in the music and her performances in those are excellent. She is the only one who looks as if she is singing there and then. Deservedly Rossum received a Golden Globe nomination and she is undoubtedly the star of the film. Probably the only one here who could actually make it in the stage play.Overall this is an occasionally spectacular piece that doesn't quite work in filmic terms yet at least can hold it's head up high and be proud in the knowledge that it introduced the world to Emmy Rossum! ***",The Phantom of the Opera
98,theshadow908,A masterpiece.,9,27 June 2006,"The Phantom of the Opera is based off of both Gaston Leroux's novel, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical. It tells the story of a mysterious man that lives beneath the Paris Opera House, and is madly in love with a young ballet dancer. The managers of the opera house think he is a phantom. The young dancer believes he is the Angel of Music, sent by her dead father to watch over her. When the phantom begins to kill and cause damage to the opera house, the dancer's heroic suitor sets out to stop the phantom once and for all. With great music and stunning sets, this is the best version of the tale on film.Joel Shumacher's career was pretty much destroyed after Batman and Robin came out, but after a few good movies to pick himself up, he was given a seemingly impossible task. To turn Andrew Lloyd Webber's world famous stage musical into a movie. Sadly, I've never had the chance to see the show, but I have been listening to the music almost all of my life. I was excited beyond words when this movie came out. I was worried about Shumacher a little bit, but as soon as I saw the movie, it didn't matter. He adapted the stage show almost perfectly to the screen. There are a few changes, but they work, and they make the movie so much better than if it was a straight copy. I loved the sets and the cinematography. Even if you're not a fan of musicals, I highly recommend you see this if you're interested in film at all. This movie is a visual necessity. You'll learn a thing or two. The angles at which certain scenes are shot, the black and white footage, the sets, they all make this movie so good. Of course, Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is genius, and I still get chills whenever I hear the overture.The acting is great. I was worried about almost every actor in this movie initially. I mean, Gerard Butler was Dracula in Dracula 2000, Emmy Rossum was that chick from The Day After Tomorrow, and who the heck is Patrick Wilson. Well, all that went out the window after I saw the movie. Emmy Rossum was amazing in the role of Christine. I really didn't think she could sing. Gerard Butler was absolutely perfect in the role of the phantom. He played the character both sympathetically, as well as devilishly creepy. His singing was nowhere near bad either.Overall, this is the best movie based off a stage show out there. The amazing acting, cinematography, and direction combine to make this one great movie.9/10",The Phantom of the Opera
99,LCShackley,A Really Useful Review,7,2 December 2005,"As a movie experience, PHANTOM was enjoyable: Schumacher knows how to make a good-looking picture, with stunning camera work; his art direction and costume people went over the top to make it a visual sensation. I have not seen the stage version, although I own a copy of the CDs, so I didn't come to the movie with preconceived ideas of how the plot should play out. The supporting characters, such as Callow, Driver, and Richardson, were superb as could be expected. The leads were fine, as far as their appearance went, but just weren't strong enough vocally. Admittedly, Michael Crawford has a somewhat weird tenor range, but the film Phantom just didn't seem in control. Christine, supposedly able to wow 19th-century opera audiences, has a nice sounding pop voice and a decent range, but not a realistic voice for opera. The only singer with the right sound is Driver, who of course was dubbed by...a real singer! And I'm wondering why they left some of the very 80s sounding electronic drums and pulsing synths in the early parts of the film. Certainly Lloyd Webber has progressed since then.I also have to take issue with people who refer to Lloyd Webber as ""arguably one of the greatest composers"" blah blah blah. He can occasionally write a good melody, but in this piece, the two main songs are virtually the same and are repeated far too often. Some of the other settings of text are awkward and rhythmically insensitive, as though he had a musical idea first and forced the text into submission. The orchestrations for the most part are exciting and showy, as they should be. So...an enjoyable evening of DVD-watching but not a timeless classic.",The Phantom of the Opera
100,RiffRaffMcKinley,Please Go Away-- You Disturb Me,1,29 September 2007,"What people see in this abominable musical I'll never understand. If Andrew Lloyd Webber is not going to remake ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" or put ""Starlight Express"" on celluloid, he needs to go away. This terrifying and overly ambitious myth confirms that he is, indeed, emotionally unstable. I could talk about the story, but it's a tale as old as time, and it's set to dismal songs that sound like a cross between goth-rock and tragic opera. And Joel Schumacher once again proves he has no idea what he's doing behind the camera. He lets horrible performances ""masquerade"" (ha-ha-ha) as quality work. He lets disturbingly dull cinematography pass unperturbed. But worst of all, he actually touched this miserable source material in the first place. It's obvious how the Phantom got the way he is-- he used a time machine to watch this movie!",The Phantom of the Opera
101,brenttraft,Slow and Static,3,26 December 2004,"Whether or not you like this film will depend mostly on how you feel about the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Fans will enjoy this movie.If you are not a fan but you normally like movie musicals, you might be disappointed and bored. Unlike the great musicals of the past, Phantom of the Opera does not have much of the way of movement when the people are singing. Instead of dancing or gesturing or acting out the music, the characters usually stand still or pace; as if they were in a stage production.The sound was way too loud in the theater I went to and there was an unpleasant screeching quality. The photography and lighting were good and gave some much needed atmosphere. This is not the type of music I normally listen to. I prefer the musicals of the 30s and 40's and I thought the film version of Chicago was great. Phantom gets a 3/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
102,jakethesnake-42007,Lavish and grand,6,30 October 2021,"For some reason this film is hard to review. Did I love it , did I think it was good or ok. The directing is good but maybe it's done too grand and lavish that it looks kinda cheap at times. The grand lavish of the film is also the downfall of the film. The acting is good but at times it meh acting. The songs are good and like most musicals some songs don't generate well to screen. I like the film it's a good musical but there's nothing special about it but it's worth a watch.",The Phantom of the Opera
103,mnpollio,"Curiously maligned, but visually impressive adaptation",7,10 August 2010,"Theatergoers seem to fall into two camps with composer/producer Andrew Lloyd Webber: they either love him or hate him. I enjoy some of his work (Phantom) while abhorring others (Cats), but I largely find his body of music (dare I say it!) more melodious and hummable than that of the criminally overpraised Stephen Sondheim. The Phantom of the Opera, relating and romanticizing the Gaston Leroux story of the disfigured opera ""ghost"" who tutors and than falls in love with a young opera singer, is arguably his most ambitious and well-known stage spectacle and it took years for it to make the transition to the screen. Naturally, it went without saying that no matter how good or bad the film turned out to be, the anti-Webber league would have their knives at the ready, the fervent Phantom devotees would be prostrate with grief that original stage stars Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman would not have the leads (being far, far too old at this point), and every Tom, Dick and Harry would have their own personal vision of the show that no cinematic achievement could measure up to. That said, there is much to enjoy in this particular cinematic translation. The opulent visuals, the sumptuous costumes and rich music are all well represented here. The film makes some derivations from its source by trying to elucidate the Phantom's origin, but it really adds nothing to the mix. Most of the music is on hand and Joel Schumacher provides solid, colorful, if not exactly exciting, direction. The supporting cast is impressive. Miranda Richardson hits the right notes as the enigmatic ballet teacher, an unrecognizable Minnie Driver is a hoot as the vain current opera diva, and velvet-voiced handsome Patrick Wilson acquits himself nicely in the slightly more proactive role of the Vicomte who loves the leading lady. The movie really rises and falls on the leads. Emmy Rossum is stellar as Christine. Her voice may not have the breadth of Brightman's, but it is young and compelling, plus unlike many stage Christines, she actually has a sexual tension with the Phantom, as demonstrated during the surprisingly torrid ""Point of No Return"" number. Gerard Butler has many detractors in this role. Personally, I enjoy him. I find his somewhat gruff voice a welcome change from the usually smoother Phantoms. He is also up to the physical demands of the role and is able to generate a palpable chemistry with his leading lady. One carp is with his make-up: sometimes he appears grotesque a la the stage play and other times the make-up appears on the minimal side, which emphasizes his smoldering appeal, but the inconsistencies are a tad disconcerting. The film does not, however, live up to its full potential in that something is off with either the tone or the pacing - many scenes do not seem to have the full impact that they should. Whether that fault lies in the screenplay or Schumacher's direction I am still uncertain, but it is definitely there - that sense that something vital is missing. Yet harping on that would dismiss the more than impressive accomplishments that the film does contain, and fans of the show who actually let their guard down for a moment may truly be entertained.",The Phantom of the Opera
104,benoit-3,The music of the shite,1,7 October 2010,"I must begin by stating my horror for the music of ""The Phantom of the Opera"". This is the musical that taught me that music could be, all at once, vulgar, boring, popular and dishonest. This new film version has given me ample occasion to add to the long list of songs, musicals, operas, film scores and symphonies that were plagiarized, from Puccini to Max Steiner, for the production of this imbecilic opus. Stealing is not vulgar in itself, but swelling the orchestra (or crashing a chandelier into the audience) anytime emotion cannot be achieved by honest means, is.As for vulgarity and popularity, suffice it to recall that the stage version was marketed, during the decade of Greed, to uneducated nouveau riche audiences of Thatcherites, people who couldn't stand or even recognize opera if they heard it - or read a book - but were willing to indulge their cheap sentimental side by listening to this swill at inflated prices at the same time art and music appreciation courses practically disappeared from British schools.I have already suffered through a chill-inducing stage performance of the ""Phantom"" in the early eighties so I am quite familiar with its let's-throw-all preceding-versions-of-the-story-into-a-blender-and-see-what-comes-out kind of script. This extra-dumbed-down movie version only adds a supplementary layer of convolution and soft-core porn to the original abomination.The direction by Joel (let's put nipples on the Batman costume) Schumacher is quite sufficient to bring shame to the project all by itself. This version finds a way to defeat its purpose at every turn: the action is set in 1870 instead of 1881 - five years before the actual opera house's inauguration (1), no particular attempt is made to make it resemble the Palais Garnier, the mirror scene has no mirror, the rooftop scene has none of the stage version's (or the 1925 film's) flamboyance, the Mask of the Red Death scene has lost its red colouring, the Phantom is sort of attractive and Christine sort of has the hots for him, the chandelier crashes at the wrong time and sets fire to the theatre in an orgy of CGI effects while the only original bit of business of the stage production - the graveyard scene - has been replaced with a sword duel. So the film can't even be counted on as a faithful record of the stage play. Oh, and the only song that is half-way decent (a Phantom soliloquy) has been thrown to the DVD extras. The stage version may have been a classic example of production overkill masking the lack of substance at its centre, an interminable sequence of spectacular scenes lacking in subtlety and signifying nothing. But the film, surprisingly enough, with all its extra loudness and vulgarity, and ADD editing, only comes off as a dud. Imagine, if you can, ""Moulin Rouge"" without any good songs.I had no particular wish to renew my acquaintance with Andrew Lloyd Webber. The only reason I rented the DVD is that I'm re-reading Gaston Leroux' original novel, a melodrama that would have been considered second-rate pulp fiction in its time (1911) but practically stands out like a masterpiece of symbolist poetry in retrospect and in comparison with this piece of cinematic tripe. What is interesting is that Leroux gave the reader every possible indication needed to recreate the music he was thinking of for every scene of the book. And it sure ain't Lloyd Webber(1) Another indication of the idiocy of the scriptwriters comes right in the opening auction scene when the aged Raoul is referred to as the vicomte de Chagny when his deceased wife's tombstone clearly states she was the comtesse de Chagny in the closing shot of the film. Just another reminder that this musical was written for the illiterates among us.",The Phantom of the Opera
105,emuir-1,If only Gerard Butler could sing!,7,27 December 2004,"Gerard Butler is a passable actor, knows how to fence and swirl his cloak in true period drama fashion, but he cannot sing! The film was gorgeously costumed, the sets were opulent if a little over colored, the supporting players were comical and Emmy Rossum was lovely as Christine. The problem was that Emmy Rossum also has a beautiful singing voice, which contrasted unfavorably with Gerard Butler's strained croak, and was that lard or bootblack on his hair? You would need antimacassars on the sofa with him around.My recommendation would be to recall the film and dub in some decent singing for the Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera
106,overseer-3,"Overall, good ensemble piece",7,25 December 2004,"The new Phantom of the Opera film has a lot to enjoy in it. Overall I found it a pretty production, with nice sets and special effects (though it was obvious much had to have been computer generated) and beautiful costumes. I guess it would have been too cost prohibitive to have rented a real opera house as the setting for the film, but I think that would have been preferable and more realistic if they could have done so.The cast came off as very much an ensemble team, which is nice to see in any film. (Usually most films are geared around one or two stars, not an entire cast). I recognized quite a few faces, like Ciaran Hinds who played Firmin. Everyone looked their part except for the lead role of the Phantom. He was just too good looking; in a role which requires a fear factor to carry it along, removing that fear factor by casting a gorgeous tanned muscular young hunk (with tight pants and unbuttoned shirt) threw me off immediately. The setting for the crucial musical scene ""Music of the Night"" was kind of awkwardly done; the video I have of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman singing this song has far better staging - and intrigue and sensuality - on a much cheaper budget - than what I saw in this film.The movie audience today is much more sympathetic to a good looking actor, I guess, than to an actor with average looks but with a commanding stage and singing presence (i.e. Michael Crawford), and that is kind of a shame. At the first few musical phrases this Phantom sang I inwardly groaned, ""Oh, his voice is terrible!"" At that moment I didn't know if I could continue watching it, but I didn't spend 9 dollars per ticket for nothing, so I stayed. As the film progressed he improved in my estimation as an actor, though not so much as a singer. The unmasking was simply not frightening at all; it does not compare to Lon Chaney's. He looked like he had a bad case of sunburn with a few bumps. Sigh. Then to have the kiss scene near the end filmed with the two stars standing in knee deep water (sewer water, no less) was kind of ridiculous; this wasn't the actors' fault by any means. The director should have known better.The actress who plays Christine was probably the best part of the movie. She was lovely and had a very nice voice. The only criticism I have to make about her performance is that she kept her mouth parted almost through the entire picture. I kept thinking to myself, ""Girl, is there no other way you can express emotions than with a continuously parted, open mouth?"" I brought my two daughters to see the film with me, one is 19, the other 7. I have to say I was surprised and a bit offended that they had a mooning scene in this film. I wish I had known about that little scene beforehand, I would have been able to shield my 7 year old daughter's eyes. I sat there for quite a while resenting it that once again Hollywood cannot refrain these days from adding annoying bits like this to their films. It was totally unnecessary and crude. It didn't do anything to make the film a better film. Andrew Lloyd Webber, are you the same man who wrote Pie Jesu? I did like Minnie Driver as the Prima Donna, she was a pip. Also I thought the actress who played Madame Giry was very good.Overall I would give the film an 8 out of 10. I just wish they could have made this film in the late 1980's with the original cast.",The Phantom of the Opera
107,marcus_stokes2000,"Fantasma Dell'Opera è qui, accanto a me",9,1 August 2006,"I have just watched 'Phantom Of The Opera' in both Italian and English versions, and I have to say, I love them both, though something (La Carlotta) is better in the original version (Minnie Driver is a riot), and something (Masquerade) is better in the Italian version (the lyrics are awesome: 'Masquerade, we hide reality'...), thanks also to Mr.s Luca Velletri and Pietro Pignatelli (Phantom and Raoul's singing voices) and Miss Renata Fusco (Christine's singing voice) which are a real delight to hear.Nonetheless, this film is really really good; everyone is in part, and it all sounds really faithful to the Book, like a plunge into the dark universe of Leroux's story. If I had to single out some favourites, I would have to say that the best were Gerard Butler, who is actually perfect for the part, both acting and singing (I have heard Michael Crawford, and he sounds like a mad scientist who still hasn't passed puberty, not the mysterious, all-knowing and darkly fascinating man he should be), Patrick Wilson, who made the most of his part as the somewhat generic heroic male lead (and what a voice!), Miranda Richardson, a captivating Madame Giry, her teenage counterpart (in the flashback scene), the actress who played Meg Giry, innocent, smart and, I'll admit, very nice to look at, Minnie Driver, who shows us why she's regarded as a good actress with the hilariously unsufferable Prima Donna La Carlotta, and especially the then-17-year-old Emmy Rossum (what's with all this bashing of her? Geez, calm down!) who gives her ALL as Christine Daaè, the young ingénue at the center of the intrigue, making us understand why she does what she does, when in most other actresses' hands, it would have been more laughable than La Carlotta, who I would have LOVED to hear butcher... err, *speaking* French, like she hilariously did with English (with such a terrible voice for an Opera singer, the worse since Jean Hagen's in 'Singing In The Rain' - maybe Lina Lamont's a descendant of La Carlotta?) One more plus are the sets, which felt and looked real, with the darkness looming at even the more sparkling corner.And who could forget the horrible accident that happens during the representation of 'Don Juan Victorious', Erick's first and only Opera; it was so well-done, I felt like I was there.So, 'Phantom Of The Opera' deserves a 9 (I don't give it a 10 because in the scene where Christine takes the Phantom's mask off at the beginning there is a small scar on his face, yet when she takes it off once again during the 'Don Juan', the damage is way bigger: WTH?).",The Phantom of the Opera

As for me I've always found ridiculous those stories where people sing instead of talking when it comes to movies (I'm not referring to opera here), and this one is a perfect sample of what I find ridiculous.That aside the film is terribly long and I dare to say that Gerard Butler (the phantom himself) is not much of a singer, nor much of a make up either in his disfigured face. And all that singing and singing and singing ...I think a good normal version of Gaston Leroux's classical novel could have been made with this budget and fine cinematography.And singing and singing and singing ...",The Phantom of the Opera

I saw this film around the time I made an homage to New York and saw the musical on Broadway at the Majestic Theater with my dad. The play itself was magnificent to say the least, but anyway I soon decided to see if the film was any good. Upon viewing the film, I was impressed for a while with how the film proceeded to the ""present time"" of the film. The acting seemed a bit mediocre and the singing was iffy. The only actor who really impressed me at all was Emmy Rossum as Christine; her performance and singing were dynamic and suited the character perfectly. Gerard Butler as the Phantom seemed a little tacky, but his acting was decent and his singing ability wasn't too bad, but seemed off-key a few times. Overall a well plotted film with good music and beautiful songs.",The Phantom of the Opera

This is perhaps the most hammy movie I have ever seen! Every scene is hammered across like there is no tomorrow! The characters do not stop singing for a minute and it gives you a headache after a while. Yet the rich, detailed cinematography and production design is among the best in its class. Rossum is very good as Christine and this is certainly better than most of the previous Phantom adaptations and Schaumacher's body of work for that matter. Yet it is very headache-inducing and Schaumacher never gives us enough time to relax our heads, it is as if the movie is in itself one big musical number.",The Phantom of the Opera
111,FairlyAnonymous,If your musical has bad singing then you know there is a problem,4,12 December 2012,"The movie isn't entirely bad. I'll just start off with that. However the singing... it's dreadful. The first time I saw it I knew it was bad but then when I watched it several years later (today) and after having much more experience with drama productions, film production, singing, choir, and being in several bands... all of the bad stuff in the movie started to become even more and more apparent. What at once seemed sort of annoying now seems awful. I'm surprised that the movie was able to be released with some of the glaring problems that it had.First problem: The Phantom's singing voice is... I'm sorry to say this but anyone who knows anything about music understands that he can't sing. He is singing way off key in most of his songs and it was so obvious that when I watched it with my music teacher he said out loud, ""Ouch. That's painful to hear. Who hired this guy?"". Now for people who aren't musically inclined in anyway then fine. You might be able to enjoy it. But when a movie's sole purpose is about THE MUSIC and it can't even get the music RIGHT then you have a very serious problem. That means all you are left with is generic dialogue and sets.And don't get me started about the actual music (soundtrack). I understand that the movie went for an eighties vibe which I thought was rather obnoxious but oh well. But it sounds ridiculous when the movie starts throwing in guitar solos and power chords in the middle of an opera! This is the 1800s! Make the music sound authentic to the time period. I understand that the musical didn't come around until the 70's and of course there was the 1980s movie, but still the movie could've tried to have been better than that. It just makes the movie feel cheesy and odd.Another thing I noticed is that the camera in the movie has this weird fuzzy 1980s feel to it. This may have been on purpose (noticing the 1980s soundtrack) but it just comes off as visually unappealing and kind of annoying. It makes the movie feel older than it really is. Also for some reason in the Phantom's lair there are arms that hold torches and the arms actually alive... huh... that's odd. Kind of makes the movie feel sillier than it already is.Overall the movie is just... ugh. It's not really good at what it is supposed to be good at. It falls flat on its face when it tries to be serious or dramatic. If there is one thing that is enjoyable about it is that the movie rather spectacular or ""massive"" in scale for a musical. Also I can say that the acting isn't bad but it's mainly the music that ruins anything that is enjoyable about the movie. So... if you are a fan and you love to hear music get butchered than go ahead and be my guest to watch this movie. On a side note I don't hate the Phantom of the Opera book or original adaptations it's just this one in particular this is very mediocre.",The Phantom of the Opera
112,wnterstar,Wow!!!,9,1 January 2005,"I am a big Phantom of the Opera fan, and I must say I was concerned when I heard it was going to be made into a movie.I shouldn't have been.When the chandelier raises to the ceiling and the run down, dusty black and white opera house becomes colorful and splendid, it gave me goose bumps. I don't say that lightly. As I said, I went in half expecting to hate the movie.The casting was great in this movie. I can't believe Emmy Rossum (Christine) was only 17 when this was filmed...she is going to be a star to watch! Patrick Wilson gives a solid performance as Raoul, Christina's suitor, and champion. (He also looks great in a white puffy shirt!) Miranda Richardson gives a wonderfully understated performance as Madam Giry. She was a commanding presence, without being overpowering. On the opposite end of things, but still just as outstanding is Minnie Driver (Carlotta). She plays the quintessential Italian Opera Diva to the hilt as only she can.The only even semi false note in this movie was Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Don't get me wrong, his acting was great. He made me understand the phantom and even empathize with the him. I just don't think he had the power in his voice that the role required.Joel Schumacher did a great job of keeping suspense in a story that most people already know by heart. For instance, we all know that the phantom is disfigured, but when you finally see his face, it still a shock, not in the depth of the disfigurement, but in the timing of the reveal.This is one I have to own on DVD as soon as it comes out. I'm sure I could see it over and over and still not see all the wonderful details of this truly spectacular movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
113,Ric-7,When I Left,4,14 January 2005,"Spoiler coming. I left just after the cemetery scene. The Count fought a duel with the Phantom and was about to kill the Phantom, when Christine begged for his life. Then in the very next scene, the Count is discussing with the Opera managers how they will catch the Phantom. Excuse me? Why didn't the Count just tie him up in the cemetery? That would have ended this interminable movie at least thirty minutes earlier.I did not see the stage musical, and if I ever do, I earnestly hope it is way different from this. The cemetery scene seemed inserted into the plot. And the ""framing"" artsy B&W scenes are spoilers, because it tells you who survives. The script was pathetic, the plot advanced glacially (and glaciers sometimes recede), but I can't fault the actors. And probably not the director, either, because I fear his hands were tied re cuts.",The Phantom of the Opera
114,robsta23,Schumacher Did This Well,9,4 April 2015,"It will probably be a long time before I revisit the films ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" since they are two of the worst comic book adapted movies to come out. Defending his direction of the films, Schumacher said ""they're called comic books, not drama books."" While Joel Schumacher failed to capture the true essence of the Batman universe, he was able to nail the tone of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in many aspects.Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are simply the perfect cast choices for the leads of this film, though Rossum mainly seems to be there for a pretty face to look at. I am saying that in terms of her acting, but her singing is incredible. We all know she is able to deliver with the concluding cadenza of ""Think of Me,"" which is a song featured in the first twenty minutes of the film. I have only seen clips of past Phantoms, but Gerard Butler comes across as a very powerful Phantom, seeming dominant with his beautiful tenor voice rather than going falsetto like previous phantoms - falsetto doesn't seem menacing at all.The core of the story focuses on the infamous love triangle between the Phantom, Christine Daae, and Raoul. Christine is tutored as a singer for many years by the titular Phantom, who she believes her late father has sent for her. Her childhood friend, Raoul, conveniently shows up as at this point in her life so that she may have a lover. Christine and Raoul represent the ideal couple while the Phantom grows jealous; he devoted a lot of his life to her by shaping her into a successful singer while she is attracted to Raoul, who contains no physical distortion like the Phantom. Talk about friend-zoning; in fact, a good alternate title would be ""The Phantom of the Opera: The Adult story of the Friend Zone.""While the friend-zoning idea is an oversimplification of the movie, it is this frustrating love triangle that lets us connect to the Phantom, feeling sorry for him since he longs for love having never known love before as a hideous circus attraction. The film has a confusing message like Beauty and the Beast - both seem to say that looks should not matter when it comes to love, but their conclusions then go against that with the Beast turning back into a prince, and Christine living with Raoul rather than with the Phantom.This is a great love story as well as a great tragedy. The music makes this film so powerful though I know this has clearly been done before since this musical has been around for ages. The music makes it a great experience, and an enjoyable one in which one may get lost, surrounded by ""the music of the night."" Some parts are cheesy, I do not completely agree with the casting choice of Raoul, but this is still a strong film due to its great execution.",The Phantom of the Opera
115,ArizWldcat,Wow!!! ( picture that in caps! IMDb says I can't shout!),10,7 May 2005,"I rarely give a movie 10 stars, but this one is one that I believe deserves it. I just finished watching the DVD (saw this in the theater too) and it more than held up the second time. Many reviewers have been critical of the singing (particularly that of the lead) , and I just have to say that you need to look at this with a bit more of an open mind. Michael Crawford defined the role for the stage show, and he was phenomenal. However, Crawford didn't do this movie; Gerard Butler did! Schumaker and Webber chose to take the film Phantom in a different direction; a bit more dangerous sounding, with a voice that was not quite so ""polished"" (and dare I say it, Butler's voice has a lot more sex appeal!) I think it was wise not to try and recreate what had already been done. Gerard Butler's phantom was a contrast to the beautiful Raoul. I thought making the phantom more ""rock and roll"" or on the edge, was a great artistic choice. In addition, I thought Butler's acting was marvelous; he brought great vulnerability to the Phantom. Andrew Lloyd Webber produced the movie, and I think it's good that he and director Schumaker didn't try to remake the stage show. It just couldn't (and shouldn't) have been done! Emmy Rossum was absolutely amazing. She was perfect for the role; Christine is supposed to be a young starry eyed girl who thinks the Phantom is an angel sent from her father. Someone with a more mature voice may not have carried it off so effectively. I enjoyed her work in ""Songcatcher"" and will be interested to see where this talented young lady goes next. Patrick Wilson sings like an angel, and I thought he brought some life to Raoul that needed to be there. It isn't credible to have a wimpy Raoul. I also enjoyed the many talented supporting actors...Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow, Jennifer Ellison. They were all superb! This film version can stand on its own, apart from the popular stage show. There are some differences and I think it was well done. And of course, those of you who already know that you dislike musical theater will not enjoy this. Why torture yourself, and then complain about it? I tend to stay away from films that I know I won't like!P.S...there's a great Easter Egg on the special edition DVD (2nd disc)...the crew sings ""Phantom,"" (and leaves no doubt why they're behind the camera!)",The Phantom of the Opera
116,jfarms1956,it is a delight to the ears.,7,9 January 2014,"The Phantom Of the Opera is a movie geared for the romanticists and those who love musicals. Although the Phantom of the Opera is classically a horror story, this version is a love story with extremely beautiful music to give sweet dream instead of nightmares. Even if you just listen to the movie, it is a delight to the ears. I enjoy the transition between the black and white/sepia opening and colorized story. The basic thematic music is one we normally associate with horror movies. The singing is just so delightful that it overcomes whatever acting may be accomplished. Young children may get nightmares. However, older children should not. It is an interesting adaptation of the basic story. It's Hollywood after all. Gorgeous costumes and scenery also appeal to the eyes. I think that the movie could have been edited down an additional 10 minutes. This is a prime time movie. Have your munchies ready and your glass of wine. More entertaining than horrifying. The phantom is always the monster. The phantom is always also a victim. Love conquers all in this film and so does beauty.",The Phantom of the Opera
117,jessie-39,A star is born! Emmy Rossum gorgeous and talented in Lloyd Webber Phantom,9,2 January 2005,"Wow! Our first movie of 2005 and it was everything and more. Having seen Phantom in London and New York for a total of three times. All with the great Michael Crawford. It is Andrew Lloyd Webber's crown jewel of a show. It is impossible for a movie to be as great as a Broadway show much like a movie is rarely as good as the book. This was a wonderful movie and Emmy Rossum at age 18! is already the new ""it"" girl for 2005. She is gorgeous, has a fantastic voice and among a cast of unknowns this movie simply blows you away. It took 15 years or more for Lloyd Webber to finally make this movie. Joel Schumacher as Director is as usual at his Academy Award best. This movie while not for everyone, is sophisticated as an opera can be. The set designs and costumes are super and it sure deserves Oscar notice along the way for acting, singing, costumes, etc. Now we need to get Emmy Rossum together with Josh Grohban for an amazing duet. We are more than pleasantly surprised at this wonderful adaptation of a fabulous, perhaps the best that Lloyd Webber has done in his career on stage, now brought to life as a great family movie. Don't miss it, make it your first of 2005.",The Phantom of the Opera

119,dougandwin,Stage Show a Great Movie Hit,7,24 February 2005,"I originally only went to see this movie, because I had seen ""Phantom"" on stage, and wanted to see how much they had ruined the whole thing. The experience proved me wrong, I am pleased to say. Sure there are a number of changes to the story, with the Chandelier spectacular being moved from the end of Act 1. to virtually the end of the film, but they do not, in any way, impair the total enjoyment of a very, very good film adaptation. All of the main characters are extremely well portrayed, particularly Christine and Raoul, while the music which has always been stunning is backed by great orchestral talents. Along with the music, the photography is quite awe-inspiring, and the moods are captured brilliantly. It is very clear to the movie-goer that Andrew Llloyd Webber was vitally involved in this excellent and enjoyable film - he has kept his dream alive.",The Phantom of the Opera
120,The_Orenda,I was left wanting ...,3,2 January 2005,"I grew up listening to Andrew Lloyd Webber. The Phantom of the Opera has always been his trademark musical, with the title song dancing through every child's head for many years. But after seeing Paul Stanley play the Phantom at the Pantages in Toronto, I thought, with that and watching Cats, a chapter closed in my life and would never be opened again. One thing's for sure, Webber likes making money. He and Schumacher throw together the stage musical for the silver screen and it comes off with mixed results. At first, I was impressed with the effort from all the actors. Secondly, I was upset at the lack of imagination from the producers but overall, I was downright angry at the movie theater for blowing the whole thing. The Famous Players we went to on opening night, through a terrible snow storm, were playing through damaged speakers that were cracking in and out of key throughout the ENTIRE MUSICAL. I demanded our money back from the theater (which is on Vega Blvd in Mississauga, Canada), and after some holiday thought, wanted to give a fair review in spite of that horrible night on my mind.A 'Phantom' begins terrorizing the new owners of an opera house when the protection money isn't paid and his private box is used by others. Preparing to pour more fuel into the fire, this 'angel of music' is tutoring a chorus girl, Christine, who becomes a runaway hit after a diva bolts out. All this and a childhood friend of Christine's comes along ...When I look at this movie, the first thought that coursed through my mind was that Joel Schumacher really did not have much say. Ideas might have come, yes, but the same videos I've seen as a child, I've also seen in this movie! Particularly, the music video to the title song. Does it not look almost EXACTLY the same video as with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford? There was no real imagination done with the musical either. You would think after nearly 15 years of the script collecting dust, they would have adjusted to a more modern approach of directing. It seems so simple and by-the-numbers that your expectations will only be met and not exceeded. For this, I blame Webber and only Webber, banking that his lyrics alone would prompt nominations when the Academy Awards roll around. Schumacher might have added a creative twist or two (and so may have the studios), but I see little of it. With that said, the movie is bright and bountiful in various ways. There is much energy and liveliness that the actors give out, particularly between Ms. Rossum and Butler, the stars of the show, who seem to sing as if it is a normal, fluid everyday effort on their part (but with much beauty). Their passion and intensity make Phantom of the Opera the ideal date movie. And though I slam the boring screenplay and squirm at the almost mandatory directing, I give credit that they did keep it simple, offering viewers a seat to the show, unlike Moulin Rouge, where you're thrown in the middle. I sum up certain scenes on par with Rocky or The Pianist, where both those movies let you watch what others might be watching and you're invited to see the roles being played. Too bad The Phantom couldn't maintain like those movies. Some men may consider this film to be one of the longest ever made.",The Phantom of the Opera
121,iago-6,Instant Cheese Classic,2,30 December 2004,"OH dear. What went wrong? Well, what went right? This movie is an instant classic for lovers of cheese, though since it is Interminable, I suggest watching it at home in close proximity to a fast-forward button. Let's rip it apart, shall we? The pairing of composer and director could not be more perfect... if you want to end up with this. In my opinion, the only way this could have been saved is to not have Lloyd Webber's input. Then someone could have trimmed the fat (and bountiful fat there is) and put something together that drew on the power of the story. If you've never seen the 1925 silent version, you might want to watch it, as it is still great, with images that still shock, and make the story intriguing and mysterious. That at least will provide some interest while slogging through his schlock.I haven't seen the stage version--and now I never will--but I have to say I was appalled at how lame the lyrics were. It really is like the lyricist just threw in the first words that came into his head. Someone will say ""well I would,"" and you will say to yourself: ""Okay, he is Not going to follow that up with ""if I could,"" but Sure Enough! That happened many, many times. Then there were things where he says something like ""as to me,"" and you think ""Okay, he's going to say ""so to thee,"" right? Makes sense, but no, he says ""so to you."" It really is shocking that this made it so long on Broadway and around the world.The cast doesn't provide much. Gerald Butler was fine, but sure would be nice if he could sing! There were many long, Flllllaaaaattttt notes (there's one featured in the trailer, with ""Let your mind take you where you want to Beeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaagggghhhhh!!!"") He was also lacking in... whatever one needs to make the Phantom a figure of mystery and menace. But the director has said repeatedly that he chose the cast on youth and sexiness rather than anything else (say, talent, for instance), so I guess he achieved his aim. Emmy Rossum's performance ran the full emotional gamut from dewily blank to mistily vacant. I barely even remember Raoul (except for the most priceless cheese line of the movie: ""Well, it seems clear that genius... has turned to madness!"" Me and my friend exploded with laughter at that one). Miranda Richardson stood out, as she can ACT (and also Underplay), and Minnie Driver ran away with the movie as the only spark of humor and life... she truly was the best part of the movie.The film is also really dishonest in ways, some more alienating than others... though it seems doubtful that Schumacher understands how this can really turn a viewer against a movie. The first was that SECONDS after we are informed that they didn't have electric light, a singer is onstage with a huge brilliant spotlight shining right onto her. The second is that throughout the Phantom wears this tiny mask and that tiny mask (so much so that you start to think ""so what, is just one cubic inch of his face hideously disfigured?""), but you Clearly see that his hairline and upper left forehead are perfectly smooth. Once he is unmasked at the end, the whole left side of his head is messed up, and that is a Cheat. You, Joel, are a Cheat! And look, if a filmmaker can't even stay true to the requirements of his story, should we respect him or go along with him? I will say that the sets and the whole look was wonderful. I love the really obvious paintings in the cemetery and rooftop scenes.My friend and I love to get together and watch movies, mostly from the 70s, that are unbelievably cheesy, and during this movie we both had the same thought: ""In 30 years, people just like us will be watching this movie and just Laughing!"" And this movie supplies lots to laugh at. The Phantom flips his cape more often than Batman. The thing is, even the hilarity wear thin after 90 minutes, with almost another 90 to go.It's also sad and disheartening to read the reviews on here, with many, many more people than I can feel comfortable living in this country with, saying this is the Best movie they have Ever seen.

122,joestank15,Nothing to Write Home About,4,22 June 2005,"Phantom of the Opera - Joel Schumacher's take on Andrew Lloyd Webber's collection of Puccini's greatest hits in a Gaston Leroux novel adaptation. Hee hee. Just trying to keep in perspective the originality of all this. Well, IL' Joel almost singlehandedly ruined the Batman franchise before. Lets see how he does in the realm of musical theater. First off, to give credit where credit is due, the movie has fantastic visuals and costumes as is expected in a Joel Schumacher movie.The music is used appropriately most of the time. My blood chills at the booming base of ""The Phantom of the Opera is here"" part, but just shrugs in confusion at the rockerish stuff thrown in. It's not bad, just kind of out of place in an operatic style musical. I was almost expecting techno to come up with it when Christine was brought down to the Phantom's lair.Unfortunately that pesky whole human element that's supposed to be in the movie kinda isn't there. I don't know whose idea it was to cast Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He just plain sucks. His singing is a little bit odd, sort of rocker-ish. His tone varies from quiet to just booming, flat and bad. He ultimately fails to give the Phantom any real menace or subtlety; he's just a jealous dorky guy trying to get a girl all to himself. The longer he is on screen, the less mystique he projects. Emmy Rossum sounds very pretty as Christine, but she's so rigid and flat in her acting. She's a non-entity. Patrick Wilson comes the closest of any of them to getting into the spirit of the film, and his tenor is pretty. Minnie Driver is just flat-out annoying.The film also gets kind of boring sometimes. It probably could do with a bit of editing at the flatter points. It's not horrible, but rather like a vase. Pretty to look at, but all hollow inside. This gets a C.",The Phantom of the Opera
123,saarvardi,"Great film, just wasn't blown away like I initially expected",7,10 December 2004,"I've watched the film yesterday night, on it's Israeli premiere, but unfortunately, I still don't have an established opinion on it yet (it usually takes the movie some days to sink in, before I can grade it either way). I can definitely tell you it's a stunning-looking production, with lots of costumes and beautifully crafted scenes and imagery. The first half kinda drags, but once you get the hang of the many songs and the rather-dark atmosphere the film has in general, it starts getting more and more enjoyable. The second half is where the fun really hides, with some breath taking scenes and memorable performances, mostly by the surprisingly talented Emma Russom. After we learned she can speak fluent french in The Day After Tomorrow, and make Sean Penn so mad he could win an Academy Award in Mystic River, Phantom of the Opera presents viewers across the world to her undeniably magical vocal abilities, as well as just how sexy and seducing this young actress can be, if dressed and directed properly. The main problem I had was with Gerard Butler. All in all he's a good actor, but he steps out of character from time to time, and his performance is somewhat unstable. Never the less, there are some scenes he manages to step into that black and disturbing place the phantom comes from, and the scenes that don't quite work are worth skipping just for the sake of watching those rare moments. The two opera managers (need to check IMDb to see who plays them) are the film's comic relief, and they portray their characters with much skill and humor, that you can't help but smile at their appearances.Coming out of the theatre, I was generally pleased with what i've seen. The songs are addictive (my girlfriend, who watched the play while visiting relatives in Australia, knew all the lyrics by heart, and said that the movie was rather loyal to it's big on-stage brother), the general pace is right where you expected to be. I guess my main problem was not being so blown away by the sum of all those ingredients as I expected to be. A lot like I felt when I came out of watching the director's Veronica Guerin.",The Phantom of the Opera
124,Pavel-8,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" will be there, inside your mind.",7,10 February 2005,"On the tail end of a modest musical revival begun by ""Moulin Rouge"" comes ""The Phantom of the Opera"", a relatively straightforward cinematic version of the oh-so popular musical based on the book. The film is set in late 19th century Paris at an opera house that is haunted by the titular ghost. Who is he? What are his motives? Why the fascination with promising young soprano Christine, who happens to be romantically linked with her benefactor Raoul? The story answers those questions through waves of passionate music and lavish scenery.Make no mistake about it, the music carries the movie. A like or dislike for the film will largely hinge on one's opinion of the music. Count me among the supporters, as I consider the poetic lyrics, driving score and songs, enhanced here by a full orchestra, like rich dessert for the ears. Perhaps it isn't highly nutritional, but the taste and sound are capable of sweeping one away into pure cinematic bliss. Combined with the probably too-perfect art direction and attractive if simplistic cinematography (both Oscar-nominated), the music creates chill-inducing moments that thrill the eyes and ears.A noteworthy difference between the various soundtracks and the movie is the age and vocal styles of the main characters. With a cast of relative unknowns, the entire film skews younger, which didn't bother me as a twenty-something, but might irk older viewers. Eighteen-year old Emmy Rossum (""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Mystic River""), whose classical training shines through, is younger than most Christines, but I think her age is more appropriate for the part. Gerard Butler (""Reign of Fire"", ""Timeline"") plays the Phantom less sympathetically than the familiar Michael Crawford. His less polished but more natural sound tweaks the role with an angrier edge, creating additional conflict that translates well to the silver screen. As Raoul, Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") holds his own with appropriate emotion as he fills the role of foil for both other leads.The simple mechanics of cinema both aid and afflict the telling of the story. The ability to break free from the sometimes claustrophobic boundaries of stage brings welcome relief on jaunts to the roof and a cemetery. But the constant singing, even while dashing through labyrinthine halls and caverns, works better on stage, seeming somewhat clunky in the larger physical world afforded by movies. Storywise, the narrative is more lucid accompanied by specific images that elaborate upon the words, as several plot points that had eluded me in stage and song were made clear through pictures.That story, like many musicals, is rife with melodrama, exaggerated emotions that would not play very well without the powerful music accompaniment. But the sweeping lyrical melodies and harmonies temper the potentially abrasive angst, stressing them without flying over the top into excessive cheesiness. There are still soap opera moments, but the strong (even single-minded) and sincere characters keep the tale progressing through the thick and thin of the narrative.For those who don't care for the show or movie musicals in general, this film likely won't do anything to change your mind. But if you do enjoy the music of ""Phantom"", then you will find pleasure in seeing a different rendition of the classic show, which is more Victorian rock concert than traditional opera, complete with lingering music that will haunt you like the Phantom haunts the opera house. Weeks later, the melodies still waft through my head.Bottom Line: I greatly enjoy the music, so I greatly enjoyed the film. 7 of 10, and worth seeing on the big screen.",The Phantom of the Opera
125,rcavellero,Passionless Phantom...,5,23 December 2004,"Joel Schumacher's Passionless version of the rock pop opera Phantom of the Opera comes to the screen with an overwhelming feeling of disappointment. Only hardcore fans of the play will find much entertainment in this bloated, overly long and ultimately dull rendition of the brilliant stage version. The story still is pretty much the same with the exception of a few minor and unnecessary details. Emily Rossum of Day after Tomorrow fame garnered herself a golden Globe nomination for her performance as Christine Day, truly one of the worst performances of the year. Ms. Rossum seems to be a deer stuck in headlights through the entire film the depth and range of her emotions is accompanied by the same bewildered facial expression. Her voice is truly beautiful but it lacks credibility cause her lip sync hing appears slightly off. Everyone else is just mediocre except for a campy turnout as Carlotta from Minnie Driver. The Phantom is a powerful character at the beginning but looses steam halfway through. The set design and costumes don't seem to be anymore lavish than the stage version which is fine but... You can't translate a play to film with nothing extra. They are two completely different things, that work in different ways. what may be beautiful and effective in a play turns out in a 100 million dollar musical as fake and disastrous. and thats the problem with the whole film it's a very paint by the numbers adaptation and despite a few incredible but seemingly out of place dazzling visual touches the film could have otherwise been a TV pic. All in all I must say that the film disappoints me majorly after seeing recent musicals like the wonderful Chicago and brilliantly creative Moulin Rouge what the Phantom majorly lacks is Passion, a magic brought forth from watching a truly great musical. One lost in the translation from stage to film, one greatly missed. Not the worst movie, or even a horrible one at that. just drowned in mediocrity. 5/10",The Phantom of the Opera
126,dhaufrect-1,Spectacular Visual Effects,8,23 December 2004,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" is well done from a visual standpoint. It certainly satisfies the musical image of the Broadway show as well. There are numerous new pieces of stage business that spice up the show. The Phantom is played by Gerard Butler and he gives a very handsome performance. Emmy Rossum is Christine, the petite, gentle opera singer, and she is perfectly cast as the enginue. Patrick Wilson is Raoul, and he too is well cast and delivers his lines in a believable manner. No expense is spared in the dramatic scenery, nor in the cinematography. The sets are impressive. The music is as delicious as the original play. It is an excellent show for the Christmas season.",The Phantom of the Opera
127,movieman-200,Sometimes enchanted spectacle gets its mileage from Webber's melodic score!,7,15 June 2005,"At long last, after nearly two decades of humming Andrew Lloyd Webber show tunes in my garage, the big screen spectacle that is the cinematic incarnation of The Phantom of the Opera (2004) has arrived on DVD. Gaston LeRoux's story is as old as the movies  actually older. Lon Chaney startled everyone with his extreme and grotesque make-up in the silent version. Claude Raines did his best, but failed to do the same in the 40s glossy remake. A sixties contemporary twist, The Phantom of Paradise, did little to generate interest in the property, and, Robert England's gross departure into horror with his 1980s scare fest is just plain wrong.But now we get the film inspired by Webber and Broadway; a huge sweeping white elephant that, even before its title sequence ends, seems quite dated in a sort of ""please, help; I'm trapped in vintage 80s Broadway."" Winsome Emmy Rossum is breathtaking as the film's opera ingénue Christine Daae. Too bad the same can't be said for Gerard Butler's Phantom (a pity that Michael Crawford did not feel himself up to reprising the role which made him immortal on Broadway). Not only is Butler NOT Rossum's match vocally, he seems to entirely lack in any conveyance of menace and sensuality  except in the number ""The Music of the Night."" As Raoul, Christine's legitimate love interest, Broadway's Patrick Wilson is the contemporary Nelson Eddy  but that's not a compliment. Although he is in fine voice, he remains a stiff chocolate soldier  sort of like a statue that comes to life for a duet, then turns to stone for the rest of the venture. Minnie Driver has a ball, if for no one but herself, diving head first into the vampish preening of reigning opera diva Carlotta. Driver's vocals throughout have been dubbed which is odd, since she does a fine job of warbling ""Learn to Be Lonely"" the film's closing title sequence which also happens to be its only new song. Director Joel Schumacher has managed a subtle coo with his sublime staging of the subject material. Is it theatrical? well, yes  and hampered by too many audience reaction shots and brief glimpses of the phantom lurking in the shadows. Like  no kidding, Joel; we know he's there. But Schumacher's been decidedly faithful to the show's Broadway roots without seeming stilted or stage bound. Overall, then, its one hell of a good attempt at recapturing the luster and magic of both Webber and LaRoux; and any film that has Emmy Rossum dripping honey from her lips as she emotes the haunting ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" against a backdrop of a silent and foggy graveyard gets my vote. Both she and that scene are poignantly exquisite. The 2-disc DVD from Warner is a visual and audio stunner  almost reaching reference quality levels. Colors are sumptuous, bold and vibrant. Blacks are velvety deep. Fine details are completely realized, even during the darkest scenes  of which there are many. The candle lit processional through the murky waters under Paris will deliver goose-pimples in both its execution and clarity. The audio is 5.1 and thrilling with Rossum's vocals, once again, the absolute high point in fidelity. A strong overall sonic characteristic, buffeted by deep sounding bass and perfectly light treble touches, make the audio presentation on par with sitting in the Broadway theater on opening night: outstanding! Extras include the comprehensive story behind, not only this film but the history of the Phantom himself, as well as a deleted scene and the film's original theatrical trailer.",The Phantom of the Opera
128,AZINDN,Spectacular Phantom Production on All Levels,10,5 December 2005,"With the reprise of big musicals, a production like Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" translate with spectacular aplomb to film. This is a sensuous delight for eye and ear in every line, curve and turn of the camera lens as the splendor of the 19th century Paris Opera House is brought to life with the backstage dramas and sensational architectural interiors. Director Joel Schumacher moves the cameras backstage and into the royal boxes as well as rooftop and dungeons of the famous opera structure giving a 3-d perspective to audiences. This realism brings the story closer to home as the pathos of the Phantom's existence is reinforced from the prison-like enclosure which is his domain. When the Phantom emerges to the cemetery where Christine flees to her father's grave, he follows and one wonders if this might be a fatal excursion for him as well. This is baroque storytelling in keeping the the high romanticism of the 19th century story, and it translates well with soaring orchestrations and operatic production numbers. Most stunning is the ""Mascarade"" production number in black and white, a stark but visually colorful rendition, it is a show stopper of set, costuming, and actor's ensemble forte.Actors singing with their own voices are the Phantom hot man, Gerald Butler (Tomb Raiders) who is more than mysterious, divine and sexy, while Patrick Wilson (Angels in America) balances Butler's deep baritone snarlings with a true and solid tenor as Gaston. In the role of the virginal Christine, Emmy Rossum (Passionata) is bright, cute, and perfectly cast. As diva, La Carlotta, only Minnie Driver (The Governess) is dubbed and it is her vocals over the closing credits that offers auditory proof why this was an excellent decision on the part of the filmmakers as the woman can't sing.The romantic story of the Phantom, a misanthropic character who tutors and loves from afar the orphaned Christine is the center of the action. Plucked from the chorus of the opera by the ominous Phantom, Christine is an overnight sensation after an accident temporarily sidelines diva, Carlotta. Worried over their investment in the Opera Populaire, its owners choose to ignore the directives sent by the Phantom to star Christine in every production, pay his salary, and keep box #5 for his exclusive use. Few ghosts have such audacity and their decision is more than costly, it is fatal.Gerald Butler is both menacing and heart breaking as the doomed Phantom, while young Rossum as the innocent Christine looks and acts a tad too naive and girlish for his earthy tastes. Patrick Wilson is very much the young, striking, and heroic savior of Christine. A childhood playmate, his attention to her is both age appropriate and expected for his forthright dashing character. He picks up where they left off in the sandbox and they fall in love to the jealousy and rage of the Phantom. This is a wonderful family film with visual excitement and superior costumes, production numbers and performances by the entire cast. It will delight and entertain all ages and should be included alongside other stunning visual musicals such as Moulin Rouge. A keeper!",The Phantom of the Opera

Directed by Joel Schumacher.From Chaney to Butler a boutique of classical music along with the arrival of color and sound.A remake of the 1923 black and white Rupert Julian Phantom of the Opera with the top movie monster leader along with Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, stars Lon Chaney as the in-genius Phantom. Only this time Gerard Butler takes his turn at the helm along with the others who have tried. Gerard gave a good performance and helped make the movie interesting but the singing I must say bored me a little. I imagined a musical to be a few songs here and there like The Lion King. I think Andrew Lylod Weber over indulged the audience with the constant singing while talking.The plot theme a young Phantom haunts the singers in a Paris Opera house. Who later becomes in love and schools young singer Christine (the beautiful Rossum with the lovely singing voice that was heard over and over) and wants to keep her with him. Christine has her eye set on a different singer Raoul (Wilson), when the Phantom becomes aware he grows mad.The movie was brilliantly shot in black and white with the color and flashbacks.

Everything was right there for him, the script, the music, the story, all he needed to do was get behind a camera.I like this phantom better than Michael Crawford. I never saw the original, but I do have it on cd. This guy did okay. Weak on the high notes? Hell, I wish I could sing high notes as well as the movie actor can (don't recall his name at the moment.) Also liked the way they mixed black and white and color sequences. Whatever happened to the phantom anyway? Did he die? And what happened to Christine as time went on? That final scene was sad. Also, this phantom seemed more like a madman than the ones I had seen in the past. This phantom sabotaged his own work by interrupting a performance of his own opera, kidnapping Christine, murdering half the cast and crew, and burning down the opera house. Not the act of a sane person.For the most part very well done. Would sure like to have the questions I asked above answered though. Seems like some loose ends weren't tied up.

131,Rosabel,Not good at all,1,3 March 2007,"I've never seen the stage musical, and I can only imagine that the live performance has some special atmosphere that has inspired its longevity and the devotion of its fans. This movie alone would leave me completely mystified as to the musical's popularity. It's rare that a movie can plod through over 2 hours without EVER quickening my pulse or raising my interest. As far as I'm concerned, the best moment in this film was right at the beginning, when the old chandelier was hoisted into the air and the opera house was transformed from a dust-covered, shabby wreck into a vibrant, red-and-gold vision. There was a true moment of spookiness as a mysterious wind swept the gray present away and brought to life a brightly-colored, lush past (even though it seemed copied from the transformation scene at the end of Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast').First problem - this story is NOT taking place in the famous Paris Opera House where Gaston Leroux set the original story. Instead, it's something called the Opera Populaire, definitely a cut below in terms of Art. So what we have is a sort of Frenchified Savoy Opera, while the audience is still dressed to the nines and drawn from the highest levels of society, which leads to a basic disconnect from the very beginning. It's hard to believe in Christine as a great artist whom the world takes seriously when her opera company is staging lewd burlesques and tasteless spectacles. In the book and earlier movies, the story revolved around several performances of Gounod's 'Faust'. But since all the music has to be written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it's a basic rule that you shouldn't put a great opera in the middle of your crappy opera, all serious music is eliminated and Christine sings wishy-washy ballads. A further problem is that the Phantom's score of 'Don Juan' doesn't sound any better than the crap 'Hannibal' and 'Il Muto' presented earlier in the movie, so HE doesn't impress as much of a genius, either.The two managers sing in a sort of fake Gilbert and Sullivan style, which increases my feeling that at times I was watching an overblown 'Topsy Turvy' - if you're going to do this sort of thing, you should at least find a witty lyricist. Thank goodness for DVD subtitles, because without them I wouldn't have had the faintest idea what Carlotta was screaming during her ""diva"" song.I agree with those who have already commented on the Phantom's very minor facial deformity - Christine's expression throughout the unmasking scene is so unchanged, I thought she was sharing my perplexity at his reaction. What's the big deal? He's not THAT bad - look, she isn't even scared! I thought that maybe there was some psychological point being made here, that a nearly-normal looking man could be so mentally scarred that he would THINK that he was hideous and hide himself away, but eventually I came to the conclusion that nothing so deep was being attempted. The actress just couldn't convey emotion.",The Phantom of the Opera
132,Ishallwearpurple,From an older woman's POV----,10,28 December 2004,"----it was marvelous, The music and voices were good and for my money, the story was much more involving in the film. I saw it on stage once, and loved the music and costumes, but the story was not as well deliniated as in the film.The sequence on the rooftop with the snow falling and Raoul and Christine singing ""All I Ask Of You"", with the Phantom lurking and listening among the chimneys as his heart breaks, was beautiful and moved me to tears. Which didn't happen when I saw it on stage.I sat in row 6 on the aisle to see the play, and the chandelier coming straight down on my head to miss at the last moment, was heart stopping, which can't be duplicated on film. But it was spectacular anyway.The ball scene and the ""Primadonna"" number were just magnificent - worth the price of admission.I plan to see the film again soon, and can't wait for the DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
133,Fever,Why don't people like this?,8,10 May 2005,"I was very excited to finally see this--being a huge fan of the play. I was rather impressed. Emmy Rossum was fabulous--an amazing voice and a quite a convincing Christine. The costumes and filming were beautifully done, I especially like the beginning where the old opera house transforms into the previous version.I've read and heard some of the negative comments. You have to remember several things when you watch this. Gerard Butler plays the Phantom, but doesn't quite hit the mark. He is no Michael Crawford...then again, no one will ever be. Butler doesn't have the same ""fear factor"" or enigmatic elegance of Crawford. He set our standards rather high. If you've never heard of Crawford or the original soundtrack, you are truly missing out. Better hear that first before seeing the movie. Also, remember people, this is an opera. There are very few spoken lines...duh.The only real criticism I have of the movie is the chandelier. I kept waiting for it to fall after the rooftop scene, and nothing happened. Though it did fall finally, it did so at an unusual point. Rather than being the climax of the first act, it became a clever escape route. Also, the twist at the end was interesting, though irrelevant to the overall story.I would give this movie the credit it deserves. Instead of the same CGI, violent, bloody, useless movies these days, this one actually uses something rarely seen: talent.",The Phantom of the Opera
134,MrBiddle,Let me be your shelter.,10,10 April 2005,"Breathtaking cinematography, elegant styling by veteran director Joel Schumacher and a virtually flawless performance by all involved. Was particularly surprised to see Minnie Driver play an unlikable character - Carlota.Emmy Rossum is beautiful as Christine, the performance of ""That's All I ask of You"" in the rooftop is nothing short of spellbinding. And I love the way the camera angle just tracks away skyward. I don't know how they do that.I never would have had faith in Joel Schumacher ever since the last 2 Batman movies, but even then that impression of mine has changed because as I was told it was Warner Bros. the studios who cracked the whip lobbying for a more flamboyant adaptation - which turned out inappropriate for the DC Comics adapted sequels.But he did PHONE BOOTH - a movie with excellent performances and sharp direction. And he has other movies like 8MM, FALLING DOWN or ST. ELMO'S FIRE that might suggest that the costume designer turned helmer is also quite an actor's director.And Schumacher's versatility as a director becomes evident - with this extravagant masterpiece being lined up with the other movies in his repertoire, he has got suspense, comedy, action. And his movie prior to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA which was a drama - VERONICA GUERIN.And as for the story that all stemmed from the Gaston Laoreux novel - besides a lot of beautiful music we get very simple, very touching character arcs that is bound to purchase emotional response. Even if you see it coming. Or have heard about it coming. It's the execution of the movie that ultimately causes how PHANTOM OF THE OPERA results. And if a film results, that is it's own grammar.PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
135,MovieZoo,Charm and Beauty Abounds,10,3 November 2005,"I know it's a little late for posting a review on this movie, but I believe in ""better late than never"". And it is never too late for this beauty.Does it sound like I loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera? Well, yes I did, but I want to be fair. The funny thing is, you will find people with similar backgrounds and similar tastes having strong differences of opinions on the results. It is never a sure thing when it comes to trying to pinpoint who likes what. Try to predict who likes this movie! I dare ya!***********SPOILER of sorts********** A man, a genius it is said, who grew up in his own world for approximately a decade (denied and deprived) finds a friend in a lovely orphan and yet, is content with remaining a mystery to her, hiding in the shadows, while somehow(probably subliminally and maybe hypnotically) training her for a career in the Opera. Once Christine has grown and has had the chance to show her talent(thanks to the Phantom), she becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend named Raoul and seemingly falls in love with him. Now, more than ever, the Phantom believes it is time to make his move. If not, he will lose the one he has shared his nights with, although hiding from her all this time. Once he makes his decision to show himself, some of the most beautiful music comes into being - music from the heart and soul. And it is with music that we are all touched. And I do not care how tough you are, you, too, will be touched.It is a sure bet that most people who loved the stage production will see this movie at some point, but not every one of them will like it because it seems the greatest disagreements are in the voices and the production. I loved both versions because they are not entirely the same. So, I do not understand the people who did not like the movie because, it would seem, they more than likely would have been happier with a videotape of the stage show. Heck, I would love that, too. I think the world is big enough for all the different versions of The Phantom but there is no way that any version(by the way, I believe there are 10 versions now) can come close to this most recent success of Andrew Lloyd Webber's. At least, not yet.If you never saw the stage show and are thinking about seeing the movie AND you are still reading this review(of course you are), go! See it! You don't have to be someone who loves musicals or romances, which is what this movie is, to like this movie. Just be forewarned, there is always a first time for everything.I just hope you can find your way out of the lair. Try leaving the theater without a red eye! I dare ya!",The Phantom of the Opera
136,Asteri-Atypical,"All in all, it was great (but The Phantom was no Angel of Music!)",8,15 March 2005,"Overall, I found this interpretation of ""Phantom"" to be satisfying, starting from the very beginning with the sepia-toned ""flash forward"" to the treatment of the opera house during the overture. The treatment the visuals was generally excellent and left me satisfied. The best example of this was the cemetery scene where Christine sings ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"". Very moving.In general, I observed that where they were true to the original stage musical (which, thankfully, was most of it), it was great - but where it deviated from the original, it failed and I found myself wondering ""why did they change that""? The two most notable exceptions to this principle are: 1. The ending. The scene they added was the only alteration which actually added to Phantom.2. The Phantom's vocals. I was dumbfounded with just how weak the Phantom's vocal performance was. I've seen Phantom on stage a number of times and the worst of those who portrayed the Phantom were still vastly superior to Gerard Butler, vocally. As a classically trained vocalist myself, it was a let-down. Additionally, Butler didn't use his hands, posture and body language as well as stage actors I've seen. For a big-budget movie, you would think they would have gotten the best they could. I can only imagine they went with looks and a ""sexy"" Phantom as opposed to a talented one.All in all, it was a joy and it's great to see the Phantom on the big screen. I can only hope an EXTENDED version DVD will be available.",The Phantom of the Opera
137,Sinnerman,"Listen to the music of the night, let your heart soar, let it take flight.",10,5 January 2005,"From the start go, I was already mesmerised by the rapturous opening sequence of this film. It boasts of the best B&W to colour transition I have ever seen on film! Now imagine the bursting of a thousand light bulbs adorning a fallen chandelier. Witness the rising ""Mexican wave"" of said fixture from the ground zero of a dilapidated, colour-drained building to its rightful place on the ceiling. As it rises, behold the ascending explosion of Technicolor splashes and crystal clear sheen shrink wrapping whatever it touches. We are witnessing the glorious restoration of a previously grainy architectural shell into an opulently regal music hall. Throughout this sequence, the familiar strains of the Phantom's theme reverberates across the hall, pounding my ears and thumping my chest. The place now screams with a pregnant zest and swims in breathtaking grandeur. My senses are filled to the brim and my blood pumper must have required resuscitation from the jolts of those bursting lightbulbs. Aaaaarrrrggghhh!! Its so beautiful!!! The show is about to begin!!!! Absorbing the awe-inspiring sights and sound of this one above transformation sequence alone is already enough to torch my heart to cinders. But like the best musicals out there, the beauty of Phantom also lies in its amazing ability to generate waves after tidal waves of wildly abandoned joys and heedlessly sensuous emotions. I marvel at its tenacious will and entrancing powers to sustain this high. And it accomplished this through its arresting visuals, its heart stopping song and dance set pieces, plus the most expressive of instruments known to men, the voices. Though the rawness of their vocals is apparent, especially for viewers more accustomed to the Crawford/ Brightman set, the troupe of courageous actors in this movie adaptation (notably Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson) used their voices to convey their feelings with wide-eyed sincerity and piercing honesty. They imbued their admittedly archetypical roles without regard for vanity or self-consciousness. In so doing, they have broken through the threshold set upon them and crossed into the point of no return. By singing their hearts out and fearlessly pouring out their souls, they opened my receptivity floodgates for the irrational and sucked me into their world. And this is a world where broad narrative strokes serves a purpose and the beauty of simple emotions is embraced. This is a world of the musicals where love reign supreme, where its allure is so addictively insular, advocates like me willingly lock myself in. So damned shall be those, who disagree and nitpick. The Phantom is immune to their callous one-liners. My final few words Spectacularly choreographed, sumptuously scored, immaculately filmed and lucidly acted, Phantom of the Opera has kidnapped my wild invested imaginings and ran with it. This counts as one of my most sensational cinematic experience this year. Unforgettable! Now excuse me while I join in the queue for yet another screening, for I so wanna plunge back into the escapist paradise of that unabashedly love-soaked opera-house. I so wanna get back to that roof-top scene where the kaleidoscopic shades of love blossom and wither in the space of a melodic verse. Now all I ask of you, is to understand that this film has an indelible Sinnerman stamp of approval. It's not worth much of course, but so are the words of my detractors. It will be best if you go see the movie and decide for yourself. Aaaaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhh! I love love love this movie!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
138,princebansal1982,A Movie is more than sum of its parts,5,30 June 2011,This movie has lot of ingredients I normally hate like over the top background score and an over the top melodramatic story and the songs. But I loved this movie. Because all these ingredients combine to form a dish that is much greater than the sum of its parts.Music is the highlight here of course as it is a musical. It is just amazing and sets the mood for the whole movie. It actually feels like an additional character. Sets and costumes are opulent and a treat to look at. Camera-work is masterful. I was just hooked from the time when black white is changed to color and the movie transitions into past for the first time. And the movie never lets you go.I was initially skeptical about Emmy Rossum's acting abilities. I didn't expect her to deliver a performance in keeping with the movie but she surprised me. Gerald Butler was good as always.,The Phantom of the Opera
139,bosscain,A Pure Delight!,10,26 December 2004,"Andrew Lloyd Webbers ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is by far THE best version of this film that I have ever seen. Joel Schumacher does one of the best directing performances in his career. Coming in at just over 2 and a half hours (143 minutes) you will feel that time is Irrelavant with this dazzling motion picture. Not a single little detail was overlooked in this magnificent production.The costumes were amazing, the stages were overwhelming, the actors and actresses were stunning, and the singing voice of Emmy Rossum (Christine) made you think that there was and angel come down from heaven. The musical score was bold and stunning and made you feel as though you were seated next to an old fashioned pipe organ. I would give this movie my top recommendations and a must see for everyone. 10+/10",The Phantom of the Opera
140,sibisi73,Overindulgent.,5,31 January 2005,"There is little doubt that in the transference from stage to screen this musical has lost none of it's opulence or extravagance. The film is a triumph of production design, of artifice over art, with barely a rounded characterisation in sight. The leads are as bland as the source material, but at least there's a supporting cast who realised that a spirited performance is, at least, a distraction from the main event. Nothing, however, can overwhelm the fact that this is a musical of dubious quality - Lloyd Webber's histrionic score succeeds in conjuring up the required Gothic atmosphere (especially when the soundtrack volume is cranked way up), and Schumacher delivers a sumptuous, swirling homage to Baz Luhrman's 'Moulin Rouge' - but overcoming Hart's trite, sophomoric lyrics is too much for anyone.",The Phantom of the Opera

The main character, the one known as The Phantom, has been living in a local Opera House most of his life, demanding that the owners pay him a salary of 20,000 French francs per month to leave them alone.During the time a production company is practicing a play at this opera house, the Phantom lurks in the shadow's and watches. He eventually takes a liking to one of the beautiful understudies by the name of Christine and makes himself known to her.Unfortunately, Christine's heart lies with another man, Raoul, she knew from her childhood.The phantom's jealousy leads him to do things, anything, to make Christine love him.Eventually, The Phantom has to learn that he can't ""make"" someone love him back, and has to learn one of life's lessons, that if you love something, you have to set it free.A sad story love, but a story I identify with, as I am sure many other people do, to.I felt so sorry for the Phantom. Because he had suffered so much in his life being in a circus freak show and abused when he was a boy before being rescued by a young girl on a school field trip, who helps him escape and hides him in the Opera House.He so much wanted to be loved back.I highly recommend this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
142,shaid,"Good, but for who is it made?",8,9 February 2005,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This is almost one to one adaptation for the famous stage musical of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Almost one to one because unlike what people thinks there are changes. Omissions in the text and changes in 2 scene's. However those changes will only be recognised by die-hard fans of the original stage show.This said one has to admit that the original stage show had its weaknesses. One big weakness was the fact the characters in the musical are nothing more than a sketch on the drawing board. Webber and his lyrics writer have striped the characters of the original book of Gaston Laroux so they can represent idea's. Christine Daaé is the young orphan girl who seek help. Roul is her childhood friend who becomes her fiancée. And so it goes on with all the characters who represent an idea.With the above-mentioned in your mind you should not expect much of characters development from this film version. And to be fair, Webber's material have found and apt director with Joel Schumacher. Who manage making the stage show look alive and glittering. Just like an Opera show, where the whole film take place.Baring in mind the characters' description I can only praise most of the cast. Emmy Rossum(Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Roul) are very good and convincing as the lead characters.(those who complain of the absent of Sarah Brightman should remember that Brightman is in her late 40's and would look ridiculous if she try to play a young girl of 17). Gerard Butler on the other hand was less convincing. It seems his voice was not up for the task and in some scene's he sound like he was pressing his voice too hard. The rest of the cast was fairly good and did it job well. The only one who I didn't like is Minnie Driver. She is simple miscast as the Opera's Diva. She can not sing(and the end title reveal what one has suspected through the film. Someone else was singing for her) and in this film she also can't act. Webber could have found someone better for this role.All in all it's quite a good film. The question is: For who?. If you are a musicals' fan. If you have seen the stage show and liked it. You should go and see it. You will enjoy the film. Otherwise you should stay away from this film.",The Phantom of the Opera
143,the_Poppuns,So close,8,23 August 2006,"This movie could have been a 12/10. Okay I realize that the IMDb only goes up to 10/10, which makes sense obviously, but I have given a few 11s in my mind in the past. This movie was one and only one flaw, but a gi-normous flaw, away from being a 12.The Phanton can't sing.I sat there watching this movie and it was killing me because everything was so so perfect, except for the Phantom. I had to immediately watch the special features to find out what explanation there was for hiring their lead actor. My interpretation of what Webber said was that he didn't sing as pretty as Patrick Wilson, so they hired him (and Schumacher thought he looked good). That's the worst explanation I've ever heard. I know what they meant. They wanted someone rougher for the role of the Phantom and I guess they also meant for his voice to be rough. What a terrible decision. Gerard Butler seems like a nice man, but he really wasn't a good choice at all. It's not his fault. Anyone would want the role and take it if it was offered. It's the fault of those who hired him and told him that he could do it. Webber also said something about him having a certain 'rock and roll to him' that he wanted in the Phantom. Which begs the question, then why not hire a rock singer? There are so many that you and I could think of that could have done a better job. The first person I thought of, who doesn't fit their age requirement either, was Geoff Tate. I know you probably don't know who that is but his voice just rang out in my ears the minute I heard Webber say that. But the fact is there are many actors out there, who can sing, working right now who could have done a better job. So, I still don't get it. I just hope Antonio didn't watch it. I don't know how I'd deal with it if I were him.Apart from that :), I thought it was perfect. I liked Patrick Wilson A LOT. I had only seen him in ""Angels In America"", which I love and thought he was great in but I'd never heard him sing before. He was amazing. Emmy Rossum I had only seen in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and had guessed that all the hype she was getting was because she was a pretty young actress. But she blew me away. I didn't expect it. Minnie Driver was awesome and in spite of my general hatred of stunt singing I thought it was the exact right thing in this case. She did such a great job acting the part and now that I see what can happen when someone who isn't completely qualified does their own singing, I think it was the right way to go. The supporting cast was excellent. The art direction, costumes, cinematography....excellent, excellent, excellent. I didn't expect much from Schumacher to tell you the truth but he did a fantastic job. Just that one major honking flaw. I think the Masquerade number is stupendous, maybe even better than Bindi Sad Diamonds from Moulin Rouge. I guess Moulin Rouge provided a path for musicals to come back which I think is great especially when they can come out as nearly perfect as Phantom of the Opera. Both movies can take a place among Hollywood's classic musicals. I still don't get why Chicago got all the praise, though.",The Phantom of the Opera

145,divaclv,Disaster Aria,2,11 February 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera, as a character, is a man whose intense physical ugliness conceals a remarkable spirita soul as filled with frightening shadows as it is with glorious light, one which seems to contain both the best and worst aspects of human nature. By contrast, the latest film version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" is the exact inverse of its title character: it looks nice enough, but that's all there is. Scratch its gilded surface (and there is plenty of gilt to go around) and you find neither passion, nor life, nor soul.There are those who will argue that this is on a par with the long-running musical which is the film's most direct antecedent, but I would disagree. Andrew Lloyd Webber's mega-blockbuster of a stage show has its flaws (most notably a book that leaves more to the imagination than necessary), but done properly it remains a powerful and effective piece of theater. Alan Jay Lerner said of the story (a truly operatic yarn about a young singer torn between her disfigured impresario and her handsome childhood sweetheart) ""it just works,"" and he's rightbut it requires two things in order to do so: a strong director who can handle romantic melodrama without descending into the ridiculous, and a talented and energetic cast to give life to the characters. ""Phantom"" the film has neither, and as a result comes crashing to earth fasterand soonerthan a certain ill-fated lighting fixture.Having previously spoiled the legacy of that other masked man, Joel Schumacher steps into the director's chair for ""Phantom,"" and does no favors for it either. Schumacher is clearly attempting to follow in the footsteps of recent movie musical successes ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago,"" but he has none of the boundless energy and enthusiasm Baz Luhrman brought to the former, nor the inventive wit and style Rob Marshall infused the latter with. Much of the time, Schumacher seems to borrow from his betterswho in addition to Luhrman and Marshall include James Cameron, Jean Cocteau, David Lynch, Rupert Julian (director of the famous silent version of ""Phantom"" with Lon Chaney), and Hal Prince (director of the stage version of the musical)and at one point, even delves into his inferiors by evoking the spirit of Ed Wood. Left to his own devices, he makes so many missteps that I could spend the rest of the review listing them. High on the list: he overplays the sensual undercurrents of ""Phantom's"" primary love story. This is an element present in the stage version, but while Hal Prince nicely underscored the quasi-sexual tension between Phantom and pupil while maintaining an appropriately Victorian sense of restraint, Schumacher attacks this element with all the grace and subtlety of a Harlequin Romance cover crossed with an MTV music video. You half expect a ""wardrobe malfunction"" to occur at any moment.Schumacher is also wildly uneven in his casting, with the weakest link showing up in the place it can least be afforded: the title character. As the Phantom, Gerard Butler struts around, sneers, and swirls his cape, but never comes close to achieving the fine mix of menace, pathos, and mysterious allure that has made the character so intriguing for nearly a century. He also lacks the Phantom's two primary physical characteristics: his hideous face, and his beautiful singing voice. The former (presumably Schumacher's fault for not wanting to make his lead character one iota less attractive than necessary) resembles a moderately bad allergic reaction rather than a disfigurement which would drive a person to madness and isolation; half the time it's impossible to tell that there's anything wrong with him at all. Butler's singing is much more repellent than his lookshis harsh, grating, and over-labored sound makes many of the libretto's high points, particularly the signature song ""Music of the Night,"" a chore to sit through. As Christine, the pretty young thing who fires the Phantom's desires and dementia, Emmy Rossum is a bit easier to listen too (there's little wrong with her voice that cannot be cured with training and maturity), but her thin sound makes it hard to believe her as an operatic sensation, and she never infuses the character with much personality. Only Patrick Wilson, as the dashing aristocrat who forms the third point of this love triangle, shows the level of vocal and acting talent needed to make ""Phantom"" work, but he's saddled with the story's least interesting character and a poofy wig that would look silly in any other movie, but in comparison with some of the other pompadours in evidence here is downright subdued.With the three leads unable to carry ""Phantom's"" emotional and dramatic weight, there's little anyone else can do to salvage itbut a few of the supporting cast members have a go anyway. Miranda Richardson, despite affecting a Pepe le Pew accent, does some good work as a ballet mistress who knows more than she tells. Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow have a few moments as the opera's beleaguered management, as does Kevin McNally as an ill-fated stagehand. However, Minnie Driver as Carlotta sounds like she came in from a community theater production of ""West Side Story"" and acts as if she's being paid by decibel (she also uses a voice double for her singing, a practice I normally deplorethough in this case, it might have been advisable for most of the other cast members to follow in her footsteps).""Phantom of the Opera"" is not a complete wasteseveral of the sets are, as I said, nice enough to look at, and even the mismanagement of director and cast cannot rob the music and story of all their power. There's even some humor to be found, though much of it is unintentional. But of material which has been so successful for so long, much more is expectedand much more should have been given.",The Phantom of the Opera
146,Mr_PCM,Excellent adaptation and exhilarating film,9,8 April 2005,"The film version of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's long-running popular stage show had a lot to live up to to satisfy its demanding fans, who would cry heresy quicker than any 'trekkie' if anything different appeared in the film. It generally succeeds here, but may struggle for the crossover appeal Chicago won.Joel Schumacher and Lloyd-Webber have combined to produce a lavish, Gothic spectacle. Schumacher made a gloriously over-the-top The Lost Boys, and indulges himself more here, and the result is certainly a visual feast. The chandelier rising whilst the powerful introductory chords reverberate is particularly electrifying, and of course the ever-present dry ice use really recalls the 80s. Lloyd-Webber also makes his presence felt, as along with scoring some new musical sequences, he insisted all principals should sing their parts perfectly, and he largely succeeds.Emmy Rossum excels as Christine, and her voice is both mesmerising and angelic, remarkable considering she was only 17 when filming began. Gerard Butler's Phantom is also largely good, and Minnie Driver obviously relishes playing highly-strung diva Carlotta, though Patrick Wilson's Raoul is rather limp.The Gothic-romantic feel of the film may not be to everyone's tastes but it has a darkly enjoyable quality to it. Emmy Rossum has the most beautiful, innocent voice heard on the silver screen in a long while. Gerard Butler's voice also benefits from repeat viewings, and whilst Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds are barely adequate singers, they are comically superb. See the film, and if the chandelier rising in the overture while those grand synth chords reverberate doesn't raise the hairs everywhere on your neck, back and arms, then you're missing what cinema is all about! Overall, the film is both visually and musically breathtaking, but the grand romantic plot and OTT theatrics may ultimately fail to convince non-fans of musicals. Nevertheless, as a piece of escapist cinema it is terrifically enjoyable, and a superb example of the power of the silver screen.",The Phantom of the Opera
147,JRmf,"Fantastic, sublime, surreal...",9,28 May 2005,"I was eager to see this screen adaptation of the famous work, as my only exposure to it prior to that was from hearing the soundtrack of the original Broadway stage play some dozens of times over the past two decades.I was not disappointed, even though the film does appear to differ substantially from the play, mainly in the latter half. Roughly the first half of the production was exactly as I had imagined it from the soundtrack. Film does of course offer greater physical scope than stage i.e. the hero on the white charger, the scenes outside the opera house. The opening scene where the dilapidated opera house (in black and white) transforms back to its original glory is marvellous to see. The film also goes into the Phantom's and Christine's origins in some depth, and explicitly describes how the Phantom early in life was a maltreated circus freak who escaped and found refuge in the bowels of the opera house. In the play, there is always some doubt as to whether the Phantom is real or not.As for the singing, when first seeing the film I was not impressed by that of either of the male leads (Phantom or Raoul); Emmy Rossum's voice seemed the equal of Sarah Brightman's in the play, though on comparing the two soundtracks several times since, I found Sarah's voice to be superior. She was after all in her mid twenties at the time, whereas Emmy was only 17. Sarah renders her parts with a peculiar delicacy, feeling and effortlessness which Emmy approaches but does not quite match, though her singing is very good.In the film, the Phantom at times seems to struggle with his parts. Sometimes he sounds more like the hero than the villain; Raoul's tenor voice sounded a bit too foppish for a hero. In the play, the vocal characterisation of both Raoul and the Phantom was much more appropriate, and consistently rendered, for their roles. Noticeably absent in the film is the Phantom's evil, raucous laugh.Of course this is a personal perspective, and many will say that such comparisons should not be made. For many this will be their first and probably only exposure to Andrew Lloyd Webber's great creation. I am sure that to such, the film stands as a brilliant performance in its own right. 9/10",The Phantom of the Opera
148,tml_pohlak_13,Murder Most Foul,1,12 March 2009,"Hoorah! Joel Schumacher does it again! This time, he takes a script, derived from Gaston Leroux's masterpiece, The Phantom of the Opera, and completely rapes any production value it had! Pop open the champagne as we celebrate yet another of Schumacher's failures.But let's not be unfair to the movie. After all, the sets are glorious, as are many of the costumes. It is really pleasing to the eye, beautiful to look at. Sadly, Schumacher decided that he might as well stop there.The acting? Poor Gerald Butler. The guy really did a good job as the Phantom, but he got absolutely no help from his supporting cast! Emmy Rossum has a nice singing voice, but can't act. Simple, isn't it? Patrick Wilson plays Raoul as if he was a girl! Miranda Richardson plays Madame Giry. But Giry is not a wise old woman any more. She is the cliché ""mysterious foreigner"" who conveniently has connections to the Phantom.I was also quite disappointed at how vastly the plot was altered. I could've lived with some changes here and there, but this is just about a completely different plot. One of the book's most torturous, mind-bending scenes, is reduced to 15 seconds of screen time, and just about as thrilling as a hall of mirrors at the local carnival.The singing itself is O.K., but here is the problem: the actors (well, Butler is the only exception once again) stop acting when they start singing if you could call their efforts ""acting"" in the first place. Maybe Schumacher enforces some sort of ""no-acting"" rule on the set? The Phantom of the Opera gets two thumbs down: pleasing to the eye, assault on the ears and on the mind.",The Phantom of the Opera
149,alexkolokotronis,You Can't Ask For Everything.......Especially With Joel Schumacher,10,27 June 2009,"The Phantom of the Opera is of course a very well known story and has been adapted so many times that you would probably lose count if you tried. This of course is the musical adaptation if you may have not realized by now. Now if any part of your criticism of this film has to do with it being a musical then you probably didn't enjoy viewing it. I, myself are in no way a fan of musicals but in this case I found the experience of watching this film to be extremely gratifying.For once I did not find myself feeling disgusted at the direction of Joel Schumacher. Joel Schumacher definitely handled this storyline with much more care then he has with other films throughout his career. Right from the opening minutes the film became extremely engaging and really never slows down. One thing for sure, and most people would agree, is that the set design and visual glamour of the film is astounding.Yet one aspect of the film that certainly has not caught on with everyone is the acting of Gerard Butler who plays the Phantom. Such criticisms as he is not scary at all or he is lacking in the area of singing. For me his singing did not bother me one bit and the fact of him not being scary enough is just ridiculous to fault him for that. This film is a musical, not a horror movie. You simply can't expect a singing murderer to ever really be scary. If there is anyone to pick at for falling short it is Patrick Wilson. In my view he never presents anything unique or appealing in his performance. He, in a way, just seems to be just there. Emmy Rossum though certainly asserted her presence in the film. Her feelings as well as the Phantom's are always felt not despite the singing or music but rather with the help of it.Personally this is my favorite musical and I definitely recommend it even if you're not a fan of musicals. Keep in mind as I stated before there won't be much of a horror factor but that is not really the point. This is by all means a romance and tackles the theme of loneliness in a very touching, poignant and compassionate way. The Phantom of the Opera is certainly gruesome but instead poetic.",The Phantom of the Opera
150,suessis,Not Enough and Too Much...,6,3 January 2005,"Reportedly, Schumacher wanted to audition Gerard Butler for the Phantom after he had seen him in ""Dracula 2000"". I'm not surprised. Gerard got many a libido going with his highly charged performance as the embodiment of dark animal lust. As The Phantom is a dark sexual character, The actor playing that role not only has to be able to convey that with his singing voice, but also with his acting performance. After having played Dracula Butler should be a shoo in, and he almost succeeds.While I don't think that his voice is terrible, I also don't think that it's fabulous either. Sometimes his acting ability helps, but with the exception of ""Point of No Return"", I didn't feel that he quite achieved what he was looking for.I have never seen the Broadway Production, but I have heard the cast album. I have to confess that when I listened to that I couldn't envision Crawford as the Phantom. I was thinking too much about the character he played in ""Hello Dolly"". I find it easier to see Butler in this role.On the whole, I think this film is done too much like a Broadway musical. I preferred the way ""Evita"" was done. Smaller more intimate than the whole big stage production. I think if they had gone that route it would have been a much more effective film.",The Phantom of the Opera
151,98nurdinm-1,A Haunting Work!,7,28 May 2005,"I'm a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber. My favourite musical of his is ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" - I love that guitar riff that echoes through ""Heaven On their Minds"" - and I'm also quite fond of ""Sunset Boulevard"". Oh, and I also really, really like this musical as well.I am not, however, one of Joel Schumacher's biggest fans. Ever since ""Batman & Robin"", I have stepped carefully around any film of his, apart from his first ""Batman"" film, ""Batman Forever"", which is arguably as good as Tim Burton's original.So you can imagine my reaction when I heard that Schumacher was going to direct the big screen version of Lloyd-Webber's masterpiece. ""Oh God"", I say to myself, ""the Phantom's cloak will have nipples!"" There was, however, no need to worry. Working very closely with the composer himself, Schumacher has pulled off a fantastic film. Just like Alan Parker's ""Evita"", this film keeps to the storyline and captures that period of time in which the musical is set - 1800s Paris, France.It was that wonderful moment at the beginning, when the chandelier is hoisted back up to the crashing chords on the organ of the Phantom's Theme, and the Opera House is transformed back to it's original glory, that I knew I wouldn't have to worry with the music. What's also brilliant is how stereotypical this music is to begin with. Along with the distress on the elderly Raoul's face, this give us the impression that the Phantom is a creature we must fear, like Lon Chaney's masterful performance in the silent 1925 version. The stereotypes continue with the introduction of Minnie Driver's wonderful Prima Donna Carlotta, a typical Opera Diva.But the real stars are the two main characters. Gerard Butler is very good as the Phantom. Although he does not have the vocal range some may have desired from the role, and there will obviously be comparisons with Michael Crawford's legendary performance both on Broadway and the West End, his ""Music Of The Night"" is chilling and beautifully eerie at the same time - and how the hell does he manage to hold that last note for so long? Emmy Rossum as Christine is not perhaps a surprise choice for the role - she is, after all, a trained opera singer herself. One thing that I noticed is that Rossum's Christine seems to gain in confidence throughout her first solo, ""Think Of Me"". By the time she gets to ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", the first tune which is arguably her own, she has become stronger in voice and delivery.What also helps is the supporting cast. Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds are very funny as the managers of the Opera, and Jennifer Ellison's Meg is sweet and innocent, as well as curious and talented. Miranda Richardson is, as always, magnificent. Only Patrick Wilson's Raoul seemed to grate on me. A very good singer, but I often felt that he was too much of a wet blanket. When I asked the girls who had accompanied me to see this movie in the cinema, they all agreed that Christine should have gone off with the Phantom instead of Raoul! This leads to an interesting point. The Phantom kills, yet in the songs that he sings and the performance of Butler, we feel as an audience that we should pity him. Is he an insane, manic obsessive who should be locked away, or is he rebelling against the years of cruelty he has endured because of his disfigurement and is in fact truly in love with Christine? After watching it a few more times I feel I'm inclined to agree with the girls - Christine, you made the wrong choice, woman! Best part of the film? Probably that wonderful duet between the Phantom and Christine, ""Point Of No Return"". Oh, and the chandelier crashing down.P.S: Buy the DVD! The extras alone are fantastic, with an in-depth look at the making of the show and interviews with composer, lyricist and producer! Some of the stuff I have mentioned in this review is mentioned also in one or two of these extra features.7/10",The Phantom of the Opera
152,GHCool,The play was better,6,31 December 2004,"I just got back from seeing the film. I enjoyed the play a lot and I enjoyed the movie too, but not as much. All the technical elements (especially the beautiful cinematography by John Mathieson who did Hannibal) were excellent. I had my doubts about Joel Schumacher directing the film. I was afraid the Phantom's costume would be ""anatomically correct,"" but I think this is one of Schumacher's most technically polished films and he was exactly right for the material.I thought the woman who played Christine, Emmy Rossum had an excellent singing voice. Gerard Butler as the Phantom was a better actor than Rossum, but his singing voice was sort of average. I have some complaints about Patrick ""Raoul"" Wilson's voice too.My biggest complaint was that the Phantom's face wasn't really that hideously distorted. If that Phantom went out in public, nobody would even care. That face does not doom him in any way whatsoever. I agree with John Beifuss of Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN) who wrote, ""The Phantom calls himself a 'loathsome gargoyle,' but, unmasked, he looks more like a guy with a bad sunburn, or maybe a seafood allergy."" I guess I would give it a 6 out of 10. Slightly above average. A modest recommendation.",The Phantom of the Opera
153,SILENCEikillyou,It broke my heart.... again,10,3 May 2005,"I've seen this production three times on stage. Twice in Chicago and once in Toronto. Watching this movie, just now, on my computer has broke my heart again. I wish I had seen it in the theater where the sound would have been better. However, you know what... it didn't matter. I was so moved by the movie version, I had to give it a 10/10. This version shows even more, the plight of the Phantom. The music, more than once, made me get all choked up. Get this!! The very menu screen caused me to fight back tears. That Phantom theme gets me every time. I don't know why. In short: I loved this movie! You must give this movie a try for yourself, whether you've seen the stage production, or not. I hope to see it in person again, someday. However, it's SO AWESOME to own it and to know that I can watch it whenever I want (it came out today on DVD). I wouldn't change a thing in this version. I'm a man and it made me get teary-eyed. I hate to admit that, but it's true. The only move to ever to that to me before was A.I. Strange? Maybe. But this film had all the elements necessary to affect me: Music. Costumes. Superb acting. Superb vocal renditions. I loved it, and I can't say it enough.",The Phantom of the Opera

155,gerry-russell-139,"The world's biggest musical at long last on the big screen complete with grand piano, red velvet draperies, candles, and all the trimmings...",7,22 December 2004,"If you know nothing about PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, you may find a sentence in this review to be a slight spoiler. Otherwise, disregard.If you've seen this masterpiece on the stage and you enjoyed that, then PHANTOM devotees will appreciate (if not absolutely love) the massive screen interpretation. In retrospect and after purchasing the 2-disc soundtrack of the film, I'm much more impressed by Gerard Butler's singing than Michael Crawford's. Crawford (whom I've never really been a fan) sounds like a shallow chorus boy with a sunny, benevolent tenor in his voice whereas Butler gives it all right from his gut and shows the tortured, ever-present dark side of his existence, only singing softly with the occasional lilt in his throat when absolutely necessary. I saw the San Francisco production ten years ago with Franc D'Ambrosio (most famous as Al Pacino's opera-singing son Anthony in THE GODFATHER PART III) and, thankfully, his performance was more equal to Gerry's rather than Crawford's. Ms. Emmy Rossum (a relative newcomer to the screen) has had classical training as an opera soprano with the New York Metropolitan Opera and as Christine, the Phantom's gorgeous muse, her voice is literally like listening to an angel (no pun intended, i.e. the Phantom's presence has been referred to as the Angel of Music throughout the film and the play). Patrick Wilson unfortunately was not at all a stand out as Christine's childhood sweetheart and prospective suitor; only at the very end of the film does he project his obvious vocal ability as I've seen and heard him do in other projects. Minnie Driver is a definite presence as Carlotta, the arrogant diva with a voice that causes many of her colleagues/managers as well as the audience to cover their ears when she hits the high notes. Her accent as the Italian beauty and facial expressions/body language are very good and utterly comical, allowing her to definitely steal each scene she is in. Mulit-talented British actress Miranda Richardson is Mdme. Giry, the opera ballet mistress who knows more than she lets on about the mysterious Phantom aka, Opera Ghost. Her french accent is good and her part is not as pushed into the background as those of us who saw the stage version would expect.But for me, the central attraction of this musical epic is and forever shall be Gerry Butler and his bravura romantic/tortured portrayal of the unforgettable Phantom. I am man enough to admit that I was sobbing a watershed at the end if only because of his talent coupled with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's immortal score.If you're a fan of either Sir Andrew and his music or of the PHANTOM itself or even if you know nothing or very little of the story I urge all of you to go see this film. Going into the cinema this afternoon I was thinking to myself, I hope this film lives up to its stage version. Rest assured, I really doubt if any of you will leave the theater disliking the film. You'll love it (as I did) or you'll think it a good film with good performances, but hate it?!!!... don't be absurd! Forget yourself and all your cares and let the Phantom cast his sweet seductive spell over you with his immortally blessed music of the night.",The Phantom of the Opera
156,eichelbergersports,Surprise: Schumacher actually does justice to 'Phantom',8,16 December 2004,"Anytime a popular Broadway musical is brought to the big screen, there is a certain amount of apprehension among fans of the genre (after all, remember 1985's ""A Chorus Line""?). That's pretty much the way I felt when going to review this film, Joel Schumacher's big-budget treatment of the long-running ""Phantom of the Opera."" I'm not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, but I do love the music in this one, but I was bit concerned over how the oft-bloated and bellicose director (""Batman & Robin,"" ""Batman Forever,"" ""Time To Kill"") would handle this classic tale. I needn't have worried. Film is an amazing achievement, especially in cinematography (John Mathieson), set (Celia Bobek) and costume design (Alexandra Byrne), makeup (Jenny Shircore) and musical score (that part wasn't difficult, the exception being one song with an out-of-place techno beat background). The singing, whether done by the leads (Emmy Rossum as Christina, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Gerald Butler as the Phantom) is terrific, and the acting very well done. Overall, it was a most enjoyable two-and-a-half hours and the picture will most likely receive an Academy Award nomination. Beginning in Paris, in 1919, the story shows a dilapidated opera house where items inside are being auctioned off, including a small monkey-decorated music box that sparks interest between the aged Viscount Raoul (Patrick Wilson) and Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison). This box causes the old man to recall how everything began in 1870, when he and the opera house were young, vibrant and colorful. The venue has just been sold to two men, Andre and Piangi (Simon Callow and Victor McGuire) and their temperamental ZItalian soprano diva (Driver)is almost hit with a falling curtain, threatening to walk out before their next production because of it. She does, but Christina fills in, does a wonderful job and is about to become a star. Her ""teacher,"" a disembodied voice within the walls of the opera house, has gained a reputation as a ghost, but Christina, who follows him to his liar after her stage triumph, begins to see he is very real, but very inspirational. His music, which she give flight to, is heavenly, but his horribly-disfigured face keeps him trapped from the world within the bowels of the edifice. Meanwhile, Raoul, a childhood friend of Christina, has come back into her life with matrimony in mind. This does not sit well with her Angel of Music, so he declares war on this arrangement. A few opera house workers are sent to find this menace, but he has lived there far too long to be trapped by his pursuers. Taut and economical direction by Schumacher (it is not easy to make a musical feature these days) was pleasantly surprising, despite the running time; while the storyline was paced perfectly, balancing the plaintively poignant songs with the drama of the plot and the occasional comic relief added by Callow and Driver. Fans of the stage version may notice a few differences, but, overall, they should love the working Schumacher does, pleasing both purists and casual observers.",The Phantom of the Opera
157,neon47,The best musical since ever.,10,16 May 2005,"I saw this in a movie theatre alone. By myself with no only two other people I didn't know or wanted to get acquainted with. But after seeing this I don't really care. This is the greatest musical ever created. Joel S. (I don't want to butcher his last name) does an incredible job bringing the movie to life and Andrew Loydd Webber's music is timeless. The story is great, taking place in a theatre in France. The people who sing are incredible especially Christine who's only very late teens to early twenties. The Phantom's hide out is set up beautifully. It's perfect. Raoul part is played very well and he too is an excellent singer. I honestly have never seen a real theatre performance of Phantom of the Opera. So I went into the the movie theatre not really expecting a whole lot of singing. But to be honest the movie is about 90% singing and about 10% misc (walking, talking, etc). If you're a fan of musicals, theatre, or a good movie see this it will blow you away. Brilliant.",The Phantom of the Opera
158,alfredsmith,Magnificent - exceeds all expectations,10,22 April 2005,"The process of creating a feature film from a stage musical is a difficult one and let's face it, one that is rarely accomplished satisfactorily. In this case, Joel Schumacher's work is simply outstanding. Although the music is what Phantom is all about, the film works on so many levels that I was in total awe from start to finish. The touches of humour, absent from the stage version, work well too. Those who feel that Gerard Butler was not up to the task are simply wrong. He gave the Phantom some badly needed testosterone that was missing in the stage versions. Emmy Rossum was perfect in her role as Christine and the rest of the cast was just great. If I had any criticism it would be some very obvious technical problems with the audio sync. This may just have been a problem with my copy of the DVD.So find a big screen, crank up the volume and be totally entertained for over two hours. This film is the standard by which all future musicals will be judged.",The Phantom of the Opera
159,jpozenel,I didn't really want to make a comment but....,1,15 July 2006,"I didn't want to make a comment but after reading some of those made by people that gave this movie 10, 9, 8, or even 7 stars, I felt obligated.This is one of the most miserable movies I've sat through in my life. I didn't see the play and I think that makes my opinion more valid than those that have. I think many of the glowing reviews are from those who have seen the play and may be having ""flash backs"" to the night that they were in the theater. I know people who have seen and loved the live performance. I don't know what their opinion of the movie is because I've never asked and they have never mentioned it. I assume they either never saw the movie or if they did, they didn't care to talk about it.The only experience that I can compare to watching this movie is when I last had a doctor's appointment. I showed up ten minutes early and ended up in the waiting room for 45 minutes. Once I got into the examination room I ended up waiting another 15 minutes for the doctor to make his appearance. I'm sure most people have had similar experiences. If you haven't, then watch this movie. It's also a complete waste of time.",The Phantom of the Opera
160,mercury4,Very Good Movie,10,15 January 2005,"I thought this movie was great. I really can't see any reason why people should be criticizing The Phantom of the Opera. Unless you detest musicals and unless you hated the play, you have no reason to put this movie down. There are certain stuck up critics like the one in my paper that like to give an outstanding movie like this 1 lousy star. After seeing the movie for myself I thought he was insane. I could tell by what he wrote he had no interest in musicals and he didn't care for the play. That's what happens when they get the wrong person for the job. But anyway, don't listen to the negative reviews because they are just ludicrous.I went to see Phantom of the Opera and I was blown away. I just couldn't believe how good it turned out to be. The whole cast was perfect in their performances for bringing this great achievement of a play to the screen. You would think that the music would not be as good in the movie as it was in the play. But the music in the movie was just as good and sometimes even better. The whole cast was great, but to name the two best actors of the picture would not be very hard. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler are without a doubt the best. Their duets are so powerful. Emmy Rossum has been nominated for a Golden Globe and I think she should win. I like so many others could not believe she was 18 years old. Her voice and looks are stunning. Any man could see that it wasn't very hard for the Phantom to fall for her.Gerard Butler really surprised me. I think it is an outrage that the Golden Globes did not nominate him. But they nominated Kevin Spacey for a movie he had no business making and only did it to show off his singing. I didn't know too much about Gerard Butler except that he was in Dracula 2000. I could see by his acting that he was too good for trashy horror movies like that. I don't blame him for Dracula 2000 being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I heard he would play the Phantom I kept my fingers crossed. I've read many reviews saying how terrible his singing was. But I didn't see terrible singing at all. So what if he didn't sound exactly like the Phantom you heard in the play? I actually liked him better. Roger Ebert thought that Gerard Butler was just another pretty face. I think he needs to see the whole movie again with his ears and eyes open. Gerard Butler's singing and acting was great. I especially liked him when he did the song Music of the Night. All you have to do is listen to him sing that and you will see how good he really is. The Music of the Night sequence is one of my favorites. My others would have to be the scene on the roof; Gerard Butler is so powerful in that scene, and the Point of No Return sequence. What a great scene. People may think that Gerard Butler is too handsome to play the Phantom, but that isn't his fault and it doesn't hurt the movie in any way. His piercing blue eyes only gave more humanity to the Phantom and there's nothing wrong with that. When I read the book I thought the Phantom was just too pathetic. When I saw the silent movie with Lon Chaney I thought the Phantom was too villainous. But the Phantom portrayed in Andrew Lloyd Webber's is just right. I was able to sympathize with him the most.Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. See this movie and you will not be disappointed. The Phantom of the Opera became a great play and now it became a great movie. The plays Grease and West Side Story became great movies and this movie is in that category. Not only was Phantom of the Opera nominated for Best Original Song and Best Actress, but it was also nominated for Best Picture. It won't be any surprise to me when it wins these awards.",The Phantom of the Opera
161,psi_fla,The Phantom finally gets the big-screen treatment,6,21 December 2004,"Co-adapted and directed by: Joel Schumacher Starring: Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, Simon Callow, Ciaran Hinds, Jennifer Ellison Andrew Lloyd Webber's famous musical version of Gaston Leroux's novel finally gets the big-screen treatment, after eighteen years of waiting. And what do we have? Answer: A perfectly adequate and occasionally moving adaptation, but no more. Anyone expecting the bombastic spectacle of Moulin Rouge or the kinetic energy of a Chicago will be disappointed. Anyone expecting a story of substance has wandered into the wrong theatre. This musical lives and dies by its cast and songs. Anything else is secondary.The title character (Gerard Butler) is a deformed man who lives underneath a Parisian opera house in the 19th century. For months now he has been giving singing lessons to young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), and he is influential in driving the star of the shows, Carlotta (Minnie Driver) out of the theatre so that Christine can constantly be given the lead roles. I suppose it's a bit inevitable that he should have a thing for her after all his lessons, so you can imagine his reaction when Christine falls in love with childhood friend Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Serious complications ensue.In the case of a film like Moulin Rouge, you could tell that the director's unique vision was being represented on film, whereas in the case of Chicago, you got the feeling that the film could have been directed by anyone and still have been as entertaining.What is true of the latter film is also true of The Phantom Of The Opera. It seems like a straightforward, by the numbers, stage-to-screen adaptation. While director Joel Schumacher does try and expand the play a little bit, he is more concerned with pleasing the purists than applying his own take on the story, even going as far as giving it a rather 1980's feel (look at Emmy Rossum's hair and listen out for the synth on the title theme). That isn't really a mistake on his part - it just goes to show that as a genuine visual artist, he is highly limited. And I believe that a musical like this calls for a genuine visual artist.He's also over-enthusiastic. (Those who remember Batman and Robin will not be surprised by my last comment.) Schumacher just doesn't know when to quit, dragging on musical numbers to the point of nearly ruining them. (A good example is Christine's unbelievably moving rendition of ""Think Of Me"" - it is just that until the final few bars.) The director doesn't seem to realise that the actors are far more capable of providing emotion than he is. He proves this by failing to provide enough pathos to what should have been a truly touching scene.Yet despite all of the above, The Phantom Of The Opera works. And this is because Schumacher has managed to get many of the details right. The atmosphere, costumes and singing voices of the cast (as far as I know, they are genuine, barring Minnie Driver's) are all up to scratch. If not all of Lloyd Webber's songs linger long in the memory (indeed a few can be grating), there are a number of real standouts here, including ""All I Ask Of You"", ""Think Of Me"" and "" Music Of The Night"". If Minnie Driver's shrill performance is off-putting, at least her screen time is limited. Besides, we still have a very capable group of actors performing this version of the musical. None more so than Emmy Rossum. Perhaps awards talk for the 18-year old is premature, for she still needs to grow as an actress, but she certainly has a fine singing voice. I am convinced that she is really going places if she is not consumed by Hollywood. Gerard Butler and Miranda Richardson also stand out, and Jennifer Ellison is surprisingly good.The Phantom Of The Opera is an enjoyable filmed version of a popular musical, but without any real vision or coherence. It's too reliant on its music and performances, which are able to help the film achieve the level of solid entertainment, but aren't enough to push it towards the more ambitious heights that it obviously aspires to reach.Rating: *** (out of *****)",The Phantom of the Opera
162,H_Spengler,C'mon.....,10,31 October 2005,"I don't understand what everyone is whining about. I grew up listening to the Crawford/Brightman version, have seen the Toronto production on stage twice, and know every word by heart.I was just as skeptical as a lot of people when this movie came out, I didn't see it at my local multi-pl ex, and I could kick myself for that now. I rented the DVD recently, and was blown away by how amazing this movie was! I simply cannot understand why so many people have bashed this movie, a little harsh..right? I won't go into great detail about it, as I think others reviews have described it wonderfully. I would however like to interject a few things.Comparing this movie to the stage and other movies and the book is ridiculous. Chaney, Rains, Lloyd Webber all portrayed this story as they took it, that's what makes us all unique, The twice I saw it in Toronto there were 2 different Phantoms, Peter Carrie portrayed the Phantom more romantically, Colm Wilkinson portrayed him more angry, and they both did a superb job. Why compare Crawford and Butler? They're great in their own ways. I love Sarah Brightman, but Emmy did a fine job. The play was well adapted for the big screen, it flowed smoothly and stayed true.The actors did an outstanding job. I enjoyed Minnie Driver as the high maintenance Carlotta! And of course Gerard Butler; he exuded seductiveness, sexiness, anger and darkness. I believe Roger Ebert said it correctly when he stated that ""Any red blooded woman would choose the Phantom."" I'd have to agree, The film does also offer an advantage the stage does not. Up close emotional reactions. I don't cry at movies very often, but me and my friends were in tears! The sets were gorgeous, well done, and believable. ***I have now gone back to add to my previous comment on here, might I add that ""The Point of No Return"" actually sent chills up my spine, that is by far the sexiest and most seductive scene i've seen, HANDS DOWN, I was being seduced right off the couch, I mean WOW. Deformity or no deformity I would have followed him to the ends of the Earth after that if he asked me.

163,shinedowness,Hollywoodized Garbage That is Inappropriately Sexual,4,8 May 2019,"This is not The Phantom of the Opera, this is Hollywoodized filth that is too sexual to be considered the real story or horrifying for that matter. All of the characters in this film are less intelligent than the characters from the book and the 1986 theatre show. Emmy Rossum fails to showcase true soprano power in her voice because her voice is too light for the Christine Daae role with an American accent that ruins the film's setting. Gerard Butler did not get enough vocal training for his Phantom role, and so his singing is not appropriate for the Phantom role in the first place. Christine and the Phantom have this seemingly inappropriate sexual tension between each other in this film, which goes against the 1986 theatre storyline and the book that inspired The Phantom of the Opera shows to exist. Even though Gerard is handsome, his sexual appeal does not make me feel frightened by him looking like the Phantom whatsoever. So, I feel the horror theme of this musical was lost. This comes across as a soft pornography rather than a proper The Phantom of the Opera show. Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo are the only people who have made a proper The Phantom of the Opera show at the Royal Albert Hall. When I watched the 25th anniversary DVD about The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall, I was very pleased despite it not having the chandelier fall down like this 2004 film. Besides all of that, this film was rushed to be made because some of the actors and actresses being miscast rather than carefully released to the public because of money. Minnie Driver was the only decent actress on this film who had a lot more vocal power and facial expression than Emmy Rossum did from what I saw. The only reason why I liked this film was because of the ""Overture"" song, the YouTube videos that make fun of this film, the ""Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh"" song by Minnie Driver, the chandelier falling down, Minnie Driver, and Patrick Wilson.

That is my mom's take on the tragic but beautiful story! Mine is , I too loved this tale of a tormented soul longing for the one thing he couldn't have ! The heart of the angelic beauty with the golden voice. Because she loves another , but the phantom is determined to claim her as his own! Even if it means killing her one true beloved ! Now that is what I call a true romantic movie. Because it brings all the emotions to the surface, in a poetic way. Through song , for each haunting melody tells about the character. With each lyric they are exposing their inner most feelings. What really captivated me was the phantom himself! All that passion and anger he really owned the story!",The Phantom of the Opera

167,LaurieMann,"Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson Excel, However...",6,25 December 2004,"This is one of the most wildly erratic movies I have ever seen.Rossum and Wilson almost pull it off, but Gerard Butler doesn't quite work as the Phantom. And while the stage play was not particularly logical, the plotting and the behavior of the characters in this film, particularly Christine, made very little sense. The effects, particularly lit candles emerging from the water, were laughable. Minnie Driver provided a little too much comic relief. The Masquerade sequence, one of the most colorful, enchanting parts of the stage play, was played out in black and white with the characters behaving as if they were in Madonna's Vogue video. And the frame story was distracting (though it did provide a very neat ""dissolve"" to the time of the main story).If you just care about the music, it's almost worth going to hear Rossum and Wilson, although the orchestrations overpower their voices at times (yes, it is that loud). Butler didn't quite have the voice, and was almost painful to listen to in several places. While I know Michael Crawford was probably too old to play the Phantom now, whatever happened to the notion of Antonio Banderas playing him??",The Phantom of the Opera
168,Tommy-5,Priceless Classic,9,22 February 2005,"I believe most persons reading this review will be well familiar with the Phantom of the Opera, so I will not spend too much time detailing the story. Rather, I would like to offer comments on this filming, at least the fifth that I know about and have seen.First, a few words about director Joel Schumacher. This is the same man responsible for such works as Car Wash (1976) and Phone Booth (2002). As with Bob Clark and The Christmas Story (1983), I did not realize he had it in him. The previously mentioned films were very good, as is much of his other work, but Phantom is excellent. Mr. Schumacher is a more talented man than I ever suspected or thought about. You have guessed by now that I like this filming. I found it to be very visual: horrifying at times, sensitive at times. This is a neat trick to pull off in any film, but especially one with such intense emotion as Phantom of the Opera. The sets were fantastic and assisted greatly in establishing atmosphere and mood. Of course the players are in large part responsible for this being such a fine film. It interests me that I think of Gerard Butler more as the Angel of Music than I do the dreaded Phantom. As frightful as he was, the Phantom's vulnerability shines through and I wonder, how would we have liked Vincent Price as the Phantom? I suspect that 20 years from now Emmy Rossum as Christine will be more famous for her marvelous voice than she will as a film actress, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul played off her perfectly. Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver were excellent in lesser roles.This has been a classic story for many years but the addition of the Andrew Lloyd Weber music makes it that much more so. Think about it: Phantom has it all. Great music. Mystery, suspense, wholesome love, misguided love, jealousy, hatred, murder, pity and, in this version anyway, redemption of sorts. Gaston Leroux, the author of Le Fantome de l'Opera, knew well the human condition and expressed it very well within the confines of the bright, beautiful opera house and dark, dank underground home of the troubled Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera

Emma is beautiful, her voice is great, and though i cant really understand what's going on (well, i am still a teenager at that time) i am crying for no reason. especially when the phantom cried out, ""go go! before i change my mind"" as he frees Raoul. his believable, and looks handsome with the mask on. i want to watch the musical, but my parents won't pay. but i definitely give it a 10/10. its moving, sounds nice, effects (when the chandelier falls) are great, people (esp. women) look great in their dresses, and it's romantic and mysterious. great way to spend 2 hours.",The Phantom of the Opera
170,segratz,"If you're a fan of the music, this is a must see!",9,4 January 2005,"I'm not sure why this movie is flopping so bad, or where it's negative word of mouth is coming from, because it is an excellent film in many ways. I have seen the musical on stage and was already a fan, so perhaps I'm biased toward the film to begin with. Perhaps a reason for poor ticket sales is because the film is too much like the musical, and doesn't have the originality of a movie like Chicago.Still, if you're a fan of the music, I would say this is a worthy film to view. Rossum does an amazing job as Christine, and she exudes passion, sadness, and heartache that I think few actresses could carry off. Although Schumacher's directing is a bit unoriginal, he sticks to the basics to provide emphasis on many psychological aspects of the film that I hadn't picked up when I saw it on stage (particularly the father-daughter relationship of Christine and the Phantom).Of course, if you hate Opera, and have not had much experience with theatrical productions, this movie is definitely not for you. My fiancé, who is no Broadway fan, enjoyed the film for the Phantom. There is a bit of horror to it that I can see that he liked.Phantom is still viewed best live - having the Chandelier fall in front of you is a wilder experience that seeing it on the big screen, where the audience sees the fantastic in just about every blockbuster. BUT if you don't have a chance to see it live, this is the next best thing.",The Phantom of the Opera
171,elitt,Enjoyable,8,1 June 2005,"A pleasant surprise. When you're not held captive in an auditorium for 3 1/2 hours and you can get up at any time and go to the bathroom, Andrew Lloyd Webber is actually quite enjoyable.Director John Schumacher can make some very effective films when he wants to and he obviously really liked this material. He turned what could have been an incredibly dull film a very enjoyable time. Just about everybody has seen ""Phantom"" or at least know the music, so making this an interesting film couldn't have been easy. He pulls it off. The film is well shot, beautifully directed, it moves along well, and the music is terrific.The actors, Gerald Butler, Patrick Wilson, Emmy Rossum, and Minnie Driver all do a very nice job with their parts and I especially liked Rossum as Christine as she brought a real innocence to the role. maybe she just really looked the part, but she can sing too.If you would like to revisit this show, I think you'll be surprised on how much you'll enjoy it.

And it is no fault of Joel Schumacher considering what he had to work with ... the evil troll has struck again. This is why I gave it a ""1"" as a ""0"" is not available ... this movie was crap, drivel, horrible, boring and awful ... go back to acting Emmy take Gerard and stick to the stage where your voices will be appreciated!

174,gus120970,Shlock-pera,4,18 April 2006,"After an aborted plan to film ALW's most 'cinematic' of musical productions, what persuaded the composer, backers and stars that the time was right for Phantom: The Movie. One suspects the outrageous, and somewhat unexpected success of Moulin Rouge, which shares its Parisien theatrical setting and essentially the same central story - a woman's choice between passion and security. Except this time she chooses the maharajah/Count in preference to the penniless sitar-player/manic genius with anger control and facial disfigurement issues, which is entirely in keeping with its bourgeoise values. But where Moulin Rouge dazzled with its pacing and spectacle, Phantom drags and fatigues with its chocolate box sets and spinning cameras. Joel Schumacher brings his action movie box-of-tricks to provide a visual counterpart to the frequently ridiculous bombast of Lloyd Webber's arrangements but souffles don't keep their shape for two hours and neither does this. A director and actors can only work with the source material they have, the problem is that Phantom has aged badly from when, in the Mid-1980s, it was the height of theatrical chic. Rather like the costumes on a repeat of Dynasty, there is a somewhat delicious sense of guilty pleasure and disbelief at our erstwhile tastes. And there is no hint of deprecating irony in a cast with some fine actors obviously under strict orders to play it straight. Alan Parker's Evita and even Norman Jewison's Jesus Christ Superstar were able to do this with a relatively straight-face and come away with some dignity, but perhaps this was because their source material, musically and literally, was younger and sharper-edged. Although POTO attempts to satirise elements of operatic culture, mostly through the role of diva Carlotta, the dated nature of its own score, demonstrating a number of ALW clichés is ripe for its own lampooning. For a musical to work on film, the medium itself must add some additional dimension that a theatrical setting cannot offer, but POTO adopts a largely proscenium, and prosaic mode to deliver its gaudy sets and songs.",The Phantom of the Opera
175,vesil_vesalier,Forgive and forget about BATMAN. Schumacher gets this one RIGHT.,10,28 October 2018,"Joel Schumacher gets a lot of crap.Most of it stems from him making the two very worst Batman films of all time, BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN, and it's true that because of this, he tanked Batman altogether for several years after its brilliant rebirth, thanks to Tim Burton and the good people at Warner Bros. who created BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES. But is it fair to completely ignore, therefore, every film the man has ever made, and ignore anything he makes from here on out as a result?I don't think so. Everyone makes mistakes.Granted, most of them aren't as bad as BATMAN & ROBIN, but...Yeah, that movie IS pretty freaking awful. And it IS true that Batman vanished from the Silver Screen up until Christopher Nolan breathed life back into it once again moons later, but...Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone.I just finished THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, Schumacher and Weber's 2004 take on the play, and I have to say... I was moved.Yes, MOVED. I said it.The scenery was brilliant, the shots majestic, Emmy Rossum was gorgeous playing Christine, Patrick Wilson successfully made me believe he was a dashing young swordsman (which was surprising, because at first I didn't even realize it was him, which is always an impressive feat, in my book). Miranda Richardson brought tragedy and life to Madame Giry, Minnie Driver brought the comedy as Carlotta (though not as much as I would have liked), and even the stage owners Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow brought some levity to the picture.The only actor that I thought might have been miscast, before I saw the picture, was Gerard Butler. I remember vividly everyone's complaints about his accent during 300 (not that I honestly cared an iota about it), and was surprised to see him as the Phantom here.But he pulled it off. And I'm told that, with the exception of Minnie Driver not singing some of her songs for technicality reasons, all the actors sang their own songs, which impresses me. Everyone pulled their weight, in every way they could.I loved Schumacher and Weber's collaboration, here. I was deeply moved and impressed by nearly every scene. I loved the way that the colors were done, moving from the black and white of the future blended so well with the past. There wasn't anything about this film that truly bugged me.I was moved, and that means something to me, even if it doesn't mean anything to anyone else. Not every picture can pull that off, and I generally rte movies higher when they do, because isn't that the reason to watch movies? To be moved, in some way? Thoroughly entertained, right down to the bearings of your soul?For my money, it is, anyway. I loved PHANTOM and can't wait to watch it again. And I forgive you, Schumacher, for growing up with the Adam West Batman and figuring that somehow people wanted to see that stuff on the big screen once again.They didn't.But hindsight is always twenty-twenty.",The Phantom of the Opera
176,baba44713,"Great, just cut 20% of each song, please",7,15 February 2005,"If you loved Moulin Rouge, you'll adore this one. Well, not quite.Phantom is a lovely musical, but it sure does drag along a bit. The opening scene with the chandelier and booming organ-filled Phantom theme was one of the most energetic and effective scenes I have seen in cinema lately. Too bad the movie doesn't keep it up in the same fashion.For me the biggest problem was not the talk/song ratio which people seem to bring up (since it seems that the movie is one song following the other, without almost any spoken lines), but the length of the songs themselves. Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs are pleasant to listen to, but they are not SO good to justify their duration. Every singing number seems to reach its peak, and just when it should finish so to keep the pace going, the actors sing a few more choruses just for the heck of it. Unfortunately, this bogs the movie down heavily.The other grudge I have is the cast. Catherine is lovely, but she keeps the same face expression almost throughout the entire movie. Raul is a heavy miscast. He can sing some, but he looks more like a grunge dropout than a handsome count. Phantom is possibly the worst of the bunch. He does have some charisma, and his booming raw singing voice is suitable, but he is just a bit too young and too good-looking for this part. What's worse, his supposed ""horrible disfiguration"" looks not much worse than a bad case of acne. By the movie's standards half of my high-school class should be living in the basement of the theater.On the positive side - the cinematography, the sets, lovely contrast between 1917 and 1870 scenes, the ending, they all amount to a great cinematic experience. You can't judge this movie too harshly, especially since it is not meant to be a movie for the masses. As modern movie musicals go, this is a very good entry. Just don't set your bar too high.If nothing, go see it for the booming introduction scene, and the catchy chromatic Phantom theme.7/10",The Phantom of the Opera

Quite surprising that Joel ""8MM"" Schumacher directed this. No, it is not without flaws. Emmy Rossum stares a bit too much with her mouth open, but gets through purity and innocence of Christine. Gerard Butler is too young in the title role, and there has been lot of criticism of him being miscast, ""hunky"" Phantom, not aging, monstrously ugly ""gargoyle"" searching beauty and love before death. This criticism is perfectly valid and on-target: he was physically miscast (Phantom should be thin, not muscular) but I never thought he was attractive, hunky or sexy, so reading from the net that ""Gerry is hawt"" or ""He is not ugly enough!"" made me ""Ooops"" mode. Blame my asexual ""hotness blindness"" for that! I also enjoyed all the singing - but then again, I am not professional.",The Phantom of the Opera
178,medic249a2,Excellent big-screen adaptation of the musical!,9,26 December 2004,"An absolutely fabulous take on Lloyd Webber's stage classic. The storyline is adhered to very closely however some of the events have been moved or slightly altered. The photography is unbelievable in some sequences, especially the one on the roof where the camera pulls up and away from the Phantom standing on the roof's edge. The musical version is further enhanced by the inclusion of B & W shots of the Paris Opera House's exterior at the auction, and at the end when an aged Raoul visits his wife Christine's grave with the music-box. One of the best sequences is when the camera pans around the ruins of the Opera House in 1930, and as it does the Opera House is restored to its former glory of 1870. The acting is very believable and they can sing almost as well as stage stars Sarah Brightman (Christine) and Michael Crawford (the Phantom).

Every moment of the film is beautiful. I love Andrew Lloyd Webber, and as usual, he does not disappoint me. The orchestrations are rich and wonderful. His music is absolutely beautiful. Great!Emmy Rossum gives a star-is-born breakthrough performance as Christine Daae. What a voice! Amazing she is only 18! Raoul, Vicompte de Chagny is played by Patrick Wilson; he is so handsome! I never thought I would like the idea of a 'young, sexy Phantom.' I was very wrong! Gerard Butler is HOT!! The shots of his open shirt sent tingles through me. He can take me down to his lair anytime! And Butler did it--he played the Phantom. He was great! All of the high/low notes he hit; and Butler has so much passion for the role! I see a superstar in front of us. True, he is no Michael Crawford, but no one is. Butler overcame the odds and delivers a wonderful performance.Even though Minnie Driver is dubbed, she is still wonderful to watch. I was pleased that she played Carlotta and shared in the Phantom experience. The same w/Miranda Richardson. Great job as Mme Giry. And Jennifer Ellison could be her daughter in real life! Wow! They look so much alike! She is so cute! Like I said, I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! And you will too. This has knocked 'Evita' out of the top spot for my favorite movie.

180,laughing_cat,Its beauty cancels out its flaws...,10,17 January 2005,"Because I've seen the stage production and love the music, I went to see this film with an extremely critical eye. It wasn't perfect, but it was an excellent effort. Here are some thoughts:GERARD BUTLER as THE PHANTOM turned out to be an excellent choice. His portrayal is both sympathetic and sinister--as the Phantom should be. Although his voice isn't as trained as men who have tackled this role on stage, I have to say that Gerard Butler's method of singing adds more sadness to the character than others I've heard before. I think it was a wise casting choice to choose someone who isn't extremely well-known for the role (I, like many, had heard the rumors for years that Antonio Banderas was going to play the Phantom.) Gerard Butler had the anonymity that the character needs. (Oh yes, and he's hot.)EMMY ROSSUM as CHRISTINE DAAE was a good choice. She seems, to me, the way Gaston Leroux pictured Christine when he wrote the book. Unlike Sarah Brightman, who is a diva trying to look innocent and fragile, Rossum's Christine is innocent and fragile. She's sings very well--although there were a couple of places where you could tell the music had been modified for her--and is lovely on screen. My only complaint is that oftentimes she capitalizes on her loveliness a little too much by not showing a range of facial expressions. As another reviewer wrote, ""She looks as though she's been injected with some heavy tranquilizers."" Unfortunately, I agree...MINNIE DRIVER as CARLOTTA the diva was a brave and, decidedly, great choice. She is hilarious, as she should be. Minnie Driver has a way of portraying ridiculous characters who are supposed to be serious but aren't that is very endearing. No, she doesn't do her own singing and yes, the lip synching is way off for her first number, but it almost adds to the silliness of the character. Kudos to Minnie for holding that 3 foot wig up on her head, too. This was a character where it was nice to see a familiar face and, if you want to hear Minnie do her own singing, stay through the ending credits and hear her rendition of ""Learn to be Lonely."" She does a great job.MIRANDA RICHARDSON as MADAME GIRY and SIMON CALLOW as MR. ANDRE were other roles where it was nice to see familiar faces. Simon Callow is always over the top and hilarious, as this role demands. I do agree with another reviewer about the age makeup on Miranda Richardson at the very beginning and end of the film. Considering that she is older than Raoul and his age makeup makes him look much older than her was careless, but insignificant.PATRICK Wilson as RAOUL is someone I almost forgot to mention because he is so forgettable. The role often gets bashed--even for stage productions--but their casting choice here was very sloppy. No memorable singing or acting came out Patrick Wilson's performance in my opinion. There were many times when his character was speaking lines that would've ordinarily been sung. I don't know if this is because the filmmakers knew they couldn't demand much from his voice or because they wanted to do something new and different for the film. Either way, it happens so often with the Raoul character that one can't help but think they were trying to spare him from singing. Overall, he comes across as a blond piece of cardboard.Some last comments are: 1. Visually, the movie was stupendous. The costumes and production design will surely get some nods and recognition during award season. I was most impressed with the scene when Christine goes to the cemetery. It had a misty, Gothic look that would've made Tim Burton proud. 2. Despite the flaws, Lloyd Webber's music is so wonderfully haunting that it acts as a thread that carries the film from beginning to end.3. I wish that the filmmakers had done more with the Phantom's mask and when to show it or when to show the healthy side of the Phantom's face. I remember in Mel Gibson's MAN WITHOUT A FACE that it seemed like he was very strategic in which side of the face you saw depending on what the character was experiencing. It is more random in PHANTOM and I think that the filmmakers missed an opportunity to stick in some subtle symbolism. 4. A last cheer for GERARD BUTLER. That man really put his heart and soul into the role and it shows. I was even more impressed with his singing efforts after buying the soundtrack. I was also very impressed with the look the filmmakers created for the PHANTOM. The very dark hair is effective and Gerard Butler has these piercing eyes that are accompanied by a lot expression, even on the masked side. I was very impressed by his performance. He had some big shoes to fill and yet still managed to make the role fresh and his own. Great job!A WORD OF ADVICE...see the movie. Everyone is so split in their opinions that the best thing is just to see it and form your own. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Happy movie-watching!",The Phantom of the Opera

182,rube2424,Judge For Yourself,10,25 December 2004,"Once again the critics have their long knives out. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has been ripped to pieces on both sides of the Atlantic and my question is, why? Most of the complaints deal with the fact that Joel Schumacher's direction is over the top, well, you know what...IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! Schumacher has matched the style of his film to the style of the time of the story and it works. What was he supposed to do, make a minimalist film in black and white? His colors are right, his camera angles brilliant and his direction of the actors impeccable. If there is any trouble with the film, and there is, it is that the director is too faithful to the original which, in itself was flawed. Take for instance the graveyard scene. On stage and on screen the scene was not necessary. It added nothing to the story nor did it advance the plot. There is a mediocre song involved in it but it could have easily been cut. Instead, Schumacher follows Llloyd Weber's lead and adds about ten extraneous minutes to an already overlong film. But so saying, with his whirling camera nd excellent editing, the director moves the film along so that the audience is seldom bored.I am old enough to remember when HAIR opened and all the critics said that a new form of musical had been born. What they didn't say is that from that time on they would destroy anything that smacked of the old fashioned, (i.e. Herbert Ross's GOODBYE, MR CHIPS and Robert Wise's STAR on film, and, later LES MISERABLES, MARTIN GUERRE et al. on stage.)PHANTOM ON THE OPERA is not a perfect film by any means, but is a tremendously enjoyable one and one which I urge you to see. Don't take my word for it and certainly don't listen to the critics. Go and then judge for yourself.",The Phantom of the Opera
183,Galagonya,This adaptation made me love the musical.,10,2 May 2007,"I have been very surprised to find that so many people have actually disliked this adaptation, comparing it to better prior performances and on stage adaptations. It has been the other way around with me.Having studied classical music for quite a long time and as a huge musical fan, I met this play several times, I heard it being performed several times, I have had the respective records etc. at home for years but the story and the music never appealed to me. Until I saw this movie last weekend since when the music just won't go out of my head.In my opinion Gerard Butler did a great job and sang excellently. The Phantom, let us get this one straight - although it has been stated otherwise in other comments- is not a singer, you know, he is the guy writing the songs in the play. And as for that, fitting this character, Gerard Butler has a strong, emotional and masculine voice, and it is the Phantom's songs that carry the most feeling and dedication in the musical (as a matter of fact in all adaptations I have encountered). Okay- a doubtless goof is that while in the first 90% of the movie the face of Gerard Butler is barely scarred, the end has him revealing some serious problems but nothing serious enough to make anyone want to go for the character of Raoul, instead, I believe.Although Patrick Wilson is a nice guy, he is one other flaw in the film - he is simply blonde and blue-eyed and has a voice of less effect than that of the Phantom. The same is true for Emily Rossum, who sings like an angel, really, but in my opinion, she can either look cute and wide-eyed or wide-eyed and cute. These are the looks she masters when haunted by a Phantom (okay, I would also prefer the Phantom to Raoul; let's skip this one), but also when shouted at, when scared to death, when sad, when happy, it is really an all-round look. Probably it was just the role, I do not know.The worst mistake in the movie is Minnie Driver. What was she doing in the film? She did not act Carlotta, and she couldn't even sing for herself, I mean really now, just think of Singing in the Rain's Kathy Selden and Lina Lemont, she was a bad choice altogether. It is in fact the Phantom's character - and the play of Gerard Butler- who despite all the above turns this movie into a wonderful adaptation (besides the flawless setting, the beautiful costumes and additional cast and crew). He is a powerful and sad Phantom, haunted himself, sometimes creepy and mean where necessary, and this understanding of the character also shines through in his singing parts.With such a Phantom, let's face it, I do not mind such minor inconveniences as the music of the night stuck in my head.",The Phantom of the Opera

However, many people give this film version negative reviews, and i do have a few complaints. It isn't as stylized as the stage version. While the Phantom and Christine are sining the title song on stage, it is just beautiful to watch the boat glide through the foggy lake. The film version gets boring. As for the Maquerade sequence, it is dull and boring on film, because of the fast pacing of the singing, and how bored everyone sounds. Red Death is cooler on stage, nuff said. The deformity is'not even really a deformity, its more like sunburn. However, there are several good things about this film. First thing is Emmy Rossum. She is in my opinion, the most beautiful Christine, because of her youthful innocence, and the sound of her voice. Gerard Butler did a good job with the Phantom character. He's no Michael Crawford, but he does a better job with the ""anger scenes"" like ""Down Once More"" or Stranger than You Dreampt it"". That leads me to my next point. I love the ""Point of No Return sequence in the film better than the stage or original recording.

If you're a guy, I suggest renting another movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
187,nolanjwerner,So much potential,7,2 February 2005,"I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 overall. It seems to have so much more potential and it could have been ten times better with a few small changes. No spoilers but vague descriptions of things that happen in the film.Now for the breakdown.MUSIC: Gerard Butler's singing was better then it seems from the trailer. Overall though, it can be a bit too dense and blaring, the music can overpower the singing and it can be hard to understand the lyrics during a couple parts (really only when there are like twenty people on screen singing). Don't get me wrong, its a great musical but the music works better on stage. 9/10.VISUALS: Great. The film looks incredible. 10/10.STORY: Yeah, the story itself is nothing special, your basic love triangle between two equally creepy men. Schumacher does add to it a bit with a few flash forward scenes and a new ending but honestly, I don't think that, with the exception of the new ending, they add that much to the overall story. While it works for a stage musical to have less focus on a plot, in the film version it does seem weak. 5/10.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Can someone actually film a movie musical that doesn't look like a stage musical? Moulin Rouge was the closest that a film has come but Phantom of the Opera, while it does do some brilliant tricks with the camera, still sets up almost all of its musical numbers like a stage show and not a film. 6/10.CAST: Emmy Rossum is great. Patrick Wilson is serviceable but nothing exceptional. Gerard Butler actually surprises me but they could have found someone much better. The rest of the cast serves their purpose but, other then Minnie Driver, no one really stands out. The one flaw is that Emmy Rossum is like 17 and her two suitors both appear to be over 30, historically accurate yes but still creepy. I think that someone better then Gerard Butler could have been found easily and Patrick Wilson just seems kind of creepy when he is with Emmy Rossum, its too Lolita-esquire. 7/10 FILM ADAPTATION: Way too theatrical. I think that the film would have been better if Webber had used a slightly more hands off approach. It seemed to be set up like a musical for the stage rather then for the screen. 4/10 OVERALL: 7/10. Excellent film but filled with the potential to be much better.",The Phantom of the Opera
188,bestactor,Better than the Stage Production,10,20 February 2005,"I love musicals and I saw Phantom on Broadway during it's first year. I thought Phantom was good but not really deserving of all the hoopla. I didn't have especially high hopes for the movie, after the disastrous movie of Evita and not finding any reviews that were very positive. However, I was absolutely enthralled by the Phantom film. Webber and Schumacher are to be commended for creating an outstanding transfer from stage to film. There are changes, but they add greatly to the overall effect. This was done with great intelligence and care. The sets/costumes are incredible and could never be reproduced in a live production. The cast is outstanding: Driver is hilarious, Rossum and Wilson are the epitome of a gorgeous ingénue couple, Richardson adds heart with a very underplayed performance. Butler is the weakest link in an extremely strong cast. I think they could have found a better actor/singer. That being said, he did break my heart in the final scene. In fact, the ending they created was absolutely wonderful. By all means see this in the theater on a big screen. The movie critics should be ashamed for failing to acknowledge the merits of this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
189,Harold_Robbins,"A For Effort, But a Less-Than-Ghostly Opera Ghost",8,24 December 2004,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a story that has fascinated me for about 40 years. What began life as a 1911 detective thriller - one of several dozen written by its author, Gaston Leroux - became known through its film incarnations as a 'horror' story (Thanks mainly to Lon Chaney, who created one of the most indelible images in film history, and rescued the novel from oblivion) - it was Andrew Lloyd Webber who saw ""The Phantom of the Opera"" as a romance, and with the addition of his music and a few tweaks to the basic story it became probably the most romantic musical/operetta of the latter part of the 20th century. Now it has finally been filmed with loving care and obvious expense, yet something is lacking: magic, perhaps?The film has fantastical, fantasy-like elements, of course, but basically the Opera Ghost has been robbed of his, well, his ghostliness. It's quite apparent almost from the start that there's a man rather than a ghost behind all the goings-on at the opera. At one point Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) tells Raoul (Patrick Wilson) that the Phantom is, among other things, a magician (this has its roots in the original Gaston Leroux novel) - however, we never see him do a magic trick! A sword-fight is substituted in the cemetery scene for the fireballs flung on-stage by the Phantom, and as for the Punjab Lasso, it's never explained or properly displayed. There's evidence of his hypnotic powers, however, as he and Christine almost glide down a corridor illuminated with torches and golden light - later, when Meg Giry walks down that same corridor, it's cold, wet, and rat-infested. It was all in Christine's mind, perhaps. . .and by making The Phantom much younger than in previous versions, something is lost - when did he have time or opportunity to acquire all the skills and talents Madame Giry claims he has, when she also implies he's never left the opera house since he came there as a child?The cinematography is excellent, with some digital effects that enhance rather than detract. There are several lovely sequences in the film: the snowy roof-top setting for ""All I Ask of You"" (with the Phantom's presence made known much to early), the ""Masquerade"" number (a riot of color and outrageous costuming on stage, this has became a stylized, almost black-and-white extravaganza, with The Phantom providing the only splash of color) which alternates between the high-brow and low-brow (back-stage) celebrations, and the beautifully done cemetery sequence in which Christine visits her father's grave and sings the score's most glorious song, the poignant and wistful ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.""Andrew Lloyd Webber cast the film young, without major stars (the main attraction here, lest we forget, is ""Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera"" - that's what theater-goers have been paying to see on stage for years, since it's long been unnecessary to pay a high-priced star - ALW and the show are the stars now), and two of those less-than-stars also lack major singing ability. Let's just say that Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson can both carry a tune, but their vocal deficiencies are obvious. Emmy Rossum does well as Christine - every actress playing Christine since Sarah Brightman has had a tough act to follow, because ALW wrote Christine for Brightman's extraordinary voice and range. A little diction and elocution training would have helped, because I caught one of them singing the word ""to"" as ""ta"" in one line and then ""to"" in the next!I enjoyed the 'flashback' element of the plot, and though the make-up jobs were good, they were still obviously actors made up to look older. And the Phantom's disfigurement turned out to be less than anticipated - not pretty, but not as hideous as previous versions, not even as elaborately ugly as the stage version. All in all, I really enjoyed this movie - I just had a feeling about it similar to how I feel about MY FAIR LADY - as though the film were made and existed in a vacuum, without a breath of air.",The Phantom of the Opera

Dark forces at play here. Not all the way, but a lot. And that is the one thing I ""resent"". This movie is PG-13?? No way! Do not let your 13 year old watch this!Also, casting .. not great.

193,aatx1154,The Movie of the Night.......,8,18 May 2005,"OK...the Phantom of the Opera movie which was years in the making finally debuted in late 2004. The film directed by Joel Schummacher had high Oscar hopes and also hype. All of this made me curious into watching this film when it came out on DVD in the spring of 2005. Phantom stars several lesser known actors and Minnie Driver. The film itself is not bad, but is not completely excellent either. It is a beautiful looking film with the set and art direction that is completely lavish and a spectacle. The costumes and music also are of first rate. In my opinion, it is the storyline which is a little thin to begin with that seems to drag and stall in the middle of the film. It picks up better in the latter third of the film for a good conclusion. All of the actors do an excellent portrayal and everything is sufficient. The DVD contains 2 discs with extras about the film. I would recommend this rental if you like musicals and extravagant films.Grade: B+",The Phantom of the Opera
194,Melrosemiss,The only version that brings me to tears.,10,22 June 2019,"I have seen every Phantom movie ever made, and had the joy of seeing a live stage production. I also have the DVD of the 25th anniversary performance at the Royal Albert Hall. While the men playing the Phantom on stage may have had better trained voices than Gerard Butler's, not one has brought the pain and poignancy of Gerard's Erik. Whoever did the hiring hit it out of the park in his search for a voice with ""rawness"". Every other Phantom, to me, is singing a performance and not truly bringing the Phantom alive. Gerard becomes the Phantom's anguish and pain and delivers it in his songs. I have read Emmy Rossum's performance characterized as ""wooden"". I do not agree. I believe she was 16 years old when she performed this role and I think she brought all the tentativeness of someone of that age, no matter the vocal gift. I am very sorry that Minnie Driver's performance of ""Learn to be Lonely"" did not make the movie release. Thankfully, it is available on the DVD and on YouTube. One of Gerard's most heart-wrenching songs was cut but is available on YouTube. I will agree that his voice is not perfect, but for me, it is perfect for the role. I loved the live performance in Philadelphia in the 80s as did my young son whose major exclamation throughout was ""Wow!, How did they do that, Mom?"". If you are a GB fan, as I am, I think you will applaud this performance. I had never heard of him before I saw this movie in 2005, but I have watched pretty much everything he has done prior (just one) and since. I believe his first movie was ""Dracula 2000"" and was the best Dracula I have ever seen. That movie was not great but his performance, and the premise of just who Dracula truly was, were superb. Also loved him in Attila and can hardly wait for ""Angel has Fallen"" which comes out on 8/23/19. If you are a Phantom fan, try to find the DVD of the sequel - ""Love Never Dies"".",The Phantom of the Opera
195,artemis_5,The Music of the Night Lives Forever in Musical Masterpiece,10,10 May 2005,"Like many other people who wrote reviews for this film, I have not seen the stage version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" so I have only the Lon Chaney version (see my review of that film) and an Andrew Lloyd Webber compilation CD with four ""The Phantom of the Opera"" songs (all of which I have loved as long as I can remember) for a comparison. I must say that I absolutely loved this version, so much in fact that I spent the extra money to get the Special Edition and the movie soundtrack.As for the soundtrack- Even though I have only heard the songs sung by Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman before the movie came out, I would not dream of listening to any other version but the movie's. Unlike some people, I absolutely loved Gerard Butler's voice, which I find sexy and soulful. Granted Butler's singing may not appeal to some the most distinguishing of music critics (I am just a regular girl-not a music expert), unlike the angelic singing of Emmy Rossum, but it is not unappealing. It has an organic quality which I find refreshing. Patrick Wilson, who has done stage musicals, brings the same vocal strength to his role of Raoul as Rossum does to Christine.There has been a certain amount of controversy about the age of the actors who play Christine and the Phantom, but I think they are perfectly cast. Emmy Rossum was about the same age as her character Christine, and Butler is more believable as a seductive ""angel of music"" than a much older man would be. I think that the Phantom's good looks (pre-unmasking) are a strength rather than a weakness because they create sexual tension. Think of how much less interesting the story would have been if the Phantom had shown up and Christine had flat out rejected him. Then he would just be this creepy old man who cannot take no for any answer. No---the story of the Phantom is compelling precisely because Christine feels a powerful attraction to him that competes with her feelings for Raoul. At the heart of the tale is the war which rages inside Christine between her reason (which sees Raoul as the better match) and her dark desire for the deadly Phantom. I will not tell you how it ends, although I knew the ending before seeing the movie just from word of mouth and knowing about the stage musical, and chances are most people who have not seen the movie do too.Final word-outstanding music and lyrics. Perfect casting decisions and wonderful acting all around. Very compelling story told with fantastic visuals.",The Phantom of the Opera
196,ignatiusloyala,Just OK,7,5 January 2005,"I went to the cinema with much expectation, but the film is just OK. I haven't read the original, but this story is rather different from the one I know (the story I know was like, three people died: Carlotta killed by the chandelier, another man strangled to death and a third guy drowned in the drain). Anyway, it's not the most important point. Being a musical, singing is the essence of the movie, but god! Gerald Butler sings like a 6-year-old~! Emmy and Patrick are decent but not as good as they should be. One more point to make: the ending is too long and no doubt I don't like the ending long or short coz Christine is such a bitch~!

All of the actors and actresses are amazing in playing their parts, especially when they had to hit those high notes, I could never do that! They also got really into their character, as much as they could, and it definitely showed! It really gives the visuals of what it would be like in the 1800's and doing an opera show, with a phantom lurking around, doubt that that really happened though. It also has a little romantic touch to the mystery part of what the phantom will do next. I definitely suggest this movie, to basically any crowd.",The Phantom of the Opera

Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is well orchestrated. The cast gives wonderful performances. Gerard Butler makes an AWESOME Phantom, and his singing is fine also. Emmy Rossum-WOW. She gives a splendid performance as Christine,and her singing voice is really beautiful. Patrick Wilson gives a talented performance as Raoul, and he also has a great voice. Minnie Driver is HILARIOUS as Carlotta, the spoiled prima donna. Miranda Richardson is a perfect Madame Giry. Director Joel Schumacher (BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN) gives a wonderfully spooky quality to the film. The sets and costumes are fantastic. Lloyd Webber's songs, such as MUSIC OF THE NIGHT, and MASQUARADE are well sung. Overall, an excellent movie. Recommended. 10/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
199,elfflame,I really did want to like it...,6,23 June 2007,"First, let me say that I loved the stage version. And I went to the movie with every expectation of enjoying it, knowing that there would be differences. I was even sure I could avoid the inevitable ""they were no"" syndrome (ie, comparing them to Crawford or Brightman). And I'm glad I went. But the movie I saw wasn't the one I was hoping for.The actors were generally well-chosen, and didn't feel as though they were out of place, though I could have wished for a Christine with a stronger voice, and Raul was a bit too milquetoast. I didn't have the trouble with the Phantom that most people seem to be having. He was older than Christine, and that's all I really needed on that line.I did have two problems with him, though. One wasn't the actor's fault: the makeup they made for him made no sense. Throughout the movie we see his right eye looks exactly the same as his left. Until the mask is removed, and then suddenly, the skin underneath the eye is pulled away from it, and the eyelid seemed saggy. Wouldn't we have seen this through his mask? The other was that, as nice as the actor was to look at, I do not see the Phantom as buff. Not in any way, shape or form. It just doesn't work.I was also mildly annoyed by the fact that they took part of the Phantom's story and toned it down. The Phantom was the one who designed the Opera house. Madame Guiry says that he was an architect, and he's constantly referring to the place as his. So why did they feel the need to take this from him? I realize that the little story they made up for him was nice and dramatic, and put Madam Guiry more firmly in his camp, but it bugged me anyway.I found the faces I recognized in the movie quite interesting. Miranda Richardson was a lovely Madam Guiry, and Minnie Driver was perfect as Carlotta. A particular favorite scene of mine was the ""Prima Donna"" scene, where she's about to leave the opera house, and they see the crowd waiting, and all assume it's for her, and she opens the door, and a man hands her a rose, saying ""Could you give this to miss Daae?"" and she shuts the door and says, ""I'll stay."" Perfect. She plays to the hilt, which is exactly what the role needs. Oh, and the stage-hand mooning her as she prepares to leave was priceless, too.Scenes: I liked the interspersed bits with Raul in 1919, particularly seeing the woman who I assume was Meg Guiry. And I remember thinking, ""How can they possibly make the chandelier going up exciting in a movie?"" But what they did was perfect, turning the chandelier into a time-machine, and sending us back to the opera at its height. The managers being introduced to everyone, and drooling over both Meg and Christine was amusing, and Christine's first solo was lovely, if a bit weak.They had me, right up to the point where the Phantom appeared in the mirror, and then suddenly I was watching a very bad rock video version of the Phantom of the Opera. Particularly the multiple images of Christine as she approaches the mirror, the arm-candelabra-filled hallway, and the horse. I couldn't help but laugh. And for that scene, that simply wasn't okay.The chandelier's crash being moved didn't bug me too much, surprisingly, as I always kind of thought it was an odd place to put it, though I suppose it makes sense to have it end the first section of the play. Gives it a dramatic finish that simply isn't needed in the movie. The duet between Christine and Raul on the roof was a touch nauseating, mostly because it went on too long.The masquerade, which has always been my favorite part of the soundtrack, and which I expected great things from, fizzled. The costumes were lovely, but why weren't Raul and Christine wearing masks? And as for the Phantom, if anything, his costume should have been bigger and flashier than the one in the stage production, if for no other reason than that this is a movie, and they can blind us more. But no, you barely even noticed his entrance, which could have gone unnoticed if the screen hadn't shifted to show him. The change in the lyrics here worked surprisingly well, given that it was the combination of two scenes, but couldn't help but find myself wondering if he was even going to bother to notice the ring Raul had given Christine.I was pleasantly surprised by Past the Point of No Return, however. After the muck they made of the title song, I was expecting more of the same, but this time, it worked, and the scene was perfect.All in all? I'd say if you're a big fan, do see it, but if you have seen the stage production, understand that it's definitely not as good.",The Phantom of the Opera
200,icfarm,"""Better than Chocloate"" Musical",10,21 May 2007,"This film, featuring the masterful music of Andrew Lloyd Weber, masterful sets and costumes, and masterful performances, should go down over time as one of the best film musicals ever produced.First, the cast: Emmy Rossum is a prodigy (singing opera since age seven, according to director Joel Schumacher, kudos to him as well, by the way), with an exquisite God-given voice, and the same can be said of Patrick Wilson, who played Raul. Now, on to Gerard Butler. To me, he WAS the phantom. Those who criticize his vocals don't get it - it's called ""acting""! Of course there were times when he sounded weak, or raspy, if that suited what his character was going through. He is a gifted actor AND singer. How much courage did it take for someone who had never been in or auditioned for a musical before to sing ""Music Of The Night"" for the composer who wrote it?! And besides, to slightly misquote a line from one of his other films (""Dracula 2000""), ""he IS better than chocolate"". His look, his stage presence, his voice - OH MY! He - along with his on-screen chemistry with Rossum, with whom he is supposed to be helplessly, obsessively in love - is what gives this musical its ""better than chocolate"" factor. Who needs an explicit sex scene with two actors who can generate sparks like that with all their clothes on!!! ""10"" out of ""10""!",The Phantom of the Opera
201,teleadm-persson,The old Phantoms,8,17 March 2006,"Since I like musicals I have no trouble when people suddenly begins to sing and dance. Musicals is it's own genré, so that part is OK with me. Up until the Music of the Night number has been sung it's a 10 pointer. I liked the behind the scenes sort of organized chaos scenes. After the ""Music of the night"" number, the movie slipped, I cannot pinpoint exactly what, but something focused out, it went down to 6 IMDb stars. There is a swordfight that looked very theatrical, but apparently was'nt in the theatre versions (Errol Flynn vs Basil Rathbone! Where are you????) GCI or CGI or whatever it's called, a scene on the roof, the snowflakes is made via computer, and it it's snowing and the air is cold, why don't they breath out smoke when they talk!!!! In old old films I think it's part of the charm of seeing old films, but in a new film, with all the smart boring guys on all Double-DVD versions showing how good they are in fron't of a PC...... By the way on the double DVD, Lloyd webber was sooo happy to finally record in fron't of a huge 110personel orchestra, after listening to the record of the ""Original London Cast"" album it doesn't sound like it was a B-orchestra that time. I've never seen the scene version! But in the first act I think the ""Bella Donna"" number was a supior highlight to see, on the record it sounds stiff and flat, somehow reminiscent of old Vienna Operettas, or Light Operas on the film. In the end! would I suggest you to be happy with a DVD or CD version of this film......hmmmmmmmmm no the first 1 hour and 20 minutes of this film is so good, I would suggest the DVD. My neighbours wouldn't like it, but you who live in your own houses and can afford cinema sounds, there is some organ music, maybe some old theatrical Organ or maybe some old Wurlitzer, I think that would sound very ""WOW""!",The Phantom of the Opera
202,endymion82,I Really Liked This Movie...,10,15 December 2004,"So, I usually don't qualify my reviews, but this movie is sort of special, and the comments I've read are from all over the map so I feel I should give some idea of where I'm coming from too. I've been an playwrite, actor, and director for years, with work of mine have been doing both domestically and internationally, and having appeared in plays both amateur and professional and every level in between, including a professional opera and many a musical: whenever I watch anything, I approach it on three levels: artist, critic and audience. Also, I grew up seeing shows on Broadway, both mega-musicals and little indy plays in the Village, and while generally speaking my tastes lean more towards ""arty and indy"", I do have a broader pallet and it would be more accurate to say that my real interest is piqued by anything that is genuinely good at being what it is- which is one way of describing ""Phantom of the Opera."" Because yes, it's not as complec and intelligent as the work of Sondheim, or Kander and Ebb, but for what it sets out to be, an enthralling and absorbing Gothic romance (a genre that is rarely done well on stage, let alone as a musical), it achieves on every level: the score (which is soaring and crashing and large, just like the emotions of the characters who sing it), the design (ornate and overwhelming and grand guigol to the hilt), the story (which is totally ridiculous on some level, but since gothicism and romance are both genres which celebrate the extremes of our minds and imaginations, this is totally appropriate). ""Phantom"" is a brilliant example of art where the content and the style of the rendering of that content fit each other to a tea, and while it may not be YOUR cup of tea I sort of feel that anyone who thinks it's crap has basically missed the point or is just sour grapes because the thing is so damn popular and so damn good at being what it is (and lets face it, it's hard not to resent a success sometimes). Genius is often ridiculed, especially genius of an unusual nature or in a somewhat unconventional field (and Gothic romance, be it novel, film or musical, is looked down on in general, usually for the very qualities that make it interesting) and Webber's work is genius, because ""Phantom"" is, for all its faults, tightly written, a brilliant balance of camp, melodrama, satire and fairy tale, and while the style of music might not work for each listener, it effectively illuminates the story and conveys what is most important about the characters: their titantic (albeit, somewhat simple-minded) emotions, desires, fears and obsessions.*SPOILERS*The movie, in my opinion, takes what is best about the play and does it even better. Though some of my favorite bits from the stage show (the rehearsal of Don Jaun where the piano plays itself, Raoul's part in ""Wondering Child"") are gone, they have been dropped in favor of brilliant improvements, namely having the chandelier crash at the conclusion of the film (it really brings the whole thing full circle), and allowing more glimpses of Paris 1917, finally explaining why it is Raoul returns, what happens to the Phantom, etc. Other good bits that we see now but never saw onstage: an affectionate moment between Meg and Madame Giry, some history of the Phantom, a deeper sense of what Meg may know or not know about the Phantom's presence, the stalking of Josephe Bouquet, the life of the underclass of the opera house, the Hall of Mirrors from the book, etc. Also, the music has been beautifully re-orchestrated, and never sounded better. I'll take orchestra over canned synths, any day, thank you.The cinematography is beautiful and the ""opera"" moments are well done- complete with the cornball, almost intrusive dancing and vibrant but totally unrealistic sets and costumes that characterized ""grand opera"" at the time. The sense of constant claustrophobia back stage is great, and adds to that sense of what it was like to live and work in this tiny world where everyone is a performer and half your wardrobe comes from the costume department (did anyone else catch that moment where Christine takes her dress from the wardrobe?), adding to the central question at ""Phantom's"" core- what (who) is real, and what (who) is an illusion- and is real preferable to illusion, or vice-vera? The bleedingly bright colors and deep shadows of the movie help echo all of this- reminding us always, this story is not real, hero on white charger and all, but we don't want it to be: it's a legend, it's a fairy tale, it's a farce... it's a masquerade. It's, as the Auctioneer says, ""a strange affair."" ""Phantom"" told and acted realistically, totally wouldn't work, so don't ask it to, or judge it that way.The best thing about this movie is the performances, and the director has done a wonderful thing by moving AWAY from Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, both of whom gave role defining performances, neither of which are any more ""correct"" than any other. The question isn't, are Butler and Rossum as good as their predecessors, but rather do their versions of the characters work, and the answer is: yes. Return to ""Phantom"" as a text, not as a show with a history, and you'll see that Christine is supposed to be dreamy, lost, emotionally unstable and young, just as Rossum plays and sings the role. Butler, with his harsher singing and deeper range, is much more believable as a madman who is sometimes pathetic and pitable, but still ultimately a deranged egomaniac who lives underground and makes wax statues of the woman he loves. The rest of the cast is equally good, with Minnie Driver giving a heroically hysterical performance, Jennifer Ellison combining strength and curiosity with innocence and a certain grounded quality (I've always believed the audience is ultimately supposed to identify with Meg, who is the only character who never panics and maintains a healthy sense of ""reality) that contrasts nicely with Rossum's morbid dreaminess, and Patrick Wilson doing much more with Raoul than any of the actors I've seen on stage. I wish Simon Callow had had more to do, but such is life- at least he was there. Miranda Richardson continues to prove she can play anything, and conveying more with a look than most actresses can with a full script of dialogue. Her accent is totally brilliant: it sets her apart, makes her glamorous and mysterious, and at the same time, is another sly tongue in cheek reminder that what we are watching should only be believed to a point: it is, after all, just another version of beauty and the beast.",The Phantom of the Opera
203,shawny11_2001,Awestruck,10,8 January 2005,"There are no words I can muster to describe this brilliant piece of musical cinema. Since I was very young, about 8 or so, I've listened to the music and been enchanted by it. I never did get to see the stage version, and now that I've seen the film, I would drive down a sidewalk full of pedestrians to get a ticket. Well, maybe not that drastic, but darn close.The music is the defining piece of the entire film. From the explosive entrance of the Overture till the silence at the end, the music is enthralling. It drives the story, more so than any other piece of music I've ever heard in cinema. Gerard Butler's voice is by far the most outstanding to me. His rock&roll twang in the baritone voice is much more convincing of the Phantom's anguish than the stage version's (I've no idea who it is, but the tenor voice does not fit for anguish). Emmy Rosum's voice is amazing as well. One thing that is a surprise though is Patrick Wilson. I'd never thought he'd be able to sing so well. Everything blends so perfectly in this. I cannot say much else, because the words are not here to describe it.Joel Schumacher, you finally show some genius in film-making.",The Phantom of the Opera
204,kastri_gr,excellent film by Joel Schumacher,9,28 October 2012,I have not seen this film since last night.i have to admit it is wonderful.Although Musicals are somehow like a memory upon the fact that no director or producer is interested in making such films any more.I have had only the soundtrack which was great and the intro Song The Phantom of the opera is there i mean who does not like it?The actors were great.I did not know Gerald Butler was playing the Phantom of the opera the rest of the actors were also good.My only hesitation for not watching this film yet was Joel Schumacher.I have seen many films of him including the two Batman films and i was very disappointed.But this one is great the whole atmosphere of the film creates to the viewer something mysterious and creepy.I have not seen the previous version of the Phantom of the opera.Once again a great movie with a great story.,The Phantom of the Opera
205,Vinny37,Redeeming love,9,27 February 2010,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's powerful production, Phantom of the Opera, has three main characters, Christine, the nameless Phantom, and dashing Raoul. The Phantom was a musical genius with a deformed face, and hid as a battered child in an Opera House – please don't knee-jerk into supporting the NSPCC! Semi-secretively he picked a young opera girl, Christine, to be his prodigy. She simply couldn't define what he was yet appreciated his tuition. The story comes to a head when Raoul who admired her years earlier met again and they fell in love, a fly in the Phantom's maturing plan to marry her.Anger management was not the Phantom's strong suit. But then, he had been twisted by society's rejection of his facial distortion. His own needs for love seemingly unobtainable, he became misanthropic, regarding the lives of innocent bystanders as meaningless and becoming a murderer. Love is a big theme. Another is redemption. It also invites the question of punishment. Ought the Phantom be executed for his murders, or redeemed by Christine voluntarily marrying him? Punishment is important to humanity's need to see that moral choices matter, and there is a fitness is suffering for doing wrong. But in this life this itself is a potential trigger to redemption. The wronged might also have some need to see ""justice done"", though Gordon Wilson (Enniskillen) reminds us of divine forgiveness bypassing this. Incarceration has its place in protecting others, helps deter others, & can offer rehabilitation - but if the offender is redeemed, what then? Counselling would certainly have been offered the Phantom nowadays. As a good production Phantom encourages us to probe deep themes.But Christine wavered between him & Raoul. She came to see that the ""true distortion"" was not the face but the soul (cf. the ""Track Down This Murderer""/""Down Once More"" dialogue). Remarkably she decided to choose the Phantom over Raoul. This highlights part of C S Lewis' analysis of love – we are able to love, to witness love, and to need love. We the audience witness the love theme; he the Phantom had less chance to meet his need for love than Raoul, and Christine elected to give hers to him, putting his need before her own needs for a healthy love – the Phantom offered unhealthy love from a distorted soul. Remarkably, at her point of no return the Phantom's healing began, and he released her from him and unto Raoul, whom she sailed away with. The Phantom escaped those who sought his punishment. Raoul & Christine were lovingly married almost 50 years, and when Raoul visited her grave, he spotted the Phantom's signature rose discreetly passive to one side. This suggests that the Phantom had achieved appreciable redemption, having kept track of his youthful love without any attempt to reassert himself over her life, even her death.The Four Loves (C S Lewis) made the point that human loves (man/woman, friendship, audience) are all derived from God who is the eternal society of love, and that unhooked from him they become distorted, despotic, demonic, but that if human loves are surrendered, submitted, to Love, they can have a touch of the divine. The Phantom is a marvellous production that touches on such deep themes, and is well worth seeing & pondering. Its spirituality is implicit than explicit, and none the worse for that. For a clear finger pointing to God read Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (perhaps skipping its over-extended 'history' of Napoleon!). Best: go for both.",The Phantom of the Opera
206,raven_blood88,I loved this movie.,10,24 June 2006,"How do I begin? I loved this movie more than words could possibly tell. Musicals have always been a big hit in my family. But this one took the cake. With a wonderful cast, and beautiful costumes, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" comes to life.The movie stunned me in many good ways. For starters, I liked that most of the cast were virtual unknowns in the film industry. But what especially stunned me, was how talented these people were. All throughout the film, I watched and listened to lovely sequences, loving every minute of them.I especially loved how Gerard Butler portrayed the Phantom. He was excellent at conveying the Phantom's pain, even while singing (which many Broadway versions failed to do). And Emmy Rossum's voice excelled far beyond any of the Broadway versions I've heard. And Patrick Wilson gave the character, ""Raoul"" a swashbuckling and romantic air, which I failed to see in most other versions. (Raoul's not bad and all, but he just didn't care as much as this one.) Of course, my favorite character, was Carlotta (hilariously portrayed by Minnie Driver). Her comic relief wasn't too much or overly done. It was just the right balance, making the vital plot essence not go awry.+ SPOILER ALERT + The ending is a tear jerker. I had to swallow back around the ending scene with Christine kissing the Phantom. The drama and romance wasn't too sappy or sicky, it was just enough to give you a little sniffle or two.But tears are never a bad thing, so have no shame if you bawl like a baby. This movie is excellent and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see it. 10 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
207,mckaymalcolm,Better than the reviews read,9,18 April 2021,"I think this film deserves more credit. The music production and sumptuous set design are wonderful.Yes, if you are a purist you are entitled to question the judgement of casting, in particular, Gerard Butler in a singing role.He definitely can't reach the level of a professional that you would hear on stage - however he's not unconvincing either.If you think of it a bit like casting Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge you'll be fine.A great nights entertainment for me anyway and I'm glad I watched it.",The Phantom of the Opera
208,shawshank86,could have been better,6,11 October 2006,"of course, no video can create the veracity of a live performance, neither can any person chosen by a Hollywood bigot be as talented as the people who sacrifice money for their livelihood, yet i still get an icky taste in my mouth every time i hear the phantom utter a sound. gerard butler has evidently never been critiqued. the other characters are doing an okay job, emmy rossem being the only person throughout the experience that shines. her performance is even brought down occasionally by mr. butler's horrendous accents and inability to execute his pitch in a way that is appealing to the ear.there are several good points worth referencing. weber's addition of electric guitar on the theme song is attractive and not overbearing, sort of a steinmanesque if i may. emmy's ability alone is stunning, and her character's voice crescendo's in quality from start to finish; the climax being ""wishing you were somehow here again"". the symphony accompaniment is also satisfying.it is just hard to accept that a film that was postponed for fifteen years was released with such an underachieving co-star. there are so many talented male singers in the world, i don't understand why this one was selected, especially since the film took four years to complete.",The Phantom of the Opera
209,mcmugged,Gerard Butler is amazing in this,10,13 July 2019,"I have seen a couple of the older remakes of this movie on TV and when I recently came across this 2004 remake based on Andrew Loyd Webber's music, I decided to check it out.The music is fantastic, of course. The singing and acting is all excellent also.I was not aware that Gerard Butler ever played the Phantom role and was surprised because I thought he was more of an action or comedy actor. In this, he is absolutely charismatic!
Emmy Rossum is also perfect in her role of Christine, who is tutored by the Phantom. She is absolutely angelic and you can see why he falls in love with her.There is a love triangle. A young, dashing Comté falls for Christine. At first, it seems she is maybe more in love with the Phantom. With his half-face mask on, he is actually very handsome, and a musical genius. Christine pulls the mask off his face but she doesn't seem all that repelled by it.We learn how the Phantom came to be connected with the opera house and how he grew up in the Paris underground sewers after escaping from a band of gypsies who abused and exploited him because of his disfigured face.Apparently, because of the abuse he went through, his anger could turn to murder. That is when Christine decides she wants to be with the Comté which of course angers the Phantom.In the end, I think Christine still had feelings for the Phantom since she kissed him deeply before leaving with her boyfriend, the Comté. It was heartbreaking to see how broken the Phantom was as she left him. I am sure she made the right decision though. Murderous rages can be bad for a relationship.The one thing I don't get is why Christine pulled the mask off of his face a second time when he was singing with her on stage in front a huge audience. This caused him to destroy the whole opera house. But then it also led to being able to get away from him and live a life.Since watching this movie, I can't get it out of my head and the music is also stuck in my head. Since this is an opera and it is mostly all singing, I can see why some people would watch it over and over.",The Phantom of the Opera
210,don_agu,"Come back Zeffirelli, all is forgiven.",1,30 December 2004,"God almighty, what on earth is this? An undigested mega pastry with all the wrong ingredients. Plodding, vulgar, uncinematic (I don't know if the word exists but if doesn't I've invented to sum up the ineptitude and ugliness of this production) Who's idea was the casting of the Phantom? Why? For heaven's sake, why? The poor girl Emmy Rossum, lovely voice, but somebody forgot to shout Action. She seems to float throughout the film as if under the influence of some very powerful tranquillizers. Not to mention the Count that ages at a much faster speed than Miranda Richardson, thank God. If this was the intention of the producers I would have gone all the way and call John Waters to direct it. Can you imagine the fun. As it stands it is a rather sub Zeffirelli pastiche with absolutely no redeeming qualities.",The Phantom of the Opera
211,vivalarsx,Egads!,2,23 December 2004,"I won't say this is the worst movie I've seen all year, but only because my memory might be faulty and I've forgotten something worse. This is pretty bad, indeed. I'm not a big fan of the show onstage, yet somehow have managed to see it twice (!); I'd sit through it a few more times if it meant I never have to see a Joel Schumacher ""film"" again. This man is a hack, through and through; his camera is all over the place, and rarely where we want it to be. The cemetery sword fight is so awash in quick cuts and flashy angles (and with that damned ever-present fog that Schumacher seems to think is ""artistic"") that you can't quite figure out who is doing what to whom. The worst part of the movie BY FAR is the masked ball, wherein a group of 19th century Parisians begin vogueing--I am not making this up. I nearly fell out of my chair in shock and giggles. The only reason I rated this a ""2"" and not the ""1"" it so richly deserves is because Emmy Rossum has a nice voice (unlike the Phantom himself, who can barely carry a tune--nice casting for a musical, eh?), and because Minnie Driver is such a hoot. Every time she appears I sat up a little straighter, eager to have some more fun. The rest of the movie is just awful. When it was over, several people in the theater applauded, and several more people laughed at those who were applauding. I hope the applause was ironic; heaven help us all if someone thinks this drivel is the real thing.",The Phantom of the Opera
212,jn1356-1,I Cried My Eyes Out!,9,23 November 2013,"Great beauty can bring tears to my eyes. Early on, my eyes were tearing just from the beauty of the music. Then the beauty of the love story took me. My 17-year-old daughter and I just held each other and cried, while my poor wife looked around for some way to deny knowing us.Gaston Leroux's book is a horrible mishmash, poorly plotted and poorly written. But he created a compelling character which will not die, but keeps coming back in new incarnations. The play is a true miracle, at least it has been when I've been privileged to see it onstage.This movie has a couple of problems. The Phantom just swishes his cape too much! It's a small thing, but it annoys me. That and a couple of continuity errors niggle at me.But Schumacher's Phantom is visually brilliant, especially his gorgeous transition from the present to the past (ITTY BITTY TEENY TINY SPOILER: The present is always black and white. The past is always in color). He makes it possible to get over losing the magic of a live performance with the magical things cameras can do that theater cannot.His casting is, in my opinion, well-nigh irreproachable. Gerard Butler's Phantom isn't a vocal tour-de-force, and I feel as if the director forced him to be a bit swishier than he would have liked (than I would have liked). But it carries it off, her carries it off nicely.Emmy Rossum's Christine is flighty, a flibbertigibbit, as is the character in the novel. Vocally, she is just nice, mouth-wateringly nice.Patrick Wilson as Raoul is naive, young, impetuous, vocally gorgeous, in short, perfect.I can go on, but I won't, other than to say the changes from the play to the movie I approve and love.Perfect? No. But fine, quite fine. If you love music, and Lloyd Webber's music covereth a multitude of sins, then you should enjoy this well. I did. I bought the DVD, and it is one of the most viewed and re-viewed in my collection.",The Phantom of the Opera
213,Awakening124,Stole my heart right out of my freaking chest.,9,16 January 2005,"I went into the theater knowing only this: It was an opera, it had a Phantom, a chandelier falls. That's about it. I'd heard parts of some of the songs from a friend of mine who had the soundtrack. The moment it went from black and white to color and organs, I literally got about three or four waves of chills through me. From then on it was total beauty. -Begin rant- Someone claiming to be a professional opera singer said that all the voices sucked except Minnie Driver's character. Ahem: HER VOICE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANNOYING. Did you not notice the cleaning ladies stuffing cotton in their ears when she sang? Geez, people are stupid. -End rant- I was totally swept up into every aspect. But when the Phantom leads her down the corridor to his lair, I just about died. I wasn't expecting him to be so downright beautiful and enticing. But his clothes and his emotion and his voice...and the CAPE. Totally blown away. Now, this was NOT a perfect film. Some of the singing didn't synch up to the actors, and in my opinion, everyone (except Phantom) could have acted just a tad more passionate when they were singing, even though some of it was supposed to be a substitute for speaking. Gerard Butler really stole the show as the Phantom. By the end you feel so bad for him it makes you cry. Bravo, everyone involved with film. With just a tad bit of tweaking, it could have been perfect, and it pains me to give this film a 9.5 out of 10 'cause it swept me away so intensely. Favorite songs were Phantom of the Opera and Point of No Return (my heart was pounding so hard during the latter I thought I'd stand up and attack the screen.)",The Phantom of the Opera
214,Calios,"Great musical, you won't forget what you see",9,4 January 2005,"The movie makes me want to see the stage performance, though I can't believe it can be better, as this movie is great. The singing is wonderfully integrated into the flow of the acting. The lighting and texture of the scenes are beautiful and insightful. This is a movie that everyone who enjoy musicals would love.I can't wait till the DVD comes out, because I want to get that to see all the extra stuff. The big screen does make some of the scenes awe inspiring and bigger than life, like the scenes of the Phantom standing apart or in front of other characters, or even the scenes, are rather dramatic. The young lady playing Christine was convincing to me and I felt her being drawn to the Phantom and then her trying to break free from his influence. The guy playing the Phantom was very real and yet possessed a voice that was not too overpowering. He was not very scary, but I did recognize that he was somewhat off his rocker, even though he was a genius. The supporting cast is marvelous and you actually feel like you know some of them.",The Phantom of the Opera
215,pauld2b,Well ... I gave it an 7 but . . .,7,1 January 2013,"First things first. I have seen this on Broadway 7 times including 2 performances with Michael Crawford when it first opened. The show, when it opened was really innovative in many ways with some really different effects.As far as I am concerned it has some of the best songs ever done in any Broadway Musical. I would rank it in my top three for music with West Side Story the clear number 1. The movie provides you with aspects that they could not do on a stage regarding the scope and costumes and the views that could not be accomplished on Broadway. They also added some scenes that were definitely appreciated as they helped clarify certain past events. DO NOT compare this movie to any movie that presented this story as a Horror movie. It is a musical based on the Leroux novel. But alas despite all of the things that the movie was able to add it was horrifically offset by the singing. Emmy Rossum can sing. Gerard Butler despite a great try simply can not carry a tune in a bucket. At all. You need SPECTACULAR vocal ability to sing the role of The Phantom. Emmy can handle some of the minor songs but the female lead ALSO demands a very special vocal talent which she lacks. Some of the other characters were dubbed - like Minnie Driver much to the credit of the movie but why in the world they did not dub the leads is amazing and despite my 7 rating destroyed the heart of this movie. I feel that in the past you cast a star like Deborah Kerr in King and I or Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady or Natalie Wood in West Side and then you get the best damn singer around to do the vocals. If you can do that with those three gigantic stars you can certainly do it with Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. As a point of interest - Marni Nixon did all three of those roles and changed her voice to emulate different females she was dubbing. Because Marni Nixon was an idiotically great S I N G E R ... singer .... . OMG ... I am going to see Les Mis today. What will happen then ?",The Phantom of the Opera
216,SILMARILLI,Beautiful!......Breathtaking!...... Enchanting!...... Exquisite!,10,15 June 2005,"Warning......Musicals are not for everyone. You either love them or you hate them. This movie is not the Horror film of old but very much a Musical of a more classical vein. If you like musicals you'll love this one.......I've been a fan of the Phantom of the Opera story for a long time. Back to before it was a musical, and was just a Horror film of the 1910's, 30's, 40's, 60's, 80's and 90's. At least half a dozen or more renditions of the story have been made for both the silver screen and for TV, and stage, all non musicals of the Horror variety. Scenes from the classic silent horror film have appeared in many modern horror movies, the one playing on TV, as someone is being killed. Some were well done, others are very badly made.Then a man named Webber put music to the story for a stage play, and the most successful musical of all time was launched. And is still going on. Around the world it is still being played. Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford I think sung originally. I even have a tape of their performances.This brings us to this current version, which is Beautiful, Breathtaking, Enchanting, Exquisite and that just describes the performance by 17 year old Emmy Rossum, in the lead role of Christine. Again Webber had a hand in the making of this film, shocking Miss Rossum by choosing her to play the role of Christine, over hundreds of other more experienced, veteran, singers.You can not compare all the different versions of the story with each other. Its like comparing bananas and oranges. The stage play was spectacular in its own right, and so to is this version. Young Emmy gave a performance of a lifetime, both in her acting and especially in her vocals. Emmy is Breathtakingly beautiful to watch, her acting is enchanting to behold and her singing is exquisitely performed. The scenery, sets, music, and other performances can all be described by those words. This film is destined to become a beloved CLASSIC, and is a true triumph.....I do not know what the future holds for young Emmy. She is currently not working on anything. I read somewhere she has turned down over 50 major roles just to go to school, so I'm sure her future is a bright one. I hope to see and hopefully hear (singing) much more of her in the near future.",The Phantom of the Opera
217,Frogfisher,Gods of all Musicals...,9,28 January 2005,"I'm a great fan of Musicals, and found myself love everyone I've ever seen, to my recollection, and a great fan of an expressive use of music in movies in general. But my list of seen musicals is some what short. Seen very few in the theater, and do wish to see some, even had a chance to actually see ""Phantom"" in London, but had to decide between Phantom and Soccer, an obvious choice for me and several million soccer fans from both England and the rest of the world. This is a choice I regret. And I even had a chance later, but just didn't have the money then. Right now I've made space right between ""Singin in the rain"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" for the DVD when ever it comes. Coz, I'm in love! The music, the story, the characters, the actors, the sets, everything is incredible. And sitting listening to the soundtrack as I write, only few film soundtracks have had this kind of impact on me. It's up in the same league as ""Lord of the Rings"" and something from the hand of John Williams or Thomas Newman.As a newcomer to the world of ""Phantom"", I was blown away by the story and the musical score. And this is a major part of the film. But also the actors and the directing is a milestone in musicals in films. through out the movie one senses that this is a musical made for the stage, but one believes the movie to be more real. The actors is well chosen, especially considering their voices. Emmy Rossum as Christine, Gerard Butler as The Phantom, Patrick Wilson as Raoul and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, very nice. You eat the characters raw, their ages and the reality of them, mostly because there's no Katie Holmes, John Travolta or Antonio Banderas, which would be harder to take. The ""unknowns"" is perfect(of course Miranda is far from unknown, but she's just one of those actors how is a new character every time we see her). Christine is innocent and young, The Phantom is sexy, tragic and very likable, Rauol is critic, dashing and romantic. Work wonderful for me, they reach out through the screen without choking you. The sets are believable, although the statues are a bit...naked and...guess they must be freezing(a Shumacher-trademark??). The backstage, the caves, the dome, are very baroque and somewhat Gothic in parts, but suits the story well as it is a theater(very baroque in most European countries) and dark caves and cemeteries just has to be Gothic if anything. It is a bit overdone as we are introduced to the cemetery, but again a Schumacher-trademark. The storyline seems strange at times, and I've both read and heard (for example in the soundtrack) things that chronological seems out of place, but won't pretend to be expert in that area. One wonders about a few things and I think i will see more films based on the book and even read it, i think, there must be more story, understandable taken out to fit a stage-production.The Musical as a Movie: All that have existed as the stage musical, I, as I've said, know very little off. But one thing I do know. Not the last time I've seen this piece of history. Andrew Lloyd Webbers Musical seems to be created to it's fullest in this Movie! The Music, played by a 105-piece orchestra, is enchanting, beautiful, haunting, breathtaking and leaves one as if the actors and musician had been right there on the stage. But with all of the things the movies can bring, effects, beautiful sets, emotion in peoples faces, realistic props and action to the extreme. I wish to see the stage show now, but fear to be disappointed. For me the film caught me and spit me out after having been inside the movies universe for 2 and a half hours, almost crying and almost hoping a sequel would be made(that one i regretted after realizing this is an almost perfect experience as it is).One thing I do have about this film, is the speculation on what ever this should be a musical just filmed, or it should be more of a movie? I see it as the first! A shame perhaps, but besides that it really spoke to me!Go see it! It's a nine for me!",The Phantom of the Opera
218,WizardOfGore,Enjoy This Movie,8,3 January 2005,"OK. I just have to put my two cents in here.***WARNING, THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** Too many people are complaining about the differences between the stage musical and the movie version. While everyone is entitled to their opinion, this is a totally unfair comparison.Remember, you are seeing this in a movie theatre, not a music hall designed for optimum acoustics. The voices are not going to soar as they would on stage. In addition, certain elements of the story telling have to be adapted to the stage. When people see a stage musical, they don't expect to hear a lot of talking. In a movie version, you can get away with a lot more dialogue, which helps the story.The thing I liked about the movie version is that they have access to a lot more ""movie magic."" The opening scene, where they transform the decrepit opera house into the opulent building from the past, as the chandelier goes up, is the coolest thing I have ever seen. The dust and decay is literally ""wiped away"".As far as the vocal talents are concerned.... I have seen the stage show five times. I was lucky enough to see it with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, who were amazing. I have also seen it with singers who were not quite as amazing. Remember, this is a movie, not a stage production, so the way you interpret the vocals is going to be different.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I don't see what's not to like.If you have seen the stage production, go into the movie version understanding that it is going to be different and you will enjoy it.",The Phantom of the Opera

The story was sensational and plays with the audiences emotions from beginning to end.The cast was basically rather good. The lead girl who played Christine was ideally cast. Brilliant.The music was well composed and if I remember correctly, a majority of the audience clapped when the movie finished (must have been on some opera trip!!!).

I've read a negative comment by someone from the media, and she's plain nuts. If you've ever read a good book and wanted ""more"", this is how the movie satisfies those needs with extra things, as when the Phantom was displayed as a freak as a child in a carnival. The casting was superb: from the zany ""over the top"" performance of Minnie Driver, to the beautiful Christine. Heck, even the Phantom was darn handsome, as long as he wore his mask. It proves that NOT having star performers in a show brings out the best in quality and content. If in doubt, please go see it. This is one gorgeous movie that will live on & on.

221,thepartyoftea,As good as the stage?,8,15 June 2005,"When I first saw the trailer for ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" I got goosebumps. I saw the theater production years ago and heard this movie was going to be made with rumours of who would play the Phantom ranging from up and comers to Johhny Depp. So when I saw that trailer on that warm summer evening I quickly told my parents and sister, who have also saw the live production and made plans to go see it. Skip forward to the release and I finally saw it. The movie stays true to the live production. Sure there's a few differences, but overall it's very close. The set designs and costumes are beautiful and work very well. The musical numbers are entertaining and every little thing is considered. Even the shots of the background dancers are good. That being said, I still liked the live performance better, must have been the live music. If you love the live version, see the movie. If you want to see a twisted love triangle romance in movie set in Paris, then see this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
222,joshtill-98100,Opera Ghost: A beautiful descent into madness or a mad descent into romance?,8,14 January 2020,"Phantom Of The Opera is one of my all time favourite stage musicals of all time, so upon learning that a movie version existed starring the incomparable Gerard Butler, I was immediately intrigued. The end product is nothing short of Phantom magic, but it is missing what the stage play has, room for the imagination. Gerard's choices of the phantom could literally be put up against Hugh Jackman's Jean Valjean in 2012's Les Miserables. The story, the everything is magnificent. This phantom just feels like its missing something that is in its mere clutches.The film opens to an elderly man, whom we later meet as Raoul Vicomte de Changy, attending an auction at the ruins of the Opera Populaire in France. He bids and wins a music box with a toy monkey on top. Next to be bid off, a chandelier. The chandelier is lifted and the film shifts to many years prior, setting up the setting for the upcoming story (""Overture""). In the midst of a production rehearsal, a set piece falls on the opera's prima donna, Carlotta (Minnie Driver). She reconvenes of her past injuries and storms out. Madame Giry, the concierge, welcomes the new owners to the opera house and puts forward Christine Daáe (Emmy Rossum) to sing in that evenings performance. Raoul, Christines childhood playmate attends the show and recognizes her (""Think Of Me"").Meg Giry, Madame Giry's daughter and Christines best friend, finds her alone in the basement chapel and fears Christine, for Christine states that a ""mysterious angel of music"" has taught her to sing (""Angel Of Music""). Raoul offers Christine dinner, but before she can leave, the angel (Gerard Butler) appears in her mirror (""Little Lotte/The Mirror""). The angel grabs Christine by the hand and takes her down to his underground lair (""The Phantom of The Opera""). There, the angel, now known as the phantom, showcases Christine his creations, and she faints of being startled (""The Music Of The Night""). She wakes up and attempts to take off his mask, and he bashes her for her actions and takes her back upstairs (""I Remember/Stranger Than You Dreamt It"").That night, the opera is set to put on Il Muto with Carlotta as the lead. In the night, Phantom has sent notes to the owners, Raoul and Carlotta (""Notes""). The owners decide to go against phantoms requests and continue to cast Carlotta as the lead and Christine as a silent role (""Prima Donna""). Before the show, another concierge named Joseph Buquet warns the girls of the opera ghost and his magical lasso (""Magical Lasso""). The performance goes well until Carlotta loses her voice due to Phantom switching her elixir to perfume. They bring forward the ballet from act 2, but the audience and castmates are scarred, seeing Buquet's corpse hanging from a noose above (""Poor Fool He Makes Me Laugh""). Christine and Raoul sprint to the rooftop as Christine explains her fear of the phantom to Raoul (""Why Have You Brought Me Here/Raoul, I've Been There""). Raoul swears devotion to Christine as they share their first kiss (""All I Ask Of You""). Secretly, the phantom has listened from behind a statue and Phantom declares war on Raoul (""All I Ask Of You Reprise"").Six months later, the owners hold a massive masquerade ball at the opera populaire, while Raoul and Christine celebrate their secret engagement (""Masquerade""). The phantom appears, dressed in all red and brings a script of an Opera he has written named Don Juan Triumphant, and demands it is the next production performed with Christine as the main character. (""Why So Silent"") Upon learning of the engagement, the Phantom storms off, chased by Raoul. The phantom attempts to kill Raoul, but he is saved by Madame Giry. Raoul asks of his past and Madame Giry explains that he is a demented ""circus freak"" who one day had the courage to murder his captor and run off with Giry, who was attending the circus that evening. She placed him in the sewers of the opera house, but she realizes that his obsession has gone too far.Christine, seeking answers and closure, visits her father's grave. She longs for answers and feels in desperate need of guidance (""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""). Looking defeated, an ominous light comes from the mausoleum with Phantom posing once again as the angel of music. Before Christine falls for Phantoms trap once again, Raoul appears on his steed and has a sword duel with the Phantom. Raoul and Christine run off together and phantom declares war on them both. At that nights performance of Don Juan Triumphant, Phantom secretly murders the lead, Ubaldo Piangi and sings with Christine. Christine, noticing the voice, unmasks the phantom, revealing his deformed face to the audience (""The Point Of No Return""). Phantom drags Christine back down to the lair, while he forces the grand chandelier to crash, setting the opera house ablaze. Giry leads Raoul to the 2nd entrance to the phantom's lair. A mob forms in order to hunt phantom down.Phantom has Christine dress in a wedding dress as he proposes to her. She informs him that she isn't frightened of his appearance, but his yearning for violence. Raoul appears and the phantom traps him, utilizing Buquet's lasso and attaching him to a portcullis. Phantom makes Christine choose: either she chose phantom and Raoul lives, or choose Raoul and watch Raoul die. Christine berates Phantom for his actions, but notices that he has not ever experienced kindness. She kisses the phantom. Having realized what he has done, Phantom frees Raoul and sends him and Christine away to live a happy life together. Phantom plays with his music box, before hearing the mob rush down the stairs. The phantom goes into hiding, as the mob, led by Meg appears. Meg holds the mask up as the time jumps back to after the auction. An elder Raoul visits Christines grave, before realizing that the phantoms iconic red flower is there too. (""Down Once More/Track Down This Murder/The Final Lair"").2004's Phantom of the Opera is truly missing the heart. It views the phantom as a villain, other than an antagonist as written. Although you are not supposed to be rooting for the phantom, due to his crimes and what not, in the stage musical you find yourself very upset when he smashes the mirrors and go into hiding. In the film, its kind of just something that happens. Now Gerard Butler did extraordinary things with the scripture given, Emmy Rossum the same. The side characters of phantom are what truly make the show, and the same can be said about Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She is hilarious in so many ways and when Piangi dies, and you see her cry, you honestly feel a bit of empathy. I do wish also that some of the songs were synced up to the actors lip syncing, but you forgive that in the first minute.Overall, The Phantom of the Opera gets an 8 solid.",The Phantom of the Opera
223,missmissa,Wow!,10,9 March 2005,"There are very few movies capable of sending shivers up my spine. And I had not ever seen a film that could awe me with its beauty and scare me half to death at the same time, until I saw this film. The music is an important part of this film's haunting quality, but the art direction and cinematography were also huge contributors. The biggest shocker of this film, however, was the casting. Gerard Butler tends to play the hairy, tough guy and he is absolutely amazing at subtly portraying the Phantom. And who knew he could sing? Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson's previous film credits aren't exactly exemplary (The Day After Tomorrow and The Alamo, respectively), but they both give wonderful performances. The treat of the cast, however, is Minnie Driver as Carlotta. The part really reveals her comic depth. Most people don't realize how hard it is to actually act and sing at the same because both activities take a lot of concentration. I realize that the actors are lip-syncing to their voices on the soundtrack, but even that requires concentration and all of the actors, especially Gerard Butler, do an excellent job blending music into their performance. Also, all of the actors, with the exception of Minnie Driver, do their own singing. And while Minnie Driver doesn't do her own singing in the film, she is the voice behind ""Learn to Be Lonely"" that plays during the credits. I have never seen the stage production, so I had no preconceived ideas on what the film should be. But I cannot imagine it being any more beautiful. It is a film for lovers of musicals and of film in general.",The Phantom of the Opera
224,amberbaer,Simply Stunning - from start to finish,10,10 January 2005,"What can be said in just 1000 words about the LUSH, RICH, GORGEOUS adaptation of the great stage play to an equally great movie - it is worth the wait that the fans of the play have had to endure all these years...this is the most perfect adaptation of stage to film since CHICAGO! Gerard Butler, while he is not the greatest singer in the world, gives emotion and depth to the voice and character of the PHANTOM - it's nice to see that he can sing and still be seductive and charming, with or without the mask! Sexy is he when full face is shown, you see the pure emotion in his eyes and voice when he sings...BRAVO The rest of the cast are a PURE JOY to watch and hear - Minnie Driver just steals the show and eats the scenery each time she appears...the Grand Diva indeed....she has a great voice - but it's not shown here until the final credits roll....the Diva's singing voice is way out of Minnie's own range...but we totally forgive her since she almost steal the movie from Gerard....I can't wait for the DVD to come out...this is a must have for collectors of fine CINEMA DU ART.

Then I watched a additional five times, and bought the soundtrack. Then I bought the actual movie! I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS! Gerard Butler actually makes The Phantom lovable, which is amazing considering what the character does. If you're going to watch this movie, watch it twice. You will not be disappointed. Romantics everywhere will be bawling their eyes out at the love triangle between Christine(Rossum), The Phantom(Butler) and Raoul(Wilson). Make no mistake, this is no ordinary love story. The perfect combination of tragedy and love turn this movie into something unexpected.",The Phantom of the Opera
226,worship_HIM97,Beautifully done!,10,7 July 2005,"This movie truly is a work of art! It was beyond my expectations. I am one of the many that saw the movie but did not see the stage production, which is why I didn't know what to expect. However, I did read Gaston Leroux's novel, and I loved it, but I knew that the film would be quite different from the novel, which for the most part, it was. Gerard Butler's part was done with perfection. Emmy Rossum was an excellent Christine, and her voice is amazing. Although I have not seen the stage production of this story, I have heard the cast recording, and I therefore have heard Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I strongly believe that Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum were much better. Michael Crawford was too weak, and he would have been much better sticking to Comedy. Sarah Brightman simply didn't meet Christine's standards such that Emmy Rossum did. They may have been good actors for the musical, but their singing parts were very much so inferior to Butler's and Rossum's. I will forewarn you that if you don't like to cry in a movie, then don't see this. It is a very emotionally powerful movie, as the movie's goal to make you feel sorry for the Phantom is very much so successful. Minnie Driver's song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" is also a triumph. It is featured on the soundtrack and in the end credits, and the song helps add even further heartfelt emotion in the film.This movie is great beyond words! Excellent work!10/10!",The Phantom of the Opera
227,gracegibson,My All-Time Favorite Movie,10,4 June 2005,"I saw this movie a little over two weeks ago, and I have to say, it was the best movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene with the chandelier being raised and the fabulous music starting (my favorite part, by the way), it captivated me. It was the only perfect movie I have ever seen. The music was so stunning and managed to mesh modern and old-fashioned music without it seeming stupid like country and rap (a.k.a. ""crap""). My favorite song is ""The Phantom of the Opera"". All the actors were brilliant except for Patrick Wilson (""Raoul de Chagny""), who had a good singing voice but wasn't a very good actor in this movie. The set and costumes were by far the most brilliant and eye-catching I have ever seen in a movie. I also love how they made the 1919 scenes in black and white and the rest in fabulous color. The choreography in the ""Masquerade"" scene was also lovely (that's my second-favorite part). There was more than smoke and mirrors, too. There was a certain enchantment, like you were experiencing something enchanting beyond your dreams. It seemed to take me to another world (and it made me appreciate 19th century French opera). You can't help but watch in awe and wonder, of the music, acting, singing, sets, costumes, cinematography...everything. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius. This movie, I think, is the greatest masterpiece in movie history.",The Phantom of the Opera
228,azeffer,A fantastic feat. I loved it.,10,26 December 2004,"Honestly, I don't know how this director or any other could have done a better job. The costumes, set, actors, and special effects were superb. He managed to fit in Webber's classic score and bring intrigue to the plot. I was touched by the plight of phantom by the end.In addition, I found Emmy Rossum's Gothic beauty a perfect fit for Christine. The rest of the cast is great, and standouts are Miranda Richardson as the stage manager who took pity one the phantom as a young girl and Minnie Driver who is a hoot as La Carlotta. She gives the role a garish vanity that is hysterical. And Gerard Butler was broke my heart as the Phantom.Musicals are probably the hardest genre to tackle in this day and age but this film succeeds. I can't stand it when people expect a musical to have a plot on the same wavelength of say, ""Terms of Endearment."" Instead just relax and be taken in by the gorgeous visuals, stunning music, and touching storyline. I would recommend this to anybody of all ages.",The Phantom of the Opera
229,mmwea,THE SOUND OF MUCK,1,27 October 2019,"What a monumental mountain of crap this is-although, it's exactly what the stage production deserves. The music is the very definition of schmalz-and low-grade schmalz at that. The sets and costumes are almost unimaginably vulgar, which means they fit this score to perfection. The poor girl playing the leading role would be laughed out of even an amateur opera audition. I was ""lucky"" enough to be invited to the opening night of the show on Broadway back in the 80s, and even then I wanted to leave at intermission. I thought the film might be an improvement, but it was just the reopening of an old wound. The fact that so many people think so highly of this show is a real indictment of contemporary theater. It really shows how low we have sunk.",The Phantom of the Opera
230,gstiger,Let the Dream Begin?,5,24 December 2004,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" tells the story of a deformed musical prodigy known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his haunting obsession with a young, talented ingénue named Christine (Emmy Rossum). When the Phantom's love fantasy is threatened by Christine's childhood sweetheart (Patrick Wilson), he takes action against the opera house for which Christine performs.For many years, I have been an intense admirer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I have seen the show several times, so I was quite excited when I discovered that a film adaptation was in the works. However, my joy gave way to dread when I learned that the heavy-handed and insipid Joel Schumacher - the filmmaker responsible for the abominable ""Batman & Robin"" - was to take charge of Andrew Lloyd Webber's cinematic opus. As the release date neared, my anxiety was understandably heightened. Photographs, video clips, and sound bytes hinted at a truly splendid visual and auditory experience. Pre-release critical reception was lackluster to say the least, however, and so I waited with baited breath...Having finally seen Joel Schumacher's interpretation of Webber's ""he Phantom of the Opera"" I can safely say that the adaptation will not disappoint fans of the musical, yet it may not wholly enthrall them nor sway those indifferent toward Webber's musical compositions. Schumacher's efforts are adequate as he remains stoutly faithful to the stage production. What minor creative liberties he allows, such as a brief glimpse into the Phantom's troubled past and an exceedingly poignant epilogue, are a welcome addition to the mythic story.However, Schumacher's stringent adherence to Webber's original storyline is one of the film's weak points. Music is justifiably a constant presence in the piece, but many lines sung on stage do not work on the silver screen. Schumacher preserves many such musical phrases, and the effect is occasionally rather silly. Additionally, his direction is both generic and without energy. As a result, the film's middle passages tend to drag. Schumacher's lack of innovation and dynamism prevent his ""Phantom"" from reaching the same lofty heights of recent movie musicals like ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago"".The lead roles of Christine and her disturbed Phantom require a great deal of emotional power and musical know-how. I am pleased to report that Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler fill the requirements of their respective roles nicely. Rossum infuses Christine with such soulfulness and innocence that it is impossible not to be swept away by her grace. She also boasts a stellar singing voice. Gerard Butler, while not as musically proficient as the famed Michael Crawford who originated the role of the Phantom on Broadway, makes up for any musical inadequacies with a dynamic, raw, and volatile screen presence. He offers a unique interpretation of the character, instilling the Phantom with a greater sense of masculinity and menace than has been seen on the stage. The rest of the cast members range from serviceable (Patrick Wilson as Christine's childhood sweetheart) to exceptional (Miranda Richardson as the mysterious Madame Giry).The technical attributes of ""The Phantom"" are, for the most part, excellent. John Mathieson's exquisite cinematography illuminates the film with such wondrous beauty and passion. A substantial amount of money was spent on recreating Paris Opera House of yesteryear, and every dollar is evident on screen. The sets are both vast and intricate, while the costumes are dazzling and extravagant. The editor, Terry Rawlings, does falter since much of the film is assembled in a somewhat incoherent fashion. The effect is one of disorientation and disjointedness.Schumacher has delivered a solid adaptation of Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"", no more and no less. I enjoyed the film and that in itself is a relief given Schumacher's abysmal track record. After having seen it, however, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed that Webber's illustrious and soaring musical was not given to a more gifted director. The actors and technicians do their part, imparting both passion and romance into the production. Schumacher's efforts are sufficient, but the material is deserving of so much more. What an experience this would have been had it been helmed by renowned theater director and filmmaker, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"") or the Gothic eccentric Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman"")! ""The Phantom of the Opera"", a good film, could have been great had it been placed in more capable hands.",The Phantom of the Opera
231,rassezeus,My mind is really switching sides.,8,2 September 2020,"As I have stated previously, I freaking hated musical movies. But I've been making exceptions here and there watching couple of musical movies. And my mind is really changing. I've started to like these things.The Phantom of the Opera is a really good novel and I was excited to watch this movie. And wasn't disappointed. The plot stayed true to the novel and the characters were portrayed well. Also, opera has always been one of the guilty pleasures and soundtrack made me appreciate opera even more.Overall, pretty enjoyable piece of cinema.",The Phantom of the Opera
232,SFTVLGUY2,A Spectacular Work of Art,10,6 February 2005,"The first time I saw the stage production of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" it had just begun previews in London's West End, and I entered the theater untainted by any of the massive hype that eventually surrounded it. A fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's previous work, I had high expectations, but nothing prepared me for the spectacle that slowing unfolded on stage before me. Much of the magic derived from the fact that many of the effects were so unexpected in a theater. I was mesmerized from start to finish.A couple of decades later, the film version has affected me as profoundly as the play did. The opening sequence, in which mementos from the now-destroyed Paris opera house are being sold at auction, is filmed in soft focus black-and-white. As the infamous chandelier begins to rise to the familiar organ blasts that open the title tune, the images burst into color, the building recapturing its former glory as the camera sweeps along, debris dissolving into luxury, empty spaces filling with stagehands and performers. The effect, one that could be accomplished only on film, is dazzling.Surely by now everyone is aware of the tale of the Phantom, a mysterious figure that lurks in the shadows of the theater on those occasions when he emerges from the watery depths beneath it, where he plots success for Christine, a young soprano in the opera company. A scene written for the film explains how this tortured soul, loathing the facial disfigurement that prompted his self-exile, came to be a resident of the dank and damp regions beneath the stage, and this addition is just one of a few changes to the original script that enhance the storyline. Another is the use of the chandelier, which on stage was more of a gimmick that dramatically ended Act One than the crucial plot point it becomes in the film.Watching this movie unfold is like wandering through the galleries of a museum, each scene a work of art, the only difference being the flow of movement as the camera weaves its way through magnificent sets and darts around exquisite costumes. The film's greatest accomplishment is its many stunning visuals - the opulence of the opera house, the towering statuary and mausoleums in the graveyard, the watery, dungeon-like setting the Phantom calls home. Few films have captured mood and atmosphere as successfully as this has; the creative teams combine their talents to use the screen like an artist uses a canvas.Of the lead players, Emmy Rossum best captures the essence of her character, an innocent, bewildered pawn in the Phantom's power play. Her singing voice is rich and pure and often reminiscent of Sarah Brightman, who originated the role on stage. In the title role, Gerard Butler oozes both menace and hypnotic charm beneath the mask he wears to hide his scars (which prove to be far less hideous than they should have been to cause him such angst), but his vocalization tends to get somewhat thin when he moves into the higher registers. Patrick Wilson is blandly perfect as the perfectly bland Raoul, the opera company's patron and the Phantom's rival for Christine's attentions, and his voice beautifully blends with Rossum's in their duets. For comic relief, we have Minnie Driver as Carlotta, an outrageous Italian-accented diva whose lack of talent escapes her completely. (Driver's vocals were dubbed, although she does sing ""Learn to Be Lonely,"" a new song no doubt composed with Oscar hopes in mind, over the closing credits.)Most professional critics were brutal in their assessment of this film, in a manner that suggests they were determined to hate it before they even entered the theater. I can't imagine what movie it was they saw. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a musical treat and a visual masterpiece. Be sure to see it on the big screen.",The Phantom of the Opera
233,mlktrout,It was great except for one thing...,5,8 March 2008,"...and it's a pretty major thing at that. Gerard Butler can't sing.This isn't a comparison to anyone else, I mean I wasn't expecting Michael Crawford. But I was expecting someone who could carry a tune. Butler is so good-looking, I wanted so much to like him as the Phantom. And so many other things about the movie were right. I could even forgive them for losing the hat, although as far as I was concerned the hat and the Phantom were as inseparable as the Phantom and his music.So many things were good. Christine was radiant. Raoul tried not to be as white-bread as he is usually portrayed. Madam Giry was appropriately scary and wise. The opera guys were pompously funny and provided great comic relief. The visuals...my gosh, visually the entire production is something you could wallow in, and absorb it through your pores.If only Butler could sing. I noticed his thin and reedy voice in the title song, but it didn't really start grating on me until Music of the Night. Only someone with a deep, resonant and powerful voice should be allowed to sing that song. The way he held that last note was not amazing, it was annoying, it was like nails dragging across a chalkboard and I was ready to scream and beg him to please stop! Everything else...well, everything but one. (Possible Spoiler follows). The unmasking is the big climactic moment of the story. Well, when we finally see the Phantom in all his disfigured glory, he looks like a guy whose chemo treatment went wrong. At best he's got a bad case of sunburn. I was expecting something horrendous, something formidable. This wasn't it.I love this story. I've seen it in London, on Broadway and off Broadway, different Phantoms each time. I've seen understudies do it. In a movie the size of this one I was expecting to see a decent makeup job and a lead actor who DIDN'T sound like a combination of early Frank Sinatra and late Mickey Rooney.",The Phantom of the Opera
234,Fielga,"Curse you, Joel Schumacher!",6,26 May 2012,"Oh, this film had so much promise! What happened in the end is pure tragedy.I give it a six primarily for stunning cinematography, elaborate costumes, extraordinary music and some very nice vocals. But oh my, what a disaster this little movie is! I hardly know where to begin.Well despite many complaints that I've read, I had no problem at all with Emmy's Christine. Her voice is certainly not Sarah Brightman's voice, but it definitely has it's charm, a little innocence and uncertainty, I thought she was wonderfully cast. And the same goes for Patrick Wilson, who so many seem to want to complain about, I thought he did a very nice job. The managers were cast decently, too.I have a problem with the casting of Carlotta. I've seen probably every Phantom movie ever released in the US and I've come to the conclusion that the best Carlottas are plump and loud and laughable. This casting was atrocious. A thin Carlotta who did not even do her own singing and provided no comic relief...how is this a Carlotta at all? Terrible failure.Madame Giry casting was another wreck. It reminded me of the Kevin Costner syndrome in reverse. Whereas he is incapable of speaking consistently with an accent, Ms. Richardson is incapable of acting in this role without a French accent so thick and terrible that it's genuinely cringe-worthy. I blame this on bad directing over bad acting, as she's a very talented performer in all of her other roles.I can barely touch on the casting of Gerard Butler in the title role without feeling nauseous. I understand Schumacher's intention to get a ""sexy"" cast to draw a younger crowd, but when the character's whole point is that he's a disfigured madman, maybe ""sexy"" isn't the way to go! And maybe a mild sunburn over a couple inches of his face isn't really fitting with the whole ""disfigured"" aspect, ugh! Oh and since he's supposed to be this amazing, genius musician, maybe he should actually be able to sing...? I do like Mr. Butler very much in many roles, but he and Schumacher absolutely ruined this musical for me in every possible way. Horrendous is a compliment.To spare you from having to read more complaints, I won't touch on everything else that's just wrong about the movie. I will say, however, that despite my complaints, I do still own a copy of it. Again, it's stunning visually (with the exception of the disappointingly toned down Masquerade scene - way to demolish the best known visual in the whole show, wow) and not all of the performances are bad. I'm a huge Phantom fan, admittedly something of a Leroux fangirl from time to time, and chances are I can find something of value in anything related to my favorite book. But unless you're an obsessive phan like I am, I'd really suggest passing on this version. There are far superior ones out there.",The Phantom of the Opera
235,emwolf,Decent Movie of a Great Theatrical Experience,5,28 January 2005,"When I took my children to their first Broadway play I chose Phantom. My youngest (then 9) has commented that she could see it every day. It was a wonderful experience, from the emotional music, to the great special effects and the single big production number ""Masquerade."" The movie does a decent job translating that to the big screen. Not great, but serviceable. My biggest complaint is Mr Butler as the phantom. Screen presence is fine, acting is good, but his voice just doesn't have the power necessary for the part. Emmy Rossum is good enough, although her voice strains in the upper registers. The stand-out for me was Patrick Wilson as Raoul. He was a stand-out as well in the Angels In America movie. I don't know if he's going to be any kind of mega star, but I don't think Mr. Wilson will ever go hungry for lack of work. The weakest film moment is the big Masquerade production. Mr. Schumacher has a good touch for the sweeping drama, but he seems to have missed the day his film school discussed dancing.",The Phantom of the Opera
236,Darth_Guybrush,Very enjoyable especially if you missed the theatre production,8,2 November 2005,"I was lucky enough to see the theatre version at Sydney's (Australia) Royal Theatre starring Rob Guest as The Phantom.And it was brilliant. From the initial pitch black darkness where you can't see your hand in front of your face (I mean it was DARK) to the next bit which I won't spoil if they ever bring the stage version back. Awesome!Of course this is a movie but it shares many qualities of the play that made it so popular.Set design is amazing and the vocal performances are also very good.An entertaining movie that brings back fond memories of a family outing to the theater.Gerard Butler (who I last saw in a Tomb Raider movie) is a great Phantom, Rob Guest in Australia was awesome too.Hard to believe this is an ""independant"" movie as it reeks of quality.If you enjoy the music or miss the stage production you will enjoy this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
237,the_only_warrior,Good adaption but pity about the casting,6,24 January 2005,"I saw the movie last week and, although I am very familiar with the main bits of music, I'd never seen it on stage nor read the book.For a first impression, I thought it was a very beautiful piece of cinema. Sets and costumes were amazing and it never had the feel of a stage production, which is the most important aspect in my opinion from stage to screen.My main gripe was in the casting. As a musical that relies on a strong classical sound from the voices, I would have expected the cream of opera/music theatre to be cast. However, most of the cast, although they would have been fine in amateur productions, were not suitable for a big-budget film version of Phantom.Emmy Rossum (Christine) acted well and she has a lovely voice that will definitely grow in time and training, but wasn't secure enough to handle this demanding role.Gerald Butler (Phantom) was simply awful. The Phantom doesn't talk much - he sings most of the time. The fact that Gerald obviously can't sing not only destroyed the best musical moments in the movie, but also detracted severely from his acting. Plus he looks like a strapping, handsome young man instead of the circus freak he is supposed to be. I was cringing in every scene he was in!On the other hand, Patrick Wilson was excellent and the highlight of the movie for me as Raoul. He looked right, acted well and sounded perfect. Minnie Driver was also excellent as Carlotta with a stand-out voice - its a shame they didn't dub the majority of the cast.The smaller parts were also a bit of a let-down vocally, though most of them looked right... I think with such a big-budget and such a popular musical they could have found the right casting.The revised orchestral score sounded excellent nonetheless and apart from most the singing I really enjoyed watching this. However, I would not go see it again and would not go out of my way to get the soundtrack - which is a big shame.",The Phantom of the Opera
238,naillon-2,"Overdone, but still magnificent!",10,21 April 2006,"I wish Alan Parker had directed this film. I know he directed Evita (which I will not see because I loathe Madonna with an undying passion), and he is one hell of a good director. Schumacher overdid it; too many swooping shots, Dutch angles galore, and he crossed the axis. Plus, the film leaves too much unexplained - the horse in the first underground scene, the respective ages of the Phantom and Madame Giry, the ultimate fate of the Phantom, etc. (I was surprised by the criticism of those who hated the unmasking scene. Christine doesn't magically change the Phantom's hair when she yanks off the mask. She removes his wig, too. You can clearly see other wigs on his table as he's readying himself for the big performance, and he adjusts the one he's already wearing.)That said, it was still exquisite. I was overwhelmed by Gerard Butler's full-blooded, full-throated portrayal of the twisted genius who lives below the opera house and falls deeply in love with one of its singers. I've never seen the stage version, so I didn't know how the story compared to the original Leroux novel; I waited for the death of the Phantom, and was relieved when it didn't come. We never do know what happens to the Phantom, but we know that he's in for a cold, lonely time of it.I've seen the Lon Chaney version many times, and he and Butler are the quintessential actors for this role - Chaney as the horrifically ugly, murdering Phantom, and Butler as the somewhat deformed, lonely, complex Phantom. I'd like to see the character rewritten so that the Phantom isn't a murderer. This would make Christine's decision less clear - even if she didn't choose Raoul, there's no denying that the Phantom is a man who murders for personal gain, with the exception of the first murder.It is Butler whom you watch whenever he is on screen; he embodies the character with a rare perfection. I haven't seen anyone throw himself/herself into a role like that in quite some time. As for his singing, I loved it. I felt that, rather than going for perfection, he was trying to put forth the emotion behind the lyrics, and he succeeded magnificently. He sang anger, obsession, madness, loss, anguish, and heartbreak with truly exceptional results. The late Freddie Mercury had a similar quality about him; what a singing duo those two would have made! As for his acting, he brought to mind the stunning Laurence Olivier; they both have the ability to make you believe, completely and utterly, in the character you are seeing. I couldn't take my eyes off him. Too handsome, some said. I think his face is perfect. A man of that time who really had a deformity of one side of the face might easily be upset by the fact that the other side is so attractive, and slide into depression. I do agree that the deformity isn't that bad; it looked to me not like a sunburn, but like a bad scalding, say with hot water. This may have been deliberate. A man who would hide himself away due to a deformity that was not too bad is a man who would have trouble expressing his love, which is what happens here.Butler's performance sets the standard for others to come; he is a talent to be reckoned with.",The Phantom of the Opera
239,kendallphoenix,What a Piece of Crap,1,16 July 2005,"Okay... I never liked Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera"" on stage, I was not surprised to find that the screen version was just as bad. I seem to remember reading the novel by Gaston Leroux and... maybe my mind is going bad... but it wasn't a love story. Phantom of the Opera is not supposed to be a love story. It's a horror story. Andrew Lloyd Webber's abortion that he christened ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has become the stereotypical backbone of the entire story. There are at least two generations of people that honestly believe that Phantom is a love story. Read a book, people. Webber's abortion is crap and the film version is bigger crap. 1/ 10",The Phantom of the Opera
240,kenbarr-ny,Why are musicals cast with actors who can't sing?,2,26 December 2005,"Once again, Hollywood has taken a musical and cast it with actors who can't sing. Gerard Butler hasn't got the voice for the role of The Phantom and Emily Rossum must have been lip syncing, but since there is no mention of a dubbed voice, i.e. Marnie Nixon for Deborah Kerr and Audrey Hepburn, I have to conclude that's her voice and it's no good either. Since movies by nature aren't live, they have to make up for it by providing top notch performances. This one doesn't even come close. I compare it to the absolutely awful ""Man of La Mancha"" which was cast to fail. Another one with this problem is the movie version of ""West Side Story,"" which at least has superior dancing to make up for non-singers as leads.Bottom line, see it live on stage. The movie hasn't a ghost of a chance.",The Phantom of the Opera
241,Bello-4,Phantom Has To Be One of the Best Films Ever....,10,4 January 2005,"Some films just have to be made. Phantom of the Opera is one of those films... It's a beautiful masterpiece of cinematic art that can only be brought to life as a major motion picture can do it justice. I'll admit, that I've seen the stage performance before and wasn't overly impressed (which I guess is probably the fault of the stage company not the play itself). What drew me to this movie however was the quality with which the movie appeared to possess, the original story in so much that it wasn't a tried and true formula of things blow up, people curse, people act more with a blue screen than with each other and make mountains out of mole hills for their cookie-cutter cinematic problems. While I like most films, I can't tell you how many times I've wondered to myself.... ""Did that really need to be made into a film?"" But what really drew me to this movie, I'll confess, was Emmy Rossum. I've quickly become a fan of this young girl. She's extremely talented, beautiful and not just a flavor of the month who's headlining a movie only cause she's hot, on magazine covers and can fill seats. The fact that I'm sure they had many many pretty and talented young girls trying out for the part of Christine, but to find that one girl, that needle in a haystack if you will, and to cast one with so much potential... That's casting for the sake of your movie over the sake of your box office. It may take a little while, but Emmy Rossum is definitely going places and is going to have the fans to follow her there.The Phantom of the Opera could have probably been made into a major motion picture for a while now (not withstanding those who have already done so), movie special effects have been coming along for years. But this is one of those films where the timing of everything is just right. The evolution of effects is just right, your capable of finding the ""right"" actors for the roles and something refreshing and different needs to take to the theaters to give those who seldomly go to the theaters an actual reason to go.The story is unchanged from the play for the most part, but they've taken the opportunity to make the film so much more detailed and not just a scene for scene copy of the play itself. I don't remember half as much of the written detail in the stage version that I saw as I did in this film. And the visuals were breathtaking. From the quiet beginning of the movie, when you knew that there was an understanding between two of the auction buyers. To the chandelier rising from its ashes and giving breath to the surrounding theater as only really good, no awesome, computer effects can. To the hustle and bustle of the opera house at its prime and then closing with a solemn quiet moment. And that's not even getting into the musical scores. So alive, so rich and vibrant, that while difficult to understand at times, were none the less moving and inspiring.Some in the media have reported that the Phantom of the Opera is likely a box office flop. And to them I say bite your tongue. Some films just have to be made, regardless of whether or not they ever recoup the monies used to make them. Not everyone goes to see the run of the mill, good to okay films with the flavor of the month starlet that seems to be churned out on a regular basis. Some of us actually demand substance and quality in our movies over run of the mill. You also have to take into consideration that Phantom was only released in select cities on less than five-hundred screens across the country and cost a reported sixty-million dollars (+/-) to make. Where as most films are released on a thousand plus screens across the country and cost, in most cases, only a fraction of what Phantom did. Phantom of the Opera here in the Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX area is only playing on maybe a dozen screens. Compare that to most flicks, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or any other movie of the month that plays like a McDonalds, on proverbially every street corner. It's unfair to judge Phantom by those standards.Instead judge Phantom on being a timeless classic. That brings art and substance back to the theater. On those no film in recent memory can touch it. I plan on seeing it more than once, which I never do, and buying it when it hits DVD, and the movie's been out what a week? Now back to reality. Where nothing looks especially interesting at the theaters this month.... Maybe I'll see Elecktra. But that's only an extreme maybe...Bello Dallas, TX",The Phantom of the Opera

Raoul was rather a disappointment, but still good. The costumes were phenomenal and the musical score and sound was wonderful, if you missed it on the big screen, you really missed out, because the spectacle was overwhelming, though just the singing alone is worth a rental. Every change from the original London musical were done with taste and reason, although I did miss some parts, especially some pieces of songs that weren't essential to the plot, but enjoyable for me.

243,Gloryous,Gerard Butler always handsome- always fantastic actor!!!,10,9 September 2006,"I enjoyed the score and the scenery was very spectacular, bringing to life a movie that was really quite dull without the songs, and the color. I had seen the original many years before with Claude Rains, and it was grim, and in black and white. It did not hold a candle to this movie. I felt the warmth of the phantom for the young woman, the movie did not depict him as a monster, unfeeling, and against everyone, but gave him a more humane side. I believe I preferred this rendition to any other. I highly recommend this movie, anyone who loves musicals will find this one to add to their collection of musicals, such as Oklahoma etc. I grew up with musicals and this one rates right up there with all the others. Get this movie and watch it, you will find yourself, wanting it on CD too so you can listen to it in the car. Great film by a very talented man, Gerry Butler! When I watched the film to begin with I did not know that Gerard Butler was the Phantom. Upon reading that he was, I went to Limewire to download a copy of his songs. I assumed the recording I got from the movie off of Limewire was in fact Gerard Butler. But in fact lately I found that the recording I downloaded that said it was he singing, was in fact that of Michael Crawford. So I can honestly say I loved the recording, but I have no clue what Gerard Butler sounds like when he sings. Wish I did.",The Phantom of the Opera
244,pnc777,*Sigh* I am in love....,10,23 May 2005,"I am one of those people who think about movies for days afterwords in any moment of solitude I have free . I can day dream about a good movie for quite a while. I saw this yesterday and I haven't stopped thinking about it, even when I shouldn't! (sorry work!) I have never been exposed to the Phantom in any form, so this was new to me. I am overcome with emotion, the beauty for my eyes, ears, heart and mind is too great! I am truly inspired. Purists with whom I have discussed this film have held firm that certain aspects are different from the book. I believe them, but you must understand that each director must make it his own. His love with the film might change it, or keep it strictly to the book...depending on its style. I must have much passion in anything I make, so I believe it so with others.I have to admit, I've changed my desktop theme and am currently listening to ""Angel of Music"" while I write this. That is how much it moves me. Please, if you would like an emotionally rich adventure in which you can almost cry at the feelings of the characters...give this film a go.On to the plot, an opera house is ""haunted"" by the ""phantom"" who falls deeply in love with a young woman who learns from his experience in opera. The woman is a fragile beauty, wide eyed and naive, orphaned by her father as a girl, she was told he would send the ""Angel of Music"" to her. She sees the Phantom as he. The Phantom has a disfigured face on one side...though honestly he is beautiful even without the mask. The girl is then reunited with a childhood love she knew before her father died. She is torn between the darkly passionate love for the Phantom and the more innocent and safe love with her ""hero"".I see no choice at all but alas, I am not Christine ;o) With love deeply, Olivia",The Phantom of the Opera
245,toddinvestor,That classic soundtrack on the big screen,7,1 January 2005,"""The Phantom Of The Opera"" is all about the music. Needless to say, this film is entirely a musical completely based on the stage play. If this is what you are looking for, you should be more than satisfied. The period costumes and sets are fantastic, and so much more detail can be shown on screen than on stage. The singing and soundtrack are also captivating. So what is not to like? Well, one cannot escape the sense that this is a stage play , not a movie. It feels like it is meant to be seen live, not on a screen. In fact if you do see it, take in the big screen because DVD will not deliver. ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" also lacks the dark side the movie should be able to give it. The phantom is simply not that scary. And the love story does seem a little contrived. My overall sense is that this movie comes across as a video take of a stage play rehearsal. Not that this is a bad thing. If you cannot see ""The Phantom"" live, then the movie is still the next best way to take in that classic soundtrack. 7/10",The Phantom of the Opera
246,CrystalBlueSilver,Damn this movie rocks!,10,16 March 2005,"I went to see this at the theatre in town last night, and I must say it's more than I expected it to be. I wasn't old enough to see the original phantom, Michael Crawford, or Chrisine, Sarah Brightman, on stage, but all I've known are the original recordings of that show. I went to see the movie, and I realized from the start that I can't expect Gerard and Emmy to be as good as Michael and Sarah. It's nearly impossible... Overall, the movie looked very nice, and it was very well done, with one exception. Emmy and Gerard needed a different vocal director. The way they pronounced some of the words caught me off guard. There were a few times I wasn't sure how that way of pronouncing actually made the final cut. That was only a very minor pestilence. I hardly noticed, except for a couple of spots in Music of the Night, and one of Christine's songs, not sure which one. Back to the important elements. I was practically tearing up the last half hour or more of the show. It wasn't like straight out bawling, more like tears forming and maybe only one falling. But seeing Erik sitting there, mask off, holding the little music box that plays ""Masquerade"", and he's singing along, but he can barely sing because he's crying... that put me over the edge, and if I'd needed any more coaxing, I would have flooded the place out. My shirt sleeves were soaked I cried so hard... This is a damn good movie, and even though Gerard and Emmy aren't as good as Michael and Sarah, they at least plunked a few notes on the organ of talent... ^_^",The Phantom of the Opera
247,MadiZone,Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!,5,12 January 2006,"My friend has been talking about this movie for a while, so I decided to give into his pimping and watch it. I found myself disappointed for several reasons.First of all, the performers repeatingly fail to stay in sync. I don't expect a multimillion production like this to feature choreography that makes members of the local Square Dance team look pro.Secondly. I know it's a musical, so plot shouldn't be it's main drive, but this movie doesn't just have an average plot, it's below standard, perhaps absent. A two and half hour play of 2 men battling for the same woman. One man is ugly, the other is handsome. Dude, ask Walt Disney to do such a storyline for an episode of Duck Tales. I'm an adult, so provide me at least somewhat compelling story lines. Well, of course, the concept could be used, if it emerged from sketch to full-fledged script, but it doesn't. We never find any reason for compassion towards the ugly phantom and we never figure out whats so great about the beautiful Raoul. The characters are one-dimensional, irrational and boring.The movie is full of production mistakes. You'll find inaccurate choreography, you'll notice different make-up or hairstyles in the same scenes, because of editorial mistakes. You'll spot scenes where objects disappear, pop-up, move or break, as the camera angle changes, once again - unacceptable production flaws in such a huge production.The only thing that rises above this clutter is the soundtrack. While the phantom could use some singing lessons, the remaining cast does a splendid job.Unless your appetite is set solely for music and fog effects, you'll find yourself hungry after consuming this release. The ghostbusters can have this phantom.This is probably one of those musicals that should have stayed out of the movies.Scenography: 6/10 Storyline: 2/10 Soundtrack: 7/10 Tilt: 5/10",The Phantom of the Opera

However, after seeing the movie i cant wait for its release on video and DVD. The sets were fantastic with the scenes in the bottom of the opera house eerie, that acting was phenomenal and as for the singing it was excellent. The one fault and one fault alone I found with the film was the phantoms singing. It has been mentioned on previous reviews that the phantoms singing was not up to scratch and I have to say I agree. Gerard Butlers voice was not terrible to listen to but was not to the standard of predecessors of him for the role of the phantom. His acting however was absolutely brilliant and he really drew me in to the point of feeling sorry for him at the end. Overall I would give this movie a 9 out of 10, Even if you think you wont like it, its well off going to see it. xxxx",The Phantom of the Opera
249,love_for_nails,The first musical I gave a shot!,10,26 December 2012,"And I was not disappointed. I know how musicals work and that's why I was not willing to watch them: lots of singing, sometimes stupid scenes with lots of pathetic dialogs, their unrealism over the real life, etc.But the stories are good, and I found myself without knowing much about this, very attracted to this particular one and that's how I decided to build myself with patience and watch it. It was wonderful. I know the stage play too, but only on the internet. People need to understand that not everyone can afford and have the possibilities to go in America or even London and see the stage play. It's just not that possible to everyone. So we watch this movie and read the book in order to make an opinion, which I don't think it's wrong, but rather different than others which sadly offends a lot of people nowadays. Well the truth is, that every person is unique in this world, and we can't think alike (thank God! that would be boring).I consider it a very good musical, with lots of thrilling scenes, great acting, and well developed story. I find it really perfect. Sure it's another view of the story, but this is the magic. If every movie made the same version over and over again, how that could have been, huh? I think really dull.I like the performances, the acting, the story, the design, everything. It's a sad story but in the same time really beautiful and in a clever way showed.And something I really want to point out, is that people need to stop to make the snobbish mistake (or not?) in comparing a live stage musical with a movie. It's like comparing an apple with an orange. Both have different situation in order to capture the attention of the public and also have a way different set, and of course actors! The stage players are hard trained, talented sopranos that are obliged to not make a single mistake in order for the public to be satisfied, while the actors in a movie, as everyone knows have the chance to repeat the scene over and over again, until it meets the directors expectations, not to mention that (until now) they record their songs first, playing being the last chapter.So it's not the same situation, and it's just plain stupid discussing those aspects forever without reaching of course to any consent. Just enjoy what you see and if you don't, don't spoil the others joy by bringing the same idea over and over again. It's a message to all that think like this.Brilliant in it's own way, worth watching for sure!10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
250,lazarus_ca_48,Erratic and unoperatic,6,9 January 2005,"Forgive the pun, but director Joel Schumacher seems to have cobbled this film together.First, the good news. Miranda Richardson is a sparkling gem. Of all the characters, only she seems solid and real, sober and grounded. She brings a note of true elegance and class to the proceedings.A friend of mine says Gerard Butler looks too much like a GQ model. I must admit that, with his open shirt, I spent far more time looking at his hairy, hunky chest than his rugged, manly face. Yet he lacked the sensuality that the lyrics of ""Music of the Night"" would lead you to expect. The physical distance between the Phantom and Christine is one operatic convention that the film should have ignored.To its credit, the film tries to give the Phantom a back story, making him a freak suffering the cruelty and abuse of ""normal"" folk (rather like the Elephant Man). But the film fails to explain how the Phantom morphed from a ragged, dirty street urchin to a stylish, rakish gentleman. It also claims he is an architectural, artistic, and musical genius, but does not tell us how he discovered and developed his gifts. His deformity looks like a congenital birthmark or skin disease, and is enough to justify his self-loathing and feeling of rejection. But his mirror smashing unfortunately inspired another pop culture reference for me -- the Who's rock opera ""Tommy"". (Altogether too many such pop culture references occurred to me, suggesting that the film is somehow derivative and lacking in originality.) Emmy Rossum is a pretty little thing, but every time I looked at her, all I could think of was Anne Hathaway in ""The Princess Diaries"". Minnie Driver is way over the top as the prima donna diva, but at least they dubbed an operatic voice for her.Speaking of voices, the film is about an opera house, yet the lead singers' voices are anything but operatic. Gerard Butler's is more so than Emmy Rossum's, but both struck me as having far more of a pop flavor. Listening to Emmy Rossum, I was reminded of such Disney animated heroines as Ariel in ""The Little Mermaid"".The sound level seemed uneven -- at times too low to hear properly, at times too loud and jarring. The lush orchestration and sometimes thin, reedy voices made it hard for me to capture every note and nuance of the song score. Equally jolting was the echo used for the Phantom's offstage voice. If a musical should be anything, it should be audible and comprehensible. The film version of ""Phantom"" fails on both counts.The black-and-white sequences are a nice touch, but why give a retro look to scenes that take place at a later date than the color images? As for costumes and set design, the wardrobe is a tad garish and gaudy, the decor somewhat rococo. The crowd scenes are too busy, and the choreography in the ""Masquerade"" scene was frankly reminiscent of Madonna's ""Vogue"" video, fans and all. The dry-ice fog and candelabras emerging from the sewers of Paris worked about as well as they did in the stage musical, which is not at all. And the damn chandelier still plunged at an oblique angle, which defies gravity and common sense, and left me feeling just as cheated as I did in the live theater.In short, I wanted very much to like the film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", but I'm afraid all of its flaws didn't give me a ghost of a chance.",The Phantom of the Opera
251,hollywoodgirl-1,"Excellent Movie (p.s., I only tell the plot, there aren't any big spoilers)",10,21 January 2005,"Okay, before you skip my comment because of the spoilers, there really aren't any, I just tell the plotI saw the stage version of this show four years ago when it came to my hometown, and I fell in love with it. We bought the original cast soundtrack, and I listened to it over and over again prior to seeing this movie on Tuesday. I thought it was fairly faithful to the stage version, although my experience may have been clouded since I was only ten when I saw it. I had heard that the ending was changed, but I couldn't remember the original one anyway, so that was okay.The plot, for those who do not know, is this: The movie is set in the late 1800s in Paris's Opera Populaire, where the Phantom (Gerard Butler) is occupying the labyrinth-like basement and causing general mayhem for all those who are in the theater. When young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) is orphaned after her father dies, she is brought by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) to live and study ballet in the theater. However, she is harboring extraordinary vocal talent that all but the Phantom and Madame Giry fail to see. So the Phantom tutors Christine, always staying out of sight, but never out of mind. Flash forward several years and the theater has new managers and a star temperamental Italian diva, La Carlotta (Minnie Driver). When the Phantom pulls a trick that causes Carlotta to snap, she storms out, leaving the show without a star. Christine steps up, sings the song, and is recast in the lead. She is perfect, and everyone loves her, including her childhood sweetheart, the dashing Raoul (Patrick Wilson) who has resurfaced as a benefactor of sorts for the Opera Populaire. They meet again and fall in love again. There's just one problem: the Phantom has fallen madly in love with Christine and flies into a jealous rage when she appears to be in love with Raoul and not him. He kidnaps her and takes her down once more to his lair (she's already been once out of her own, however weak,free will). You see, the Phantom, being as sensual and raw and charismatic as he is, has a definite power over Christine, and she can't resist him when he sings with her. Will this come into play when she is forced to make a choice in the depths of the Opera Populaire...?I thought that this movie was excellent, and that all the actors did a wonderful job. Gerard Butler was great as the phantom, he was raw and emotional and charismatic and sensual. It was easy to see why Christine lost it around him. Sometimes his singing was a little harsher than it should have been, but he did a very competent job with it for only having had a few singing lessons and not being professionally trained. Emmy Rossum was amazing as Christine, she has a beautiful voice that was just right for the part. She gave a lot to Christine, playing out her weaknesses and eventual strength perfectly. She is a very good actress and role model, one of my favorites. After hearing Sarah Brightman and her, I prefer Emmy's voice, though Sarah Brightman is a very good singer. Patrick Wilson has a very good voice and did very well with such a limited character. The costumes were amazing and the sets were mind-blowing. I hope that this movie continues to get nominated for and receive awards. In conclusion, I loved this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
252,rrryoyorrr,It's Give & Take,8,4 December 2011,"It is not a perfect movie by far, but it's worth watching, never-the- less. The story could have been less pat, and could have taken more risks. Which makes me wonder, what were they afraid of? The visuals are beautiful, and that includes the Cast of Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, & Gerard Butler. Given these three beautiful people, it is easy to understand why we would want to sit through this movie, but when it comes to the singing, Gerard Butler is not on par with the rest of the cast. I do not blame Butler, since his singing could have easily been enhanced, dubbed, and even perfected with today's existing technology. Instead, they chose to go with a Joey Buttafuoco sounding, Phantom. Well, not that bad, I mean, most of the time he was just fine, it's just sometimes that he would sound like Buttafuoco, but that was enough to ruin any emotional investment one would have had in the movie at that moment. Another issue with the movie is the Makeup. I really don't see anyone receiving any noteworthy, awards for this work. It is not so much the actual application of the makeup, because the actors look good. The makeup on Emmy Rossum is breath-takingly, beautiful, when she sings, ""Think of Me"", but then again, she probably doesn't really need any makeup to look beautiful. However, it's the continuity of the makeup that throws people for a loop. The phantom's disfigurement (more like a rash) seems to appear less & less grotesque as the film progresses, and then appears grotesque again, and then less so again - it's a mess. Then there's Emmy Rossum, who miraculously changes from a fresh, faced innocent, to a sexy, eyeshadowed seductress, all within the same scene where she takes a ride on the gondola with the Phantom. Did she check her makeup on board? Not to be unkind to Emmy Rossum, if anything, she is the star, and the heart of this film. It is as if the universe all conspired to bring us this unique talent, for a brief moment, and we could all fall in love with her in the Phantom. Overall, the movie is absolutely worth watching, because Andrew Lloyd Webber, and his Lyricist (Charles Hart) are geniuses. The music & songs are beautifully, written and the Director did a great job bringing it from stage to screen.",The Phantom of the Opera
253,satterwh,Disappointing production based on great play,6,21 May 2005,"Phantom is one of my favorite plays of all time. The story and music are nothing less than breathtaking. As a result, I was thrilled when I heard it was going to be on the large screen. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed with the translation.I thought the time split between the Paris of 1907 and 1870 was unnecessary. It was established in the opening scene, and that was sufficient. I know they did it to lead up to the ending which was modified from the play ... but that was the part that I found most disappointing.I thought the ending from the play to be much more satisfying. To me, the play's ending kept the mystery alive; the ending in the film had the air of finality - if only because it was 30 years after the events in the film. It might work well for those who haven't seen Phantom on stage, but it simply didn't work for me. The mystery was over.I find this to be a common fault of plays that are translated to film. Those translating seem to think they need to make changes to the play - forgetting that the very reason they're making the film is that it's *ALREADY* a great story. No one takes a mediocre or bad play to make a film. More often than not, their changes take away from the story instead of adding to it.I gave Phantom (the film) a 6; Phantom (the play) is an easy 10++",The Phantom of the Opera
254,pandora8,"Lush, and wonderful",9,15 December 2004,"Phantom of the Opera is a gorgeous movie, which sometimes moves into over the top territory, but never unbearably so. It has its flaws, but none that it doesn't overcome. The dialog is forced in some places, but when it gives way to music it just washes over you and you can submerge yourself into the lavish dream of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Joel Schumacher. In order to enjoy this movie though you have to let it draw you in. If you stay on the outside it might look stagy, and even a little ridiculous.The cast is excellent, especially Gerard Butler who though far too good looking to play the Phantom gives him a dark, brooding melancholy. When his heart breaks yours does too. He is not Michael Crawford, and thankfully he isn't trying to be. His Phantom is rawer, and more seductive. Emmy Rossum is luminous, and though not exceptional she does convey the innocence, and sorrow of the character of Christine beautifully. Patrick Wilson's Raoul is the opposite of the Phantom, and creates a pleasing balance. He is earnest, and sweet, and his voice is heart-breakingly good.This movie is not perfect, but it is a wonderful escape, and you might find yourself leaving with tears in your eyes.",The Phantom of the Opera
255,briankistler,"Saw the Play in Madrid, Spain",9,15 March 2005,"The first time that I logged on to this site, to read the reviews of IMDb users, I was pretty disappointed at how harsh and dismissive a lot of the comments were. Many of them seemed to parrot the remarks of a lot of the professional critics (I frequently disagree with them). I found it interesting that, a month or so later, there were at least just as many glowing and positive remarks. I was delighted to read a lot of these latest commentaries, because I find myself in agreement with them.I saw the film version of the Phantom the night of Christmas Eve 2004. What a treat this was! I had seen the stage version, for the first time in my life, pretty close to one year earlier, when I was in Madrid, Spain. I had never even heard the music before December 2003. I felt that the movie was about at about 95% to being just as good as the play.It was a very, VERY POWERFUL, magical and cosmic night, when I saw the Phantom performed on a European stage. It sent shivers down my spine, when the chandelier was raised to the top of the stage, at the beginning of the play, accompanied by that overpowering, pulsating and beautiful music. I was especially overwhelmed by the steady, heavy beat of the drums that accented that music so nicely. The movie had the exact same effect on me. Both times I found myself reduced to tears.It was also very powerful, in both the play and the movie, when we hear the Phantom sing for the very first time, while he is back stage; especially the way his voice LOUDLY ECHOES in a HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WAY(which instills both horror and charm). In a way this special effect sort of reminds me of the same feeling that one gets when hearing a harpsichord play (a kind of Victorian or Gothic feel). Then, shortly after that, we see him for the very first time, in the flesh, with the leading lady. Talk about a dramatic entrance! (By this time the story has already been going on for quite some time; thank goodness there is still plenty of quality time left, with the delightful and terrifying phantom). Once the Phantom is no longer singing in an echoing voice, his voice is awesomely BEAUTIFUL. Again, I felt this way with both the play and the movie. His beautiful voice is a perfect metaphor for the fact that the Phantom was neither black nor white.....neither a total villain, nor totally sympathetic(though I did find myself rooting for him----even crying for him).For me, the only thing which prevents the movie from being 100% on the money with the play, was that some of the climactic action transpired a little more slowly, than on stage. This took away, a little, from the dramatic impact (but not terribly so). I admit to being a little bit biased. I had not been to Spain for 23 years, and had always wanted to go back (I was an exchange student there in 1981). I had endured a 14-15 hour whirlwind trip, in getting over to Spain (between flights and layovers). And after all that, that very same evening, despite my jet lag and a 7-hour time difference, I was seated in the Lope de Vega Theater, enjoying the Phantom. It all felt so magical; especially after a 23-year hiatus from that country. So I know that when I saw the movie, last Christmas, in a way it was kind of like revisiting Spain all over again!",The Phantom of the Opera
256,TinTin-6,The Mess of the Opera,3,12 January 2005,"First of all, I have to admit that I have never seen the actual play on stage before I saw the movie. Now, after seeing this mess, I don't even think I want to! No, I'm not a musical hater. Far from. I enjoyed Chicago, really loved Evita and as a kid, Annie was my favorite movie for many years. When I saw the trailer of Phantom I was intrigued. It looked really, really good. I couldn't wait to see it, although my friend was trying to convince me to see the stage show first. Visually, the film is stunning. Great sets, amazing costumes and an overall incredible production design. But then came the singing. I had the impression that none of the actors were actually singing themselves. And although many of them actually did, the whole thing looked like a bad, out of sync lipsinging contest! Was I the only one who noticed that?!?! I also missed the energy that many musical songs have. Apart from The Phantom of the Opera song, all other songs lacked spunk, were boring and just dragged on and on. Believe me, I was happy when the chandelier crashed, burning the whole opera house down...",The Phantom of the Opera
257,stellarbiz,My secret indulgence!,10,18 September 2005,"Having heard so much about the play and never having seen it, I didn't know what to expect. Living ""way out here"" in Wyoming limits availability of some of the ""lesser"" movies in our limited theatres. POTO didn't arrive in theatre until late and only for a limited run, so I wasn't even able to see it in the theatre. So when it came out on DVD, I rented it right away! WHOA!!! Remembering some of the lukewarm reviews of the movie, I was ... in a word... smitten with this movie! I bought the DVD the next day and keep it next to the player whenever I want to indulge. What a lush production, wonderful cast, and regardless of what criticisms have been thrown at it, POTO is worth every minute seeing it, feeling it, and loving it, over and over again! For me, it is my secret passion to watch it, with tissues in hand... for it never fails to evoke tears and bring back feelings of love. If it is ever re-released for the theatre again, I will be first in line to see it in it's full-effect... sights, sounds, passions!",The Phantom of the Opera
258,ObscureAuteur,Its all here! the wonders and the warts,8,8 January 2006,"There are few, if any, truer translations of a stage musical to the screen as genuine cinema. (As opposed to a filmed stage performance. e.g. Sweeny Todd, Into the Woods, Sunday in the Park with George, and In these instances I am grateful no movie version was attempted after the travesties of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and A Little Night Music, and that a faithful record of the original staging and casts has been preserved. This should be done far more often for the history alone.) No significant song cuts. (Unlike Chicago which, despite its virtues and awards, sacrifices considerable stage music in the name of its overdone movie concept of the ""Roxie-eye view"", the latest in a long and sorry list of past casualties, perhaps capped by ""Irma La Douce"" that used no music at all from the stage.) The musical numbers are all well done both musically and visually. Having seen it on stage in London I can say that they really got Phantom into cinema without qualification.Whatever problems this movie has are strictly problems that also existed in the stage version. And since the general public is not composed of musical drama scholars, I am surprised the movie did not fare better at the box office since it preserves the essence and the music of the show quite well. The problem must be that the screen presents the weaknesses of its stage production far better than the strengths.Perhaps the uncomfortable conglomeration of a classic horror story with lush romantic spectacle doesn't sell on the screen even if thousands bought it, and continue to buy it for far higher than movie ticket prices, at the theater.At the theater, the visual aspects like the chandelier at the heart of Hal Prince's stage concept, are highly effective being live and physically present. Compared to pure movie special effects of today, these things are comparatively tame on screen, leaving everything else more exposed for better or worse. (No one says ""Wow, did they really do that!"" at the movies anymore.) At the theater I noticed many (mostly women) crying at the end apparently in sympathy for the Phantom letting Christine go (and not hanging Raoul for his third on stage murder). This amazed me since the audience had witnessed this same Phantom murder at least two innocent people in front of their very eyes. So who cares if he gets the girl or not? Lucky girl to escape! Given the content of some hugely successful chick flicks gone by this should not be an obstacle to success for this movie.The score is probably at least Lloyd-Webber's second or third best with no shortage of potential hit songs. (If you want to see a Lloyd-Webber mega-hit with a genuinely weak score propping up one hit song, try ""Cats""!) My favorite technical quibble is the number ""Think of Me"". Phantom, like Sondheim's ""Follies"", invites a clear distinction of musical style between its book/character numbers and (opera) pastiche numbers. Sondheim utilizes this consistently and brilliantly. Webber has less integrity and will insert anything he thinks might sell anywhere at the expense of any dramatic or musical principle, pandering to the audience. ""Think of Me"" is a perfect example of a straight Webber pop song (like ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"" in JC Superstar), appropriate here, if at all, as a book number in the plot or character development. Instead it is used as an opera audition song which should be in an operatic style like the other opera segments. He lamely attempts to fix this with a short cadenza tacked on at the end that only highlights the flaw. If Lord Lloyd-Webber is still wondering why he does not get the respect that Sondheim gets (especially that he can no longer use the ""I am younger that Sondheim was when ""Company"" premiered"" defense) this is one of many reasons why.I also puzzled over ""All I Ask of You"" a bit. One lifetime is all anyone gets, thus all that is asked for is everything(!) in a phrase that suggests a mere trifle is requested. It can be a big problem trying to be Rodgers without a Hart, Hammerstein or even a Tim Rice.",The Phantom of the Opera
259,nixxnutz,Best stage-to-screen adaptation I've ever seen,10,30 January 2005,"I am a 70-year-old woman, and I have loved musicals all my life. I've been familiar with the Phantom story since seeing the Claude Rains version in the '40s. I saw Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom"" onstage in Phoenix (not the original cast). I've had the original cast album since it first came out. This movie is the first screen adaptation of a stage musical I can remember in which no songs were left out, no plot was changed, and no locale was moved because somebody thought movie audiences wouldn't ""get"" the original, or because it was too long, or some other insulting reason. It shows what magic can be made when an artist insists on controlling the reincarnation of his work. I liked it better than the stage show because everything was bigger and opened up. There were touches of humor, badly needed. The ""Masquerade"" scene was brilliant, and the Phantom himself was mesmerizing. The whole spectacle (and there's nothing wrong with spectacle, despite what the critics seem to think) was incredibly romantic and thrilling, the way many movies used to be and very few are now.This is not the sixth or seventh film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera."" This is ""Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera,"" a totally different and superior animal.",The Phantom of the Opera
260,DeathFish,The Phantom of the Opera makes your soul cry!,8,20 May 2006,"This is in my opinion an underrated movie, it should maybe be 0.5-0-7 higher in average. Because it is indeed a great movie completed with amazing song and music. Joel Schumacher makes the famous story about the master and the servant shine on the screen, and the actors give you a brilliant performance you wont forget for many years to come. The symbolism and metaphors feed your mind with many mysteries and keep your thoughts on the movie all day long. Due to the fantastic music it is also a movie anyone can watch over and over again, finding new meanings every time. It is a very sad movie and for those who like it there will never be a single dry eye while watching this one, especially not in the ending, where even the toughest guys gets challenged. However I can imagine that this is a type of movie that some people don't really understand or appreciate because of the constant singing and complicated metaphorical scenes. And therefore I am pretty sure that some people wont like this one, but those who like movies like this will love it.",The Phantom of the Opera
261,thomas998,"Not too bad, unless you've seen the stage version.",9,16 August 2005,"If you like musicals then this one isn't half bad.... that's the upside. The downside is that if you've seen the stage version (even a touring version) then you will be disappointed in the signing. The Phantom's signing is iffy at best. Christine's is actually pretty good. The real stinkers are the other roles. You get the feeling that the producers didn't have any faith in the actual movie and wanted to get named actors to get some buzz (not a bad idea, except they seemed to forget that the movie was a musical and the actors were expected to sign). So you get to hear Miranda Richardson try to sing (not good)... And you get to see Minnie Driver act like she is signing (they use someone else's voice which is rather odd seeing that her character isn't suppose to be as good as Christine - it makes you wonder just how bad a signing voice she had). Another clue the producers were just looking for names to get buzz is the choice of two Brits in roles of a French and Italian... I'm sorry but Minnie Driver does a terrible impersonation of an Italian I have ever seen. It brought back memories of Ted Danson in black face.Overall the visuals are pretty good, maybe a little over done in the sewers. The main fault is the signing is marginal, and the score still has the schmaltzy euro-disco feel in a few places.... Something one would have hoped would be left out. The best you could hope for is that someday someone will dub the movie version with the Michael Crawford soundtrack... Until that time, your better off waiting for the touring stage version.",The Phantom of the Opera
262,Nephalim,Joel Schumacher butchering a beloved classic? Are we surprised?,2,3 May 2005,"I have no idea why anyone thinks that Joel Schumacher is a passable director. His efforts to establish himself in many genres has repeatedly failed. The only films he doesn't manage to run through the slaughterhouse are saved only because they ride on something other than direction, IE Cate Blanchett in Veronica Guerin, and the John Grisham source for A Time to Kill. The only films that he's involved in that don't completely fail as films are the ones that require the director to be a virtual nonentity.The Phantom of the Opera is not an example of one of these movies. If you took stills of the scenes and made a storybook, then maybe it wouldn't be a waste of time. But otherwise, everything here fails miserably. Emmy Rossum's soulless performance juxtaposed against Minnie Driver's (in hands-down the worst performance of her life) ridiculous overacting render both characters completely unbelievable. Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson, who have both done extremely well in other pictures, fall flat here, as if they think their characters are so well-known that they don't really have to actually act, and the audience will just get it from notoriety. The only redemption on the acting spectrum is Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, who, naturally, gets the smallest amount of screen time of all the second tier characters.The Phantom's scars look like little more than an intense sunburn - barely worth putting a mask over. That this was done because people wouldn't believe Christine's attraction to a disfigured man (so I hear) only amplifies what a shallow blunder this was.If the film had sacrificed acting for good singing voices, then maybe I could understand, but that can't be the case, because all the leads just aren't good. I've seen high school productions of the Phantom do better.",The Phantom of the Opera
263,robertrosado,Absolutely mesmerizing.,10,1 January 2005,"When I was eight years old, my family and I took a train into New York City, and saw an evening performance of a Broadway musical. It was my first time seeing a show, and you could not have found a boy who was as excited as I was. Since then, that particular show has gone on to be one of my favorites of all time. As I got a little bit older, and more interested in the art of cinema, I said to myself: ""What a movie it would make."" Almost ten years later, the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" hits theaters. And it did, indeed, make quite a movie.The setting is Paris, France. The time is the late 1800s. Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) is a gifted, young singer who is given the lead role in a opera when the current lead, La Carlotta (Minnie Driver) walks out of rehearsal, due to alleged ""technical difficulties"". Daae is a revelation, and is soon stalked by a strange figure, known only as the Opera Ghost. Is this the angel that her late father promised he would send to her? Or is it a madman, bent on using Christine's talent to his advantage? Gerard Butler (""Dracula 2000"") is fantastic in the title role. Going in, I was anxious to see how a non-singer would fare in handling one of the more difficult male parts of musical theatre. I was very pleasantly surprised. What he lacks in vocal experience, he more than makes up in passion. Butler's Phantom is alternatively heartbreaking and threatening, as well as deeply sexual and mesmerizing. He is a tortured character that one feels sympathy for by the end. Emmy Rossum (""The Day After Tomorrow"") is a stunning newcomer, with a lot to offer. With her performance as Christine Daae, Rossum combines her angelic voice with her soft features and impressive acting skills. Neither Butler nor Rossum are as accomplished as Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman, their stage predecessors. However, they display far more passion than I have ever heard from either British stage star.Christine's lover, Raoul, has the potential to come off as flat, but Patrick Wilson (TV's ""Angels in America"") does what he can with a sketchily written part. Nevertheless, Wilson continues to impress me. He is a smooth tenor, and his performance in HBO's 'Angels in America' deserved an Emmy (you know what I mean). Miranda Richardson is solid as Madame Giry, the woman who may know a thing or two about the mysterious opera ghost. Ciaran Hinds (""Calendar Girls"") and Simon Callow (""No Man's Land"") are hilarious as the clueless buffoons who run the theatre. Finally, Minnie Driver (""Good Will Hunting"") all but steals the show as Carlotta Guidileci, the opera diva who is constantly vying for attention.Andrew Lloyd Webber has written many quality musicals before, namely ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"", ""Evita"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", ""and ""Cats"". Webber's work on ""Phantom"" is his best. Standouts numbers include ""Think of Me"", ""All I Ask of You"", ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", ""Music of the Night"", and the exhilarating title song. The production design, courtesy of Anthony Pratt, is among the finest I have ever seen. Every detail, from the candelabras in the Phantom's lair, to the gargoyle that sits atop the opera house, to the misty cemetery, breathes imagination. Credit must also be given to cinematographer John Mathieson, whose colors are practically tangible. On stage, the musical tends to drag a bit in certain spots, but Terry Rawlings's fluid editing keeps the pace surprisingly fast, even during the ballads.Despite his constant critical bashing, I have usually enjoyed Joel Schumacher's work. His work in ""Tigerland"" ""8MM"", ""Veronica Guerin"", and ""The Lost Boys"" suggested a filmmaker with a sharp visual style and a sensitive touch with actors. Speaking of which, though I am in the minority, I must say that ""Batman Forever"" is my favorite of the Batman films. Just don't even get me started on ""Batman & Robin"". Certain sequences are borderline brilliant, and some images are unforgettable. Consider the scenes in which the Phantom first lures Christine through the mirror and into his subterranean home, the masquerade ball, and Christine's visit to her father's grave. The first ten minutes are astounding. It is set after the events in the film, and is shot in the style of the silent era. Suddenly, the opera house magically goes back in time, to reveal its original glory. I don't know who came up with that idea, but it has the power to raise goosebumps.At the end of the day, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a lavish, old-fashioned musical. The emotions felt are not necessarily subtle, but they register perfectly. The climax and epilogue were especially moving. The final confrontation between The Phantom, Christine, and Raoul packs as much potency as most independent dramas. The stage show was spectacular and all, but I never felt much for the characters, even on the original London cast recording. This was no fault of Webber's, as his show is as good as anyone could have possibly asked. Maybe it was the actors that I saw at that particular performance. Doesn't matter. Schumacher's vision of this popular piece is definitely sufficient enough to solidify its place in musical theatre history. I know this is extremely corny (and I'll probably end up taking it out, anyway), but this film is phantastic. Who knew that a music box and a rose can induce tears from a person who has seen the show, and listened to the CD for ten years? Certainly not I",The Phantom of the Opera
264,lual,For fans of the musical only,6,23 August 2008,"Roger Ebert said of Andrew Lloyd Webber: ""Whenever he finds one good tune, he starts rehearsing."" Now, that may be a little harsh and exaggerated, but Ebert does have a point here. Webber tends to overuse sequences of particular songs and especially so in ""The Phantom of the Opera"".I think there is certainly more than one good song in ""Phantom"", but most of the good songs are in the first half. After ""Masquerade"", which on stage opens the second act and is played after a little over half the movie is over, there are only 2 or three really original songs following (which are all weaker songs of the musical), the rest is just patchwork from other songs and sequences. You can't call this ""Leitmotiv"" either, because Webber uses theses tunes almost randomly. Really, it gets rather boring after a while.The second half is a big problem in the production anyway. The story basically falls apart. Everything repeats itself, the focus is lost and basically, it doesn't make sense either.Many people say that the problem is the Phantom, which is not really scary in Webber's piece. I think the problem lies rather in the character of Christine. Her relationship with the ""Angel of Music"" is naive and she comes across as rather bland and dumb. Also, while she is fascinated by the Phantom, she is never at all in love with him. From the beginning she falls for Raoul for motives which are also rather flat. We can never really believe that she loves Raoul (who is a boring character anyway and while Patrick Wilson plays him well, his hairdo in the movie really only underlines the impression of the spoiled vain brat that we have perceived from the get-go). So, there is no believable love-story to Raoul and no love for the Phantom either. Therefore, while Christine seems nice to the viewer, we never really get involved with her emotionally. The ""love"" the Phantom feels for Christine at times rather comes across as desire but still, it is the most believable emotion in the piece. All of these are problems of the source material. But since Joel Schumacher has adapted the musical almost slavishly faithfully they need to be addressed.The actors all do a good job, some of them even outstanding. Emmy Rossum's singing is incredible and Minnie Driver, Simon Callow and Chiaran Hinds add a much needed comic relief. In fact, it is these three latter characters who make the movie bearable. While the movie does look good it still looks far too serious. This heavy-handedness pulls the movie down quite a lot. Its OK that most of the movie looks fake or stagy but it is also filmed in way as if this musical were high art. I am sure that even die-hard fans of ""PotO"" will agree that while it is nice entertainment, it is nothing more than entertainment. A little more lightness, maybe even a hint of irony would really have helped here. But so, we only have Driver, Callow and Hinds to tell us that it actually is OK to laugh sometimes.What really doesn't work are the scenes set in 1919. Apart from the opening and possibly the ending they really don't serve any point at all other than giving us a break from the singing. While that is a noble effort, a little dialog should have been included instead of just having to look at a tired old man for roughly a minute. Also, the rose in the last scene is really distracting. During the entire movie, Schumacher has been trying to make the Phantom human and real (which the stage production never does) and suddenly we are supposed to believe that this character is immortal? BIG mistake here.You probably wouldn't guess it from this review, but I do kind of like the movie. I like looking at it, I like the actors, I enjoy many of the songs. But there is not a single moment in this movie where one is not aware of its weaknesses. We are never really pulled in. We stand by watching, listening and maybe enjoying it, but at no time do we feel like we are part of the action.Fans of the stage production will probably love this movie and I am happy for them (except for those who keep crying that they want Michael Crawford back who hasn't played the role for about 20 years). But I don't think it is for anyone else. There are musicals which I consider to be watchable for people who do not like musicals. THIS movie is definitely NOT one of them.",The Phantom of the Opera
265,bobilene,"Phenomenal, Gorgeous, Fantastic, Need I say anymore?",10,11 July 2005,"Having seen the Stage adaptation and loving it, I couldn't wait to see the movie. Well, when finally my wife and I had time for the movies, it was no longer showing. Like it came and went in a flash. I thought, wow must have been a real stinker, guess the critics were right. Loving the music, I figured why not check out the video. What a surprise, we both loved it. The sets were great, the acting was fine and of cause the music was as lovely as ever.Anyone who's seen the stage production will love this version. I could never quite understand the relationship between Christine and the Phantom but now, all the pieces were put in place.I was especially surprised by the performance of the Phantom. He starts off kind of slow but then grows on you.

266,Jvbway,Under Rated,8,19 January 2006,"The film version what has recently become the longest running show in Broadway history was roundly dismissed by critics and did not thrive at the box office. But on the whole, this film was an under rated achievement and a very satisfying film.true it was not flawless. The Phantom's lair was not as mysterious and haunting as it was on stage. And then there was the use of the flashbacks. The opening scene, used in the stage version, was well done, it was a good idea to do it in black and white and then see the theater come back to life in color, and the final scene with Raoul as an old man at the cemetery was a nice touch, but the flash back scene'd interspersed throughout the film were over kill.Then there was Gerard Butler in the title role. Most of Butler's performance was excellent, he has a very expressive, compelling face, so it is almost heartbreaking when Christine pulls off his mask to reveal his deformation. But Butler's singing is not strong. His husky voice might have worked in another role, but he simply let his ballad's down. I think it was not a bad idea to use young, mostly unknown actors in the three leads, but it might have been beneficial to find ones who were strong singers.That being said, Patrick Wilson does sing strongly as Raoul, and brings the charisma he carries on stage fairly seamlessly to the screen. Emmy Rossum is lovely as Christine, and it is interesting to hear the change her voice goes through as the film goes on. The entire supporting cast is faultless. Minnie Driver is a riot as opera diva Carlotta, if not a bit on the . broad side, and Miranda Richardson, although overqualified and underused, is excellent as the motherly madame giry.What Joels Schumacher also succeeded in doing was keeping the look of the film similar to that of the stage production, but translating it so it works on film, so it is still a different experience than seeing the stage version. While few had anything good to say about this film when it was in the theaters, after the disappointing film versions of ""Rent"" and ""The Producers"", this film deserves a better reputation",The Phantom of the Opera

268,FilmWeekUK,Excellent movie of a poor rock-opera,8,15 May 2005,"Phantom of the Opera is typical of the latter output of Andrew Lloyd Webber - lazy and derivative, with a single melody being repeated over and over and over again to the point that you're climbing the walls desperate for the continual repetition to stop. I loved ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" but with ""Evita"" the usual Lloyd-Webber formula started to set in: repeating the song melody for each ""new"" track and merely change the lyrics, the tempo or the sex of the singer to disguise the fact you couldn't be bothered to write more than one or two tunes for your latest rock opera album. The rot started to set in with ""Evita"" but with ""Phantom of the Opera"" the formula is taken to its most ridiculous extremes. One song and a strong repeated riff does not a musical make!I saw the stage show some years ago and thought it was one of the most miserable theatrical experiences of my life - little to no plot and that wretched song sung over and over and over for the best part of three hours. Lots of dry ice and an over-the-top crashing chandelier gimmick do not make for a fantastic evening's entertainment. 'Dumbed down for the masses' is far too kind an expression for this sort of tosh, and yet audiences who've ignored far better musical work seemed to lap it up. I just didn't get it! So I approached this DVD expecting very little.What a surprise! With lots of dialogue and new music the 'single song' of the original work is nowhere near such an obvious flaw in the original work. The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction flawless, the sound amazing, and the acting excellent. OK, so it IS rather ludicrous that the so-called 'disfigured' phantom of the opera is so sexy and obviously good looking, and also that as the main character his singing voice is by far the weakest here. But that's a minor quibble - this is a major motion picture of a musical after all. The film is a stunning visual treat and on DVD the crystal-clear picture and DTS surround sound show the medium off to great effect.What I expected to be a chore (watching this on DVD) turned out to be a treat. I'm surprised the critics were so Luke-warm about it.8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
269,mezaco,"Enjoyable, Fun..........don't let the bad reviews put you off...",9,31 December 2004,"After reading some terrible critic's reviews of this film, I went in with a lot of trepidation. I was expecting something horrific....But I was very pleasantly surprised. This film version of the Phantom is a very entertaining, energetic and faithful adaptation.The Pros: The set direction and costumes are an absolute feast for the eyes, and an Oscar in those categories would be deserving. Emmy Rossum is a beautiful Christine with a stunning voice. Also, watch out for the underrated Miranda Richardson in a wonderful supporting role and Patrick Wilson makes Raoul a much more heroic and manly character than on stage. All in all, it's extremely loyal to the musical, but with the bonus of being able to add special effects that cannot be seen on stage. The Cons: I do have a few criticisms. There are some lip-synching problems, especially early on, that are annoying. And there are some cheesing lighting and set issues. There's too much ""soft-glow"" lighting during romantic Christine moments and some of the underground scenes were too brightly lit and not ""spooky"" enough. Finally, the biggest criticism I have is the casting of the Phantom. Kudos to Gerard Butler for doing a job well done, but I'm still not sure if this role is suited to a suave, handsome young ""hunk"" like him. To sum up, some reviews of this film have been very unfair. It may not be Citizen Kane, but The Phantom is an exciting, enjoyable, musically uplifting way to spend a couple of hours.

270,zachlen48,The Worst,1,26 December 2004,"This has to be one of the worst conceived musicals ever.there is no blame here to the performers. All the blame for this fiasco is in the hands of the director , Joel Schumacher. He hasn't a clue as to how to structure a scene to find its meaning. Its all so over done that nothing moves you as it goes on and on and on. It is clear that the man has no soul which is something I have thought from his first film.The opening looks like MOULIN ROUGE, then it switches to grainy black and white which looks like out takes from ELEPHANT MAN.Then later on he has a flash back to the early years of the phantom which becomes almost laughable in its depiction of the boy as John Merrick. How this director continues to get funds to make films is a mystery. He should go back to decorating windows at Henri Bendel's in NYC, where he started. Every person in this film might as well been a mannequin.this film has no heart, soul or substance.a bigger waste of 90 million dollars there has never been.i wanted so much to like this but it fails miserably this might be the death of future musicals.where is Ken Russell when you need him.",The Phantom of the Opera
271,ACMcC24,I'll be seeing this again....soon.,10,24 January 2005,"*Possible Spoilers*For those of you who know the story (whether it's book or musical), I'll save you the hassle of reading the plot, most should know it by now. The first thing that comes to mind with this adaptation is absolutely stunning. The props, costumes, makeup, even the theatre itself was perfect in my opinion. Once you've got those out of the way, that leaves the characters and adapting the music to film.Frankly, for me, there were a few key scenes in the musical, that if the movie could pull off, would win me over. The first was the opening...all of it. For those of you who've seen the musical during it's 20 yrs(?) run, you know how grandly it opens. The chandelier lights up, raises off the ground over the audience and remains there for awhile, while Carlotta comes in with her booming voice during rehearsal. The movie IMHO, not only nailed these scene, but excelled in them and set a standard for the rest of the film. Carlotta (Minnie Driver) naturally had to be dubbed given there probably isn't anyone in Hollywood with a set of lungs like hers. I thank the creators for getting a voice who sounds like Driver's, so that you can't really know the difference. As for Driver's performance, you couldn't ask for a better spoiled, uptight, self righteous performance for her character.As for the stars of the film, the only one I wasn't happy with was Raoul (Patrick Wilson), who's introduction seemed more of a formality and wasn't all that impressive. Although his voice was beautiful, in tune and hit the high notes perfectly, it also seemed more set on being beautiful than being emotional, like his acting. Christine (Emmy Rossum) was quite the opposite. Rossum portrayed the character - and her voice - the way Christine should have been portrayed: young, slightly raw, naive, passionate. This leaves the Phantom (Gerard Butler) who, if cast incorrectly, would ruin the film. Butler, though slightly young for the roll, I couldn't praise enough and - with Rossum - truly made the film. I've heard criticism that his voice was to raw for the roll, yet the Phantom was never suppose to have a great voice, just a decent voice made great by the passionate way he sung. Butler had this passion and more important, a spark between him and Rossum that just wasn't there between Rossum and Wilson. This brings me to the other key scene that, if done incorrectly, would be a major black mark - The Music of the Night. A song more intoxicating and passionate than the rest of the musical combined, that if the connection wasn't right b/t Rossum and Butler, would seem flat and simply dead, along with the rest of the film. This, I am thankful, was not the case. Since words will fail me with this song, I will leave it to the audience to judge on their own.You can expect the first half of the film to honor the musical while taking a few scenes from the book, though every so often the performances seem out of place with the situations. The second half takes a detour by rearranging or deleting some scenes, though I would assume it to be for the sake of keeping to the pace of the film. The biggest detour though is the chandelier dropping towards the end of the movie instead of in the middle, as in the musical. This though, plays into the situation perfectly, and was as grand of an exit for the chandelier as was it's entrance. This leaves the ending that for the overly sentimental (me), Butler's performance will leave tears in your eyes. My only regret is that once this comes to DVD, surround sound will be gone, which can only take away from the film. Overall, I give this a 9/10",The Phantom of the Opera
272,BeckyKmovieluver,outstanding,10,2 April 2005,"I mist admit that when I first went to see Phantom of the Opera in Janueary 2005 at the cinema I had never seen the stage version before or any of the other many film versions of it, I had never even heard the soundtrack. I had friends who had been to see the film and they had recommended it so I went with rather high expectations. Some might say that my expectations were so high it was rather risky as I could easily have come out disappointed. Yet I have to say that the film far exceeded my expectations. The acting is superb and the voices of the stars are classic and haunting. I would even go so far as to say that Gerald Butler is the Phantontom of the Opera. The story is horrifying, but at the same time is also heart warming and romantic. Andrew Lloyd Webber has really managed to get into the head of the characters from Gaston Leroux's book and has created a masterpiece. The sets are beautiful creating 2 hours of complete suspense and total delight. The film captures all the charm of the period but still offers a more contemporary look which should appeal to more younger viewers. All I can say is that it's a grave pity that it didn't win any of the awards it was up for recently and by no means should this be considered to be a reflection on the quality of the film. I for one cant wait for the DVD to come out and will be th orally proud to have a copy of this masterpiece that I can call my own.",The Phantom of the Opera
273,pigletgirlkp,The beauty of the stage,10,7 June 2005,I never thought that the beauty of the stage could be put on film so well. Joel Schumacher took the play by Andrew Lloyd Webber to new heights with the amazing locations and scenery. The acting and dancing are nothing less then a 10. Emmy Rossum is the perfect Christine with the voice of the angel she plays. The performances given by Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson make it hard for you to choose who you want to win Christine's heart. For those of you who have never seen the play this is truly up to the comparison. Make sure you are with people who don't mind you singing along. The songs will enchant you. Phantom will captivate you and in the end you will either fall in love with or feel pity for the Phantom.,The Phantom of the Opera
274,manicmeuk,"love it or hate it, just don't rip it apart!",8,18 December 2004,"i think that a lot of people are not giving this movie credit where it is due. i am a HUGE fan of musicals and music in general, i have seen the original stage version and was completely mesmerised by it, yet i find that there are some people who cannot appreciate that not everyone has experienced music in that setting. the simple fact is, i took my brother (a 21 year old who listens to hardcore dance music) along to see the movie, and he was very dubious as to whether he was going to enjoy it or not, but throughout the movie he was intent and listening. not only that, but the cinema was PACKED with young people in my own age group (18) and all other generations too. i think it is sad to pick fault in something that has got this generation interested in music at is best. i agree that the music was 'funked'up, the voices considerably weak compared to the stage performers but i don't feel that the movie ever set out to better its original. not everyone has the privilege to go see such shows live, or have never had the inclination to fork out £30 when they can spend it on other things, but when leaving there were people of all ages saying how they wanted to see the stage version. how can this be a bad thing? i agree that the film, having seen the original stage version, was somewhat lacking in impact, but its a film for pete sake, its never going to recreate the atmosphere of live performance. i think that casting Gerald Butler as the phantom was an incredibly wise move, he held a lot of charisma and mystery and in my opinion portrayed a character rather well (whether it was in keeping with the original character is irrelevant)yes the character had been 'sexed up' but it would not have appealed to a mainstream audience if people could not get interested in the characters. at the end of the day, this is a film, made for a mainstream audience, and in my opinion, if it can get people of my generation off the couch and into theatre seats, listening to music as it should be, it cannot be a bad thing!",The Phantom of the Opera
275,artwk,A ten-ton turkey,1,21 February 2007,"First, let me say that I enjoyed Superstar and Evita, on stage and on screen, so I expected ""Phantom"" to be good. With a spectacularly talented composer and an apparently unlimited budget, what could go wrong? The sets and costumes are magnificent, the photography first-class, and at least some of the cast, such as Miranda Richardson and Simon Callow, are always worth watching. Moreover, several of the songs are excellent, and memorable. Unfortunately, I was put in mind of the adage ""Never mind the quality, feel the width"". The dialogue in the recitatives is uninspired, and the melodies dull, the quartets/quintets/ umpteen-ets are messy and incomprehensible, like Sondheim at his worst unless one has the DVD subtitles on, whereas the patter duets sound like bad imitations of ""My Fair Lady"". The solo singing is variable  The Phantom is good when volume is not required, but when it is, he sounds like a fishmonger yelling. Carlotta's singing is bearable, but her screeching dialogue is painful. The ""operas"" being staged are clearly intended to be mediocre, but instead are excruciatingly bad. The photography is marred by the currently fashionable chopping-up into 2-second cuts. The Phantom's disfigurement, supposedly the basis of the entire plot, is hardly worse than the effect of a bar-room brawl, and becomes progressively less pronounced until it appears no more than a serious case of sunburn. The silly plot, acceptable in its original Grand Guignol setting, is blown out to utter absurdity. Self-exiled to the opera house, the Phantom has nonetheless mastered a series of difficult crafts without assistance  he is even a competent swordsman! Cut to about 90 minutes, the film might have been bearable. At 135 minutes, it seems to go on forever. I was thankful that I hadn't wasted money to see the stage show.",The Phantom of the Opera
276,MartinK75,"Very faithful, very watchable adaptation",8,11 May 2005,"Adaptations don't come much more literal than this, but if your source material is the most successful musical ever, it's not a bad place to start. The film was criticised for being too ""stagey"" but then again it is mainly set within an opera house! Director Schumacher does what he can to open the film out and make it as cinematic as possible but he's largely constrained by the template of the original show. That said, the film is visually spectacular, cinematography, production design and costumes all top notch. I feel that Gerard Butler has come in for a lot of unfair criticism for his performance as the Phantom. I think he has a decent singing voice and that his performance in general was fine. My only criticism would be that he is too young and good-looking for the role. Antonio Banderas or Michael Crawford would have been better in this regard but if Crawford had been cast, an older Christine would have been needed given the age gap between Crawford and the teenage Emmy Rossum. Lloyd Webber and Schumacher clearly decided to go with youth in the casting of the three principals. I thought Rossum was perfect as Christine both in looks and voice. Patrick Wilson was okay as Raoul but lacked charisma. He's a pleasant enough singer but I prefer Steve Barton's voice as Raoul in the original London cast recording. The musical numbers are well executed although some of them such as Masquerade and Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again drag on for longer than they should. Also, the drums and electric guitars used on the title track sound jarring and out of place compared with the classically-arranged other songs and the late 19th century setting of the film. Needless to say non-fans of Lloyd Webber/Phantom should avoid the movie at all costs but fans should find plenty to enjoy here.",The Phantom of the Opera

I didn't really care for the movie, but please allow me to elaborate on this before you consider me one of the people who ""trash"" this film... 1. the guy who plays the Phantom just doesn't do it for me. He just doesn't sing the part with the passion I would have expected from such a tragic part. 2. the ""artistic license"" that was taken with a few of the plot points here were a little insulting but I realize that to make it to American cinema, that must have been ""needed"". I would have been able to overlook this if it hadn't been for the vocal ""weak link"" though (the Phantom). 3. Last but not least: the Phantom is a very tragic figure. Or should I say ""is supposed to be""? This film paints him out to be more of a ""handsome stranger"" which is definitely not the way it should be. I didn't make it all the way through to the end of the film. I made it about 10% of the way through the song, ""The Point of No Return"" and I thought that the passion was misdirected here completely. The direction for this film (and the part of the Phantom, the CENTRAL character!!!) was flawed. I couldn't take it anymore. I know this is a very, very sad story but I just couldn't watch it feeling the way I did about the CENTRAL character's voice in this. So please, if you haven't seen the play, check out the film. But please, if you see the film and you like it - SEE THE PLAY.That said, I was very impressed with the way this film was done, all in all. I thought all of the other singers were wonderful in this too. The woman who played Christine really amazed me. Would I recommend this? No, definitely not. Would I tell someone who I know hasn't seen the musical that they shouldn't see this? Definitely not. I WOULD, however, recommend the musical.

And trust me I love Broadway.Now since I am a singer you would expect me to be a little be a bit critical, but what I watched that night in the cinema I was blown away! That Emmy Rossum sung so beautifully as Christine and she's only nineteen, a year younger than me! Now I have heard that the theatre version was ten times better, now recently I was going through my parents' CD collection and I found the original cast recording of ""Phantom of the Opera"" on double CD and I listened to the two CDs and once again I was blown away, so in comparison, honestly I didn't have a problem with the two versions, both were equal in brilliance.And thank God they didn't give the role of Christine to Anne Hathaway because I would of tried to prevent myself from laughing!Gerard Butler? Wasn't he that guy who sucked us girls in for ""Dracula 2000""? Yep it was, he played the Phantom, but I was shocked when I found out he could actually sing! (Or at least I believed he sang) No wonder Mr Schumacher wanted to meet him after ""Dracula 2000"". Good cast there and may I say Emmy Rossum is one lucky actress cause she got to kiss him in the film! If I ever met her in real life I would say to her ""Good on ya! I would of loved to be in your shoes!""Mr Schumacher did a good job bringing this famous musical to the silver screen and Sir Webber should be proud, what was it? The 7000th performance?

Like everyone else I saw the show with that night, I was blown away. Everything about it was amazing. When we heard that they were turning The Phantom into a movie, we were so psyched. Flash forward to a month ago when we all saw the movie (with some of our friends tagging along). Let me just say the film was wonderful. They kept almost every song, and only changed a couple of things (they changed the timing of when the chandelier falls). I thought that the film was perfect... until the Phantom began to sing. Something about his voice bothered me. I think that his voice was way to deep for the phantom, and frankly his voice wasn't that good at all. He was also too angry. I look at the Phantom as a misunderstood man, but he portrayed the Phantom as an angry man who wanted revenge on the world... I don't know, maybe he's supposed to be that way. Other then that, the film was wonderful. Emmy Rossum as Christine was excellent, as well as Patrick Wilson was as Raoul. I give it a 9 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
282,LadyBeth10,"Stunning!!! Magnificent!!! Powerful!!! Beautiful, Sexy, and Tragically Heartbreaking",10,8 February 2005,"I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie. I've never seen the stage play. I lived in L.A. for about 17 years, attended acting school, and performed in some musicals before, but was never that crazy about seeing them, so I really didn't know what to expect. I thought ""Chicago"" was okay. I went to see it on a whim. But when that chandelier went up and the sweeping transformation happened to the opera house from black and white dusty ruin to a lush landscape of red velvet and gold ornate statues to the equal sweep of that unimaginably beautiful music, I literally forgot to breathe. Every time I see it I still get goosebumps. You feel that you've just been magically transported to another world. I loved every frame, every note, every performance from the very beginning to the very end. The critics must be crazy. This movie should be up for every award ever made!! I can't stop watching it. I've seen it ten times already and can't wait for the next time. It's definitely now in my top ten of all time. Joel Schumacher, and Andrew Lloyd Webber have created a MASTERPIECE!!!What can I say about the performances that hasn't been said, they were superb. Emmy Rossum was innocent, beautiful, and angelic with a voice to match. Patrick Wilson was perfect as Raoul; handsome, and with a voice as smooth as silk. However, I can't say enough about Gerard Butler. His emotional range is absolutely stunning. Not since Richard Burton or Larry Olivier in Richard III have I seen an actor who can encompass so many different levels on the turn of a dime: Murderous rage; intense sexuality and longing; incredible vulnerability. I can't believe the comments I've seen on his singing. His voice was beautiful, sensuous, and the amazing thing was his singing matched every emotion he was feeling from highest to lowest. In the beginning we see a very confident, strong, domineering individual partial to strangling people when cornered, (not the most sympathetic of individuals,) who nevertheless shows a sensitivity and sweetness despite all of his extremely fatal faults; that is, in the more than competent hands of Gerard Butler. His performance is so beautifully and deftly drawn that gradually by the end of the film we see what's been behind the mask all along: He's just a lost little boy who never grew up. I also have to comment on the ""Point of No Return"" number. That has got to be the sexiest scene I've EVER seen. And neither of them lost a stitch of clothing. Well, accept maybe a cape and a mask. But I digress. I'm sorry, but I would have dropped Raoul like a hot potato just to lie in that swan bed and let him sing to me ALLLL day, and ALLLL night, among other things.....use your imagination. So he lived in a sewer and had a little anger management problem. We could have worked through it with a good therapist. I mean this guy gave Christine what every hot blooded woman wants: Total and obedient worship. Am I right girls? Anyway to all you naysayers, I say this movie would have been nothing without him. To tell you the truth I kept wondering, ""Who is this guy, where did he come from? So I did what the rest of you do and looked him up on ""imdb."" I'd seen ""Dracula 2000,"" and ""Timeline,"" but I didn't recognize him at all. Since then I've seen his other film roles, (to be honest the films weren't that great, but that's not his fault. You've got to take what you're offered.) So I just have to note another of his astonishing talents: I swear he changes with every role. His voice and his face, even his body molds to whatever character he's playing. I cannot believe that he is not up for Best Actor, or that this film is not up for at least ten Oscars. Incidentally, I shall be boycotting them this year, and I urge you to do the same. Compared to this film, the rest is just drivel. Anyway, Mr. Butler is an amazing actor. I'm so glad Mr. Schumacher had the tremendous insight to cast him. I hope now he will get the roles he so richly deserves. I'd pay admission to watch that man walk across the street. I can't believe he'd never had a voice lesson before. I hope he does more recording. I still can't get those songs out of my head, got the CD and still can't stop playing it. To all those spoil sports, GET OVER IT!! This is a MOVIE, it's not the stage play. You must embrace it on it's own turf. And WHAT a movie, I can't wait to purchase the DVD so I can savor it like the finest wine that it is to my hearts content. If you haven't seen it yet, you've missed something extremely special. It's one of the finest and most beautiful films ever made.I have to thank you ""imdb,"" at least we, for once, get a chance to air our opinions. I will never see another movie without consulting my fellow ""little people"" again. Thank you so much for this opportunity.",The Phantom of the Opera

So I am gonna say now that if you find musicals boring, you'll probably find this boring too.Other than that let's get right into this Phantom of the freaking Opera! Gosh I was expecting the most girly musical ever and what did I get? A girly musical but that's not the point because this movie is more than just that! It is a mature musical. It knows what a musical is supposed to be and it succeeded to be just that. And I gotta say the music was pretty amazing. I gotta hand it to Andrew Loyd Webber. This music was outstanding! I loved just about every second of this movie. It was just so interesting and beautiful and dramatic in just the right way. To be honest with you guys I don't know how a non-musical lover can hate this movie. Face it. The Phantom of the Opera is your dream musical you wish your school can do. Because I know I do. I literally loved this movie so much the morning after I saw it I went on my computer to listen to the soundtrack and I was listening to it all day. What are the flaws? Well, I don't really like the actress who played Calotta. She was just way too dramatic for me. There were some lip- sync problems with the song ""Think of Me"".

284,skyblueangel-1,A Spectale to See!!! (if not own),10,27 June 2005,"First Thoughts: Before seeing this movie, I had heard of the Phantom of the Opera, but I had never seen any of the plays or musicals, I had never read the book, or seen any of the movies about it. My only clue to this mysterious film was my mom's film soundtrack, which she bought immediately after seeing the movie. I listened to it with her, and was very surprised with the music -- it was actually really good!Of course, I don't care much for musicals, either, but Phantom seemed to just tug at me. Now, I have seen three different versions and read the book. Of all the versions I have seen, this one was by far the best! I have not seen the stage musical and cannot compare it to its theater origins, but I can say that this version was WAY closer to the book than Yeston & Kopit's stage version.Pro's: The acting was very good, especially Minnie Driver who plays Carlotta. The music was even better than the acting. Gerard Butler did a really good job capturing the Phantom's pain and loneliness better than any other Phantoms I've seen. And the screenplay did a good job in capturing the Phantom's human side! Sometimes we forget that the Phantom is human, even though he does some devilish things. He seems more like a misunderstood hero than a villain to me. And for those of you who say that ""Gerard Butler can't sing"", in the French audio version, I will bet my life that they had to use at least two different guys to pull off the Phantom's vocal ability. And, Gerry could do it by himself. I mean, come on! He's not that bad...Con's: The only things I wish they would've changed about this movie is the characters' backgrounds. I wished we could've seen the 'Angel of Music' giving Christine Daae lessons and seen more about the childhood relations of Raoul and Christine. The Swordfight in the Cemetery was I think one of the worst scenes that they shot. Joel could've done a better job than that! It seems like all during this bloody, action-packed fight between the Phantom and Raoul, the shots went from hands, swords, feet, Raoul's face, Phantom's cape, feet, swords, hands, Raoul's arm, etc. I had to rewind to see how Raoul got the Phantom's sword away because the camera angles were so bad!The film did slow down in some spots, like for instance Magical Lasso, and Madame Giry's Tale, but they give you important info that you need to connect all the pieces of the puzzle. At the end, it might leave you with a few questions remaining. It did for me, and I looked to the book for answers.Overall: But, overall it is a very good movie. It will have you crying at the end, for some people. It's a heartwarming tale about a monster who wanted to be loved as a human -- somewhat like Beauty and the Beast, but the beast is more human.

The problem here is that we have what appears to be a ""cut up film"".Here is what I mean. For people who have seen the play and know the story, this film will work. For people who have not, and do not have access to subtitles, it will be confusing.The confusion would be in trying to follow the story because we have the overwhelming majority of the dialog being sung. That is hard to follow, and each sequence ""cuts"" into the next sequence. EXACTLY LIKE A PLAY!!Now, should a film be a play on film? Or should a play be a play on stage and a rework on film?I chose the latter. This is the reason the academy balked on this one.If they would have made a real film adaptation, that is, give us film dialog THEN GIVE US SONG AND DANCE, we would be looking at a great film here and would have given this one a best picture nomination.Examples are such as ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Chicago"" ""Grease""Pros = Emmy Rossum might be a future star in show biz. She hits this role just right in my opinion.The Male leads do a fine Job with the strange exception of Gerard Butler, whose acting is the best but singing the weakest.Oh, and do not believe or be fooled by so called ""Music critics"" who are not professional musicians but got their jobs with a journalist degree;Emmy Rossum can sing and she does very well. In fact, technically speaking her singing voice is superior to Sarah Brightman. What is not superior is the recording mix of this soundtrack verses the 1987""Original cast"" recording.Mixes can make or break a singer. The trained ear can hear thru The mix. With all due respect, many of you do not know or understand what makes one a good singer and not a good singer. Most of you go by ""what you think you hear""However Emmy's voice is not as ""seasoned"" as Sarah's, Being 17 years old at the time might explain this. Speaking in terms of raw talent in singing, Emmy is miles above Ms. Brightman.To Conclude;If you are a big fan of great music and song and dance go see this film.If you are looking for a story line that you can follow without music, take a pass on this.7 out of 10 based on great music, great set and costume and good acting.",The Phantom of the Opera

""Masquerade"" is sung by all casts, so the scene is very gorgeous. You must check it too.The ending is not happy for every one, but it i a good point of this story. There is no perfect ending which all characters become to feel happy, I think. Before I watched this film, I didn't like a sad story, but I could understand a strong impression which comes from painfulness because of this one.In addition, a musical of the Phantom of the Opera also powerful and wonderful, I want you to compare with the film.",The Phantom of the Opera
290,Sam-80,Better than Chicago,9,16 September 2007,"If Moulin Rouge is my 10, Phantom has got to be at least a 9. Everyone compares it to Chicago, a film I didn't really like, Phantom is more like Moulin Rouge. Emmy Rossum can out sing any of the cast of Chicago and so can Patrick Wilson. To many, Michael Crawford will always be the Phantom but Gerard Butler fit well in the film. It was lush and shot beautifully. I don't think it received the credit it deserved. As the years go by I think people will find this on DVD and come to appreciate the beauty of this film.I totally enjoyed it.",The Phantom of the Opera
291,jprhedd,A great old fashioned musical,9,23 December 2004,"I have waited a long, long time for this musical to be produced. Strangely, although I was first put off by the casting, it grew on me. I thought the singing was more than adequate, the visuals outstanding and all in all, a very elaborate production. I have seen several negative reviews and cannot understand the bashing of the music or the lyrics. People who are not fans of musicals simply will not enjoy the lavishness of this movie.I remember the good old days of musicals and would be delighted to see them come back if they can equal the quality of this one. How pleasant to not see blood, gore, bombs, drug addicts etc. This is one excellent way to spend an evening and I hope many people will be open minded enough to give a musical a chance.",The Phantom of the Opera
292,RichN36,One of the Best Musicals in a long run,10,28 January 2005,"Just came home from seeing ""The Phantom of the Opra"" I have to say it is one of the Best Musicals I have ever seen as time goes by this will Rate up there with ""Westside Story"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Guys and Dolls"", and ""Music Man"" This was just a great movie all around. The story The Music and the Acting were all top notch.I have been listing to the CD and Tape for the last 20 years of the Broadway Show but never had the Chance to see it on Stage. I was surprised at how what My Minds Eye has visioned as the Action to the Music was Repsented on Screen. Only thing I had wrong was the Chandlier I always thought it was earlier in the Story. But I guess I was wrong but that was OK It fit right in the Right place in the story.Would of still like to take a Time Travel Machine and see Michael Crawford and Sara Brightman in the Lead Rolls But like seeing a Original Production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" It just ain't meant to be.I highly Recommend the Movie It will be an All time classic. ON a Personal Note what is with the Acadamy Awards for not giving this Movie a Chance at winning Best Picture or the Studio for not putting this out a few weeks sooner to be up for Best Picture this is so much better then ""Chicago"" which was a good Movie in its own way.Even my Mom gave this a 10 but she is not a member of IMDb.When this comes out on DVD it will be on my Top Shelf Movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
293,wdbrown,Excellent Adaptation,9,22 December 2004,"I have seen the stage version and I am writing this after having just seen the movie. ""Phantom of the Opera"" is majestic. Yes, it has some flaws. Comments were made by my party (a group of community actors who just completed a long run of ""Man of La Mancha"") about the odd synchronization of actor to sound as being noticeable. The voices of the male leads were decidedly weaker than what one would expect, but there was true emotion behind the words even if the ""pipes"" weren't totally there.This is a visually stunning piece. The graveyard scene was effective even if it did evoke some ""Batman-like"" images.Several scenes stand out. Although there is this annoying vogue-like choreography to Masquerade, the scene is effective. For me the stand out scene was ""Point of No Return"". I have not been as visually moved, or as emotionally involved in a scene since ""Cell Block Tango"" from ""Chicago."" Finally, there are the women. Emmy Rossum is luminous; Minnie Driver exhibits a flair rarely shown before, and Miranda Richardson portrays the steady conscience of the film.The film is an excellent adaptation of the stunning stage play. Yes, it is too long in coming, but while it is here, it must be enjoyed.",The Phantom of the Opera
294,drkjedi1-2,Better than the stage version,9,3 March 2009,"I do not like the stage version of this musical, I know, I know I don't care that it is ALW's most famous musical it just was not all that for me. AND I saw it with the marvelous Michael Crawford. He had a wonderful voice then but by the time they finally got this film going he was far too old to play the Phantom and honestly Christine on the stage is far too old. No woman of her age in the late 19th century and growing up in the theater would be so innocent, not possible! Emmy Rossum however was FAR more believable as was Patrick Wilson(I ALWAYS hated Raoul in the stage version)and Gerard Butler. Less vocal talent than Crawford but a much stronger emotional performance.The film looked, sounded and felt stronger than the stage version I saw way back when and I'm glad I went to see the film despite not being much of fan of the original stage version.",The Phantom of the Opera
295,tbaa_andrea,"Visually spectacular, vocally lackluster (Spoilers)",7,5 May 2005,"I have to start off by saying, thank God for Gerard Butler. His passion to me makes up for a lot of the points I'm going to bring up in this review. He brought a passion to the Phantom I've missed since Michael Crawford.now to the review...Visually the movie was beautiful. the costumes and scenery were gorgeous. but the show isn't about the visual. its also about the music, the passion, the obsession.Christine had a very precise voice and perfectly tuned, she had a very young pretty look, but her voice lacked any true innocent emotion and her acting was a bit hollow. I like the actress, she did a great job for what she could do, but in my opinion she didn't bring that innocence and deep emotion to the role of Christine. That tear between a love and a dream, the terror and hopelessness of a shattered illusion, and the sympathy she truly felt for her obsessor. she lacked that hypnotic loss of control when she was around the phantom. Vocally she was good, performance she lacked a bit.I LOVE Gerard Butler. He is very handsome (wow is he ever) and I have a thing for Scotsmen, he is an extremely talented actor, he showed great emotion in the role, but sadly his voice was not quite there. it was almost there, but as the old saying goes, ""Close but no cigar- close doesn't win the race."" The phantom is suppose to have this romantic, hypnotic voice that puts Christine in a trance every time she hears him sing, he is a brilliant illusionist, magician, composer. Yet the more emotional he got, the more he grunted instead of sang. Performance wise he was superb, I actually felt drawn to his Phantom, until he started singing. although he did do a good job on the big number, ""Music of the Night."" with some training, I think he could be amazing as the phantom. but he didn't have enough training in time for filming. he was just a great phantom with a not as hypnotizing voice. I heard many people comment on the wish he would have been Michael Crawford.Also, with technology being the way it is, after how amazing they made the sets, I was EXTREMELY disappointed by the phantom's unmasking. Like one reviewer put it (I wish I could remember his name off hand) It looked like a very handsome man with a bad sunburn on one side of his face. after the phantom moaning about how pitiful his life was because of his face, it seemed so anti-climactic. The old silent movie version of the phantom was more horrific. The description given by original author of the Phantom, Gaston Leroux paints a much more pitiful version of the Phantom. The stage make-up for the musical version is more dramatic than this was. You'd think with FX being the way it is today, they'd have come up with something more. I'm not talking grotesque or gory. just... more dramatic.the worst thing that broke my heart was the grave yard scene when they changed the Phantom's fireballs shooting at Raoul and the scene when the stage erupts into fire, to a sword fight where Raoul has the phantom where he wants him and decides.. ""Eh, maybe later."" what was up with that? They took the whole element of the Phantom's genius at illusion and terror and turned it into a weak sword fight no one won even though Raoul could have ended it all in that moment.I also disliked where the chandelier fell. The reason I enjoyed it much more where it happens in the stage play is because 1. it shows his anger, and deep sadness over Christine's betrayal 2. it shows the Phantom's maniacal madness. 3. who doesn't love it when it flickers on and off before it falls when he cries out to a croaking Carlotta ""BEHOLD SHE IS SINGING To BRING DOWN THE CHANDELIER!!"" I also miss the maniacal laughter as Carlotta croaks. Michael Crawford did that the best. It just shows how mad the Phantom was increasingly growing.you're probably wondering why I gave it such a high rating with so many complaints, here are the things I liked about it, and the DVD that followed.The DVD's making of, and behind the mask extras were truly interesting to watch.Gerard Butler is an amazing actor, who minus the non-phantomish voice (In my opinion at least) brought great passion to the role. He really brings you into his character no matter how hard you try to not like him. (And I did try cause I'm a die hard- Michael Crawford for the phantom! fan.) but there was something in Mr. Butler's eyes that was impossible to ignore.The sets were amazing, the costumes were beautiful.Raoul, Madame Giry and the managers did their roles splendidly.Christine, minus the lack of emotion, had a very lovely voice. Needs a bit of work to bring that emotion out in it, but still lovely.and she's a good actress.the orchestra was amazing. The music set the mood perfectly.I liked the ending at the graveyard. That was touching and was a nice twist with the rose on Christine's grave.Overall, minus some of the singing, I think the actors did a very good job. and I love Gerard Butler. (Did I say that yet?)overall it wasn't a great movie if you're a major fan of the musical, but it was a very good movie and I'm glad they finally made it. I just wish Mr. Lloyd Webber would release a live stage version on DVD like he did for cats, or like they did for Les Mis.that's pretty much it. I think visually and because of the wonderful job Mr. Bulter put into the performance, It makes the show worth watching.",The Phantom of the Opera
296,cybertigger1,Very beautifully done,8,24 December 2004,"I've seen Phantom on stage once, and while it's rare that a film of a stage production transcends the thrill of a live performance, this one is an exception. I think being able to see the emotion on the faces of the performers, particular the Phantom, made a big difference. Also, Emmy Rossum is heartbreakingly beautiful as Christine, not to mention an excellent actress--the way she manages to combine sweet innocence with smoldering sensuality is something to behold. ""The Music of the Night"" is an incredibly erotic sequence. Cold shower time after that was over.I loved the glorious opening scene with the chandelier, as well as the hauntingly beautiful graveyard scene (""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""). And ""Masquerade"" of course.This is one of those ""why I love movies"" movies. See it!",The Phantom of the Opera
297,jessepenitent,A Gorgeous Trainwreck,4,3 August 2005,"After reading through the commentaries here, I want to see the movie the other writers saw. After I watched Phantom last night, I kept asking ""Where was the passion?"" Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson manage to portray some of the passion and emotions their characters experienced, but Emmy Rossum seemed whiny, Patrick Wilson callow and Gerard Butler....well, I have never seen the famous Michael Crawford version, but I have seen other Phantoms (all still unknowns) and all of them assayed the role with more passion and darkness in their pinkies than Butler did with his whole body. Yes, it was pretty to look at (and I will admit that ""Past the Point of No Return"" was a great sequence) and I give props to the writers for explaining why Carlotta suddenly loses her voice during a performance, but if I never see this again it will be just fine with this Phantom fan.",The Phantom of the Opera

Much better in the lower ranges than high note but still very effective.I loves Christina and thought she did a great job.If you love musicals it is a must.

299,Guildfordian,"Sorry, but i didn't like it!",1,7 May 2005,"I hate t say this, perhaps due to the obvious effort put into the film, but I didn't like this film at all! Except for three thing, I was incredibly bored by the film and had to stop myself from turning it off three times.First the three points I liked: 1. The singing of the young lady playing ""Christine"", certainly inspiring. 2. The final scene under the theatre was well done 3. Simon Callow was rather good and funny, as always!The main points I didn't like: 1. The actors may have all sung their parts however the singing obviously, in my opinion, dubbed afterwards, and this REALLY annoyed me, because Icannot stand looking at people while they are ""singing"" to see that they are in fact not. They may have sung well in the dubbing studio but their being unable to act and sing at the same time rather ruined it for me. I mean IT IS A MUSICAL! 2. I found the acting, with a few exceptions, to be very below standard and boring. Basically, not one to buy. My two main complaints concern the main focus of the film. Quite awful!",The Phantom of the Opera
300,lilguyollie,10 out of 10? I'm not so sure,7,15 August 2013,"In many respects this film is a masterpiece. Memorable, mesmerising and beautiful. The acting is solid, the singing is okay (some are great others are not) and the sets are wonderful. However, the directing is awful. Just awful. Joel Schumacher missed so many opportunities to make this a classic. So what is the final verdict? The premise is that the Phantom (Gerard Butler) is a musical genius and magician who hides in a lair beneath the Paris Opera House due to his horrible disfigurement. He spends his time trying to lure singer Christine Daee (Emmy Rossum) into his grasp only to face opposition from the young nobleman Raoul (Patrick Wilson).The good: The acting is great, every actor puts there heart and soul into it and I particularly enjoyed Gerard Butler's rendition of the Phantom. The singing was exceptional from Emmy and Patrick however I found Gerard's singing to be hollow and powerless when singing along side others. The sets and costume were brilliant and set the mood and feel perfectly.The bad: Nowhere near as good as the show. I hate the fact that Joel Schumacher put off making this for years which then led to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman becoming too old for the parts. The film doesn't quite have the creepy Gothic feel that the play has. The fact that Schumacher opted for a younger phantom just made this look like a fight between two kids for a girl. It completely disassembled the adult feel that the rest of the film worked so hard to create. Just as an added note, his deformity isn't that bad.Verdict: Good, not great. I love the songs and story and I felt that the actors did a fine job and at least they tried to stay true to the source material. The direction really held this film back, too many wrong decisions got this film panned by some but in my view, the movie works too well in certain areas to be labelled a bust.",The Phantom of the Opera
301,Cat-Squire,The Phantom of the Opera is there........inside your mind!,10,26 January 2005,"I don't go to the cinema often but for 'The Phantom of the Opera' I decided to make an exception. Now, at the ripe age of 17, I have already seen a few musicals on stage and some on TV or video. 'Phantom....' is one of the musicals I have seen performed on stage about 7 years ago. I know I thought it was good at the time but couldn't really remember the story so I went with my mum to see this film, not really knowing how good it was going to be, not having read any reviews of it. I left the cinema with one resounding word in my mind:WOW! It was an incredible film. As a music student I just loved every minute of the score, excellently done by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Emmy Rossum (Christine) has an excellent voice, so soft yet it creates a nice, round sound. And Gerard Butler (The Phantom, and home grown Scottish talent :> makes me proud to be Scottish) has a great voice for the role of the Phantom, especially for someone who is not a trained singer. It has power and aggression but can also be soft and serenading like in the song 'Music of the Night'.A great film for lovers of musicals, for those who enjoy romantic films, drama, a hint of madness, a strong, captivating storyline. This film could be classed under many genre's and if there was a genre titled 'WOW!' it would come under that too.All in all, an excellent film! Go forth and enjoy!Cat §quire",The Phantom of the Opera
302,the_phantom_was_here,"A wonderful film, despite what some may say about the Phantom",10,6 July 2005,"I had no intention in watching this movie at first, I was never really big into musicals and I knew no one in the cast. I decided to give the movie a chance, expecting nothing to spark my interest. As I sat there watching it, I fell in love. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year! Emmy Rossum was a great discovery, born to play Christine. And Gerard Butler, what can I say about him? He was incredible! I heard from a few people that he was the only downfall in the movie...WRONG! He was perfect to play Sir Andrew Lloyd's Phantom for many reasons that I found. For one thing, Webber and Schumacher wanted someone who would portray that the Phantom was still a man at the end of the day, which Gerard portrayed perfectly. Another thing is that they wanted a Phantom who wasn't grotesquely hideous, but still showed the beauty of who the Phantom really was...which Gerard did perfectly! Some disagreed about Gerard's singing skills, since he only started singing around pre-production of the movie. I disagree. Webber said he wanted a ""rock and roll"" tone for the voice of the Phantom, which Gerard naturally had in his voice. I believe that what Schumacher and Webber tried to achieve in this was to make Phantom of the Opera something of their own, which they did. Sure, it doesn't hold up all of the same traditions of the original Phantom of the Opera, but isn't that the point of all remakes? To make a certain movie somewhat of your own? Despite what others may say about this movie, I give a perfect 10/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
303,einezcrespo,It was an OK version.,5,31 July 2005,"I have to admit it was hard for me to sit and watch this film since I had seen the musical a couple of times before. While the stage performance does give way for some surprises (i.e different from various actor's and actress playing the roles of The Phanton, Christine et all) the movie version is a different matter altogether and I had to accept that. Gerald Butler is more angst ridden but gave a fine performance as the Phantom. Minnie Driver's over the top rendition of Carlotta was funny but the ear-splitting singing gave me a head-ache. Emmy Rossum captured the frail beauty of Christine and has a pretty voice. My problem with her is how she delivered her lines. She just mumbled through them and lacked a degree of warmth or emotion especially in the confrontational scene where she is forced to chose between the Phantom and Raoul. In other words she lacked soul. The others, Raoul, Firmin and Madame Giry were a little forgettable. The sets and the costume were great and the in between fillers were a nice touch. The ending was an unexpected surprise. Was the film version better then the stage version. So-so but it does give people who haven't seen the musical an idea what it was all about. Personally, I prefer the stage version. I guess I expected more from the acting. Sorry!",The Phantom of the Opera

The acting was pretty good, but he wasn't able to sing the pieces very well, and some parts were practically spoken.

The voices of the lead are such a let down. I can't even believe the praises given to them by some reviewers. Their voice were like trying so hard to be operatic, but disappointingly was very far from it. They didn't even sound as good pop voices. It was like watching a mediocre school production. The set design, costumes and ensemble was good. I also love the orchestration - it was quite refreshing actually. The camera scene shots left much to be desired. I'm sorry to say it, but I think Baz Luhrman would have done a much better execution of the scenes. Of the leads, the one I only enjoyed listening to is Patrick Wilson. I loved his voice here! It had that just-right (not scary male) operatic quality. I also liked how the ensemble/company chorus. I would like to watch this movie again, but it would be such a pain to hear the voices of the leads again, sorry to say.

The sets are grand and elaborate, the costuming is done with a keen eye on period authenticity, and the script well displays the actors' talents.Emily Rossum is excellent as Christine, and Gerard Butler does a passable job as the Phantom (though I thought either Michael Crawford or Gary Mauer, both of whom played the Phantom in the stage version, would have been better). Patrick Wilson does an excellent job as Raoul. The one real weakness of the film is the musical ability of the Phantom. This is the primary reason why I made the comment above about how Gerard Butler played the part: he does a passable job, but did not bring the air of musical genius to the part that Mauer or Crawford did (just listen to the Broadway cast recording, and compare it to the movie, and you'll see what I mean). ****SPOILER ALERT***** The scene, near the beginning, where Christine and Meg Giry (played by Minnie Driver) meet in the private chapel, contains one of the most musically perfect duets I have ever seen.

307,VerbalKint-2,Very good,7,25 December 2004,"A wonderful (and surprisingly faithful) film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical (which I saw three times in Toronto in the early 1990s). Yes, several changes were made from the stage version, but there wasn't a single one that I didn't understand the motivation behind. I think the story is actually stronger on film than it was on stage because of those changes.Amazing performances by Gerard Butler as the titular Phantom (whose voice sounds better in theaters than it does on the soundtrack album released earlier this month), Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry and especially Emmy Rossum, whose voice is perfectly suited to the part of ingénue Christine Daaé. (but whose diction is slightly lacking).Also surprising in this film was the restraint shown by director Joel Schumacher, a man perhaps best known for destroying the Batman movie franchise. He seems to have matured greatly in his last few films (Tigerland and Phone Booth are good examples), and this is almost certainly his best film to date. The movie is visually stunning but character-driven. The visuals are never allowed to completely overwhelm the story, which has previously been a huge fault in Schumacher's work. Restraint, as I said earlier, is the key here.I will absolutely be seeing this again soon.",The Phantom of the Opera

Andrew LLoyd Webber probably shouldn't have produced or co-written the script as, I assume, this was the reason for many of the musical inclusion that the film could have done without.The second half was much better than the first, and an interval would have really helped.Compared to other LLoyd Webber film adaptations, It pales in comparison to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar.OK so what did I like about it..The sets were fantastic, and there seemed to be elements of Moulin Rouge in the way it was filmed.

I have to say this movie does the musical justice. Everything is very very good if not great.I had/heard qualms about some of the singing and the busyness of the production. I was worried because Joel Scheumacher really ruined the Batman franchise with its in your face gaudiness. Andrew Lloyd Webber must have kept him on a short leash for this one, though, because he was really calmed down.And the singing? Great. If you're hooked on Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and that's all you listen to, you may not like this because no two actors are the same. But the people cast have great voices. Butler brings the passion behind the Phantom to the songs. Rossum has a very sweet and pleasant voice.The sets and costumes are, of course, fantastic. Additinally, everything looks JUST like the stage show, down to set details and even looks. The production staff rightly knew not to mess with a good thing. I've seen a fair amount of stage musicals to movie conversions, and I believe this movie stuck the closest to the stage show.In short, there are two groups who will not like this film. One, those who dislike the stage show. Two, those who have grown unusually attached to the voices on their particular recordings.

She was stunning, beautiful, sexy and intriguing all at the same time, with a killer voice to boot. I liked the portrayal of Raul to the story, the best I've ever seen. Minnie Driver has never been a favorite of mine, but she actually made Carlotta's character somebody fun and hilarious. Gerard Butler as the Phantom topped them all. I agree with many critics that his voice isn't as good as others such as Michael Crawford, but he makes the phantom a more human character, drawing the audience to him, making him the character he was supposed to be....the victim.The sets were glamorous, and I stared in awe as soon as the movie started.I'm not one to cry at movies, but every time I see Phantom I at least get a huge lump in my throat, so bring tissues. I highly recommend this film that will warm the heart of even the coldest person in the audience. 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
315,iloveUGA123,I Love This Movie!!!!,10,26 April 2012,"When I was around 7 years old my cousin showed me this movie and I was obsessed with the movie and the songs! The whole thing with the Phantom choking people did freak me out, but the movie was so good and I would definitely watch it again!!This movie was getting hit really hard by critics about the music, like why? The Broadway musical has the original songs, this movie has basically the same exact songs, just with a little twist (they added a little bit of rock to it)! That to me is what made it even better because it was it's ""own"" original soundtrack but with the same lyrics.I would definitely recommend watching this movie, you will love the music and the story its self!",The Phantom of the Opera
316,zephyr24-1,Grand Phantom,7,8 January 2005,"A movie remake of a famous Andrew Llyod Webber will inevitably split audiences into two camps. Love it or hate it. When I saw that Joel Schumaucher was going to direct an epic of such scale, I was both surprised and curious.Out of curiosity, I went into the cinema with an open mind, trying not to think of the kind of action movies he's more used to directing. And true enough, he didn't disappoint actually. As with a Webber production, the grandeur and theatrics of the musical is largely retained. I'm in awe with Gerard Butler's voice. For someone with no formal vocal training, he has delivered exceptionally as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is a bit of a surprise too. Some may have complained that the songs were lowered a few notes to let her sing, but hey, she doesn't do a bad job. Her performance as Christine is succinct and rather bittersweet. Minnie Driver also spots a refined comedic performance as Calotta. The cast were also immaculately dressed in elaborate and fanciful costumes.Earlier in the movie, Schumacher did not entirely seem to be able to decide on what he's trying to convey and hence, resulted in some slight awkward moments when he tries to mix drama and comedy in some of the singing sequences. As he picks up the momentum, the movie also improved vastly, also largely brought on by the splendid compositions of Webber and Rice.If for any purpose, the movie version of the Phatom of The Opera actually allows casual moviegoers to understand the musical better than when it's on stage since watching a live musical requires more than just your attention but lots of imagination.",The Phantom of the Opera
317,delphine090,Don't listen to critics,10,9 January 2005,"This is a revised comment because I saw it for the 3rd time last night. I've never been so taken with a film that I had to see it over and over (and I'm FAR from an enamored teen). I actually saw it Friday AND Saturday night. (For me that's completely unheard of). I was less impressed after the first viewing, but I knew I had not been able to take it all in, so I went again. And I saw and enjoyed it so much more, especially Butler's performance, that I then wanted to see the whole thing again in a high quality theater and not the standard mall multiplex. (The film actually skipped during second viewing, cutting off the first two lines of ""Music of the Night"").I've read reviews here and even professional critics, and here's a major spoiler: About the repeated complaint that the small mask ""doesn't cover"" - there's a second freaking mask! A mask of a normal forehead and head of hair. You can see him adjust it. People complained the singing was out of sync - at three viewings the singing was perfectly in sync, so those complaints coupled with the film skipping I can only surmise there's a quality control issue with copies/showings of the film.I know it's a bit much to expect people to see the movie twice in order to really ""see"" it. I can only say that made a huge difference for me. I enjoyed Ms. Rossum's singing much more than Ms. Brightman's. It captures the essence of a Christine's young talent and it's flawless. Raoul was brave and earnest (not a wimp but he's young and not yet jaded), and his sweet singing voice furthers that feeling about him. And I can't say enough about Phantom. He's murdered and tormented people and at the end the audience cries for his pain. No amount of lyrics can move you that way if the actor has not revealed Phantom's tortured soul. Butler shows us the anger and violence, but also the sadness and vulnerability of this man. And since it is mostly singing, he uses his voice as a tool to convey all these overwhelming emotions the character is feeling. And yeah, I'd pick him over Raoul.So while I can understand the critics, and the movie's not for everyone, there is something really special here and unless you hate musicals/ALW in general, it's worth checking out. You might actually love it, like so many others do.",The Phantom of the Opera
318,madscientist2787,"""Joyless, candy-coated claptrap.""",2,26 November 2005,"My sister convinced me to watch the film last night. I strongly wished I had not. Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber took a classic monster story and turned it into a half-assed romantic fantasy for lonely housewives. I'm sorry, but I just can't be asked to take seriously a story about some selfish doofus who enters the room like Bela's double from Plan 9 from Outer Space, demands money for no reason, and screws with innocent people just to impress some doe-eyed singer chick. And he's deformed....if you can call a what appears to be a port wine stain on the face on one of the otherwise sexiest human beings I've ever seen. You can't get away with this kind of behavior unless your name is Lon Cheney. Sorry, Mr. Butler.

319,suzy-60,A guilty pleasure,5,16 April 2007,"This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a good movie. Or even an adequate movie. In fact, in places it's laughably bad. My loveand the love of many othersfor this movie remains a deep, dark secret, only taken out and aired in the darkness of outer cyberspace.And thus I begin my song of adoration. Yes, the original cast were all better singers. Emmy Rossum does a great job for someone her age, but Sarah Brightman is much much better especially in the higher register. Gerard Butler's voice is far more suited to rock and he only really sounds any good in the lower registerup higher, and he sounds a bit strained and nasalwhile Michael Crawford's voice is like a clarinet; still it's hard not to like the way Butler belts out the songs with a hint of ferocity now and then that Michael Crawford never managed to get around to. Raoul is as always pretty colourlessthis time around he has an American accent (grimace) and hair reminiscent of the Hanson Boys.The backing music is much better than that of the musical, thoughbigger, thumpier, and (thank God) less synthesized, but don't listen too carefully or you will catch an electric guitar or twenty. The sets are pretty snazzy (just watch the Masquerade sceneit's fabulous)--and by ""snazzy"" I mean laughably bright and baroque and ornate beyond all sense or reasonthere's not a wall that's not covered in something naked and gold. The story is so changed from the source novel (which was a masterpiece of silliness to begin with) that one little puff would blow it all away. There are enough plot holes to sink the Flying Dutchman. The entire graveyard sequence is a beautiful example of totally unnecessary travelling, kidnapping, fencing, etc.So why do we still love it? Why do we still watch it, even now? One word: Melodrama.There is nothing on this earth more melodramatic than this movie, in such unadulterated formnot even Moulin Rouge, which is a perfectly sensible movie in comparison. I don't know how exactly to define it, or how to point out the particularly melodramatic bits, but I do know that the movie is nothing but. It tries to play, with utter transparency, on every heart-string known to man. Its transparency, and its partial success, make up a totally irresistible charm. See it, feel free to hate it, but don't be surprised if you find yourself loving it.",The Phantom of the Opera
320,Rick K,"Very good, and better in some regards than the stage version",9,6 March 2005,"First, what it is and what it is not: It is a very good rendition of the story and play, with different emphasis providing more depth. It is not is an attempt to replicate the stage play. Those are both positive statements, as much as I loved the Broadway version with Crawford and Brightman.Like many reviewers I too was enchanted with the way the film opened and transitioned from gray Paris 1919 to the colorful story itself. Those were some very effective special effects. And getting to see the older Vicomte de Chagny's passion, you felt his loss along with him. Can that really be Patrick Wilson under that makeup as the old man? Wow.I agree with endymion82's observation that the cast and director didn't try to out-do Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman - perhaps neither advisable nor possible - but instead provided their own interpretation of the roles. In comparison (which is nearly irrelevant unless you've seen the stage version) I felt Emmy Rossum gave a much more youthful-exuberance pitch to the role, quite a bit more unsure of herself and who is really on her side. I found that aspect of the role very intriguing and that it gave a new dimension. True, Gerard Butler is no Michael Crawford, but then he does give the role a rather more ""human"" aspect (Michael being such a towering figure) and you realize that as the movie points out, ""he is after all just a man."" It is much like the more human portrayal that Antonio Banderas gave as Che in the film version of ""Evita."" Somehow by not being smooth and pitch-perfect trained singers both he and Butler added depth and color to their respective roles, along with credibility.Patrick Wilson as Raoul was fine, alternately supportive and tender with Christine and brave and daring when needed. Of course Miranda Richardson is so capable an actress, giving just the right shading to her character. Minnie Driver was simply fun to watch as Carlotta.I found it very helpful to see the background fill-in bits, where we got to see how it was the Phantom was rescued and given his place in the Opera House, as well as the backstory of Madame Giry and her relationship with Christine. I understood more of the characters and their actions and interactions as a result.The denouement of the story - the final scene with Christine and the Phantom in the underground - was quite moving. I felt as much here as the stage version, which is to say I was just as emotionally affected.In all, I'd say it is definitely a very good, worthy version of the story and also of the stage play. 9/10 if only because the singing was slightly less than brilliant, except for Emmy Rossum's sublime and sweet performance. Worth seeing, indeed worth seeing more than once. There are not a lot of films these days that good.",The Phantom of the Opera
321,KittyGrimm,A Stunning and Emotional masterpiece!,10,18 May 2007,"Since I saw this film when it first came out, I have been in love with it now for three years straight and I still get emotional every time I watch it, especially in the climax. In fact, I'm actually afraid to watch it because I get all teared up, which is rare for me because I don't often cry in films. The story is set in late Victorian Paris where a young soprano, Christine Daae, wins a triumph of the leading role and captures the heart of a mysterious masked man whom she admires as her long-awaited ""Angel of Music"" that her father had sent to her. But her Angel turns out to be a Fallen Angel when his darker and more demonic side is shown and threatens the lives of many...and all because of his deformed face. The only question is does Christine love her Angel or is she under his dominance? I fell in love with this film and it is still a big favorite of mine. What I loved about it was that it didn't look so much like a musical, but an opera itself, which makes perfect sense, of course. The acting, of course, is brilliant! An excellent, if not underrated cast of wonderful actors from the classically subtle touch of Miranda Richardson (Mme. Giry) to the raw passion of Gerard Butler (The Phantom), whom I fell in love with not only for his looks, but for his gift of adding such an intense humanity to The Phantom that I, myself, had found myself relating to the loneliness that I believe we all feel. Very rarely can a man cry on cue and give that emotion to the audience and Butler captured it perfectly.Emmy Rossum (Christine Daae) also brings a delightful as well as tortured and troubled performance as the victim of what we would see as an abusive lover and longs to escape, but somehow cannot decide whether she loves him or not. Patrick Wilson (Raoul De Chagny) also brings a stunning performance, as subtle as he may seem. Like Butler, Wilson has the rare ability to speak with his eyes. He knows how to be subtle and intense all at once and he can say it all through his eyes. In short, this production was a stunning work of art and this is coming from someone who knows the book better than the play. If you are a lover of great music, wonderful artwork, and brilliant acting, then this is the film for you and I highly suggest it, especially if you are a lover of great literature as well as an Angel of Music.",The Phantom of the Opera
322,caenleranzo,"Unprofessional Music, Watered Down Writing, and Poor Directing",3,19 March 2020,"Only naive people would be easily impressed by the music, writing, and directing of this film. The Phantom of the Opera is supposed to have a scary-looking phantom, but this has a handsome Gerard Butler. Gerard Butler does not have a professional voice for operatic singing. Which is an insult to The Phantom of the Opera legacy. Hollywood unwisely rushed this by casting Gerard Butler to be The Phantom. Emmy Rossum who portrays Christine Daae will never hold a candle to Sierra Boggess vocally. The camera(s) that was/were used in the scenes shaked, which made the scenes look unstable in an unprofessional way. Christine Daae had an American accent when she was not singing and that's preposterous. Some people such as Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver properly sang professionally. If you want a sophisticated The Phantom of the Opera performance, then watch The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall with Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo that was made in the year of 2011. Forget watching this 2004 movie please. Unfortunately, theatre classes will probably show this disgrace to young, impulsive, and ignorant children, teenagers, and young adults. Andrew LLoyd Webber and Joel Schumacher watered down the writing, which made this show ridiculable at an alarming rate. Not that it's going to keep me from mocking bad performances.",The Phantom of the Opera
323,Jackie-Kennedy,Lloyd Webber has hit the jackpot again,10,17 November 2006,"Poor Gerard Butler. He was public enemy number one before filming even began. No-one could accept that some-one who was not voice-trained and had never sung a note in his career could take on one of Musical Theater's most famous and emotionality charged parts. Could a 32 year old Scottish stage actor with no singing experience really step into Michael Crawford's sizable shoes? Answer? A great big YES! Gerard, although not a classically trained singer, has to his advantage a gravelly emotional voice that is perfect for the role of the tortured and lonely phantom. At six-foot three and being incredibly handsome he's quite an imposing screen presence. His Phantom is just the right mix of danger, passion, anger and loneliness.One of Joel Schumacher's requirements was that he wanted a young cast particularly for the part of Christine. He believed that youth would help with the innocence of the story. No surprise then that the part of the beautiful heroine went to 16 year old Emmy Rossum. The young actress has a beautiful soft Soprano voice, having sung in Opera since the age of 9. She perfectly exhibits Christine's youth and innocence while clearly portraying her confusion and mixed up feelings. Sarah Brightman has a new rival. Her voice, thought not yet as powerful as Sarah's fits the bill to a tee.In the play the character of Raoul is rather minor as ALW himself has said but for the film version he is brought more to the fore thanks to excellent acting and singing of the part of actor and lyric tenor Patrick Wilson. Wilson's Roaul is a handsome, sword-wielding, passionate hero type. His superb Tenor compliments Emmy's soft Soprano and Gerards gravelly voice perfectly. He is a strong agile actor and really gives Raoul a more human feel.I'd love to say more about the lush sets , wonderful costumes and beautiful haunting music but sadly I'm running out of space. Suffice to say the spirit of Andrew Lloyd Webber's captivating play is very much kept alive but with everything on a bigger grander scale that the stage would allow. Fans will not be disappionted and newcommers will be captivated from the opening scene. And as for Gerard Butler? Well personally I think old Michael Crawford would be proud!",The Phantom of the Opera
324,soniagoenaga25,Gerard should have been nominated for the Golden Globe Awards,10,1 January 2005,"I don't understand the reason for not nominating Gerard for the Golden Globe Awards when he is the star of 'The Phantom of the Opera'. In the first place he is much more convincing in his role than Emmy Rossum, and despite of her good quality for singing, in fact, she is an opera singer, her performance is far from being convincing. She is just like a mere object without personality. Gerard is totally the opposite, he is absolutely marvelous as the Phantom, masculine and romantic. Apart from the fact that he has a good voice. Despite of not being a singer, he has impressed me very much so this movie has given Gerard the chance of singing well. I am completely fed up with Hollywood for not nominating Gerard as best actor, he really deserves this prize and not Emmy. Perhaps the reason is that he is Scottish, something without any sense, because Scotland is a very beautiful country and the Scottish accent is the most beautiful accent I have ever heard. So this is not an excuse for excluding him from the prize, although Hollywood always excludes foreign actors because of their accents and this is totally unjustifiable. I hope Gerard to win a prize one day because he deserves it.",The Phantom of the Opera
325,katyggls,Great Film; A Fairy Tale Set To Music,8,28 May 2005,"Overall, I liked this film adaptation of the show. It was very true to the actual stage production (which I saw in Toronto in 1997). For those that don't know, Phantom is the story of a disfigured musical genius known only as The Phantom (Gerard Butler), who lives in the dungeons of the Opera Populaire in 1870's Paris. There he trains and falls in love with the young chorus girl Christine (Emmy Nossum). The opera house then comes under new management and new patronage in the form of Christine's childhood sweetheart, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny (Patrick Wilson). The Phantom demands that the new owners give Christine the lead in the opera, infuriating the opera house's reigning diva, Carlotta (Minnie Driver). They refuse, and the Phantom learns of the blossoming love between Christine and Raoul, with disastrous results.I did feel that Gerard Butler, while superb in a dramatic/acting sense, left much to be desired with his singing abilities. Emmy Nossum was fantastic, as was Patrick Wilson. I have to say though, that Minnie Driver nearly stole the show with her performance as Carlotta. Funny, sparkling, and with an impressive vocal performance, she adds the perfect comedic catharsis to an otherwise somber tale.The sets and costumes are breathtaking. They completely transport you to another world, accomplishing what the words ""Once upon a time"" and ""in a land far, far away"" once accomplished for fairy tales.If you're a fan of the stage Phantom, or of theater or musicals in general, I highly recommend this.",The Phantom of the Opera
326,the_usual_suspect,A flawed work of art,6,24 December 2004,"Based on the eighteen year old stage musical, The Phantom of the Opera is a visually superb although considerably flawed tale of beauty, beast and love. The Phantom (Gerard Butler, I'm afraid) haunts a Paris Opera House that has recently come under new ownership. He falls deeply in love with Christine (a spunky Emmy Rossum), unfortunately just at the same time as young buck Raoul (Patrick Wilson) falls for her too.Joel Schumacher's visualisation of the epic theatre production is magical to behold. Sweeping camera shots combine with the booming brilliance of the new IMPROVED (despite what some critics have said) soundtrack to create a delightful display of grandiose film making. What Schumacher does well with cinematography, he almost undermines with casting. Butler, star of Tomb Raider 2, plays the Phantom without sympathy, losing a major part of the emotion that was captured in the stage version. His untrained voice is torn between being gravely and operatic, the second of which he cannot handle. Butler gets lost in the strength of the score and simply can't keep up. Schumacher has misjudged the ageing of the Phantom also, as Butler is noticeably younger than the faultless Miranda Richardson who plays the Phantom's closest contact, who we see help him escape from the circus when they are both children. It is predictable that I should now enter the subject of other possibilities for the role of Phantom. Antonio Banderas, although not liked by all, can, at least, sing a song, and his performance in Evita was very impressive. Banderas would have brought not only some much needed maturity to the role, he would also have brought a sympathetic quality to the Phantom that Butler can only dream about.Emmy Rossum is engaging as the young performer, although she is remorsefully objectified throughout the length of the film. Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver are both not given enough to do, and despite critical praise, Jennifer Ellison is irritating and boring to watch as Meg Giry.The script utilises the lyrics well, and production design, costumes and sound are of the highest possible quality. The beauty of the snowy rooftop scene in which the Phantom eavesdrops on the two young lovers is very moving, and leads on to an emotionally engaging climax.Schumacher seems to want to make the Phantom an out and out villain, which, whilst a complete misjudgement, is completely opposed by the first ninety minutes of the film, which are spent learning all about the poor Phantom's tough upbringing (or lack thereof). Another mistake is the ambiguity of the relationship between Christine and the masked maniac. The lyrics suggest that she sees him as a father figure, yet, during their first meeting Christine's eyes roll into the back of her head in orgasmic delight as the Phantom touches her. From this point onwards its a battle trying to determine whether she loves him as a father or a lover.Plot holes and cardboard cut-out Phantoms aside, this film has the beauty and visual flare of Moulin Rouge, supported by a thunderous score which lifted my spirits to the roof of the Opera House/cinema. Overlong, at times irritating, but nonetheless impossible to turn away from. The trailer for Phantom really symbolises the whole nature of the film: its quality is solely reliant on the power of the music (of the night). A flawed work of art.Rating: 3/5",The Phantom of the Opera
327,joe16vind,This is not a Masterpiece but a hack job (THIS MIGHT BE A SPOILER INCLUDED IN THIS),5,24 January 2005,"My mom and I saw this and both found it rather irritating.The incongruity of the hair styles (The phantom's short, Raoul's long, Christine's ever full and curly, her choir girl best friend's flat and plain), the overly long stroll to her father's graveyard (how could so young a child have so much money to have a burial crypt for her father? if Christine was poor as it was suggested, then how could she afford such an ostentatious burial place in sea of gaudiness? Even if she rose to sing lead, she had become that wealthy which I find hard to believe.), the stiffness of Butler's phantom and his talk singing which exhibited no range whatsoever, the high school quarterbackness of Raoul and a voice hardly tolerable and then the so-so renditions of songs that haunt the imagination long after they have been heard and sung.My nephew and his friends who range in that all important studio target demographic of 16 to 25 years had no desire to see this film at all. Others I know had seen the stage play and stayed away from this latest film incarnation of The Phantom Of the Opera.The youthful dynamic obliterates the relationship. (THIS MIGHT CONSIDERED A SPOILER) Case in point if Miranda Richardson's character as a very young girl(no more than 12) discovers the phantom as a very young boy, then why does only she age? Even after he is unmasked, he still remains young!!!!Nope, this is not a masterpiece but an inept adaptation. If the studio did not want to cast Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman from the original stage play and whose voices exhibit tremendous range, that's their choice. But to foister this cast upon the paying public was pretty idiotic. Surely a better performing group of actors were available along with a stronger director who might have been able to pull this off. Baz Luhmann understood the dynamics and Moulin Rouge, while not a masterpiece either, was a far more enjoyable experience.",The Phantom of the Opera

I've still got the soundtrack running through my head five days after seeing this movie. However...The characters are my biggest problem. Christine (Emmy Rossum), in particular, is air-headed, irresponsible, and seems to fall in love with whomever is serenading her at that particular moment. Raoul (Patrick Wilson) - who gave a very impressive musical performance - is a very cardboardy character. The Phantom is, of course, completely changed from the book and musical - both in backstory and appearance. Okay, so he's pretty - but he's not supposed to be, and as soon as gains that physical attractiveness we lose half of the character's motivation.",The Phantom of the Opera

There are many moments of comedic relief. The sets are stunning and vivid. The story is easier to follow than on the stage. Mr. Gerard Butler will be the one remembered for his rendition of the Phantom because he puts his heart and soul into this character. His loneliness is palpable and also his love.

So naturally when this movie came out I wasn't to thrilled to go see it at first. The main reason that I went to see it was to see how bad I thought it would be, but I was wrong. When I came out of the theater I was a very happy critic. This is by far the best musical that I have ever seen. And furthermore, one of the best all around movies that I have ever seen. As I watched this movie I was amazed to see that the actors in this film had such amazing voices. There were even some shots in this movie that reminded me of a Tim Burton film. After watching this movie I came to realize where Shumacher's talents truly lie.

Then here comes the film version...Objectively, I know this movie has A LOT of problems, but I still enjoy watching it. This movie is a huge guilty pleasure for me and now that I'm older I can definitely see the flaws:The changing of lyrics to dialogue is a huge problem. If they wanted more dialogue (why?) then write NEW dialogue, not the odd rhyming couplets (didn't Rent do this around the same time as well? Dreamgirls is usually almost though sung and they changed that for the movie too- and shouldn't have but at least they gave them new dialogue not spoken lyrics).The Phantom's ""deformity"" is an unforgivable offense. It's ridiculous for another reason entirely, as well - his mask is obviously much smaller than his patch of bad skin, so they shouldn't have hidden anything. And you can see that his eye looks perfectly fine through the hole before he's unmasked. Unless he somehow had the world's fastest allergic reaction to Christine herself when she pulled his mask off, and that's what made him slightly less conventionally attractive, this doesn't make any sense. His makeup job and general demeanor make it seem like he's attempting a Prince Zuko cosplay, but couldn't be bothered making the burn-scarred, inflamed, uneven and big enough to cover a significant portion of his face - i.e. actually noticeable... Tom Hiddleston looked more Phantom-like at the end of Crimson Peak, for Pete's sake! Why didn't they just do the same makeup as the stage show? It's supposed to just be a cinematic version. What's the point of altering it?The movie version of Masquerade sucked. No colors other than black, white, and grey. The Phantom showing up in a very uninspired costume of the ""Red Death"" is almost a relief, and the song was sung way too quickly. LET ME ENJOY THE SONG!There's no sword fight in the musical so that really confuses me about the movieThe execution of 'The Point of No Return' is my biggest issue about the movie. I just assumed the Phantom taking Piangi's place was done with the rule of Shakespeare - if you're wearing a hat you are considered ""in disguise. The ""sexiness"" of it all can't make up for the absence of tension (she knows it's the Phantom right away) or consistency (she should be afraid). Butler wasn't right for his role. Emmy wasn't right for her role. The director wasn't right (could have been worse... could have been directed by Michael Bay). It was all messed up. It was a very big disappointment because I am such a big Phantom fan. Anyway, The POTO film version is more watchable than ""Dracula 2000"".",The Phantom of the Opera

Remember, it is the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera; not a horror flick like Argento's nudity & gore festival or the creepy Bob Englund version.The sets are amazingly beautiful and diverse, which is to be expected as the medium provides for wider latitude than that which can be done live on stage in real-time.All of the familiar songs are there. The Daae role is so much more enjoyable than Brightman's self-promotion (hmm, methinks there's actually some Carlotta in her). While Raoul & the Phantom may be a bit weaker than their original London cast / 1997-ish Toronto cast counterparts, they still do admirably well.If your interpretation of a film musical is ""get drunk & sing in the aisles"" fluffy schlock like Grease, Rocky Horror, or Moulin Rouge; stay home.

At the time many people didn't know what to expect with the hit Broadway play turned motion picture, but in the end were pleasantly surprised, which turned out to be no secret when the film took home the Oscar for best picture. Fast forward to this year and we find Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA taking aim at Oscar gold. And Webber, having mastered the Broadway version, knows a little about this musical, so who better to produce the film? Like CHICAGO, expectations for this musical-turned-motion-picture are somewhat unanswered, but believe me when I tell you that any expectations you might have for this film will undoubtedly be blown away after watching this masterpiece unfold before your eyes.As most people are aware, the story in this hit revolves around a musical genius (Gerard Butler) who is a bit flawed, mostly around his face. Having been abused during his childhood, this ""phantom"" has been hidden for most of his life, mostly because his disfiguring features were too much for people to bare. He chooses to make his appearances by haunting the Paris Opera House from below raging a small war with the house patrons and for this reason he was dubbed ""the phantom of the opera."" But, when he falls fatally in love with the very lovely Christine (Emmy Rossum) his world is literary turned upside down. This desire led the phantom to help mentor Christine's voice, eventually molding her into becoming a thriving young star with endless talent, a feat the phantom was quite proud of. That was until Raoul (Patrick Wilson) arrived onto the scene sweeping Christine off her feet starting a strange love triangle of sorts. But, that love triangle would be broken, leading the phantom down a nasty rampage of jealously that would eventually threaten the very essence of the opera house and the music that built it.In films like PHANTOM, the cast usually takes a backseat to allow the music to shine through and although that is also true in this case, the cast couldn't have been chosen better. Every role played in this film seemed to fit perfectly with the actor which only helped enhance the great story that was taking place. You can definitely see Andrew Lloyd Webber all over this film, but to me his presence was mostly seen in the singing from the cast. Gerard Butler (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) and Emmy Rossum (THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW) were great in their leading roles proving that Webber is some sort of teacher. That's not to say either actor hadn't had previous experience, but when Webber gets his hands on you, you're destined for a great voice. If you don't believe me just listen to one of Sarah Brightman's CD's, who stars in the Broadway version. Either way, all the stars, even Minnie Driver, did a more than adequate job in singing the songs that everyone has grown to love over the years.Outside of Webber's touch when it came to the singing, the rest was left up to Joel Schumacher, who I must say did a marvelous job. I never would have thought Schumacher could pull off a film of this magnitude, but he did it with the help of the masterful Webber. With unbelievable sets to work with, Schumacher (A TIME TO KILL, PHONE BOOTH) was able to capture what this story was about and that was music. Some argue the love story overshadowed the music, but I think the love story only helped bring the music into light. The art direction in this film was so insane with all the people singing and dancing that you can't help but get caught up into the grandeur this film possesses. Unlike previous musicals like CHICAGO, this film thrives on it being one big spectacle every step of the way, right down to the magnificent costumes and vibrant colors involved in almost every scene. But, no aspect of this film may be more important than the way Schumacher shot the flashbacks and flash forwards. Instead of using the typical flashback techniques, Schumacher chose to show flashbacks and flash forwards in black and white, which really helped reinvent the story each time.Even though THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA won't be on the top of most people's list of ""movies to see,"" it should be. Having never seen the Broadway version or watched the previous films based off this hit musical, I really had no idea what to expect from this film. I figured it would just be your ordinary musical, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only was I blown away by the raw production of this film, I was given a gift of music that I will for sure visit time and time again in the future. So, for all those PHANTOM fans, this one's for you; for the rest of you like me, you might become a fan if you give it a chance.",The Phantom of the Opera
336,schumybv,With no doubt one of the best movies ever made,10,15 January 2006,"I have not seen the musical and I have not read the book, but I thought this movie was absolutely beautiful. The costumes, the characters, the plot and most of all the music make this an unforgettable movie.I never would have thought that a musical, which is a remake of a classic story with many unknown actors, would turn out to be such a masterpiece. Joel Schumacher should get a lot of credit for this.I think the best part of the movie is the moment Emmy Rossum starts singing ""Think of me"", the first song of the movie. That is just breathless and it makes you love her right away. The phantom looked really handsome with his mask on and really mysterious and his voice was a bit more rough, which fit in perfectly.What struck me most about this movie was how much sympathy we gain for the phantom. We can sense this sympathy even if we were to listen to the soundtrack without even seeing the movie.This movie does leave us with one question: If we were Christine, who would we choose, Raol or the Phantom?",The Phantom of the Opera
337,Fd-Up-Squirrel,"Dreadfully Boring, but visually stunning",5,9 May 2005,"When I first saw the trailer for Evita and the name ""Madonna"" popped up, I groaned, but after watching it, I was quite impressed, My first impression of Moulin Rouge was Nauseating, yet slightly curious, and I loved it- same with Chicago. Now, the trailer for ""Phantom"" was actually interesting, it looked amazing, colorful, amazing choreography. Upon watching the movie, I was bored out of my mind. Almost every song in the first half of the movie sounded like one long continuation of the same song, the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" would have sounded almost bearable had it not been for the cheesy rock backing track, while the flashback sequences were cheap looking, and some of the singing was, well, bad. Emmy Rossum was stunning though, her voice was unbelievable, and Minnie Driver's performance as Carlotta was a bit of a lift. Other than Rossum's Performance, the only saving Grace is the Settings and Visual Effects, at the beginning of the movie during the Opera's ""transformation"" I was amazed, it was beautiful. The vibrant colors, ornate sets- amazing. While the music is boring, overblown, and monotonous - it's all the same song, just badly remixed, which is one problem I had with ""Evita"" and it seems one of the problems with any Andrew Lloyd Weber Musical. I did find it odd that the Phantom had a wide array of masks that would cover very little of his face, yet when his scars are revealed, they take up almost the entire side of his face!My Advice, RENT the movie, don't buy it, turn on the mute, and put on a CD of your favorite Music (preferably from another musical, or Classical Inspired)",The Phantom of the Opera
338,jomipira,It was already there...,6,28 December 2004,"The Phantom Of The Opera is one of the most popular and long lasting tales of our time. The musical is one of the most perfect work of art of the world stages. But all of that was already there. Now the rest... well the rest is the problem. Emmy Rossum was a fair choice, she can sing and is believable as Christine but the two male leads were a complete miscast. Butler is, for starters, too young, the Phantom is supposed to be about the same age (a bit younger) than Madame Giry, and is obviously not the case. He looks like an 80's playboy and can never fully transmit the scope of emotions the character requires. Patrick Wilson is even worse, having the look and the acting ability of a ""Baywatch"" star. And Schumacher swings between the good (great opening scene)and the mediocre. Still Leroux's play and Webber's music are always worth watching in spite of everything and always transmit a powerful feeling at the end.",The Phantom of the Opera
339,rogue719,Wonderful adaptation from the stage version,8,22 June 2005,"I approached this movie with trepidation after finding that Joel Schumacher was going to direct. After all, he had almost singlehandedly destroyed the Batman franchise handed down to him from Tim Burton. I have to say though, that this is a powerful adaptation from the stage production, wonderfully cast and sensitively done. Excellent cast, with highlights from the ""Big Three - Butler, Rossum and Wilson, but even the supporting cast are delights. Minnie Driver is a standout as the vain diva Carlotta, and Hinds and Callow are wonderfully comic. A strong support performance from Miranda Richardson who was given some additional dialog and scenes that helped move the film along. In the end, though, it's the eternal triangle and strong sensitive performances and yes, wonderful direction from Joel Schumacher to make this movie the real treasure it is. This one is worth owning and watching again and again with someone you love.",The Phantom of the Opera
340,robinhoodfilms,A potentially great film ruined by reckless casting.,4,13 October 2006,"Joel Schumacher should never be allowed to helm a musical again. One of the greatest stage works of all time should have translated beautifully to the screen and would have been far more impressive in the hands of a more talented director (Milos Foreman, Ed Zwick, Mike Nichols). I will concede the film looks great and has the epic, period-piece feel, but how the hell did Schumacher pick Patrick Wilson and Gerard Butler for leads in a musical? Neither of them have the chops for Broadway-caliber singing and even with the aid of studio engineers sweeting their recordings, they fall disgustingly short of acceptable. Emmy Rossum is wonderful in her role Christine with the looks and voice to pull it off. Perhaps they should have cast someone less talented as putting her along side Butler and Wilson make them look even more incompetent. One can't help but wonder if the fact that Schmacher is gay had a bearing on his casting decisions. What other reason could he have gone with mediocrity when bigger, more talented names were available? This could have been one of my favorite films of all time...very disappointing.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have seen the Lon Chaney version of the film.Folks, I just don't understand what is so mesmerizing about the whole 'Phantom' thing, but this movie...how unbelievably boring. I fell asleep To start,there was no one in the cast that I recognized except Miranda Richardson (whom I love). A cast of unknowns. A cast of unknowns who can't act or sing. Maybe the film would have been better had there been acting in it. Everything was over-dramatized for the inaneness of the whole plot. The story line was so ridiculous... 'Angel of Music'?? Theonly reason I gave it a '2' is because Emmy Rossum is very visually appealing.

Then look no further than The Phantom of the Opera. This beautiful crafted movie will have you laughing, crying, and reaching out our loving arms to comfort and care for the Phantom himself. There is no emotion left untouched in this masterpiece of a film. Joel Schumacher has done what the Stage Play only hope to do, it brings directly into the world of Paris in the 1870's and transports into the mind of the characters. You feel as though you are Christine experiencing what she does, when she does. You cry out in anguish with the Phantom when his heart is torn from his chest and stomped on by his muse. You fear for Raoul and the unwavering love he still has for Christine after their childhood romance ended. Gerard Butler is the most moving and convincing character and one can't help but personally feel all of the emotions he portrays throughout the movie. The singing is out of this world and one wonders how come we are only getting to see these marvelous hidden talents now, after so many years of show business for the leads.

343,chersull_99,"Actors and sets were very good, but...",8,17 December 2004,"I saw this show on Broadway. Trying to adapt a perfect play into a movie must be very difficult, so maybe the solution is, other than adapting the scenery for film, why change it? I saw the movie last night and despite what you'll read below I want to say, I DID enjoy the movie and I thought the actors did a fine job. I have loved Minnie Driver in every role she's had and this one is no different. Carlotta is an over-the-top head case, and Ms. Driver plays her beautifully. And the sets are way cool - the moving arms holding the candelabras, the candles emerging from the water and the scene with the chandelier falling were really stunning. Now for my 3 complaints. 1 - In my opinion, the only thing added by the cemetery scene at the end of the film was unnecessary length. We didn't need to be shown again that the Phantom continues to pine away for Christine. The entire story is about his obsession with her. Also, making us look at Raoul old is one thing - but did he have to be old and decrepit? Phantom of the Opera, the play, is spectacular fantasy and reality checks like this don't serve the story. Now, I will admit that I did not read the book, so perhaps this scene was in there. But 99% of us are basing our experience on the play where everyone is young and strong and (mostly) beautiful. The way the play ended, with Christine and Raoul sailing offstage to their future together was perfect. And I never asked myself, ""Gee, I wonder what happened to them after they left the Opera House that day."" 2 - I'm not sure what happened to the song ""Masquerade"", but I thought the Madonna-like dancing was out of place. A little too ""C'mon, Vogue"" for my taste. 3 - My friend tells me that this last gripe is especially petty and that I should use my imagination a little more. Sorry, guess I'm lazy! It bothered me that the Phantom's mask was too small to have hidden the scars we later saw that covered most of the right side of his head - to well behind his right ear. Also, his hair changes to thin, stringy light brown, from thick and black. You never see a wig get pulled off, so how can this be? Continuity errors (if that's what these are called) really bug me. Like the scene when Christine is first taken to the Phantom's lair and there is a lock of hair falling in front of her shoulder that is curled very nicely, then in the next shot, it's barely wavy...then it's curly again. I'm sorry - but this stuff drives me NUTS and I don't understand how a film gets released without someone noticing things like that. Maybe someone who works in the industry can explain to me why this sort of thing happens.Other than these minor complaints, I would recommend seeing this movie, and I intend to return with my daughter once it opens.",The Phantom of the Opera
344,Anaksunamen,I Love this Movie!,8,13 January 2005,"The number one thing that we must remember about This Film that I think separates it from the musical is the fact that Joel made the character of the Phantom in to more of a tragic lover not a madman. Raoul took something from him and the phantom wanted it back at any cost. What would a man not do for love? I was so angry that the Phantom didn't get Christine in the end!! Will they ever make a happyverse version where the Phantom gets everything he wants? cause that would be nice. Anyways the Critics once again have no idea how to critique this film. Its been getting unfair reviews. Its nice to see something classical is still popular. I didn't know Emmy Rossum or Gerard Butler could sing. I hated Raoul played by Patrick Wilson although he sang well. Why would christine pick boring, ordinary,predictable, more likely to cheat, whimpy Raoul over the hot, sexy, powerful, strong, beautiful, seductive, unique and different Phantom? She was foolish. I liked how he redeemed himself in the end, I wonder what happens to him after he escapes the theatre. He is so hot and beautiful. I Love Gerard Butler he did the role justice. the supporting cast was great too. I get a rush every time I hear the music.

345,mraiche1980,I thought this movie adaptation was excellent.,9,11 February 2013,"I have seen the stage production, which was awesome, and I think this adaptation lives up to it. I particularly liked how they took out the supernatural aspect and re-adapted it. The Phantom wasn't a real magician, but he was a very clever illusionist. Also, the combination of satire, drama, and creepiness was excellent, and the singing time vs. talking time really worked.Some people automatically hate this movie because it's a movie adaptation of an excellent Broadway stage performance (while disregarding that Andrew Lloyd Weber was one of the producers). Some people automatically hate this movie because the book has been made into a movie before. Some people, such as my former roommate, whom I'm pretty sure had not read the book, seen the old movie, or watched the stage production, just hate new movies about old things for the sake of hating them.Those people are choosing to be ignorant just to make a point.Another reviewer said it well when he said to watch it with an open mind. It's not the stage production. The story is a little different. Don't expect something that is exactly word-for-word and song-for-song as the stage production, and the singers aren't as good as the original cast (whom I'm pretty sure are retired now), but they are good.",The Phantom of the Opera
346,briancseel,Mishmash of Conflicting Source Material,5,14 July 2013,"What most of America doesn't realize is that Phantom was a an early 20th century French novel before it was anything else. It is a story of a dark Phantom who puts Christine under a spell. One that Raul is eventually able to overcome and the live happily ever after.The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical bastardizes that book and makes it a kind of a beauty and the beast love story that we are all more familiar with.To make a compelling movie, in my opinion, the only available source material with enough depth was the book. Somebody clearly agreed, but they didn't fully commit to adapting the book (can't lose all the fans of the musical) so the movie becomes some kind of hodgepodge of the story from the musical, the story from the book, and a few new things thrown in.The problem with that is the book and the musical have entirely different endings making them incompatible. It is also, even in a 2 hour film, very difficult to fully convey the back story of the Phantom such that you understand who he is, why he does what he does, and how he does what he does. That was probably the best chapter of the book.Skip this movie, read the book, and get the real story.",The Phantom of the Opera
347,nimbleweevil,Delightfully surreal and chillingly human,10,21 January 2005,"Every critic whose reviews I had read hated this movie. The reviews all seemed to say the same things. Flutey leading man. Vacuous leading lady. Sluggish pace and lazy directing. After seeing the movie for myself, the only reason I can guess for all of the negative reviews is that most of the film critics are looking at it purely as a movie, as opposed to a movie-musical, when the two are not separable.(spoilers below) The plot has become common knowledge by now. In the dark cellars of the Paris Opera House lives a man (Gerard Butler) with a disfigured face and far too many names (The Phantom, the Opera Ghost, the Angel of Music, and in the book, Erik) whose only love and passion is music. Then along comes an obscure, orphaned chorus girl named Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) with a voice to warm even in the Phantom's icy heart. He trains her, manipulates the rest of the opera for her benefit, and eventually falls madly in love with her. Problem is, she has a thing for another man, a much better-looking childhood friend named Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Enraged at what he sees as this rejection and betrayal, the Phantom slowly unravels to the point of madness, creating an atmosphere of terror for the entire opera.Rossum gives a stellar performance - her supernatural vocal skills (pronounced the most in ""Think of Me,"" ""All I Ask of You"" and the title song) combined with the childlike innocence of her characters combine to make one of the most charismatic female leads I've ever seen in a musical. Wilson's Raoul, while not quite as compelling, is strong and solid and does a nice job on most of his songs. Minnie Driver is a delightfully hideous Carlotta (the narcissistic prima donna) and Jennifer Ellison, Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, and Victor McGuire provide excellent supporting acting and voices.The complaint I hear most often about this movie is that Gerard Butler, our leading man, doesn't have a voice which does the Phantom justice. I beg to differ. Butler's singing voice, while not technically fantastic, is shockingly human and will chill the spine of any viewer who has ever known the feeling of being an outcast (""This face which earned a mother's fear and loathing...""). Fifteen minutes after leaving the theater, I was still shaking. Butler and Rossum had superb chemistry, as demonstrated in the title song and in ""Point of No Return."" If you have a short attention span, don't like classical music, have perfect pitch, or are looking for an excellent technical movie - don't see this film. Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone.

349,rosie_smash,Phantom It Up,8,2 May 2005,"OK, let's just be honest. If you HATE Andrew Lloyd Webber then you will probably not like this film. Sure, it is melodramatic and over-the-top . . . and that's why I liked it. Joel Schumacher, who I usually think should be kept as far away from a movie camera as humanly possible, seems to understand that there is no way that this story could be adapted to the screen without opulence, and he does a good job.The acting is generally pretty good. Minnie Driver is great as La Carlotta. A Prima Donna in her prime. Patrick Wilson does the best that he can with Raoul, a rather bland character if you ask me. Emmy Rossum has a wonderful singing voice, but she tends to play Christine with only one facial expression.Gerard Butler plays the Phantom, and while many have criticized his singing, I found that it really worked for the film. It might seem weird to say this, but it seemed more realistic and emotional . . . and it had a nice edge to it. Another thing that he was criticized for - although I can't understand why - is that he is too good looking. Now, if this was a film being adapted from the Gaston Leroux novel then yes, the Phantom being attractive would be a very bad thing, but this is Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera (says so right in the title) and his stage musical has always given the Phantom a bit of a sexual side so really it was cast very well. I will say that it does make the love triangle kind of hard to believe because the Phantom is SO attractive and Raoul is, well, not so much . . . but that is just my opinion.So, yes, this film has it's cheesy moments (count the number of dramatic cape swishes!) but it really needs to be over-the-top because the musical on which it is based is as well.

In addition, it is almost drawn into the sweet singing voice of solemn music and appearance actors unintentionally.After having finished watching a movie, it is in the feeling that I want to go to the Opera of Paris that became the stage for.I want to dislike liking it, and everybody to look once.",The Phantom of the Opera

The moment the chandelier crashes to the ground, the theme music bursts in and everything blares into colour was the most jaw dropping piece of cinematography I have seen. Just the look of this film makes it worth seeing. The costumes and scenery are dazzling, as is the contrast between the glittering colours and the sombre black and white.Emmy Rossum who plays Christine took me in with her performance. Her voice was utterly beautiful and the audience themselves begin to feel entranced by the sheer sound of it. Minnie Driver was a hilarious character and added further sparkle to the film.The only problem I found with this film was Gerard Butler is just too damn good looking to be the phantom. This wasn't a problem for me: I loved every moment he was on screen, his acting and voice were superb - but I cannot feasibly see how Christine would pick Raoul over the phantom, even after she sees him without the mask.However, other than that, I cannot think of anything bad about this film.

I understand a film is not a theatrical musical and changes must be made. Some are for the best and could never be done on the stage. The beginning flashback is beyond perfect. Then there are the things they ruined...and they did a REALLY big mistake in this one. I recommend you see it, but if you are a complete Phantom purist be prepared to grit your teeth to get through some of the ""liberties"" they took with the original production.As for the performances...Emmy is an angel. Gerard is Good. As for Miss Minne Driver...well look closely at the credits and you will see one for Carlotta's singing voice. So Minnie didn't even do her own singing!? I expect Carlotta to be fat but I got over that, but I was surprised they hired Minnie when she didn't sing. It took awhile to get comfortable with younger characters in this version (the stage version has the characters about 10 years older then in this film). In all other aspects from the sets, props(I will work till I die to get an actual monkey music box from this film),costumes, all the little touches are spot on.

Although, I felt it to be a bit overdone in the Drama department, it didn't matter. I love this movie. Whatever flaws it has are made up by Emmy Rossum's insane hotness. The background orchestral score sounds great, and the film is a wonderful take off of the stage version. Then again, the stage version doesn't have Emmy Rossum.

354,windfox,"i want to see a FILM, not a recording of the musical",4,12 December 2004,"so why the harsh comments? i find it hard to define this production as a musical, but even harder as a film. there is, seriously, not enough wisdom on camera movement (except for the scene where Phantom goes madly shouting after Raoul and Christine sang All I Asked of You), or on montage (except for the scene where Bouquet was chased and killed by Phantom), or on correctness (why the snow does not melt even on Christine's lips? Schumacher made such a great laugh for me on that). but all in all it lacks originality, and the fact that it is a film does not add to its expressiveness at all, given all the advantages of modern movie techniques. if anyone thinks that this is not of importance because only the music and the sets and the costumes are important for a musical-movie, then Schumacher wastes his time and purpose on making it into a film at all - except for selling it to more people, which i suspect to be the secret desire of ALW.just imagine that in the final scene where the three of them (Christine, Raoul, Phantom) started the trio, they were actually all facing the audience and not singing to each other even they were supposed to be talking to each other. this happens in an opera, not in a film - i personally can't tolerate such laughable bits just because the film is adapted from a musical. i would be better off watching a recording if it was so.Schumacher's Phone Booth was brilliant filming. nothing like that in the Phantom. in fact, there was almost no filming, simply musicalling.and even that was spoiled by the voices of the three, mainly the Phantom. i find no seduction or control, but mere pretence of passion. dear carlotta has appropriately over-driven voice and inappropriately over-driven acting, which is better for a comedy - that's why i end up laughing most of the time during the film.secretly wondering if ALW and Schumacher quarrelled lots on the screenplay, because the film reflects that much.the only good bit was that of Mdm Giry's reflection on Phantom's childhood sufferings. it reminds me that this is after all supposed to be a film. but then, if the audience doesn't really mind whether it is a film stuffed with ALW songs or a ALW musical sandwiched with film sequences, it might be a good thing to catch for the sake of its fame.",The Phantom of the Opera
355,ObiWanDan131,Shines as much as the Chandelia,8,12 December 2004,"I was very wary before entering the cinema to see this film, as I have been disappointed in the past by other musical adaptations e.g. Evita and Chicago. The problem with Chicago was that I found the music hard to interact with, and the plot seemed to just link up the next song and dance. The Phantom of the Opera did not do this and I felt fully involved in the plot. The songs were also full with emotion and really grew to care for the characters in the 2 and half hour running time. Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) who plays Christine was astounding for her age, and you really felt she had grasp this character with both her hands. Patrick Wilson who played Roaul was also very good but I guess his acting character on the stage has given him a lot of experience for this movie. The actress playing Christine's friend called Jennifer Elliston (Brookside) was also very surprising, especially for a British audience who have only seen her in Brookside and singing pop songs. Minnie Driver (Sleepers) was also very funny in her role. The main character that most people wanted to see work was The Phantom who is played by Gerard Butler (TimeLine), I liked this role because you could feel sorry and dread for this character. I think Butler pulled it of very well, his vocals were very effecting and menacing. I found the songs to be very enjoyable with the power ballad 'The Phantom of the Opera' being the most entrancing. One of my main negative points for this movie would be that I think this was more of Andrew Lloyd Webber movie then a Joel Schumacher film. I am a fan of Schumacher work especially Tigerland, Phone Booth and The Lost Boys, I would of liked to see more of his touch in the film. However, I guess making one of the most popular stage musicals its hard to be personal, as you want to please the fan base. I highly recommend this film if you like to escape into a world of song, danger and romance.

The problem with Chicago was that I found the music hard to interact with, and the plot seemed to just link up the next song and dance. The Phantom of the Opera did not do this and I felt fully involved in the plot. The songs were also full with emotion and really grew to care for the characters in the 2 and half hour running time. Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) who plays Christine was astounding for her age, and you really felt she had grasp this character with both her hands. Patrick Wilson who played Roaul was also very good but I guess his acting character on the stage has given him a lot of experience for this movie. The actress playing Christine's friend called Jennifer Elliston (Brookside) was also very surprising, especially for a British audience who have only seen her in Brookside and singing pop songs. Minnie Driver (Sleepers) was also very funny in her role. The main character that most people wanted to see work was The Phantom who is played by Gerard Butler (TimeLine), I liked this role because you could feel sorry and dread for this character. I think Butler pulled it of very well, his vocals were very effecting and menacing. I found the songs to be very enjoyable with the power ballad 'The Phantom of the Opera' being the most entrancing. One of my main negative ponts for this movie would be that I think this was more of Andrew Lloyd Webber movie then a Joel Schumacher film. I am a fan of Schumacher work especially Tigerland, Phone Booth and The Lost Boys, I would of liked to see more of his touch in the film. However, I guess making one of the most popular stage musicals its hard to be personal, as you want to please the fanbase. I highly recommend this film if you like to escape into a world of song, danger and romance. If you not a fan of constant singing then you might be wary, but give it a chance. 8 out of 10 ps. i still do not know how Chicago won Best Picture.",The Phantom of the Opera
357,Rocking DH,"It's a different Phantom, yet close to the stage production. Slightly off.",6,27 December 2004,"I was intrigued by the trailer for this film. I could not tell who had been cast in the title role of the Phantom. The sets looked lavish and the production numbers promised to be top-notch, with some details fleshed out as films can do.I grew up being taken to Broadway shows at an early age. I still remember wanting to see ""Camelot"" when I was three and lived in New York City (with Burton and Andrews). To this day, I cry when I hear a good soprano and I have a knack for hearing tunes and picking them out in the correct key. I saw Michael Crawford create the Phantom in London many years ago, and I took my mother to see him do it again in New York. His vocal range and power are truly awe-inspiring for me, reflecting much discipline and talent.I saw the film version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" last night. Technically, yes, the film does reveal who the Phantom is and how he came to live in the Opera House, a nice touch. It also shows the backstage chaos of an operatic production, really putting the viewer in the middle of the mêlée. The story followed that of the play, for the most part. And the familiar score was there.As for casting, I still wonder why Michael Crawford was not cast as the Phantom, although I have read that the choice was Andrew Lloyd Webber's. The young lady who portrayed Christine, Emmy Rossum, has a beautiful voice and she handled the difficulties of the role nicely--far better than Brightman, in my opinion. That she is rather young--17/18--by other comments, is not important to me. The role is that of an ingénue, an innocent, who comes of age. Ms. Rossum is extremely talented for one so young.I have read much about the Phantom needing to be ""younger"" for audience appeal. Hmm. To me, the Phantom could be any age. An older man's fondness for his protégé, translating to a desire to own his creation, yet realizing, as a parent, that young people must take wing and leave the nest, once given a decent start on life. Much more interesting plot-wise for me than a competition between a deformed, unemployed creative genius and handsome, wealthy, titled aristocrat of the same general age, dueling it out like two young bucks clonking heads. I noted Butler's deeper voice and sensed that some keys had been lowered, perhaps. The giveaway for me was in, specifically, ""The Music of the Night"" where the Phantom has the first high note that is held impossibly long. Argh. I squirmed, ate my popcorn, and squirmed some more. I swear, it sounded flat. Just not THERE. Also, there is a delivery that Butler has that, well, it's not quite singing all the time. Raspy? I do not know the background of this man. The Phantom is an extremely difficult role. He lends credulity to it, given the differences in singing ability/acting technique, but the film would have been a much stronger vehicle with Michael Crawford in the role. Sorry. I disagree with the casting on this part. It also was obvious throughout the film that the synching was off. The characters' mouths did not match the singing frequently. And that drives me nuts. Surely for a production that went to such great lengths to get the opera house right, the costumes, the choreography, one would hope they could polish and brush up the technical details. Oh, well. Patrick Wilson handled the young, aristocratic lover role nicely, creating a credible third side of the love triangle. Ah, but did he really jump while riding bareback? As a horse owner, I noted that there was a nice edit NOT showing Christing getting on the horse, and that he remounted from a tombstone.I was surprised that Minnie Driver portrayed Carlotta, the diva. I truly did not recognize her. And I did not know she could sing. Then I learned that she did not--hers was the only role dubbed. She certainly portrayed an over-the-top diva. (Is there any other kind?) For some reason, I found the movie overly long, almost dragging in points--""Masquerade"" for one. It was almost too much, disturbing the pacing. Perhaps it was trying to build suspense. I squirmed in my seat a few times and looked at my watch. I do not remember feeling this way when viewing the stage production, which the film pretty faithfully followed. The difference? Ah, Michael Crawford is all that I can figure. There are such intangible commodities as charisma and star power--and Crawford oozes both--as well as vocal control and RANGE.If one had not seen the stage version of the ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Michael Crawford as the Phantom, one might not notice much difference from a touring version of the show and the film. Alas, I have been treated to the best of fine wines with Crawford's version, and it is hard not to taste the film's version of the Phantom as slightly off, in pitch and key. Just slightly.",The Phantom of the Opera
358,Anarchy_1993,Great movie! My favorite Musical movie,8,25 May 2008,"Wow. I was surprised at how good this one was. There were some flaws, but which movie doesn't have flaws? My first complaint is that they spent too much time singing, and not enough time using the original plot from the book. The only song that deserved enough time was the one that goes ""The phantom of the opera is here, inside your mind"" (love that song. Have it on my Ipod :P). Because they sang too much, it left holes in the plot that remain unanswered. So what do they fill these holes with? Thats right. More singing. They completely left out the torture chamber and ""Le Persan"" (I read the book in french). They also ignore the fact that the phantom DIES at the end.It appears that chronological order doesn't matter either. First of all, Joseph Buquet dies at the BEGINNING not the MIDDLE. Second of all, when the chandelier falls, its when the Carlotta is singing and her voice turns into that of a toad.Well, thats all i have to say. Still, it was a good movie. NOT a waste of time. (actually u might wanna fast forward through the parts wen they sing cuz some of them are like 10 minutes)",The Phantom of the Opera
359,peter-c-odlaug,Fantastic spectacle that almost hits its intended notes,8,6 January 2005,"First off let me say that this movie is very lavishly done. The sets, costumes and photography are beautiful to look at. The music is well...if you've seen the stage version or have the original soundtrack then you've heard this shows' music before. That being said, the repetition of the melodies starts to get very monotonous but the movie moves along and provides ample distraction. Gerarld Butler's ""Phantom"" is very pleasing to look at. His swagger and motions show that this character is in control of himself. Mr. Butler struggles with his singing sometimes but barrels through and forces the notes to have a more primal intensity than would be expected. Emmy Rossum as ""Christine"" sings wonderfully. Hers is the best voice in the movie. Patrick Wilson as ""Rauol"" carries his part and his songs well. He doesn't force the notes like Butler but has a very fluid delivery that puts you at ease. All in all, this is a very good attempt to film the stage version of the Phantom. If you've seen the stage show, then you pretty much seen this movie but the sets, costumes and lavish attention to detail and the cast more than make up for the repetition of multiple viewings.One minor annoyance for me was when the Phantom was unmasked, his bad side in the light made him look like Gerard Depardieu was singing as the Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was yawning after 10 minutes or so into the movie, and hearing the theme music for the 4012045:th time in my life didn't send the shivers down my spine as people keep saying.I find the hours spent on this movie nearly totally wasted, except for the fact that, as I said - the scenes are nice, remind me a bit of Coppola & Polanski.The rest is horrid.",The Phantom of the Opera
361,bubs1,Thoroughly Enjoyable.,9,4 January 2005,"CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS....The big screen version of Phantom Of The Opera is a delight on the big screen.I absolutely ADORED the stage version seeing it 4 times in 2 different states. The music is fantastic, the story is fantastic and the singing was fantastic on stage. It was great to see the production able to expand, not being limited to the dimensions of the stage. There were some notable differences in storyline between stage and screen, noticeably the Chandelier drop, which occurred on stage at interval. Here it is shown during ""Don Yuan Triumphant"". Actually makes a bit more sense here than on stage.Only one real downer in the movie. Some of the dubbing of the singing was quite poor (particualy in 2 spots). Also the Phantom's singing voice was a tad weak in the lower registers. Considering Christine has been 'well taught', maybe another Phantom would have worked better. However saying that, the Phantom's voice in the high register was strong and excellent, a real necessity in some of the pieces.All the rest of the voice talent was excellent. The songs were excellent. The story was well told and sufficiently expanded for the screen. And the orchestral work was of course top notch. If you have seen the Phantom on stage, see this version. You will thoroughly enjoy it. If you like stage shows in general but haven't seen Phantom, you will certainly enjoy the movie. After all, Phantom of the Opera is the show that all stage shows try to imitate (and never succeed). If you live for Rap music or Heavy Metal music only, they use whatever small amount of brain matter you have and stay away from this. Better still, throw yourself off the nearest skyscraper you can find and do the world a favour.SCORE 9/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
362,s33a2d17,very Enjoyable,7,14 May 2005,"Beautiful costumes & stages, wonderful singing, but the acting is not that impressive - which is fairly common in this type of movie, of course.The typecasting of Patrick Wilson in the role of Raoul did little for me to care for him or his 'love' for Christine and the phantom wasn't mysterious enough by far - not really a phantom, more like a squatter in the Opera everyone knows about and nobody cares about - not even when it becomes obvious some should.None of that is really important, of course, this movie is an opera in itself, and delivers what that requires: a little suspense, a lot of romance, little talking and a lot of singing with impressive music. And most of that is done very well. There is one point where Webber makes a painful mistake by including a synthesizer in the score, but thankfully that is only once. However, my overall feeling about the music is more like'oh yeah, heard that before' and sometimes even: 'hear that before, but better'. Can't put my finger on it right now, but there are several points where the music and singing feels 'cheap'. Does that make sense? In part, the singing of the phantom may be to blame for that.However, the entire movie is definitely enjoyable and I had a great time. If you're into this type of movie more than I am, you'll definitely rate it above my 7.",The Phantom of the Opera
363,SHADO57,One beautiful movie,10,6 January 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber outdid himself as producer of this film version of his musical play (operetta?). I do not believe I have ever seen a more opulent film anywhere, anytime! I can see quite a few Oscar nominations for this film, including: best costumes, sound, editing, cinematography, adaptation. Probably even a few I haven't thought of.I have not seen such a rich-looking film in many a year, if ever. The color and scenery are way above par for a film of this kind. The actors do their own singing (a condition set by Lloyd Webber); the only exception is Minnie Driver (but she sings a new song in her own voice over the closing credits). This movie sounds great! Perhaps I shall see it again -- certainly I'll be buying the DVD! In a word, this movie is GORGEOUS!",The Phantom of the Opera
364,calgarian3432,"Sounds great, looks good, and written badly",6,10 March 2005,"After watching the film, I found it was as good, and as bad as expected. The music is great, but at the same time you won't hear anything great that wasn't given away in ads and trailers. I think with musicals, giving away the best music outside the film, is kind of like giving away the plot. Basically, the only significant singing you didn't already hear (before going) is them singing pure two-way dialog. Of course a musical should be filled with music, but please don't think you can take any two-way conversation, and turn it into a duet. The ""Sound of Music"" is an example of how a musical *should* work in singing and dancing. Only emotional and significant character dialog should be put to music (in addition to ""true"" songs).As we know from the small size of the mask, the phantom is hardly seriously disfigured (I'm not revealing anything here that's not given away in the movie billboards). He wears it like Batman's mask; a kind-of fashion statement. The key characters are hardly developed. I won't give away the Phantom's back story. But, I will tell you it's pretty lame. Remember this film is not the same as the 1943 film, which was not a musical, and did have a clear motivation for the Phantom.One thing that really let me down, was how small the opera was. I was expecting a huge opera building, with lots of space, lots of crevasses. After all, a guy is hiding out here for many years, without detection. Turns out it's a pretty small place. OK, maybe it is as big as the ""real"" thing. But, I don't want reality. I want fantasy. I want bigger than life. By nature, the ""Phantom's Opera House"" aught to be truly grand. It should be the kind of place where you'ld be afraid to be in at night. The kind of place you could get lost in.Now, I know my review sounds like I'm dumping on the movie. But, keep in mind I can't convey the great music, and good look, which you know about, before going to the movie. If what you've seen and heard is worth seeing for 2hours, then go see it. But please, do not see this video-cassette on a little TV. Catch it only in a theater, or on an entertainment system with great sound/video quality.

The phantom is a hunky hot deformed man (Gerard), his protégé is a young innocent virgin songbird!

366,chrishn,"All in all, a great experience!",7,17 January 2005,"The movie can be divided into parts.Part one (vote 5 of 10)It starts out really well, with an effective introduction where the stage is set. We are introduced to the main characters, and we hear them sing for the first time. It's clear from the start that nothing in this movie is cheap. The Paris opera ""populaire"" is beautifully created in an overdone and almost vulgar fashion. Everyone can sing, and especially the main characters have beautiful voices (their own voices by the way!). Right from the start the drama is build up and you start to enjoy yourself, but then it fades out. Next comes an hour which isn't bad, but it is ""out of sync"". In this hour we hear some of the background stories. Two of the main characters begin to fall in love and everyone is talking about the Phantom. It's calm before the storm, but unfortunately the music and the singing stays at a very voluminous level, which isn't appropriate considering the actual story in this part. The link between the story and the music becomes disharmonious. Don't get me wrong. The music is wonderful in itself, but it has to fit with the context in which it is sung. During this hour my opinion of the movie was gradually declining, and I started to think that either the music had to settle down, or the story had to pick up the pace. Fortunately the ladder happened.Part two (vote 9 out of 10)The final hour was one long awesome final. Not only did it save the movie, but it also turned it into a great experience. The Phantom is so effectively portrayed that you don't know what to think of him. One minute he's a psychopath, the next minute you feel sorry for him. Christine is torn between the bestial Phantom and the oh-so-tender Raoul. Through the hour, suspense is build up towards a great climax. The voluminous singing fits perfectly to the dramatic story in this part, and everything melts together.Put together the three parts justify a vote of 7. Because of the great final hour you also forgive the movie for its flaws during the first hour.The actingThe main characters are the most important, and they do an excellent job. All the characters are stereotypical in the sense, that you quickly know whether they are pure of heart (Christine and Raoul) or torn between a dark and a good side (The Phantom). However, just because they are easy to figure out, doesn't mean it's easy to know what to think of them. I didn't make up my mind about the Phantom until the end, because the movie succeeds so well in portraying both his sides. The interesting drama is between the Phantom, Christine, Raoul and Madame Giry (the woman who nurtured both the Phantom and Christine). The rest of the characters are so weak that they don't really matter. The movie tries to introduce some funny sidekicks in the shape of a Diva and the Opera managers, but it fails.To sum it all up: If you like a great drama, combined with beautiful music and fantastic settings, then go see this movie. I you feel - like i felt - that the first hour is awkward, then worry not. The last hour is so great that it will leave you gasping for air.",The Phantom of the Opera
367,KvMauB,Can't Help Comparing It to the Beloved Stage Version,8,23 December 2004,"I really loved The Phantom of the Opera and I'm so glad that there is at last a film version (which means that eventually there will be a DVD version. wooHOO!). Honestly, I still think I prefer the various live on-stage versions that I've seen, but this is a great and worthy film adaptation. The sets were gorgeous and I especially enjoyed the much closer, more intimate distance from the performers that you can get with film. The casting was great, with really good young singers. I liked the new addition of some swashbuckling fights too. Though I personally loved the Phantom of the Opera film and recommend it, I based my IMDb score of 8 on what I thought of it as a stand alone film. The music of course is the best part of Phantom of the Opera. I really enjoy every song, and even cry for some. However I felt there were just a couple of awkward moments that did not translate seamlessly from stage to film.

I came to the movie with no baggage, as I had not seen the stage version and only knew the main songs (due to my sister who used to play them on the piano). My sister recommend I watch the movie, when she was in Japan she loved the movie so much she went to see it 3 times! Gorgeous costumes, magnificent sets and wonderful acting talent! Emmy Rossum is SO pretty, her dress she wears during her performance of 'Think of Me' is stunning, I also loved her dress in the Masqurade scene, that was beautiful. She has that perfect fresh face innocence and her voice was also pretty. Her relationship with the Phantom is very well played out and as we know the ladies love the boy from he wrong side of the tracks.Gerard Butler was wonderful as the Phantom, made him a sympathetic character and you can just see his character descending into madness, a very dark character indeed. Gerard Butler is a very sexy man by the way! Minnie Driver's La Carlotta was also excellent, high camp but very funny, the outfits alone!

As a film i found it quite mesmerising, from the music to the lavish set pieces and costumes. I prefer it to Chicago and Evita, although those films were much better received by critics and the box office. Gerard Butler plays the phantoms emotions to a tee,through his acting and singing we get to feel his longings, pain and torture, this helps us to see him as a human (and it doesn't hurt that he looks pretty good!). Emmy Russom is enchanting as the young, innocent and sensual Christine,( although i couldn't help inwardly shouting at the screen 'pick the phantom!') Well i guess his odd murdering habit put her off!!. As an average movie goer and being no musical expert i have to say i was more than happy with all the vocal performances, especially Gerard and Emmy's which i thought were quite good, and i think some of the criticism towards their vocal abilities have been a little harsh.

Actually, its predecessors have been good too, but the newest, in my opinion, reaches perfection. Gerry Butler is, indeed, a magnificent Phantom, and Emmy Rossum, although very young, excels as Christine Daae. This movie made me cry, it impressed me beyond words, and the music still floats inside my soul. Although different than the book, and perhaps the original play, this film keeps the essence, the beautiful love story, and the musical motives. Gerard Butler is such an awesome presence on the screen, that you feel him right there, beside you. The music, and the way it is sung by these talented actors, manages to absorb you, and, somehow, change the very fabric of your soul. Maybe this happens because it describes a Gothic love story, that combines fiction with our own little reality. In my opinion, this is the most important musical ever made, a sublime work of art, proving that art and love won't ever perish.

The Gothic fantasy romance story is what always appealed to me. Schumacher has had a share of successful Gothic tales like Lost Boys, Flatliners, even the Batman movie. The film version has really beautiful sets, costumes, photography, effects. I felt as though, however, that there were far too many moments taken from other films... the mainly Moulin Rouge... but some of the others were reminiscent of Batman, Titanic, and Pirates of the Caribbean. In my opinion I didn't want to be thinking of other movies when I was watching Phantom of the Opera. It didn't make the movie bad but it didn't make it original either. I also thought that the acting was rather mediocre... nothing very captivating... but occasionally there was an emotional gesture or moment that hit the right chord.

375,emma_crawfordgreene,A Revision of a Former Review,1,29 October 2005,"There have been many film adaptations of Gaston Leroux's novel """"The Phantom of the Opera"" over the years in various different forms. Some make it more faithful to the original novel (aka Lon Chaney) and others couldn't be further from it (William Finely).This version is based not on the book; but Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 version of the book. In contrast to Andrew Lloyd Webber's previous film version of ""Evita"" (in reality, he has put some of his actual stage versions on film, including ""Phantom"". Sadly most of the films, with the exception of ""Cats"" and ""Joseph"", are not releasable to the public) - which was more in the spirit of its stage counterpart, this one couldn't be further from its stage counterpart, let alone the book.Most of the film's faults should be accredited to the show's composer himself, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, who it must be said, was one of the worst possible choices to direct this film. Why Andrew Lloyd Webber chose him, after many numerous Hollywood directors (some who indeed would have made the film like the stage version) wanted to do it, I shall never know. But what is evident is how painfully aware the faults shine throne in the film and severely undermine the spirit of the stage show.Previously his big ""blockbuster"" film was his adaption of the Tim Burton ""Batman"" film and sequel was considered the flop of all the film adaptations of the ""Batman"" story. Sadly ""Batman Forever"" echoed ""Phantom2004"" with its overdone, too colorful, gay looking atmosphere - in filming, costuming, script, casting, and also film editing.Also, although true Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version of ""Phantom"" is highly romantic, it is also balanced with the correct amounts of mystery, horror, and comedy (surprisingly enough), at least in the early productions it was. But as the years progressed the stage show went through a lot of change and subsequently was tarted up more - which from my view is wrong.It must be stated that the actors cast as the characters (although many miscast in their roles) are not horrible by themselves. Not in the slightest.Gerard Butler for one, whom after seeing in the films he did prior to ""Phantom"" (which, from my opinion, are his best, and I mean that sincerely); ""Dear Frankie"", ""Attila"", ""The Cherry Orchard"", ""Mrs. Brown"" (although a small part, he nonetheless captures the screen once you see him, but at the same time does not override his other cast members) to name but a few, shows he is an amazing actor with a lot more realism than many modern day film actors do today. This is to his credit.But sadly, when miscast in a part (and let's face it, even the best of actors, either in stage or film have this same problem): it plays up the film's problems not good points. However, I will say this in regards to Gerard Butler's performance, and I don't blame him for the acting or the costume he wore (again I repeat, that is due to the fault of Joel Schumacher), although perhaps he could have made Erik less more an overly romantic figure and tried to play up the horror and drama more. But in a master star turn, Gerard also has a few bright spots that echo his predecessors in the role of Erik. His changing Carlotta's throat medicine and the scene of him guiding Christine down on a horse hearkens back to Lon Chaney, in the scene when Erik kills Buquet, in an eerie resemblance, is an exact copy of Robert Englund (this is probably, as well as possibly the FL, is where Gerard tries to play up the drama. Thankfully!), and even his phrasing (not singing) in ""Music of the Night"" is equal to Michael Crawford's performance.However his singing was a real handicap in the film. Although he indeed brought passion and great depth of feeling to the role (of which he should be praised for also), his singing technique was unrefined and untrained, in regards to Patrick Wilson (who is a Broadway stage actor) who played Raoul. But it should be noted that his voice, although unrefined and ""raw"", does indeed have great potential.Personally in my view, had the film been remade as a modern day adaption (like ""The Phantom Lover"") and had the director been different and he was a bit older and more trained singing wise; he would easily be in the big leagues of the more infamous Phantoms that critics and public love (Lon Chaney, Charles Dance, Claude Raines, and yes Michael Crawford) alike.Again many have already seen this film and love it: which is their right to voice their opinion. But as for me; if you take into account that this is hardly at all like the stage version, let alone the spirit of the piece (people will disagree but then they do so to many other film adaptations of musicals); then the film has to be given a rating of 3.Indeed this film, although hailed as popular, blockbuster; it must be noted is one of the worst adaptations of a stage musical ever. And that is the sad truth of it, even if people deny it.",The Phantom of the Opera
376,jeha-2,Beautiful Film--Not Sure Why It Flopped,10,1 July 2008,"This version of the Phantom of the Opera was fantastic and everything about it was gorgeous. It had all the colors and scenery and music, without the trippy headache you get from something like Moulin Rouge, and the singing was absolutely awesome. Gerard Butler did a great job as the Phantom and I loved his singing voice, despite his not being a trained singer. He had a raspy, singing-with-a-sore-throat kind of voice (he reminded me of Sting quite a bit). Emmy Rossum's voice was beautiful and angelic, but just a little too dainty--you have to turn your volume up a bit to hear her sometimes. Patrick Wilson's Raoul was excellent and he was a dazzling romantic hero, and it was great to see the role be taken from a minor role, like in the stage play, to something this awesome. I do not understand why this film flopped at the box office because everything about it was right.",The Phantom of the Opera
377,silverwing-001,The Phantom is awesome no matter how hard Joel tries to destroy it,7,14 September 2011,"I love Phantom of the Opera. Its a classic tale and musical which its themes and romance still do well in modern audiences. The writing is great as well as the music is breath taking. All you have to do is honestly follow the story of the play accurately and treat it with respect and its a shoe-in for being an awesome adaptation to the screen......unless you give it to Joel Shumacher and he tries to destroy it.Everything he adds detracts from the greatness that is the Phantom of the Opera. First off casting actors that have little to no experience singing. Especially the PHANTOM. Sorry Gerard, your an awesome actor but your singing wasn't meant for the phantom of the opera. The Phantom is supposed to be a master of music and you sound more like an owl hooting to rich classical music. I will admit when the music gets a little darker his voice is a little more appropriate but not by much. He acts the role well but does not sing it well. The others I have minor critiques but I thought the performances given to Raul and Christine were fair. It could have been better but they were fair.Second off he adds a scene that is not in the play or novel that makes no sense at all. In the movie he adds a sword fight between Raul and the Phantom. Its a good fight scene I'll admit but it ends with Raul winning and about to kill the Phantom but Christine stops him by saying ""not like this"". Then literally in the next scene they decide to trap him at the Opera and have Police shooting him and using Christine as bait. So it basically says ""Lets not kill him now while we have a chance with a sword but later when the phantom can plan with guns instead"". Its stupid and if Joel gave a crap he would have one additional scene maybe explaining why but like good ole Joel he doesn't give a hoot.My third major problem is with the revealing of the Phantoms face. Magically he loses a quarter of his hair when its revealed and he turns blonde instead of a dark brown. I mean really Joel you couldn't get your own main actors make up job right. REALLY!!!! There is other nit picks I have but honestly the movie is still a good way to experience the Phantom of the Opera without traveling to New York and seeing it on Broadway. Its not bad and its probably one of Shumacher's better films but this is what happens when you give a masterpiece to a hack. You get something mediocre and the Phantom deserves more than that. So all in all I gave it a seven out of ten. If you can watch this on netflix or from a friend. If Joel stops making money for his crappy films then he will stop making crappy films.",The Phantom of the Opera
378,movito72,"Beautifully shot, with glorious music and acting",9,19 December 2004,"In this majestic, beautifully photographed powerhouse of a film, Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic musical is brought to life by a youthful cast of unknowns and directed with expertise by Joel Schumacher. This movie contains more life and zest in every frame than the majority of films released this past year. It is never boring, and the beautiful frames on screen made me want to take them and put them on my wall, staring in wonder at the amazing capabilities of a camera. The movie looks good, feels good, and boy does it sound good. The songs, some of the most popular Broadway tunes ever written, are presented here in all their glory and spectacle. There is no question that without the music the rest of the film would have been as useless and grotesque as the covered half of the mysterious Phantom's face.Emmy Rossum (Sean Penn's daughter in ""Mystic River"") gives a wondrous performance as Christine, and her voice mesmerizes with every note. She is aided immeasurably by Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") and Gerard Butler (""Attila"") as Raoul and the Phantom, respectively, rival suitors for Christine's hand. Minnie Driver is also quite funny in a supporting role as ""Prima Donna"" La Carlotta, the star of the opera house. She is the only member of the cast that does not actually sing, which makes the performances by the others all the more astounding due to the fact that these incredible voices belong to the people on screen.Schumacher (""Phone Booth,"" ""Batman Forever"") directs with a sure eye, making each new sequence more elaborate and heartfelt than the previous one. His young stars give such raw, powerful turns that it gives the film a real emotional depth that helps it rise above other movie musicals to become one of the most entertaining motion pictures I've seen this year, and a better adaptation than ""Chicago"" by a long shot. This is a truly fun ride, and I would recommend it to anyone who longs to see a movie that will touch them and fill their hearts with great music and effects, as well as being pleasing to the eye.",The Phantom of the Opera
379,mallen92506,Didn't mind it at first...but now I think about it....,5,28 March 2013,"THE GOOD I'm gonna state the obvious thing first in that the film itself looks gorgeous, it's very grand and full of epic spectacles and amazing set pieces. Some of the songs are done very nicely, Wishing you were Somehow Here Again and Prima Donna spring to mind, others were OK. The acting from some of the actors are alright, Emmy Rossum is the acting highlight of the film. And hearing the score with a full orchestra is a plus in my book.THE BAD There are two main problems with the film. One is Gerard Butler, his acting is substandard but his singing is appalling, it's so monotone and flat that you can't help but mock it. The other big problem is Joel Schumacher, his directing is poor indeed. The choices he made with the characters sucked all like-ability and interest out of them. Take Carlotta for example, in the stage show she comes across as a brilliant singer who wants perfection and is overwhelmed when something goes wrong. In the film she's played more like a spoilt brat with an over-the-top voice who do anything to get in the spotlight and the other characters encourage it! Other problems include the songs being turned into dialogue and dialogue being turned into either whispering or growling by Butler. The look of the Phantom doesn't look right either, the mask is more a fashion item and the deformation looks more like a slight burn.THE BOTTOM LINE A lot to rant about for me but not enough time to write it all. Altogether there's enough treats for the eyes to make me glad I saw it once, just in future I might put the mute on.",The Phantom of the Opera
380,hrothgar19,A masterpiece,10,27 January 2010,"I expected to be disappointed after seeing the West End show in London and buying the original cast recording. Oh no - Joel Schumacher quickly grabbed my attention with the fantastic Wizard of Oz-style cut from 1870 to 1919 and held it for two hours. Lloyd Webber co-wrote the screenplay and added new incidental music, so his original vision isn't in the least tainted.Emmy Rossum doesn't sing in the same flowery style as Sarah Brightman - maybe that's a good thing for a movie - but is luminous as Christine Daaé. Gerard Butler is a completely different Phantom to the stage show - very little makeup, vulnerable, sympathetic and frankly a lot more sexy and appealing than Patrick Wilson's foppish Raoul. Just look at his face when he's seated at the organ in his lair and Christine approaches from behind, or as he's listening to Christine and Raoul on the roof of the Opera. There is some fine acting throughout, but Rossum's and Butler's is absolutely impeccable and the theatre managers provide excellent comic relief. The sets are stunning throughout.There are a few changes from the theatre version - the whole thing is a story within a story (I won't give too much away), the chandelier crash features in a different (and more logical) context and the rehearsal of ""Don Juan Triumphant"" is cut, but it never worked for me on stage and I suspect Lloyd Webber wisely decided it was pointless. There is also a little more back story and a sword fight replaces some of the theatre pyrotechnics.The ""play within a play"" scenes work much better on film because it's readily apparent which ones have an audience present. The performance of ""Don Juan"", a bit muddled on stage, is gripping here, as the rest of the cast and the police watch the performance paralysed by indecision, and the Phantom is genuinely seductive. Likewise, the transformation from rehearsal to performance after the first verse of ""Think Of Me"" is something that can only be shown clearly on film.Other standout scenes are the famous one on the roof of the Opera, where Butler's utterly heartbroken Phantom listens in to ""All I Ask Of You"" and ""Music Of The Night"" in the Phantom's lair, where the extent of his obsession with Christine becomes clear.The only way the film could have been improved would be for Christine to elope with the Phantom in the final scene ;-) The critics didn't like this film, but I suspect most of them weren't familiar with the stage show or the music. This is clearly a film version of the original musical, and Schumacher was suitably restrained from making any more changes to the original. In time I expect it will become a classic.",The Phantom of the Opera
381,SeanPennModernPowerhouse,The Most Successful Musical of All-Time is Here Inside My Mind!,10,5 August 2006,"It's finally here! Andrew Lloyd Webber's legendary masterpiece of a stage musical is here on the big screen, and it sounds and looks beautiful. I thought that with Joel Schumacher directing that this was going a total camp-fest, but Shumacher manages to cast his 'BATMAN & ROBIN' shadow aside and produce something so astonishingly breathtaking.Gerard Butler is excellent as The Phantom, but I can't help thinking how wonderful it would have been to see Michael Crawford reprise the role. Emmy Rossum is outstanding as Christine. Emmy, Sarah Brightman would be proud. Patrick Wilson is good as Raoul, but he's definitely the weakest of the three leads. But, Minnie Driver (as Carlotta), Cairan Hinds (as Firmin) and Simon Callow (as Andre) are without a doubt the best in show, stealing every scene they are in.Although I loved it, I have to say that non-Lloyd Webber fans may find this a little bit too much.",The Phantom of the Opera
382,lewboskian,This one should be remade,7,30 October 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is filled with fantastic imagery and delightful cinematography. The actors who play Christine and Raul were surprisingly very good. Their singing was much stronger than I expected and we will definitely see their careers get a kickstart from this film. I have been a fan of the staged version of the musical for years and I never tire of listening to the breathtaking soundtrack from the original London cast, nor seeing the musical itself. Its one of the few musicals that gives me chills when the first few chords of that haunting organ music is played.However there are a few weak points in the film version. First of all, there are certain things that work for the stage as there are for the theater, but don't mix. That's the problem with some musicals when they get transfered to film, the director tries to put every element of a staged play on film rather than allowing the film to achieve its own identity, like Chicago, or Singing in the Rain.For example, choreography designed for the stage doesn't always play out with the same effect on film. It seems to be more of a distraction in the Masquerade and Past the Point of No Return scenes. The dancers in Don Juan look like gay pirates, and its just plain annoying and comical to watch them twirling. Masquerade feels like a scene designed for extras or failed off-Broadway actors and actresses. Do I really need to watch masked people acting like mimes? And being able to see the backstage part of the opera really detracted from the overall atmosphere of the film Its clear that Joel Schumacher sees directing as more of a hobby than a job. He's willing to keep his experimental camera work in the film, even when it makes the scene crappy. Occasioanly he jumps the film around from scene to scene so quickly, that there are times I feel like I'm watching a candid video from some high school field trip at an opera house rather than a movie.And then there is the Phantom. Not a bad actor, but his voice was so weak that he had no business playing the Phantom. I recall watching the HBO special, where Andrew Lloyd Weber was being interviewed and he admitted to telling Joel Schumacher that any actors he casted would have to do there own singing. Big Mistake. Some people naturally can't sing, SO DON'T LET THEM!!!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie must be tone-deaf! Sir Weber is arguably one of the finest composers of all time, but the movie productions of his musicals usually fall way short of their potential and I think he needs to let the director have more control and he should also let more experienced film producers have control of the film versions. I think this film could be remade with stronger actors and actresses. There's also dozens of directors that could have made this movie much more romantic and engaging. It's alright to see the movie to hear the sweet songs of a tragic story come to life, but this isn't really an Oscar worthy film by any stretch of the imagination, nor one worth owning or watching more than once every so often.",The Phantom of the Opera
383,Jweybrew,The Shadow of a Ghost,6,4 May 2005,"Okay, so I've seen the movie at the theater, I've bought the soundtrack CD and the DVD; that's enough. I've been a Phan since 1962, when I read the original novel of The Phantom of the Opera in paperback and was captured by its blood-and-thunder melodrama, romance and chills. I've seen/collected most of the film adaptations of the novel- - -none of them have yet to capture the true Opera Ghost. The Weber/Rice musical comes closest in spirit (!), if not story, but has always erred in downplaying the Phantom's deformity as well as his insane genius. The novel's Phantom of the Opera is an angel with the face of death and the mind of a devil; the new film's Phantom is a petulant, whiny understudy of some nondescript Opera Ghost, who can't even hold his own in a sabre duel with a younger, dumber adversary. The other performers are equally vapid, if attractive and photogenic.On the very positive side, this production is lavish, beautiful, orchestrally splendid, excitingly photographed, imaginatively staged, and is well worth the watching and re-watching for these qualities.And yet, I can't help wishing that someone would actually film the novel and bring to life Erik (the Phantom), Raoul and Christine as they were meant to be portrayed. Alternately, that a way to magically integrate all the good qualities of all of the filmic Phantoms into one creation could be accomplished. If you're a film collector or Phan who's familiar with the novel, try watching Lon Chaney's 1925 Phantom using the Weber/Rice musical as a soundtrack and you'll get an inkling of what I'm talking about. This version, then, gets a six out of ten, for production values and music and an okay addition to the Phantom's filmic lore. That's enough, this time around.",The Phantom of the Opera
384,cherry_daze,Mixed Film,6,30 May 2005,"I went into this film filled with sheer enthusiasm. After all, I told myself, it has singing, is set in the 19th century, and features Gerard Butler, so how could I not like it? What I didn't count on is the cheesy first half.Before I go on, I have to say, in short, I did enjoy the film. The end was absolutely great, but the first half? Yeah, not so much with the good/enjoyable.My utter distaste of the first half is due to the unbelievable lack of emotion present. Literally, it just seems disconnected from any kind of reality. In short, it's an American soap opera MINUS the involving story line.I watched this with some friends, and one of them walked out (of the living room) 1 hour into the film. At that point I agreed with her decision, but at about 1 h and 20m, I totally saw why this film was worth the pain.Sadly, the fact that only 40minutes of the film were actually good, doesn't say much about the quality, does it?

386,judasfm,My first experience of Phantom...,10,12 December 2004,"I'd read the original book years ago, and had a vague idea of the story from the cinema blurb, but I'd never heard all the songs from the score (at least, not in order) and had no idea what to expect.In a word, breathtaking. I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. Emmy stands out as a superb Christine. Admittedly she didn't bellow out the songs like a lot of recordings I've heard (and which seems to be the main complaint against her) but on the plus side, the audience could actually understand what this Christine was singing; people who go for effect and volume tend to wind up singing so high that the audience needs the lyrics sheet to understand what's being said. Sounds wonderful, and technically very impressive, but give me a clearer voice like Emmy's any day. Patrick as Raoul was also good, although I felt his voice lacked power in one or two parts. He seemed to struggle slightly with singing and acting convincingly at the same time; most of the time he did an excellent job, but there were one or two parts (especially at the end) when he seemed unsure whether he should give more effort to his singing or acting. By and large however, a fantastic performance.Finally we come to the Phantom. I was blown away by Gerard Butler's performance; at times he seemed to carry the entire thing. The added scene detailing the Phantom's childhood and background worked well as well.Overall, an amazing production and a full 10 out of 10! Highly recommended.",The Phantom of the Opera

The talented and beautifully enchanted Emmy Rossum, gives the best performance by anyone this year, and her singing makes her a goddess over every actress. Gerard Butler, though not giving the best singing gives the most dangerously enchanted performance as the Phantom. and when Christine ( Emmy) and the Phantom ( Butler) share the screen, in hate or love, you feel for both characters and you want to sing with both of them.Not only do these actors give their best, but Mini Driver, though sometimes makes you wince, is very funny, and the actor who plays Raol, was amazing and heroic.So follow the Phantom to the theater and endure ""sweet intoxication"" the rush of excitement, through a sword fight, a burning and the lives of all the characters. and experience the "" Music of the night"" in Joel Shumacher's The Phantom Of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
388,Moviefan-Two-Kay-Four,Obsession and Love Are Very Different...,8,12 March 2018,"Released in 2004, Joel Schumacher's adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's legendary stage production was a long time coming. The play first began in 1986, with singers Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman as the Phantom and Christine, respectively. Webber later married Brightman, and had planned on her reprising Christine Daae for the silver screen. But their eventual divorce put an indefinite hold on the project; it would remain unfulfilled for over a decade. Webber had chosen director Schumacher (""Batman Forever"", ""Phone Booth"") for ""Phantom of the Opera"" back in the early 1990s, due to his talented use of color and music. Eventually, a deal was struck with Warner Bros. Studios, and the two filmmakers agreed on two things: the cast's overall ages would be reduced in this version (the stage actors were mostly in their late 30's to mid-40's), and all of them would do their own singing. This caused a slight problem with the addition of Minnie Driver, Webber's only choice for the role of Carlotta. Webber dubbed her in-picture singing with a professional soprano, and gave Driver her own song for the film's ending credits. In the main principal roles were actors Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry.Thus is the basic story for the making of the film; upon its release, it was a commercial success in many respects, as fans of the stage musical were excited to see their beloved characters in a new form. The songs, costume designs, sets, and historical representations were all praised...and in my opinion, the film definitely deserves it. However, those unfamiliar with the tale should be cautious. Based on a novel by French author Gaston Leroux, both the musical and the film tell a story deeply mired in themes of romance, love, faith, (in)justice, and death. As such, it's especially important for discerning hearts to be wary of a few elements.Visually, the film's biggest areas of concern are sex and violence. Unlike many films which revel in them, this film thankfully avoids that trap...and while the presence of such elements are important to the story, what's more imprtant is for viewers to know ahead of time what they'll be getting themselves into. Regarding sexual situations, the most obvious one is likely the many nude statues and carvings which adorn the walls and lobby of the opera house. While the camera doesn't excessively linger on them (mostly presenting them as historical art pieces), their inclusion helps to sell the mood of the time in which this tragedy takes place. Costumes worn by many female characters are designed to enhance their curves, particularly above the waist. As for the violent content, the most extreme moments concern the murders of Joseph Buquet and the Phantom's childhood abuser (the latter is shown in flashback). As for Piangi's death, it is mainly done in a quick cut away, and his lifeless form appears shortly thereafter, embraced by a weeping Carlotta.Non-visually, the other theme which fuels this story is the spiritual nature of music. Christine often likens the Phantom to her deceased father's promise of sending her an ""Angel of Music"", which could be interpreted as an allusion to Satan. Among the dark character's many lines of song are phrases such as ""let your darker side give in""; he also refers to himself as a ""gargoyle who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven"", a ""repulsive carcass"", and a ""beast"" or ""monster"". In the Don Juan performance scene, lyrics such as ""when will the flames at last consume us"" are present. Overall, an underlying message of this film is one of emotional and spiritual suggestion through the power of music. Used properly, music is a wondrous thing...but used irresponsibly, it can be a greater danger to people than a knife or firearm. Both sides of the collective canvas are presented, so people should know that going in. As a whole, this film gets a 8.5/10 in my book.",The Phantom of the Opera

All three primary characters where excellently portrayed and excellently sung and the music is as always terrific. A true Triumph that Sir Andrew and Joel Schumaker can really be proud of. Gerard Butler as the Phantom did take a little getting used to because at first he seemed to young for the part but I warmed to him very quickly and I thought his vocals where excellent.

The cast is all around excellent, especially Gerard Butler who is moody, tragic, very sexy and also a little frightening as the Phantom. Yes, he struggles some with his singing, but he sings well enough overall and is so passionate and charismatic in the role that I wasn't bothered by the occasional wobbly high note. I also thought Minnie Driver was hilarious in her over-the-top comic relief role as the demanding, poodle-obsessed opera diva La Carlotta.

When I first heard about this movie, I asked my sister, who had seen the musical a couple of times, whether she thought I should watch it or not. She warned me not to see it. So, I decided at that time that I would not watch it. Then, about 5 years later, I found out that I was going to get to go see Phantom on stage. That made me want to watch the movie. After a while, I decided that it would be better to wait until after I saw the show on stage to watch the movie. When I finally go to see the stage version, I could understand why people went to see it multiple times and couldn't wait to see it again. It is one of the best Broadway shows ever, if not the best. However, the only problem I had with the stage version was that I couldn't see exactly what was happening that well. Now that I have watched this movie, my understanding of the play is more clear. All of the actors portrayed their characters exceptionally well. Gerard Butler made the character easy to sympathize with. In the scene on the rooftop in which the Phantom begins to cry because Christine does not love him, my heart just went out to him. I almost started crying with him. He really became someone who you could believe was real. I have always loved the Phantom, but after watching the movie, I loved him even more. Emmy Rossum made Christine seem very innocent. She made it seem like Christine would believe anything someone told her. I would recommend this movie to any fan of musicals and especially to all Phantom ""Phans"".",The Phantom of the Opera
395,square-peg,It Does What it Says on the Tin,8,10 September 2005,"If you're looking for something modern and gritty, stay away. This is lush, lavish and high- powered romanticism. The leads do not hold back and the film is better for it - this is no time for subtlety. The director sweeps about his vast and fabulous sets as if he were wearing a full length cloak himself, and if the music sounds a little dated now, in a way that 'West Side Story' never does, then that's down to Lloyd Webber, although this is undoubtedly his best, most heartfelt work. The story abandons the Gothic horror of the original text for the tragic love triangle of ingénue, lover and monster, and thankfully, Raoul is given a bit more to do in this film than stand around and get cuckolded as he does in the stage play. Patrick Wilson does demonstrate some answering passion and bravery to the Phantom's towering obsession. But he's fighting a losing battle, for in the blue corner we have Gerard Butler, who looks remarkably fit and healthy for a man who's spent his life in a sewer. I have to say that the film failed a touch when the Phantom's disfigurement was revealed - he wasn't nearly hideous enough. I, for one, would have cheerfully overlooked one side of an otherwise handsome face, but even I might have had a problem with his homicidal tendencies.

The performance, the music, the costumes, the atmosphere, everything is just perfect, I thought that no other film could share the same place with ""The Lord of the Rings"", but for me, both ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" are sharing the first place. My words are even too pale to express how this film affected me in such a positive and emotional way. In this crazy 21st century, I could finally feel real emotions coming from this film, the way both of these gentlemen treated Christine is incredible, it makes me wish for those old times to return. Superb performance, and Sir Gerard Butler truly showed incredible emotion in singing and acting, it made me feel with the character so much. No better Phantom than Gerard Butler, you Sir have truly made this one shine. Kudos to the whole crew, this is the film of my life in every way. Thank you, thank you...THANK YOU!",The Phantom of the Opera
397,scottishrose,"Masterful, wonderful, and many more -fuls.",10,5 January 2006,"This was the single most amazing film I have seen since I was a little kid going to see The Lion King. It is not only the all-star cast, the incredible singing, the stupendous effects, or the engaging storyline that makes me love this film. It is that Joel Schumacher has managed to weave them all into one glorious production that threatens to consume all else.One thing I loved about this film is that it totally swept me into the story and made me care deeply about the characters. The Phantom's tortured life as a deformed creature of darkness, Christine's sorrow at the loss of her father and her fear of the Phantom, Raoul's unconditional love of Christine and his desire to protect her... all of it bound together an incredible tale of love, suspense, and music. I cry every time I see this, no matter what. I weep for the plight of the Phantom, and the sorrow of Christine.But don't think that this is all about fear and misery. Oh, no, there is quite a lot of humour. André and Firmin, the new owners of the Opera Populaire, work wonders as the welcome comic relief of this film.Please, I beg of you, *see this movie*. Even if you don't like opera or musicals or music in general, see it anyways. I guarantee, it will be a favourite throughout your life.",The Phantom of the Opera
398,Rimsey,Movie Lover vs Phantophile (warning SPOILERS),8,24 January 2005,"I had a very difficult time making the decision to go and see this movie. My first and foremost reason was that I am an AVID Michael Crawford fan and have been since I was about 6 years old and saw him in Condorman.I was concerned from the outset when Joel Schumacher said he wanted a ""Young and Sexy Phantom"" Considering that is is supposed to be wildly disfigured, that sentence worried me.My fears were even more compounded when I saw the shorts and it seemed that somewhere in the mix the had managed to get a horse chase and a sword fight...... my PhOTO loving stomach was churning.Finally I went to see it for my 30th birthday and then I was really anguished.From a MOVIE LOVERS point of view and from the more logical/sane/non-fanatic side of my brain, I actually found I loved the movie more than I was expecting. The horse race and sword fight have been added in a way that does keep with the ""Younger"" protagonists. All in all it was a good adaption..... for the most part.......However (as my own Erik like tendencies emerge) I had some MAJOR issues with the movie.1) For a man who has lived under the surface of the opera house for the better part of his life... Gerrad Butlers Erik was remarkably tanned. And lets not start on the make up indecision between the masks.2) In order to make is more ""palletable"" to the general audience, a lot of the intimate moments of small musical numbers have been transformed into spoken word over the original score. I found that annoying as these moments have some of the most powerful feelings ingrained in them which were lost in them being spoken.3) The loss of scene 3 in the second act, leading up to the song ""Wishing you were somehow here again"", when they are plotting to use the Phantoms opera against him was just plain annoying.4) In ""Masquarade"" they are all singing about the riot of colour... but they are all dressed in black and white! 5) The loss of the fourth verse of the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" was plain unfortunate. That key change leading up to it is very powerful.And the Finally BIGGEST Blunder (From the Musical loving side of my brain) 6) What the hell did the think they were doing moving the whole Chandelier scene from the end of Act 1 to Act 2! I realise that cinematic ally it makes better sense to have it at the climax of the show, but not having it at the end of when Erik is at his greatest moment of anguish considering everything that has lead up to it is a travesty! Oh loyalist Phantom Rant over.. Back to my normal insanity! For people who have never seen or heard the show - this movie is a lavish sumptuous feast that will leave your senses reeling.And if you are like me and are a rabid phantophile... put your grumbles aside and kick back and enjoy!",The Phantom of the Opera
399,lensman-4,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible",3,18 May 2005,"Why would anyone let the director of Batman and Robin direct the beautiful Andrew Lloyd Webber story of the Phantom of the Opera is beyond me. This movie was awful. I am not one to try to compare the stage version with the movie, I have seen the stage version of both Chicago and Cabaret, and I enjoyed both movie versions. This, however, felt like they were trying to go for a ""Moulin Rouge"" type movie (which, IMO, was worse).Also, what was with Madam Giry knowing what the Phantom was doing. Madam Giry was terrified of the Phantom, she wasn't helping him. She respected him out of the fear of him. She knew his origins but she was not his partner.Although I think that Emmy Rossum is quite beautiful and her voice was pretty she did not convince me that she was an opera Ingenue. The problem with the role of Christine is that Webber wrote the music specifically for Sarah Brightman. Now I have seen the stage version with 2 different Christine's, Brightman (who was beyond fab.) and her understudy, who was phenomenal stepping into the role. Rossum, just does not have the strength for the role. In the song ""Think of Me"", it's a bittersweet song and she just made it too happy, too Pop music ish. When she sings the duet with Raoul, ""All I Ask of You,"" it was also very Pop, the song is Christine imploring Raoul to love her and to ""hide"" her so that she feels safe. She is trying to convince herself that she loves Raoul, but what she feels at this point is gratefulness for someone to protect her. Raoul is showing her that he loves her. I did not get this at all from Rossum.The direction often felt like an overblown perfume commercial. I mean, Christine riding on a horse from the top of the opera house to the bottom of the opera house? GIVE ME A FREAKIN' BREAK.I HATED the way Gerard Butler played the Phantom. It was either weepy, or over the top, not angry, or anguished. Again, not comparing to the stage play, but I have seen 3 different people play the Phantom and all of them while unique had some the same basic elements. The anguish of the years of exile, the anger at being rejected, not only by Christine, but by society. Butler did not show that, I felt like he was a romance novel anti-hero come to life. Also, Butler was WAYYYYY too young to play the Phantom. The Phantom is supposed to be in his mid to late 40's (and that is out of the book, folks).Minnie Driver as Carlotta was AWFUL, and way too skinny. There is a reason we have the saying ""It ain't over till the fat lady sings"". Opera divas, especially those that achieved the type of status the Carlotta was supposed to have would have been on the thicker side. I know from singing in choirs all of my life that you develop a LOT of muscles in you stomach and chest when you sing constantly, especially in Opera. It is a very demanding profession and most of the well know renowned opera stars are NOT skinny little waifs.The other problem I had with this movie was the art direction and the cinematography. What the heck was that soft focus on Rossum EVERY time they did a close-up. That got annoying really really fast. Everything was too bright and flashy and absolutely no substance in the visuals. If the directors were trying for a period piece, they did an AWFUL job.Now, I grew up with movie musicals and stage musicals all of my life as my Grandmother and Mother would watch them avidly. So, I have come to learn what is a good story and what is not, this was not. What has happened to the classic musical? What is with the MTV video style of musicals these days? This movie, and Moulin Rouge are perfect examples of WHAT NOT TO DO, Yet, Chicago give me hope.",The Phantom of the Opera

Gerry makes the phantom soooo sexy that you can't help thinking that Christine is making the wrong choice!!

Minnie Driver as Carlotta is soooo funny!! I had to stop and remind my self to breath on the odd occasion cause she makes me laugh with her ranting!Emmy Rossum (soooo jealous of the kissing!)looks a bit dazed the whole way through but we can forgive her for that - if you were with Gerry Butler you'd have that look on your face too!!!

401,RainStar_Anahita,At last Phantom on the big screen,7,13 January 2007,"Director/co-screenplay writer Joel Schumacher Composer: Andrew Lloyd Webber's company Phantom: Gerald Butlet Christine: Emmy Rossum Raoul: Patrick WilsonWith her angelic voice, Emmy Rossum shook me so hard, I couldn't stop myself to say wow.She portrayed a very young and naive singer who was torn between two men. She played the role absolutely fantastic and exactly how a 16 year old would dream to play a role like that, in those beautiful ""Cinderella at the Ball"" costumes and ""The Little Mermaid"" voice.The scenery of the film was superb, and the music was the best part.I also enjoyed the symbolic language of the film: the rose in the black ribbon was so poetic and so was the Phantom's lair. I enjoyed watching the Phantom and Christine's labyrinth underground journey, slowly in the small boat and when they arrived at Phantom's lair, the candles arose from under the water all lit up and my mind was tearing asunder with the beauty of what I was seeing.There was also many uses of mirrors and reflections through the film... Going inside mirrors, to reach inside your mind, to that hidden lover, whose face is under a mask! And sadly all the mirrors end up broken for phantom.I expected to see more passion in Raoul and Christine's Relationship, more chemistry to save Christine. But I could feel more passion in Phantom's love, and Christine's body language showed more affection for the Phantom's touch, the way she closed her eyes and felt at peace when she was with him, the way her eyes shone with lust when following the Phantom to the boat...She wanted him and she wanted him so badly.. He was her ""angel of music"", but.. When Christine saw the face, she reached her ""Point Of No Return"".A true and sad story.All the way through the film, I really wanted Christine to choose the Phantom.... But Phantom behaved madly and badly.. Won't you if you were in love and the only thing stopping you to get your love was your ugly face?""Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime . . . Lead me, save me from my solitude . . .Say you want me with you, here beside you . . . Anywhere you go let me go too - Christine that's all I ask of . . .""Go and see the musical.

402,president242003,"A truly wonderful, enthralling and enchanting masterpiece",10,27 February 2005,"I'm not sure that words could even come close to indicating what a wonderful, beautiful, truly magnificent and enchanting masterpiece the latest movie version of ""The Phantom of the Opera Is"". This movie sets a standard of excellence and high quality that should very well serve as an inspiration for future movie makers of this genre.Everything about this movie works well and exceeds expectation. Most notable is of course the performances of all the cast involved in the production and their musical talent. Emmy Rossum gives a truly breathtakingly magnificent performance in the lead role of Christine. Her style of singing in this movie conveys wonderfully the emotions her character is feeling as each stage of the story unfolds something which is very hard to do when you are signing in an operatic style. Rossum's facial expressions, her body movements and all other aspects of her performance provide a wonderful depth and dimension to her character that makes it in my opinion the best portrayal of what her character should be like to date. Emmy Rossum has the makings of both a great actress and a great musical performer Gerald Butler also gives a truly first class performance as the Phantom of the Opera. This is a hard role to excel in but Butler does it so wonderfully and with so much passion that he greatly enhances the quality of the production and draws us into the true power and mystique of his character. And Patrick Wilson makes the character of Raoul come to life I think that this must be the best portrayal of Raoul I have seen to date. Also making an already truly magnificent show even more wonderful is the supporting cast ranging from Miranda Richardson to Minnie Driver to each and every one of the cast members involved. The depth and the quality of acting provided in this movie surpass that of any other musical that I can remember in recent times.The musical numbers are beautiful and enthralling, the sound effects add greatly to the enchantment and mystique of the whole production and the scenery is just breathtaking. Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber clearly put immense planning into this movie and it has paid off wonderfully. I didn't think that the movie could be even better than the stage production but this movie has exceeded my expectations way beyond what I could ever have imagined. I highly recommend it and will give it 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera

Emmy Rossum is gorgeous, wonderful actress, and a beautiful singer! Gereard is a wonderful Phantom, playing a more angry bitter Phantom, and it works so well! Minnie was hilarious and Patrick Wilson was awesome as well.

405,AllSunday,Favorite Film of 2004,10,27 December 2004,"Never have I seen such a beautiful musical or film. The movie is as captivating as it is entertaining. Although not flawless, it is well worth the ticket price.I have had some familiarity with the Gaston Leroux novel, but not past experience with the ALW musical itself. Being a huge fan of musicals, I was skeptical in going to an early screening judging by some early reviews on IMDb. And with Joel Schumacher as the director (remember those awful Batman 3/4's? Ugh.), it only heightened my fears. But as far as I'm concern, some people don't know what they're talking about.Beautiful sets, vocals, and presentation. Despite what most reviewers on IMDb might have you believe, Gerald Butler as the Phantom was the best in my eyes. All I've been hearing was that his lack of experience ruined the classic songs performed by Michael Crawford in the Broadway play. Especially in 'Music of the Night'. I don't understand this at all. I have heard the Crawford version of the song and I liked the Butler version more no contest. Butler's song had more emotion, Crawfords lacked range and really only had one pitch through out the song, while still a good rendition, I really preferred Butler's.My biggest problem with the film is that sometimes the background music was so loud I couldn't hear the singers, this being a mistake on the singers or the musicians, I can not tell. The background music is too strong to the point where one could not even hear the singers at all. Other times, the singer's pitches are so high, one can't tell what they're saying. Emmy Rossum, beautiful singer though, is where this problem kept appearing.I can only encourage people to see this film, I saw how poorly it's doing in the box office, and I just know this film deserves better. If you haven't seen it, go see it. If you know someone who hasn't seen it, tell them to see it! Support this film. 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
406,Kerridwyn,Disappointing translation of the stage show to screen,2,18 December 2007,"The Phantom of the Opera on stage can be an intensely powerful emotional experience. Sadly for me, most of the magic of Andrew Lloyd Webber's show was entirely lost in Joel Schumacher's re-visioning of it, which substitutes gloss and glamor for the haunting darkness of the original story, and seems aimed at the romance novel market and teenage girls.Part of this is due to changes made to the back stories of the characters - instead of a man who's lived out in the world and suffered at the hands of his fellow human beings for years, we're given a man who's spent his life from a young age under the opera house, taken care of and watching the chorus girls. Instead of a naive girl from the countryside who believes in her father's stories of an Angel of Music, Christine is a girl who grew up in a metropolitan society with a famous father. Although these changes may not be noticed the casual viewer, they are just some of the alterations which enormously impacted the emotion of the story for me.The other major problem is that it's hard to believe in an Angel of Music who's only been singing for a year. Although Gerard Butler throws himself into the role, it's impossible to disguise his lack of range. Emmy Rossum seems to rely on looking like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car.Gone is the sleek seductiveness of the stage show's Phantom, gone is the alluring character who balances charm and deadliness on a knife edge - instead we have a whiny boy who's never grown up, and a girl who's not yet out of her teenage years (instead of a young woman).Patrick Wilson deserves commendations for his performance as Raoul, who was unusually the only character I didn't want to strangle.",The Phantom of the Opera
407,cheryl-77,Very Disappointed in the Phantom,6,4 January 2006,"The imagery was very nice and the movie itself was well done, but my husband and I just couldn't get past the Phantom. The actor looked too young to play the part (he wasn't too young, he's 17 years older than Rossum, but he LOOKED too young), and his singing was just average. And darn it, it should be way above average for this role. It wasn't strong at all, not at all breathtaking -- as it really should be if you're going to put it down on film, right? They went for looks and names over pure talent -- it would have been really nice to see this exact movie done with people who could truly sing and take your breath away. Gerard Butler is almost too handsome for the part -- like ""oh, too bad he had to have 4 square inches of his face disfigured or he'd be a Calvin Klein model."" Heck, I'd still date him -- the guy is gorgeous! The Hollywood style of beautiful people ONLY is getting tiring and probably leaving some really talented people out. How about making vocal talent the priority in a musical!? Lots of other sites seem to say that the actors are doing their own singing, which speaks highly for Emmy Rossum who I thought sounded beautiful -- and she's so pretty! It was fun to see Minnie Driver in such an outrageous role, though, so that made up for it. And I always like to see Simon Callow pop up in a film.",The Phantom of the Opera
408,dcarst,"True to the Play, but flawed in other ways.",7,11 January 2005,"Since Sir Andrew got a screen writing credit, I am not surprised to find that the movie copied the more positive aspects of the play. I found the movie enjoyable. I did think that it could have been a bit shorter. This is perhaps the first film that I felt should have been a candidate for an intermission, just like the play.Many of the characters appeared more shallow than we have come to expect on the screen. The one exception to the mediocrity of the cast is Emmy Rossum (Christine). She has burst upon the scene as a very lovely presence in recent movies (Mystic River, Day After Tomorrow). She now bursts upon the scene as a very pleasant voice.My main objection is that the voice over work became fairly obvious and toward the end the ALW songs were a little repetitious for a screenplay.",The Phantom of the Opera
409,mysta02,"Phantom of the Opera is about a musical genius with a deformed face, whose love for his student brings him to the point where he will do anything to get her.",10,2 March 2006,"Phantom of the Opera is the best movie I have ever seen, and I bought it just days after seeing it the first time. Basically, it's a musical starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, both of whom have beautiful voices and do an awesome job in this film. The rest of the cast is also very talented, and no one detracts from the film on any level. Many of the songs in the movie are very powerful and convey so much meaning, through not only the words, but through the music also, as well as the visual element which adds its own touch. Something I noticed when I watched it the first time was the amount of detail in the background, from the walls, to the lights, to the Phantom's organ. Everything is just beautiful, and like I said, very powerful. In fact, the movie is so emotional that it brought a single tear to my eye, and I'm not usually one to cry in movies (even one tear). Overall, I have nothing negative to say about the movie, except that it didn't last forever. Hehe. So, definitely, I suggest that everyone see it once. It won't be for everyone, as it is a musical, but for anyone who likes those type of movies, as well as anyone open to something new, it's for you.",The Phantom of the Opera
410,RejeanGhanem456,Beautiful,8,6 November 2012,"Out of all the versions of this film, this is the best adaption of POTO.Gerard Butler sounds just like a Broadway singer, he hits the high notes perfectly, and keeps the English accent through out the whole movie without ever breaking character. Butler's version of the Phantom is more soft then how he was in other versions to the point where you feel bad for him. He's more of a misguided soul in this adaption but still stays complex.Emmy Rossum was a good Christine, she has a beautiful angelic singing voice and it's very Oscar worthy. This version of Christine is much like the rest. She's the damsel but does have her limits. She's no Mulan but she's no Snow white either. You'll love her no matter what, though.If you don't like musicals, this movies probably not for you. There is very little dialogue, but you should try to watch it because this is something you don't want to miss.",The Phantom of the Opera
411,Jasimia,Utter sadness,7,17 April 2005,"I love the musical. I really really do. That is probably why this movie made me so sad. The story is still wonderful, the sets are great, the costumes are fantastic, yet, it lacked. It lacked a strong cast: Butler, while a wonderful actor, can't sing, Emmy Rossum, while a good singer, lacked the acting ability to carry the movie(but i think she will eventually come into her own, she's young), Minnie Driver didn't even bother to try and sing, Patrick Wilson practically walked through the movie, although they did butcher his part. The music was butchered and robbed of it's complexity, if you don't believe me listen to the movie version of Notes/Prima Donna, and then listen to the stage version. Plus lots of the lyrics were changed to plain dialouge, leading to some very funny moments of rhyming. It lacked any visual flow, the camera movement took the viewer out of what was meant to be intimate moments, like Angel of Music scene with Meg, could Schumacher get the camera ANY farther away from them? It had some extremely awkward staging and editing that made me giggle out loud(RE: Point of No Return). Yes I laughed, and because i laughed I am sad, because you're not supposed to laugh. The last half hour of the movie was quite a lot better though, and almost ALMOST redeemed the utterly silly first part, but mostly because of Webber's heartfelt music and more intimate feel, and basically the dramatic pull of the story. This movie is a bad movie. I wanted so much to love it, really I did. I'm probably being generous with my vote. So see it, or not, definitely not if you don't like the musical, the movie has no added merits.",The Phantom of the Opera
412,evabba,Face the Music. This PHANTOM will take your breath away!!,10,25 February 2005,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" (2004) is a visually spectacular film which remains loyal to the stage production despite some changes to the characters and story. The set design and costumes are sumptuous and Webber's music is beautiful..The cast, for the most part is excellent. The standout performer is Emmy Rossum who gives an praise worthy performance as the young soprano Christine Daaé. Although her voice is no match to the others who have played the role on stage such as the sublime Rebecca Caine, Sierra Boggess, Rebecca Luker, Claire Moore to name a few it is still lovely. Her tone is delicate and sweet (""Angel of Music"") and at times powerful (the cadenza at the end of ""Think of Me"") and many times throughout the score, she achieves moments of great vocal beauty (the rooftop scene). She breezes through most of the score effortlessly with a few exceptions (there are moments of strain during the ""Think of Me"" and during the Phantom's ""Point of No Return""). I always keep in mind that she is probably one of the youngest sopranos to ever perform these songs. All the other (stage) Christine's have been at least 10 years older than Miss Rossum and to have someone this young sing these songs is impressive as the score calls for the singer to jump octaves and sing high B's, C's and E's (in this case an E flat). Her physical presence is also worth noting. Physically she is the perfect Christine as her age and look is suited well for the role. Admittedly, I have not read the original novel but I am suspecting Ms. Daaé of Leroux's imagination was close in age to Rossum. If not, she should have been, as it is far more believable to have a young girl, not yet reaching true maturity, succumb to the Phantom's influence.The title role was given to Gerard Butler who gives a strong dramatic performance but vocally, he is the weakest singer in the bunch. His voice is still competent in parts but many will argue a Phantom with a weak voice is not believable to which they have a point since it is he who teaches Christine how to sing however, like in Rossum's case and since film is a different medium, suspension of disbelief must come into play. If not, the hard-nosed critic will most likely have a difficult time listening to Butler struggle with most of the score. Another distraction that may or will arise is Butler's looks since his Phantom looks more of a Harlequin romance version and not the grotesque creature originally portrayed in the novel or the countless horror films the book inspired. Since this is the musical ""Phantom"" and not the horror-esque version of the 20's, 40's, 60's and 80's, it works for me. He is not suppose to scare the pants off the audience. If it's scares you want then I suggest you stick with Lon Chaney. Lloyd Weber's Phantom is suppose to seduce the audience and make the audience sympathize with him and Mr. Butler succeeds. Webber himself has stressed in earlier interviews that what attracted him to this piece was the romance, not the hokey horror tale. So while other versions focus on the horror, this one focuses on the romance.Others in the cast include Patrick Wilson who turns in a solid performance as the love-struck but rather wooden Raoul. His voice is good yet his character remains the least sympathetic despite the film- makers attempt to make him more interesting than his stage counterpart. Minnie Driver's over-the-top but hilarious portrayal of the diva and Christine rival ""La Carlotta"" is a scene stealer. Driver was the only cast member who did not do her own singing.Directed by the now infamous-for-putting-nipples-on-Batman-Joel Schumacher, the film is an assault on the senses. The elaborate sets, the glittering costumes, the cinematography are all spectacular and beautiful to behold and Webber's score is gorgeous. Many of Webber's simplest tunes turn out to be his most beautiful works. In the case here, the hauntingly beautiful ""Angel of Music"" is a standout. This song is repeated throughout the musical and the lovely tune is enhanced by Rossum's delicate soprano and fantastic orchestrations. Other musical highlights include the title track (although many have expressed disappointment in the omission of the last verse), the energetic ""Masquerade"", the lovely duet ""All I Ask of You"" (which is spectacular on film) and the Phantom's opera ""Don Juan Triumphant"" followed by what many call one of Webber's best tunes ""Point of No Return"".The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Song and Best Art Direction at the 2005 Oscars. It also received 3 Golden Globes nominations (including Best Picture), 2 Critics Choice award nominations (including Best Picture) and 11 Golden Satellite Awards nominations (including Best Picture). Although the film did not win any of the major awards Emmy Rossum won the National Board of Review Award for her performance in the film, as well as a Critics Choice award which was well deserved.The 2 disc DVD contains a making of documentary which is interesting enough, the theatrical trailer and if you do some investigative work, you should discover an easter egg. The one disc DVD's contain only the trailer as an extra.For the millions of fans who have not experienced Schumacher's vision of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical, do not hesitate. It is a glorious production that does the stage show justice despite some cast controversy and narrative changes. It is a remarkable documentation of the show and as a movie musical, it is almost perfect. Musical theatre has never been this spectacular.",The Phantom of the Opera
413,ladyjatbay-1,Nostalgia and Dr. Ruth,10,23 January 2005,"While watching this film, I thought about Shirley Jones in Oklahoma and how it is nice to see movies of such caliber in a movie theater, even in this modern day and age. It really takes you back, and allows your mind to go to another time and space. Of course my reality was disrupted constantly by some ignorant people who could not shut up through the course of the movie. I will definitely have to see it again thanks to them, but I will most assuredly see it live on stage as well.My therapeutic comment: What also struck me about this film is the fact that it is about a woman making a choice between a control freak and the boy next door. As with all victims and their would be batterers, she is seduced into the Phantom's charms over and over again. Were it not for the ""nice guy"" she would very likely pick the Phantom and go on to live a life of abuse over an over again. The same tale as in Heathcliff and Catherine (what if). Isn't it interesting that Christine has lived under the Phantom's roof for many years, and he never once pursues her as a lover until she is finally chosen for this role? The reason for this is that the Phantom wants to mold her into his device for controlling. He has groomed her for many years, and it isn't until she is set to be the lead in a opera, AND until the ""nice guy"" decides he wants her, that the phantom comes out of hiding and shows himself to her. This is just a prelude to a batterer and if this is watched consciously, you will think twice about feeling sorry for the Phantom and falling in love. Be glad she makes the right choice and hopefully you will to.",The Phantom of the Opera
414,laurenblue2011,Beautiful..... astonishing,10,27 May 2014,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I cried throughout the entire thing. I had already seen the play and loved it, and this movie was an excellent version of the original, I actually almost liked it better. The characters were perfect, and the effects were too. I loved Gerard Butler as the phantom. He added so much. He was ruggedly handsome and had a rugged voice that is exactly how I envisioned the phantom would sound. I also loved Emmy Rossum as Christine. She had a very sweet and pure soprano voice and was very young, but very intense and mature for her age. She was beautiful in a very original way. The songs in Phantom are my favorite Broadway musical songs. They are just so beautiful and deep and amazing, I can't really describe them. The actors (especially Gerard Butler) Added so much emotion into their parts. I loved how they cried a lot while singing so that you could really feel there pain. There voices weren't perfect, which I really liked. I believe that this movie should be up there with Titanic.",The Phantom of the Opera
415,keys2494,Visual Mastepeice well worth seeing,10,10 June 2005,"I hate it when people break out into song. Nothing is more irritating and ruins a movie more. For these reasons, I was apprehensive about seeing Andrew Lloyd Webbers Phantom of the Opera. However, this experience was quite different. The music, the set and performances made this movie an absolute treat to watch. The story of a masked musical genius (Gerry Butler)living in the catacombs of the Opera Populaire who falls deeply and obsessively in love with his student, Christine Daee (Emmy Rossum). The Phantom soon finds himself having to compete for her affections, against her childhood sweet heart Roaul. His jealously grows as Christine and Roaul's relationship blossoms, leading to his decent into madness. It was touching, surprising, sumptuous, lusty, tragic and yet still maintained the true love story that is Phantom of the Opera.This movie truly touched me on a level that I have never known. The tragic circumstances in which the Phantom finds himself are truly horrid and brings out the cruelness of our world. To shun someone out of society because of looks, because of social standing, because they threaten our plastic fantastic world. Gerry Butler does a incredible job, showing the human aspects of the Phantom and helps offer explanation for his behaviour. You are truly brought in commonality with the Phantom. A man who has been denied emotionally and physically. Emmy Rossum portrays the innocence and beauty in Christine Daae, in a role she was born to play. This film address the two sides of the characters to a tee! The Phantom - a man who is lonely and suffers from extremely low self-esteem, but also as a sexual being longing for companionship. Christine Daae- a confused young teen confronting her first real feelings of romance with Roaul, and also her real sexual awakenings with the Phantom.The exciting plot and complication in this movie leaves you asking the same main question Christine is forced to ask herself; Do you choose the loving alluring and desirable musical genius, who has issues of abandonment and self-esteem? Or do you choose the swarve, loving, 'anywhere you go let me go too' style aristocrat, who is your perfect match, but doesn't understand your needs and wants? The answer I can promise can leave you in deep discussion with your peers into the early hours of the morning! The deep, human portrayal of the Phantom is, I believe the most evident aspect of the whole film. A scene called ""Point of No Return"" manages to mix emotions. It is so sad and heartbreaking, but it is so exciting and lusty! You want to kill someone or something! Your heart is breaking but your so happy. These mixed emotions make this film a roller-coaster. The singing talents of Emmy Rossum is right up there with the genius of Sarah Brightman. Gerry Butler is definitely NO Michael Crawford, but his performance was so much more. His vocal styling were brilliant nevertheless. His acting and portrayal of the true suffering of the Phantom made his performance a truly notable one.So in conclusion, I would NOT go past the Phantom of the Opera. Truly a wonderful and mesmerizing portrayal of Andrew Lloyd Webbers greatest masterpiece. The use of a younger more attractive cast made the film all the more realistic. Christine's desire for the Phantom is (shallow I know!) made more understandable by the use of very good looking men! A true love story, that is gripping on a mental, emotional and physical level. I would not go past Phantom of the Opera. It is a MUST SEE!",The Phantom of the Opera
416,NickD39,The only improvement that could be made to this movie is....,8,23 January 2005,"To use the singing voices of Gary Maurer, (the phantom), Rebecca Pitcher, (Christine), and Tim Martin Gleason for Raoul. My family and I saw The Phantom of the Opera at the Overture Hall in Madison, WI presented by Cameron Makintosh and the, ""The Really Useful Theatre Company Inc, and their voices were over powering.The Italian type tenor voices of especially Gary Maurer exceeded the very best tenors in recorded history and Pitcher has a very smooth but extremely powerful voice. I only wish this company would make a CD recording as the music made the Michael Crawford CD version seem dull.Perhaps the producers of this movie wanted more of the current rock star voices in their film and perhaps I have to strong of a liking for the really great voices of yesteryear. But the talents of Gary, Rebecca, and Tim should have not been overlooked.What is extremely disappointing about the Makintosh stage production is that no recordings or photography was permitted, so the only thing we are left with is a memory.I am sure to buy this movie on DVD when it comes out and it did fill in many important missing details of the stage play. Would be my wish as they did with so many DVD's would be to add a second version using the voices of Gary, Rebecca, and Tim, then I will crank up the speakers of my 5.1 surround sound system to keep those goose bumps flowing down the back of my neck.",The Phantom of the Opera
417,mochamar,sexiest Phantom ever,10,24 April 2005,"To anybody who is whining over the fact that Gerard Butler's voice is no Michael Crawford: get over it. Michael Crawford's body is no Gerard Butler. Movies capitalize on the Visual, and Gerard Butler has it. And Emmy Rossum -- wow! Been singing at the NY Met since the age of 7. And it shows. There is a lot you can do with a movie that you can't quite equal in a playhouse, like, the way that the underground grotto was set up and the long walk route through which the Phantom led Christine, quite a buildup! Overall, the film production of this movie was excellent and the soundtrack will still leave you crooning ""the phantom of the opera is in my mind"" for days and days and days. I recommend this movie with five big stars!",The Phantom of the Opera
418,steve187,"Some good elements, but overall a ""thumbs down""",4,28 December 2004,"Let me preface by saying that yes, I have seen the play (twice) and very much enjoyed it both times. So I'm not anti-Webber, although what was Starlight Express??? Anyway, I thought that the sets, costumes and supporting cast were all excellent, especially Miranda Richardson, Simon Cowell and Minnie Driver. And the movie followed the score almost to a ""T"", which was nice. But what sunk this movie for me were the three leads. Just bad casting on all three parts. Butler - first off, since when did the Phantom look like he just came off of ""People Magazine's sexiest man alive"" cover??? Sorry, but this guy was too ""heartthrob""/matinee-idol to play this part, with or without the makeup and/or mask, both of which were disappointing. But the worst part of his performance for me was his(?) singing. Flat as a pancake. ""Music of the Night"" has several key notes that the singer has to hit, and this guy hit none of them, making it almost painful to watch/hear him not pull it off. Rossum - there is nothing about her that makes her stand out, as she is somewhat plain. It didn't help that she carried one expression through the whole movie, either. She did have a good voice though. Wilson - The part of Raoul has always been interpreted as somewhat wimpy (honestly, haven't you always wondered why Christine ran off with him?), but I felt bad for Wilson because, with his long Prince Valient haircut and ""I just turned 21"" looks, I felt like the orchestra leader (remember, the old guy?) was going to beat him up and take his lunch money! Add to that the lack of chemistry between the three (It seemed like in the play, there was general emotional conflict between Christine and the Phantom; here it seems like it's all one-sided on his part), and the painfully obvious (and abundant) instances where the lips were not matching the lyrics, and you get this mess. Although I would recommend it to those who haven't seen the play and don't plan to, just for the score itself.",The Phantom of the Opera
419,gchucky,Good - if you've seen the show,7,25 December 2004,"A lot of reviews I've read bash the movie, saying that it's really just a remake of a bad Broadway show. But people are harsh. The movie was pretty good, but better if you've seen the show.Basically, the movie is just the Broadway play in, er, movie form. The music has been expanded and some lines have been rewritten, but it holds true to the play. More importantly, it explains things that were unexplained before - how the Phantom came to the opera house, for example. Considering how the show's plot was a bit weak, the movie makes it considerably stronger.The music is the most memorable part of the show, and that holds true here as well. The songs are all on par, and everyone sounds good singing. Minnie Driver didn't sing her parts, but that's okay, because she's not in many songs. One thing that irked me is that Webber didn't remove some aspects of the original score that are outdated. In ""Phantom of the Opera,"" there's a power chord in the beginning, and there are the handclap sounds that come up here and there. They should have been removed, but they weren't.That aside, the movie is pretty. Everything is elaborate and vibrant: the sets, the costumes. Camera-work is good, with quick cuts and pans put in the right places. This is Schumacher, people. He knows what he's doing.The reason I keep mentioning the Broadway play is because that's what all the other critics are doing. They didn't like the original show, and they don't like the movie either. And that makes sense, since they're pretty much the same thing.Unfortunately, it doesn't stand much as a movie. The only reason I enjoyed the movie is because I've seen the show, so I knew what was coming. If you've not seen the play, you'll think the movie is decent, if a bit contrived. And if you have seen it, you'll enjoy the movie. It cleans up and expands the play, and brings it to a much higher level.",The Phantom of the Opera
420,dirvine-2,"Splendid! Superb! Magnificent! A masterpiece of music, a feast for the eyes and senses!",10,4 January 2005,"This film is a magnificent achievement. A.L.B. and Joel Schumacher have managed to put together a sparkling feast for the eyes, ears and senses. I have seen it four times and it has not ceased to thrill me each time. I laughed, I cried, the music filled my soul and gave me chills again and again! I can't get enough! It's beautiful,haunting, and heartrending at times. The songs play in your head constantly. The story and characters haunt you through the day and into the night. Emmy Rossum's Christine is gorgeous. I prefer her voice much more than Sarah Brightman's. Her performance was stunning. Her compassion and range of emotions are portrayed to perfection. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is without equal. He wrung out every emotional note of the Phantom's torment and longing. His performance is hauntingly beautiful and heartwrenching. Admittedly, I did have to make a mental transition from the previous Phantoms' singing voice qualities to Gerard Butler's singing. However, it does not take long to appreciate how Mr Butler's emotionally intense performance carry over wonderfully into his singing of the Phantom's songs. Patrick Wilson almost seemed in danger of being eclipsed, I felt, by the intense fire of emotions ablaze between Christine and the Phantom, but he definitely held his ground, and his singing voice is fabulous. Minnie Driver as Carlotta was hilarious! She was great! All the supporting cast were superb as well. I don't know what is with the critics. They seemed to have had their minds made up to hate this movie before it even opened. Was it some personal vendetta? Were they paid to bash it? I can only say that I feel all the negative press was very unfair, and I feel sorry for people that stayed away from it just because they let the critics decide for them. I suppose I, like the Phantom don't really fit in this world (the entertainment world, anyway). I come from a generation that went to the movies to enjoy laughter, drama and beauty and, even music (heaven forbid!). These days, it seems that commercially successful entertainment must to pander to more jaded (and grittier) tastes. Since this is what brings in the money, and money is the bottom line for all of this anyway, so be it! ""The Phantom of The Opera"" will probably not be a big money maker, which is likely to be the only deplorable criteria it is to be judged by. However, like the Phantom himself, it seems to have been born into a time and a world into which it does not fit and is grossly under-appreciated. However, I absolutely love it and welcome the music, story and characters into my heart and soul again and again.",The Phantom of the Opera

When I thought of opera, the image of that fat, screaming, viking lady popped into my mind. My friend kept telling me about how it was the absolute best movie ever and how I should see it. Again, that stereotype opera image came to my mind, but I finally decided to trust my friend and watch it anyways.Well, she was right! I've never seen a movie like this one- so beautiful, enchanting, magical, mystifying, intriguing, and musically divine. There are not any words to actually describe how much I love it. It has anything a good movie could ever have: a majestic and haunted building, a mysterious and misunderstood man, an obsessive love, a tragic love triangle, an angel-like singer, a father's promise, deaths, excitement, mystery, unconditional romance, beautiful music, and more. What else could you ask for? This is my favorite movie, no doubt about it. If you want to find out why it's that good, see it. Don't let that viking lady convince you not to see it, that's not opera.

423,melly47-1,Amazing!,10,14 December 2008,"This is such a wonderful movie! The music was is excellent and at times very moving. The acting deserves a 10/10 from Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson and Miranda Richardson. Emmy Rossum was incredible for a girl of just sixteen! The rest of the cast were very good as well. The costumes was one of my favourite things about this film. I thought Christine's dress during the song ""Think of me"" and ""Angel of music"" was beautiful. I love the outfits. The story is very romantic. This is in case you don't know what its about. Its about young chorus girl Christine Daae. Ever since coming to the opera house, the phantom has looked over and guarded Christine. When Christine's amazing voice is discovered by the opera owners, the phantom becomes obsessed with her. Then Roule (Christine's childhood sweetheart) appears, which brings the phantom's jealousy to the highest. Everyone sets a trap to catch the phantom, but the phantom knows it straight away, and sets a trap of his own to take Christine away. The phantom's trap succeeds, which results in the opera house going up in flames. Roule tries to find Christine in the phantom's den, unknown to him that this was also part of the phantom's trap. The phantom threatens Christine that if she refuses him then Roule will die. Christine is about to accept to stay with him, and then kisses him. But then the phantom realises his bitter-sweet victory, so tells Christine to forget him and allows her to go away with Roule. Does that sound like your thing? Then buy it!I recommend this to all opera music lovers and romantic film lovers.",The Phantom of the Opera
424,actorman_us,Missed greatness by about a half an octave.,5,23 December 2004,"There is so much to like about PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. It looks breathtaking- both in its costuming and overall design, the music is given the most wonderfully vigorous and dazzling orchestrations one can ever hope to hear, and most of the young stars of this film deliver the goods in fine fashion. The problem, however, is that the film is not called COSTUMES OF THE OPERA or SET OF THE OPERA or even ORCHESTRATIONS OF THE OPERA. It's called PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and that's where the problem, alas, with this version glares brightest.Gerard Butler simply doesn't cut it vocally. He looks good, he wears the mask well, but the poor man can't sing a lick. There were ever so brief moments where he managed to hit a pleasing note, only to lose it in a sea of raspy, unsustained noise. We must believe that the Phantom can mesmerize, bedazzle, and seduce with the beautiful intoxication of his singing voice. Sadly, Butler fails utterly in this regard. If an actor is to spend 3/4 of a piece with his face covered, he'd better be able to move us with the voice.A larger problem is that at no point, did this reviewer feel any sympathy for the Phantom. This is the central challenge of this piece, on stage or screen. Yes, the Phantom is a bully and a murderer. However, we MUST be made to feel some sort of sympathy or empathy with this character. It is the only way the ending, with Christine choosing Raoul and finally being the woman who recognizes the Phantom's humanity, will be effective. Many of Butler's readings come off as downright petulant- hardly the tone to strike to inspire any feelings for the Phantom. The rest of the cast does quite well. Emmy Rossum's beautiful fragility and sharp voice make for a fine Christine, Patrick Wilson is suitably gallant and vapid as Raoul, and Miranda Richardson is a wonderfully mysterious Madame Giry. However the Phantom must be the emotional and musical core of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. We must weep for his fate, for his unrecognized genius, and most of all, for his unrequited passion for love. This voiceless Phantom simply can't deliver these goods.",The Phantom of the Opera
425,git2,way too cheesy for me,1,12 January 2005,"The book was amazing, that was the main reason to see this movie. The early 20th century costumes was authentic, the difficult operatic interplay onstage was seamless, the visual scenes were strong.However, the ""Phantom"" scores was pompous and repetitive. A particular solo musical scene (you'll definitely know which part after watching the movie) lasted so long that the audience didn't even feel the emotion anymore and was just anxious to see what was going to happen next. The Phantom's lair, dungeons, moats and hidden areas were on full display and sadly were not scary or mystical enough.Christine surely can sing, but she lacks the sex appeal. Raoul, her love interest, looks more like a long hair surfer dude going to costume party. Phantom gave a strong, focused performance but that was it, no room for further character development because all they have to do was open their mouth and sang endlessly. And those were not catchy songs either.Stick to the book, forget this movie. Don't even bother to get the DVD either.",The Phantom of the Opera

Why did I wait almost seven years to see this movie?This movie is wonderful. It has every element required for a film. It's slightly Gothic nature was perfect for a film with this story. It was romantic, dark, fun, and all-around excellent.Emmy Rossum was a jewel as Christine. Her soprano voice was beautiful and rivals that of Sarah Brightman's singing voice. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was good, I liked his singing voice. Minnie Driver was a hoot as the diva Carlotta. The two managers (whose names lose me right now) were hysterical. But my heart (like Christine's) belongs to Gerard Butler's Phantom:Butler brought everything that was required for the role of the Phantom and then some. You could really feel the Phantom's loneliness and vulnerability. And, YES, he could sing. Better than Michael Crawford, because with Butler, you can hear the emotion in his voice. And I mean, come on, no one can watch the ""Point of No Return"" sequence without melting. This film was, ""in a word"" (as the Phantom would say), wonderful.

I thought the film version was even better than the stage play since the film of course provides close-ups and smoother transitions from one event to another (all of the things film by definition offers over stage)...I also thought the performances and the voices were every bit as good as those I had seen and heard in the theater. If you enjoyed the stage play - you should LOVE this film... so many of the critics who did not like the film apparently just don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber or his music, or do not like the stage play -- each to his own I guess.I also think Gerard Butler is just maybe the sexiest man alive! He infused the Phantom with such passion -- at first I was a little surprised to see that the Phantom was young and handsome (well 1/2 handsome anyway)-- but it actually makes the story line a bit more plausible that Christine could be mesmerized and genuinely conflicted about her feelings for him..A Great time at the movies!

I was actually pleasantly surprised that it used so much of the original score. I thought the singing was excellent, and Minnie Driver was great. It definitely captured my interest and had beautiful visuals. I thought they cast the characters perfectly - I really liked Emily Rossum, Gerard Butler, and Patrick Wilson. Gerard really stood out in my mind as the Phantom. Excellent performance. I'm bummed I waited until DVD to see it and missed it on the big screen. You don't have to be a Phantom of the Opera fan before you see this movie to love it - but you do have to like musicals!Just a couple quirks: The phantom's disfigurement did tend to change depending on which mask he wore (or didn't wear)- but that's OK. You get the idea. I didn't pick up that the lip syncing was off. I'll have to watch for that next time I watch it. And in the 1870 shots, I would estimate the age difference between Raoul and Madame Giry to be at least 15 years, if not more. But in the 1917 shots, they look to be about the same age. These are so minor though in reflection of the entire Phantom experience.Now if only they'd do an adaptation of ""Les Miserables"" just as well...",The Phantom of the Opera
429,sanfordrm,"Great, but with a few too many distractions",8,15 March 2007,"I have been looking forward to a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom"" for many years, now. And, I must say I am rather impressed with the turnout.However, there were a few things that keep this film from being perfect. For example, the several transitions between the ""real time"" and the flashbacks seemed to slow the film down too much. The opening sequence (necessary part of the original stage performance) and the end scene at the gravesite (not in the original) were OK, but the others seemed to unnecessarily break up the flow of the film and detract from the storyline. Most of these transitional scenes were annoying.As far as the casting goes, it was very good. Emma Rossum was sensational. She was the standout performer of this film. However, I felt that the two lead males were total opposites to each other. Gerald Butler appeared to be forcing his part as the Phantom, trying to ""act"" the role rather than becoming it. Too bad Michael Crawford wasn't available (and may be too old). He was the ultimate Phantom. By contrast, Patrick Wilson's Raoul was holding back. He never really took a commanding lead as the stage character had, and he seemed stiff in his costumes. Too much starch in his wardrobe?

431,nimmy1,Mostly excellent,10,21 December 2004,"I went to see this film not knowing much about the music nor the story and thought it excellent.The look of the film is the first thing that captures you - sumptuous, lit by candle and gas light mainly, giving it a warm glowing look. The costumes and the sets are are superb. It is mainly set in a theatre with a few underground scene and I think three outside scene (mainly in a cemetery).The music is a lot better than I was expecting and the performances where uniformly good. The weakest of the three main leads was Raoul he sung the best was the most handsome but surprisingly non charismatic. Christine, though nice to look at with a very good voice had a blank expression at times but the girl playing her was only 16/17 at the time of filming and so did an excellent job. The best for me (Miranda Richardson aside) was Gerard Butler (GB). GB seems to have come in for a great deal of criticism, especially his singing. Whereas he is not the greatest singer he certainly is nowhere near as bad has people make him out to be. But what GB does score on is his interpretation of the phantom. Suitably charismatic and attractive to arouse the interest of a beautiful young starlet but also a bitter, lonely and broken man - fantastically captured in my opinion.All the other supporting actors do good turns as well.It starts to suffer a little after the masquerade number, but I think this is due to the music becoming more 'chase' music or more dissonant as the film reaches its climax.All in all go see. excuse any spelling I'm mildly dyslexic",The Phantom of the Opera

It worked quite nicely indeed. (Even though his voice wasn't as strong as the others. I found out he has never had singing lessons.) I have mixed feelings about this movie. I am a huge fan of the musical and I was quite excited to see this film. I was surprised and delighted how closely it mirrored the stage play ... but with extras that you can only get on the screen (like the gravestone scene at the very end) Actually, a lot of confusion I had about the play were cleared up for me by this movie. (Except for Madame Giry. How could she seem younger than Raul at the end when she should be at least 15-20 years older?)The reason I said I had mixed feelings is because the film was beautifully shot and the characters were done so well, but during the film, I was bored.(The entire cast was fantastic!

437,Garbo46,Would Rather See a Concert with Margaret Preece,4,29 August 2007,"What drew me to watch this movie on DVD was Emmy Rossum. I listened to a song that she recently released, and liked it. Plus, she made a comment about not becoming a ""slutty singer,"" which appealed to my sensibilities. I thought she did a good job in Phantom.The most enjoyable character for me was Carlotta. Driver was funny, and before learning that she did not do her own singing, I thought she was phenomenal. Margaret Preece has a more operatic voice than Rossum, and I liked her numbers more.I guess you have to be into musicals to enjoy all the singing. I would have chosen to make a movie more like ""Cabaret,"" where the singing occurs in a place where you'd expect it to, a cabaret. There is plenty of plot off stage to provide the drama and dialogue for a movie without characters bursting into song every minute or so. The sword fight in the cemetery is a good non-musical scene, and about the only exciting part for me.I also did not quite understand why all the characters and audience in the film would recoil so dramatically because of the phantom's disfigurement. He didn't look that bad to me.Anyway, even with those familiar tunes from the stage play, I was still yawning way before the movie finished.",The Phantom of the Opera
438,Lmbinc,2nd Rate Film...,6,24 December 2004,"A second rate film, directed by a third rate director does not bode well for bringing this magically staged musical to the screen. I saw three major problems here. 1.) The director - everything is so overblown, you lose the story. 2.) The phantom is a miscreant. There's just no liking him - the charm that Michael Crawford brought to this part seems to have been totally lost in the baroque, bombastic business. Where was Hal Prince when you needed him? That brings me to my third complaint. 3.) Voguing? Really! Who choreographed this muddled monstrosity? Madonna? The masquerade ball that was so magnificent and inventive on stage, here appears to be an excuse to burlesque Baz Luhrmann.Stop this man, before he directs again! To their credit Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, Jennifer Ellison all do very credible job. Emmy Rossum's voice is quite lovely.All-in-all, this film is every bit as good as the 1943 Claude Rains version. That should tell you something.",The Phantom of the Opera
439,Diva101,Not very good (sorry),4,24 May 2005,"Sorry to depart w/ the crowd here, but this is not a very good adaptation of the musical. It's not even a very good movie on its own. I feel horrible about saying these things b/c I'm a huge fan of the B'way show, but the movie is what it is. To quickly comment on some other things that I've read. Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom is not an opera. It's a musical. The only character who should be singing w/ an operatic voice is Carlotta. The role of Christine was written for Sarah Brightman, who may be considered a ""pop opera"" singer. Otherwise, the characters should be singing as if in a musical, not an opera. Roger Ebert commented that Phantom isn't a very good musical. I think he pretty much called it vapid. Again, this is a B'way musical, not Wagner. To me, that's kinda like saying Guys and Dolls or Once Upon a Mattress is vapid. I think Phantom has a lot of good things over these shows though. About the movie. IMO, Joel S is not a good director and was not a good choice for this project. Who chose him, especially considering his earlier works included Flatliners (which I liked, but hardly a great movie) and the really bad Batman movie? I hated the flashbacks. I hated that the Phantom's ""magic"" and hypnotic powers were generally not shown. I hated that much of the singing was changed to spoken dialog. Most of all, I didn't think the direction really evoked any of the feelings one takes away from the B'way show, and that to me is a major failure. The casting was really off. While many may say Emmy Rosum's highly talented, blah, blah...I just didn't see it. While the character requires naivety, the role really needed someone more experienced, especially acting wise. I felt like she was just standing around and singing w/ a fair voice, but I didn't see any real acting from her. The Phantom was too young and too hot. Gerard Butler's Phantom left you feeling like his character was more psychopath and less the tortured, love sick figure that's seen in the B'way show. The man is so good looking that he looks better than Raoul even with the distorted face. Overall, I feel there's too little sympathy for the Phantom in this movie. I felt Minnie Driver was quite good as Carlotta (the non-singing part of her, that is), but she's supposed to be a fairly minor character. What can I say? ALW screwed up w/ this one. Evita was a far better film adaptation IMO. Hopefully, Aspects of Love (currently in production) will be better.",The Phantom of the Opera

I just do not think that they really work in modern Hollywood. The last good musical was the South Park film, anyway: The direction was sloppy. Joel Schumaker hasn't really made too many good films as of late. His last good movie was 8MM, and before that Falling Down. While watching Phantom, I felt as if some of the camera shots were the comical and zany shots that were in Batman Forever/Batman & Robin. I just don't think he was the right choice to direct this film.Also, the whole added story about Raoul as an old man was a little unneeded. Why not just have the story as it is? Why add in all this bollocks that really does not justice to the story.The art direction and costume design. Well, what can I say? Fantastic. You can be sure this will grab up some Oscars for that. The movie itself is a feast for the eyes. Lots of visual eye candy and the such.I am not really going to say much about the music.

Everything just comes across as bigger than life and yet so human at the same time. -It was slightly ""stagey"", but it is based on a show, so I was expecting that. And it really only adds to the charm that the movie possesses.The music was incredible! Every time they reprised ""the phantom's song"" I just got chills! And though the words to the songs are sometimes hard to hear, the story is still easily understood. The fact that most of this cast is not well known only helps the movie. You aren't distracted by remnants of any other characters the actors have portrayed and you can just enjoy the story for what it is.Emmy Rossum as ""Christine"" and Gerard Butler as ""the Phantom"" have such chemistry when they are together on screen that you almost fall in love with the phantom as well -even when you know that he had just done many ruthless unforgivable things.

442,kicangel,Absolutely loved it!,10,12 December 2004,"Now i have neither read the book, nor seen it on stage, but loved it on the big screen. I thought the costumes and sets were amazing, extremely lavish. There was sense of grandeur which Hollywood can either get wonderfully right, or woefully wrong - here they got it right. The musical numbers were great (though i imagine those familiar with the theatre version will already know that) and very enjoyable and moving. The acting i thought was overall good, though i think the Raoul (Patrick Wilson) left something to be desired. I thought the Phantom (Gerard Butler) was excellent (and seriously good cape swishing. I mean, how many men can pull off that look? Dracula?...) Those who don't like musicals should really avoid this film, but for those of us who do, go out and see it. Amazing. One thing though - what was up with the horse? I don't think this counts as a spoiler, but i warn you anyway. There's a bit, where the Phantom id leading Christine down into the depths of the theatre, and to take her further there's a horse tied up. Now i know he's obviously been planning this, but still. Very random, and bit off-putting. I mean where did the horse live? Where was it for the rest of the film? How did he get it down there? Why couldn't she just walk? I might be missing something really important about it, but it just seemed pointless to me. But apart from random (though admittedly romantic) horses, this is a fantastic film, and i urge people to go.

443,crawlfan-1,"A hard film to really appreciate, and at the same time excellent in every aspect",5,21 October 2007,"I saw this movie before I went to see the live Broadway play a few months later, and up until I saw the play, I loved this film. The music is intoxicating, to say the absolute least. However, after seeing the play, you begin to turn against this film because of the sheer brilliance of the Broadway musical. They killed the beautiful atmosphere of the play, and all the characters seem a bit separated. For example, if you watch a scene with the Phantom, then change to a scene with the managers, it seems like you aren't watching the same film anymore. It's hard to explain if you have never seen the live version.Speaking for Gerard Butler, who played the title role, he's a magnificent actor in this and really captivates you. However, his voice is severely lacking what a good Phantom should have. It's a bit hoarse, and he growls and shouts instead of hitting the notes in some of the songs. And there's the ""sexy"" issue, which deprives this film of ANY POSSIBLE DIGNITY it could have ever achieved. The Phantom is a deformed creep who's been living in a sewer his whole live. Something tells me that isn't drop-dead gorgeous. ""Phan-girls"" are utterly the worst thing to ever happen to this franchise (and if you ever visit YouTube, you'll see for yourself), because they focus more on the ""sexiness"" of Gerard Butler than anything else in this, completely ignoring the terrible acting of the other lead.Which leads me to Emmy Rosum, who plays the role of Christine Daae. The way she sings for her age is breathtaking, and hard to believe. However, she hasn't got a shred of acting ability whatsoever. I mean for God's sake, I can't even describe how pathetic she is. She only makes one facial expression in the entire movie, and doesn't even TRY to act in the least. It's so ignorant, it actually angers me to see her on screen. Lloyd Webber (the composer) is nothing but a whore for money, and probably accepted this pitiful excuse of a performer before hearing anyone else in the role. Even Sofia Coppola was better in ""The Godfather: Part III"" than Emmy is in this.As far as the sets and make-up goes, it's very unsatisfying. The way they try and make the deformity look is the cheapest there has ever been for a Phantom, musical or not. It literally looks like he has a tumor and a rash on his face: NOTHING ELSE. Once again, it probably had something to do with the ""sexy"" effect they were going for. Damn you, Andrew Lloyd Webber! The atmosphere of the whole movie really leaves you depressed, after seeing the play in which every set for every scene was magnificent.Overall, this is the greatest musical ever to be presented, but is not the best representation of it. If you have the chance, see the play before you see this. If you have no other choice, however, it's highly recommended.",The Phantom of the Opera
444,sanjeev-sarpal,"OK, but a poor contender to the musical",5,5 March 2007,"Having seen the original musical in London, the film was rather disappointing. The songs were cut and pasted, and characters lacked the passion of the original cast - although the final scene with the Phantom was better than the original. The 'beauty' of the musical was the use of and style of English, which was rather poorly portrayed in the film. My advice to anyone who has seen the musical is not to bother with the film, as you will be disappointed. However, just analyzing it as a film, I would say that it that it was a good film, but in truth they should have left it alone, as it the musical (in my opinion) was a masterpiece.JB.",The Phantom of the Opera

I finally decided to, so on the day it came out I went. And I am so glad I did! The movie was pure magic. Everything about it was marvelous. The singing is sensational, it is obvious that the actors were not just casted purely on ""celeb status"", they all truly can sing. Emmy, ""Christine"", plays the part perfectly, and she is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. The sets were amazing, sometimes with color, sometimes black and white, but they always looked good. The acting was great too. The best part, in my opinion, was the Phantom. He was cast perfectly. His voice is great, and so are his looks! His acting is marvelous too, it brings you to tears....so definitely bring tissues! The chemistry between the Phantom and Christine was soooo good, it gave me goosebumps. When either one of them sang you would get the chills. I definitely recommend this movie.

The beauty and detail of the film along with the freedom to move the camera anywhere it needs to be combined with the freshness and passion of the relatively unknown cast made me love every minute. Minnie Driver is a hoot, Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds the perfect foils, Patrick Wilson is solid as the earnest young suitor, Emmy Rossum is enchanting as the innocent girl caught between loves, and Gerard Butler made me shiver with delight as the phantom. Michael Crawford's voice is smoother and better trained, but I kept thinking of him as Hero in A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum and his voice came off as a tad whiny at times. Gerard Butler's voice is raw and passionate and far more preferable to me as a seductive figure. I took a group of high schoolers and they were unanimous in their enjoyment of it.

447,tjk1986,A Remarkable Film,10,3 January 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is a spectacle. As a stage show, as a musical score, and finally as a full length feature film. Everyone knows the story of the dark and tragic opera house and it's tormented villain who lurks in the depths. This tale by Gaston Leroux is not quite the same in book form as it remains in either the stage show or the movie which is why, quite possibly, there exists a ""Andrew Lloyd Webber's"" before its title. Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man responsible for Cats, Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar, and many other spectacle shows with lavish music and gigantic stage productions, has created a beautiful art piece with the Phantom of the Opera on stage, and the translation has been mounted successfully.Director Joel Schumacher, whom I personally respect as a director, has gone for a youthful view on the Phantom, casting a young Phantom (Gerald Butler) and an even younger Christine, the object of his affection, played beautifully by newcomer Emmy Rossum. Another man, Raoul (stage vet Patrick Wilson) vies for her affection as well. The movie succeeds on the strength of these three casting choices. This trio has the most daunting musical numbers including The Phantom of the Opera, All I Ask Of You, Music of the Night, Point of No Return. They are all bright marks on the future of film. Superb background work is done, notably by Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson, two underestimated talents in film today.The Andrew Lloyd Webber score is heavy, and at times monotonous but then again so is most opera and I feel his score is clever at both creating opera, musical theatre, operetta, and just plain and simply breathtaking melodies.I would highly recommend The Phantom to anyone.TJK",The Phantom of the Opera
448,ARRI535BL,Could have been better.,7,25 January 2005,"Well, I've been expecting that film version of Webber's masterpiece for a very long time to come! Being a strong fan of stage version (I watched it in London about 4-5 times) I was afraid of disappointing in the film version. Well, first of all the good aspects of the movie - the scenery, costumes and orchestrations are truly excellent - Schumacher and Webber did a really remarkable job here. The masquerade sequence was directed and filmed excellently! But that's all the good points. Now, for a casting. Butler turned out to be and excellent Phantom, despite all my fears (he was a rock band singer). But Emmy Rossum...First of all, I'm not sure if Schumacher have checked her acting skills before signing the contract. Yes, she's got the voice (altohough it's not as powerful as Sara Brightman's or of the girl in modern London cast). But when she sings 'Think of me' and then goes like 'a-a-a-a-a-a-a!', I really couldn't stand her I-am-your-sweetheart horrible grimace. Then, in the dungeon, when Butler sings 'The Music of The Night' she starts to turn up her eyes in a comic passion and performs somewhat what may seem a fake orgasm. The girl simply can't act! That was horrible. Raoul turned to be a pretentious cheesy-handsome narcissist with no charisma and a really weak voice (check out the Original London Cast CD and compare). All the others were okay. Then, I could'n see the point in having J. Schumacher directing the film. As far as I remember, his strongest achievements were mainstream politically correct thrillers like 'The Client' and '8 mm'. Could't Webber hire someone like Baz Luhrmann? The film could have been MUCH better. And we wouldn't see any fog at a SNOWY graveyard.",The Phantom of the Opera

The vocals dissolved into insipid melodramas, and the pacing was slower than a horse bound for the glue factory. Unbelievable that after nearly 20 years this was all the better they could do. Would have been pretty good as a silent movie, given the lush staging, and beautiful costumes. Maybe they can overdub the original Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in future DVD versions. This is a great example of something that takes itself too seriously, and thinks that its own love of itself will take everyone else in.

450,kevi_kevi,better than expected,6,2 January 2005,"I've seen a lot of adapted versions of different literatures/musicals and most of them weren't that good, so I didn't have high expectations when I went into the cinema. I was wrong. I've heard Gerarld's singing in the trailer on TV, and it wasn't fascinating, so I didn't expect much when I went into the cinema. I was wrong. I thought to myself 'the only thing I'd get out from this movie is the exquisite and extravagant settings' when I went into the cinema, I was wrong yet again.Plot? Undoubtedly fascinating. Settings and cinematography? Great and almost flawless. Acting? Some very good performances and overall very satisfying. So, I'll concentrate on the singing part.Being a great fan of musicals and operas, I told myself from the beginning that the people in this film are all actors and NOT singers, so seriously I wasn't expecting a lot from them. I have to say I was stunned after watching the whole movie, I never expected them to sing so well. Even if their voices didn't quite reach perfection they were able to compensate it with the passions and emotions they expressed. I have to say even after listening to Michael Crawford for almost 10 years, I prefer Gerard Butler. Not saying that Michael Crawford is not a great singer, for he IS undoubtedly (I had his version of the Phantom of the Opera CD), but there's something raw, fierce, rough and ghostly in Gerard's voice, almost like animal instinct, which I find suited the character 'Phantom' more, given the tragic and lonely life he has led, being feared and rejected, these would naturally turn a person back to basic instincts, let alone a child. Gerard reminds me of the Phantom I've heard when I was young (around...10 years ago?), whom regrettably I never found out who exactly he was (the performance was in Hong Kong, anybody help?), with a rough and enchanting voice that expressed raw passion, something not unlike Gerard's singing...I was stunned, I was touched, and for many years I've tried to find out who that person was, without success, and somehow now I am able to see him in Gerard.In some sense, Raol and Meg had better voices (more close to the 'perfect' singing voice, e.g. Ian Bostridge, Sarah Brightman, etc) than the Phantom and Christine, but they lacked the passion, the 'rawness' in their voices, they don't quite have the uniqueness that brings about impact on audiences' emotions like the Phantom. But I was pleasantly surprised by their performances and I was fascinated and captured.Some people complained that Gerard can't sing, but hey, who said that Phantom had a beautiful voice? People whom are good singing teachers are not necessarily good singers themselves =P",The Phantom of the Opera
451,DutchRonin,Didn't age well,6,25 May 2021,Just watched this for the first time and was disappointed. This one didn't age well if it even was better in 2004.Except for the title song none of the other songs are really memorable. At least not like other Webber musicals. The whole movie looks like they just filmed the theatre performance. Sure the story takes place in a theatre but all the 'non stage' sets look so artificial.And why cast Butler as the phantom?

452,Claire-loves-the-movies,"Good, but not great",6,19 February 2012,"Well. I have recently read the original book of Phantom of The Opera and loved it, so I immediately wanted to see the movie, hoping it would be as wonderful as the book. Now I wasn't completely disappointed but lets go over the pros and cons.Pros: Music-The music in this movie is amazing. It is soulful and uplifting and sad all at the same time. Absolutely breathtaking.Emmy Rossum- She was only 16 during filming and she still steals the show with her amazing voice though she is fairly weak on the acting front. Actually she is more a pro and a con. Nice voice, bad acting.Artistics-Simply the way this movie plays out, with the light and colour of the sets and atmosphere, is almost enough to make you forget the flaws. It is beautiful.Now the cons: Gerard Butler-I don't have anything against Gerard Butler as and actor. I do a singer. I said I had just finished the book, and I came into this movie expecting the voice of an Angel of Music, but instead I got Geard Butler trying desperately to be good when he is just so bad. And since this whole movie is told through song we don't get much relief. He is fine in the scenes when he gets to simply sit around and look sad but when he has to open his mouth I cringe. Also I hate that we had to sacrifice a good voice and maybe not as nice a face(but let me remind you that this is the point of the story) for someone with a more attractive face and a horrible voice.The disfigurement-This one is kind of minor, but the phantoms disfigurement really annoyed me. I know I keep making references to the book when this is Andrew Lloyd Webbers, The Phantom of the Opera but still. In the book the Phantom is described as- Skin yellow as parchment, with only one or two locks of hair on his forehead and four black holes that served as his eyes, nose and mouth. Sounds horrifying right. Well when the time came for the unmasking, I was actually a little scared. But here is what we get. 3/4 of his face are just fine, fulfilling the need society has for pretty people, and he is fully unmasked, well let me just say, it looks like he got a really bad sunburn.But in the end, the good outweighs the bad in this movie, considering the only real flaw in my mind is Gerard Butlers singing, and I certainly enjoyed watching it. It is quite the spectacle and I can see how it stemmed from a Broadway musical. It is not for everyone but it was enjoyable. And like I said, the music is to die for.",The Phantom of the Opera

But the transition from stage to screen so rarely works well and this is no exception. It is too obviously a stage production someone filmed rather than a cinematic experience.Hated the sung dialogue! It never really works for me unless its in Italian!! And as for the Phantom's 'disfigurement', it looked more as though he'd had a bad morning with the shaver than a personality twisting deformity.But the main problem is the plot. Knowing nothing about the story, I (and several friends) left the cinema perplexed. What actually happened to Christine and the Phantom? Who is the woman we see at the end and why did she bid for the music box? Too many loose ends - as a friend said, 'And what happened to the conductor?!' Good performances from the cast, but the film is flawed by too much attention to FX and not enough to ensuring that the story is clearly told.",The Phantom of the Opera
454,lavellen,Great Operetta turned Mediocre Film,6,11 January 2005,"This is not what I expected. I thought that I would have run to the computer with rave reviews directly following my screening of this one but it turns out that despite the obvious... the music... the remainder of the film leaves much to be desired. I, having loved the musical for years now, would like to pull apart a few in your face blunders and detail mistakes that make this shlocky enough to pull it's automatic 10 rating all the way down to a 6. For starters I would like to say that there were just enough great scenes to make this a good film, but the bad scenes were all very disappointing and some even atrocious. The phantom in this rendition takes a departure from the wounded vain individual he was portrayed as in most renditions (his eyes were normal and his face was too for most of the time). I've heard it argued that it represents the ""illusion"" of the phantom... his mystique, well the fact is if you have to explain it to someone than the story missed out on telling you that to begin with. Watch for the scene ""Masquerade"" which is definitely the cinematographic highlight of the film. Other than that the characters had no depth (I blame the Direction) and the scenery was over-the-top, but only enough to make me wonder,""wow, I wonder how big this could've been if they would have just admitted to themselves that this scene should be ridiculous"" instead of trying to hide it with realism that wasn't pulled off atoll. One other note, before directing an entire musical maybe try directing a music video to figure out how to properly line up vocals with picture... because there were scenes that lost all of their dramatics when you could tell that the singer had sung it differently in the studio than on the stage. Looks to me like somebody needs a do-over. Maybe in 20 years or so I'll do one.",The Phantom of the Opera
455,TheDarkKnight12,The Phantom of the Opera - overrated flop,6,3 August 2005,"Visually this film is delicious from the outset, the black and white sequences are reminiscent of the visuals in 'Moulin Rouge', but the actual actors are quite frankly poor. I am fully aware this is a musical adaptation and some of the moments were truly breathtaking such as the roof scene with the Phantom lurking in the shadows, surrounded by gargoyles, or angels, he makes the similarity in some of the lyrics, but he refers to himself as the ""Angel of the Night"".There were two clear cut ""toilet breaks"" in this film, where you could leave the cinema, go to the loo, come back in and the film hadn't moved on. I appreciate the use of tone and melody to put a point across but at the finale when things are rushing and Christine has ""the choice"" she decides to sing her thoughts in Soprano instead of the realistic split second decision that the Phantom is pressing for.The songs were just stupidly slow moving in parts and Christine looks more like a gormless fool than an enchanting young lady, in parts. The phantom himself almost managed to shape the lyrics into the desired melody but sometimes it felt like they were searching for notes rather than putting things into song because it should be - more of a case of doing it for the sake of it, and the ""Devil Child"" circus scene is just ridiculous, as if they'd allow for children to be brought up in such a place! I haven't seen the musical and have no desire to.And if the Phantom has lived in the dungeon for so many years - where did he obtain his clothes? How did he learn to speak with such grammatical correctness, where did he learn to write music and what instruments is he using? The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous - and as for the ""night in shining armour"" he's more of a wet lettuce than anything to be reckoned with. If the Phantom wasn't just an unfortunate social outcast, then this lad would be cream-crackered! His voice is so monotonous and yawnful that I couldn't help but laugh. It's no wonder Christine is so ""weak willed"" I would be too just to have a little bit of excitement rather than the ""i want to go wherever you go - that's all i ask""...that's all you ask?! Right.One good thing about the singing was that all the words (well, more than you normally can hear in a musical) could be heard, well done, but let's face it, the plot isn't exactly hard to follow is it now? Minnie Driver was the only bright spark in this film and even she was remarkably annoying. The two owners of the Theatre were actually superb in their roles, and one particular scene was absolutely perfect (The scene where the Phantom has given them all so many notes, explaining different parts of his plan). Furthermore, what would the Phantom need £20,000 a month for? And, how can he possibly survive down there? We've seen that his saviour wouldn't even dare venture down into the dungeon so I highly doubt she made regular visits to see him.I hate being so pedantic, but the storyline begs these questions, and the storyline isn't good enough to avoid them. It's not so ""magical"" or ""myserious"" or ""well shot"" to rule out these everyday routines! And make of it what you like, but if I've sat through this movie and the first thing I think of is ""how does the phantom survive and his monetary issues"" then it speaks for itself! It's not all bad. It's averagely good, worth a watch if you've got a couple of hours to waste.",The Phantom of the Opera
456,Metalfairy,Breathtaking,8,13 December 2004,"This was a spectacular film full of lavish sets and costumes and some wonderful singing. I have not seen the stage adaptation so I cannot be too critical. What I saw was a wonderful film with some good acting and singing. I thought Minnie Driver was fantastic as Carlotta and Gerard Butler wasn't half bad as the phantom. I wasn't too keen on his singing voice though. Emmy Rossum was wonderfully innocent as Christine and she has such a beautiful singing voice but sometimes she came across as a little bit wooden at times. The biggest surprise was Jennifer Ellison. I am used to her as a mouthy Liverpudlian and never thought much of her as an actress but I really loved her as Meg and thought she looked very pretty and sounded wonderful singing wise.The film overall tended to drag in places but I loved the use of the main theme song for the dramatic moments and there were plenty. The mixture of accents tended to be slightly annoying, from Miranda Richardson's french to Emmy's rather confusing American then British smatterings. The sets were wonderful, I loved all the costumes. The ending I found very poignant and quite sad but still enjoyable.It was a fantastic film and it makes me want to see the stage adaptation even more which I imagine will probably blow the film out of the water but I saw the film impartially, have been waiting for weeks and thankfully I was not disappointed. 8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
457,james_rushbrooke,Webber's wonder spoilt by Wilson's blunder,8,27 January 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic masterpiece 'The Phantom of the Opera' finally hit the big screen in Britain, but it has been a long wait for many fans. (The film was originally planned for the early nineties and set to star Sarah Brightman as Christine and Michael Crawford as The Phantom, recreating the roles they dazzled audiences with in the West End.) At the time the project was first shelved in 1990 the star of this movie would still have been just four and toddling happily around a New York pre-school. At sixteen years old when filming began, Emmy Rossum (Christine) is perhaps one of the most talented youngsters to come out of the USA in years. Rossum's performance seems to grow in strength and maturity as the film progresses and she holds her own against her much older co-stars. The one mar on an otherwise excellent performance is her 'slapped goldfish' impression, which is smattered through the film with reckless abandon by director Joel Schumacher.Patrick Wilson's Raoul is perhaps the weak link in this otherwise well cast film. Although vocally brilliant Wilson does little more than irritate the audience by bouncing around like a love struck cocker-spaniel. His portrayal of the French count is lack lustre, flat and leaves the audience wondering why Christine would pick him as a lover over the much more exciting Phantom (Gerard Butler.) The title role however has been well cast and Butler manages to make us empathise and grow fond of a character that is essentially a psychotic murderer. The on screen chemistry between Rossum and Butler adds an edge to the romance, and their voices are sublimely matched, enough to get the audience tingling with anticipation for the heavy opening pipe organ chords of the title song 'Phantom of the Opera' The film is lavish, extravagant and well directed by Joel Schumacher but lacks the atmosphere and excitement of the West-End production. Supporting roles from Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver help bring credibility to a cast of relative unknowns. This film is definitely worth the price of a ticket but isn't a patch on the experience of seeing it in the West-End. The musical involves the audience in a way that the film simply cannot, seeing the chandelier come down in the movie doesn't exhilarate in the same way as experiencing the fear of having it drop towards your seat! 'Being part of the show' is what is sadly missing from the movie version but if you're a Lloyd Webber fan this is a must see musical extravaganza It kept me in my seat and my eyes pointed at the screen, and I'm a fairly picky customer! The occasional tut-tut at the talentless Patrick Wilson only spoilt the enjoyment for my girlfriend and not myself. Sadly the end of the film, in staying true to the book, doesn't leave room for a sequel.I gave this film a whopping 8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
458,tdcheck,Brilliant,10,19 December 2004,"Well I loved it. Already a huge fan of the music, I was really looking forward to seeing this film and to be honest I was expecting to be a little disappointed. Thankfully i wasn't. I loved the sets, the costumes and thought that all the actors did an amazing job. they have a lot to live up too and personally I think they all did well.i think my main concern was I was not going to think a lot of the phantom - having listened to Michael Crawford singing for years, but I actually though this version was better - he puts more emotion into his singing and more ermm 'grunt'! As you can tell I'm no critic and not great with words, but I still had goosebumps listening to the music and came out of the cinema crying! Thank you soo much for making this film!",The Phantom of the Opera
459,Oldguypo8,phantom lives again,10,25 December 2004,"The music and characters came to life. The sets and camera work were visually compelling whether on stage, beneath the opera house, the roof, or the graveyard. The time transitions began a visual feast. People who have been unable to see the stage production can now see what all the fuss has been about. Casting worked, the music rocked, the story moved. On stage it was one of the great operas of the last century. Now it is a costume drama, a love story, a horror show all in one. The bickering in the chat lines simply shows that people felt it deeply. Enjoy it for what we have been missing. Celebrate the life and scale of the experience. It isn't South Pacific and it isn't Carmen filmed. It is a Phantom Lon Chaney, Nelson Eddy, and all the others could not give us. Bravo.",The Phantom of the Opera

It is brilliant, perfect, astonishing. And really, really touching. My heart broke at the end. I loved the parallels (the black and white scenes - the future and the color scenes - the past). It was unique, and conveyed so many emotions. The acting was perfect, the costumes were perfect, the songs were perfect.. EVERYTHING was perfect. This is one of those movies that I will be happy to watch again and again and never grow tired of it. Brilliantly done. That is all I can say. Pure perfection!",The Phantom of the Opera
461,ParanoiaPoliticianDiva77,Spectacular! Beautiful! And slightly homicidal...,10,13 July 2006,"The screen lightens as eerie music plays and a candle lights itself, revealing the haunting brown scrawl: The Phantom of the Opera. This is the beginning of the movie that introduced me to Phantom, and from the moment the candle lit itself and illuminated the title I was entranced; this was the movie I had been searching for, I had found it. From the beautiful operas within operas and hauntingly raw love of the mysterious phantom we delve into a perfectly imperfect world where not everything is as it seems and looks can deceive. Those who are as beautiful as the Prima Donna Carlotta turn out to be horrid and nasty, wishing ill on those who she does not like. Then there are those like the phantom who can rapture and enthrall us, force us to love him despite his deformed face. We begin the story in the midst of rehearsals for a new opera to be performed that evening and everything is a shambles as the current manager passes on his role to two new conceited managers, prima donnas have tantrums, opera ghosts leave demanding notes and a mysteriously curious ballet Mistress suggests a chorus girl sing the lead as the lead Soprano walks out in a fit. It is this Swedish orphan, Christine Daaé (Rossum) that does indeed win the leading role and performs magically that night. Emmy Rossum plays Daaé with her gentle nature and sweet spirit, though has the dark undercurrent that Christine must always possess as she is pursued by a spectral shade, enchanted and afraid of the magical voice that sings to her. Though at times she may pull ratherstrange faces, reminiscent of a goldfish perhaps or a deer in the headlights, she pulls off Christine's character well, enraptured, like the audience, with the mysterious phantom. At this point we are introduced to Raoul (Wilson), a handsome young Vicomte, previously a playmate of Mademoiselle Daaé when they were children. Recognising her he plans to court her. Patrick Wilson, a trained Musical Theatre actor, succeeds very well in this role, singing amazingly and bringing the selfless character that only wants his beloved Christine to be safe and happy. My only complaint could possibly be his extremely foppish hair, at times bringing the Leroux Raoul to mind (not a good thing). But just as we are introduced to this sweet courtship at its nervous nostalgic beginnings our leading lady is spoken to fiercely by the magical voice that taught her to sing. He commands her to obey him and she pleads with him to forgive her. Suddenly her full-length mirror opens and she is mystically led down strange stone corridors by a masked figure in dress clothes. He takes her to his underground home; a cave on a lake furnished like any other Victorian home and urges her to sing only for him. At this point Christine realizes he is not an angel but cannot think of him as a real man; she calls him the phantom. Scottish actor Gerard Butler plays this Phantom. What most thought as unsuited for the role with his rock star like voice and appearance I believe he brings a different emotional side to the Phantom. His rough voice somehow suits the phantoms rocky character and the despair sometimes heard in it fit perfectly. No Michael Crawford but something completely different; while Crawford portrayed the Angelic mischievous side of the Phantom, Butler brings a darker devilish pained side to the phantom, with his deep baritone voice and expressive face. His rendition of Music of the Night still remains one of my favorites, tying with Crawford himself. Suddenly we are drawn in a flurry to the world of the opera house again, above ground this time. Andre and Firmin are played wonderfully and the only possible complaint with them is their hair. I'm not sure what was going on in the hair and makeup department for this movie but somewhere they lost the plot. Il Muto is staged perfectly, Butler's voice echoing eerily throughout the theater. The only lacking in this section is now that I have listened to my Original London cast soundtrack I always notice the lack of the maniacal laugh, the flickering chandelier lights and the cry of 'Behold! She's singing to bring down the chandelier!'. Though the dropping at the end of the movie creates a disastrous climatic feel we miss out on hearing Butler attempt the laugh, the strange crazed side of Erik that most Phans adore. One of the beauties of this film is the way it evokes such emotion from the viewers, without a tragic death of a main character to summon it. Merely as Butler sings the last line of the film ('It's over now the music of the night') you cannot help but sob for the sad heartbroken phantom. When you see the pure fear and trapped feelings of Rossum in the final lair scene you cannot help but feel for her, a sweet talented girl put into a dreadful heart wrenching situation. Her passion as she sings to save her fiancée Raoul is beautiful, the notes almost crushed and cracked by her despair. You cannot help but feel slightly defensive for Wilson's swashbuckling hero Raoul as he begs Christine to kill him so she can be free. You may love the Phantom but you know this Raoul is brave and good and it is too unfair that Christine must make a choice. Overall after nearly a year since my first viewing of Phantom I still indeed love the movie, though I have moved on to enjoying other aspects of Phantom; Michael Crawford's angelic voice, Lon Chaney's impeccable performance and Leroux's spine tingling book. This movie is the perfect place to first see POTO as most Phans I know began by watching this very film. I every aspect I adore this film and I know it is worth your time and so much more.",The Phantom of the Opera
462,piggypiggy,"Stunning and heartbreaking, a tribute to the theatrical production.",9,25 March 2005,"I went to see this movie with the express intention of completely slating it for being so audacious, and was pleasantly surprised. Joel Schumacher for once has failed to offend me (such previous offences including the appalling Phonebooth), however this is probably due to the involvement of Phantom's masterful composer Lloyd Webber and the story being an established artwork on stage. Having seen the stage play at Her Majesty's Theatre for the first time very recently and listened to the original cast recording on vinyl since I was knee high, I was so enthralled with the music and choreography I couldn't see how translating it to film would possibly work without ruining the mystique of theatre. But to my amazement it was so good it actually made me want to see the stage version again! I thought the cast were very well chosen, Emmy Rossum being a star in the making with a wonderful voice for her age, which although was slightly weak in places will grow stronger with maturity. Also another delight was Gerard Butler skilfully making up with acting talent what he lacked in vocal ability - did you know he actually took singing lessons to be able to perform the role of the phantom? I think that's definitely going beyond the call of duty and I didn't much mind his occasionally fluffing a note because he made me feel more compassion for the phantom than the actor I saw on stage did (and that's no mean feat!). I was astonished that Jennifer Ellison managed to shake off her strong Liverpool accent in order to carry off her role as Meg and showed her true talent for acting, singing and dancing was worthy of more than a TV soap, may the offers come flowing in for her. The scenery was breathtaking, especially the scenes in the cemetery and the phantoms lair, and Rossum looked stunning in every one, stealing the show every time in gorgeous 19th century attire (that white lace dress in the phantoms boat springs to mind, absolutely divine). I loved that the film stayed true to the theatre version only making minor changes which if anything aided the portrayal of the Phantoms heartbreaking story. One scene that did this well I thought was the Don Juan performance where Christine and the Phantom are going up the stairs and although singing lines from the Phantoms script they are actually talking about their own feelings. This scene isn't the same as in the stage version but I felt it added to the depiction of their doomed romance.Webber and Schumacher didn't try to smother the film in special effects knowing that the stage play could never compete; instead it was a tasteful yet lavish tribute to the amazing theatrical production, bringing the celebrated Phantom music to those who haven't yet had the honour of watching the stage play. Wherever you see it whether at the theatre, cinema or on DVD you will not be disappointed!",The Phantom of the Opera
463,writer_cb,STUNNING movie!,7,8 June 2005,"I feel that everyone has already said what I wanted to say, but the movie was so exquisite that I just HAVE to comment! I have never read or seen a stage version of Phantom of the Opera, and I knew next to nothing about the plot when I saw this movie. I was worried that I would hate it and find it boring, because I'm not that fond of musicals, but my family really wanted to see it so we rented it and I sat down to see if I would like it.LIKE it? I LOVED IT! I wish I had seen it in the theaters! All the flashing colors, amazing costumes, and fairy-tale like words and story would have been even more fascinating if I had! Every second of this movie has your eyes glued to the screen in awe of something or other, whether it be the intricate costumes, vibrant colors, or suspense of the story. I was at the edge of my seat with excitement the whole time, the mystery of who the Phantom was and what Christine's choices would be driving me crazy.Emmy Rossum was a very beautiful Christine, with youthful features and lovely hair, but gosh, her VOICE was by far the most beautiful thing about it! The first time I heard her sing a song on stage, the high, angelic notes rising ever higher, I was SO amazed! The drama of this story becomes even more so when the Phantom of the Opera enters. The actor who played the Phantom, I forget his last name, he was astounding! Not only did he have a jaw-dropping voice (whoever says his voice wasn't good, they have something wrong with their ears), but he played the sad/loving/genius/insane personality of the Phantom SO well! I found his character had the most depth to it.SPOILER AHEAD...The actor who played the Phantom, in my opinion his best moment was when he first brought Christine to his lair and sang a song to her, about the angel of music and the place of music. There was one moment where he talked about her heart soaring, and on the word ""soar"" the note he held was SO high (especially impressive for a man) that I almost dropped off the couch in shock! END OF SPOILER PARAGRAPH.I cannot compliment this movie ""The Phantom of Opera"" enough. It weaves everything that makes a movie fascinating into one complete, stunning, unique and aesthetically pleasing whole. The visuals are realistic, colorful, they make you feel like you are THERE. The costumes and stage sets make it not difficult to imagine how opera was done back in the 1800s. The characters were full fleshed out and stunning to behold in both their looks, the way they portrayed their characters' emotions and personalities, and, of course, the singing parts of the performance... were the most ethereal, tear-inducing, jaw-dropping, awe-bringing parts of the whole movie! For anyone who loves adventure, anyone who loves romance and a good story, anyone who is curious about the raving behind Phantom of the Opera, anyone who loves hearing beautiful voices at work, THIS it the movie for YOU! Go see it! Quick! It will be an experience I am sure you will not regret.",The Phantom of the Opera
464,emee4real,Oh wow!!!,10,14 November 2007,"Wow!!! That's all I can say. Wow!!! If Joel Schumacher has done a better film than this I don't care! Not one bit. Great singing, great acting, pumped-up adrenaline all in one, this flick's got it all. Oh, and humor too. Gerard Butler may not have the best singing voice but that aside, he was absolutely brilliant as the Phantom. The final scene with Christine and Raoul, I think showed Butler at his best in any movie I've seen him. (of course there are many of his movies I have not seen yet). Emmy Rossum was cool as Christine. I loved Jenny Ellison as Meg; she was very pretty to behold. The song ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was well-performed by both Butler and Rossum. The underground river scenes kept me so enchanted I kept rewinding the song to hear it again and again. Minnie Driver has again shown that she would make (in my opinion) a real stand-up comedienne. But all said the movie was a big hit for me and Schumacher gives one of his best movies. All the actors, but especially Butler and Rossum, did so well that if they did more it will just be too much. I doff my hat for them.So I give it 10/10. Anybody who sees nothing good in this movie should really have his head or IQ examined by a psychiatrist. And I mean it!!",The Phantom of the Opera
465,pnsei,Favorite Musical,10,18 August 2018,The Phantom takes you on an emotional roller coaster through his struggles with a beautiful score to carry you along.

466,KatieScarlettButler,I prefer it to the stage version!,8,10 March 2006,"As an actress myself, I look out for who is good or bad in films and why, so here goes. The lead roles are quite extreme. Gerard Butler's Phantom, is, at times, ridiculously over-dramatic, which is a shame as it means he ends up shouting a lot of his songs, which takes away from the painful beauty of them. No, it takes away the beauty and just leaves painful. I'm not a fan of him. Sorry! Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, over plays the wilting flower a little, but rather than badly affect the songs, hers become better as a result, because any strong emotion she puts into them is small as she is playing the character in this way. Raoul is a little flaky, and I think that like Emmy Rossum, the man who plays him (forgotten his name :S) is more a singer than an actor.There is, however, salvation in the form of flawless actresses Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson. Driver's OTT acting and gestures add much needed light relief from the heavy script, but unlike our Phantom she knows when enough is enough. The ever-perfect Miranda Richarson again shows off her versatility as an actress, adapting to her role as Madame Giry effortlessly. She also surprised me with a beautiful voice and the apparent ability to stretch and touch her toes while they are resting on a waist-height ballet bar (it's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it, but an amazing contrast to her role as Queenie in Blackadder II!) Other than that, the film is lovely. I was swept away right from the moment that colour floods the screen, and you can't help but be carried along by the wonderful cinematography, singing, and dance routines (especially Masquerade - it lived up to my high expectations as my favourite song from the show).",The Phantom of the Opera

I was expecting to be disappointed. I was not. This is an exceptionally well done presentation of the Phantom with great sets, and a great cast of up and coming folks instead of Chicago's ""Razzle Dazzle"" cast. Christine and the Phantom are well cast for a superb interpretation of these characters with Christine much younger than I had thought of her, and the Phantom softer than I had him ""im my mind."" The show is true to form and flows well. The flash forwards are great transitions and add to the story. The Masquarade choreography is GREAT. I REALLY enjoyed this one.",The Phantom of the Opera
468,ailiaq,I own the DVD and each and every time I watch it...,10,2 January 2007,"...I morph into a weeping idiot. DISCLAIMER: I have never seen the stage production, so I can't compare the two, but I can applaud it for its pure lushness of music and vivid setting. This movie NEVER fails to transport me outside of myself. I have heard the stage production recordings (the stage show opened when I was a senior in high school and I had several good friends who were self-described ""Phanatics"".) The movie version has a full orchestra behind it, and this lends it a richness that is a bit lacking from the stage production recordings I have heard. As for Gerard Butler's singing, I can only say that his ""rock and roll"" type voice is perfect for conveying the Phantom's soul-tearing loneliness, which is, of course, half of what makes him so appealing. I don't think I've ever been as moved by music as consistently as with the soundtrack to this movie. I watched this for the first time by myself, which is a terribly good thing, given I blubbered for a solid hour after this. (Ladies, if you want a good cathartic cry, rent this one!!) The combination of the set, costumes, storyline, and settings, are all ""overdone"". They assault the senses and leave the viewer unable to remain detached. This is a wonderful thing, in my view, as it allows the viewer to immerse themselves. I'm planning a special trip to London for the sole purpose of seeing this show. I live in the US, so you can gauge my fascination with this.I will say one other thing: ""All I Ask of You"" is quite possibly one of the most romantic, enchanting songs I have ever had the pleasure to hear.",The Phantom of the Opera
469,hashy2,Like Marmite,7,6 January 2007,"Like a certain well known vegetable extract people all seem to love or hate this film. Everything from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical to the performances of the actors are ruthlessly slammed by some viewers while putting others into raptures. Personally I like the musical, like many others written by ALW. Discrediting of his work by pompous critics is defied on all accounts by his success and the numbers of people who go see his musicals. They clearly entertain, what else is the point of musical theatre we ask? Why all the nit picking?As for this adaptation, the sets and effects are excellent. Viewing is better in the latter half, the beginning is a little slow. The lack of dialogue that works fine on stage perhaps doesn't lend itself to the big screen. The music, namely the singing from the cast, certainly doesn't warrant all the criticism it has received. Gerard Butler performs well though he is no Michael Crawford and Patrick Wilson is underrated. It is not Emily Rossums singing that disappoints but her dreamy countenance lacks a spark of life throughout. There are other mild faults such as some questionable lip syncing and I would love to have a patent on the anti ageing cream used by Madame Giry for her to age so little in comparison to Raoul in the early scenes. That being said this film is nowhere near as bad as some would make out and is worth watching, especially if you have never seen the musical.",The Phantom of the Opera

A movie should be about entertainment, and if you can't be entertained seeing and hearing people this beautiful singing songs this melodic in costumes this fabulous on sets this grand, I pity you. If you can't admit you loved this film because it's not cool, or wasn't nominated for 14 Oscars; if you think, as one critic put it that Andrew Lloyd Weber is to music what McDonald's is to hamburgers, then you're not honest and you're pushing some kind of agenda or have a vendetta. Which is the only way I can explain the Academy's snub of this movie. Rossum is an angel come down from heaven, my heart ached for Butler's phantom, and I wasn't even put-off by what could have been a sanctimoniously heroic Raoul, no, heck, I couldn't blame him for loving Christine, and I thought he showed the class to understand that there was love and sexual attraction between Christine and her musical mentor. And that's the last thing I want to say: this may have been the sexiest movie I've ever seen. Wow, I could not take my eyes off it, and I'm having a heck of a time getting my mind off it. I tell everybody that they MUST see this movie. I don't understand the current ""cool"" critical reception it is getting, but I believe the Wizard of Oz got a cool reception from the critics back in 1939 too. But like the Wizard, I think that in 20 years ALW's Phantom of the Opera will be regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made.

475,thecollegebum,7.2 star average? Did I see a different movie?,5,4 June 2005,"First off, I'm a fan of the Broadway musical version of Phantom. No one can match Michael Crawford's singing of the Phantom, but I've seen other stage actors in the roll do great jobs. Gerard Butler almost sank the entire production for me with his version of the character. First off, the look of the Phantom has become more romantic over time -in the book he's a living corpse. Andrew Lloyd Weber sexed him up a bit for the stage, and he's far more prettier here than ever. But this isn't Butler's fault, so let's get back to him. Gerard is a decent actor, but the man is a bit tone deaf. Being a musician I cringed at his song styling. I swear he is either flat, off tempo, or just plain off-key throughout the film. Overall I felt the acting/singing talent lacked all around. Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson are very talented ladies who were stuck in small thankless roles. Heck, Driver is dubbed over half the time anyway. The black and white cuts throughout the film jumping from past to present were annoying and added nothing to the story. Only two good things came through in this production. First off the art direction and set designs were well-executed. I especially love the journey from Christine's dressing room into the Phantom's layer. Secondly, and most obviously, Emmy Rossum is truly a shinning star here. The role of Christine as written by Webber is pretty demanding, and I think she carries it off better than anyone could have hoped. Her vocal talents are truly a wonder to behold, and she was the only one who could carry and emotional scene in this picture. The sequence on top of Apollo's Lyre with the Phantom weeping for example: I couldn't tell if Butler was laughing or crying. Compare that to any scene with Rossum, and BOOM! Butler's blown out of the water. So who's a better Christine, Brightman or Rossum? Honestly, purists will hate me but I prefer Rossum. I think she captures the youth, innocence, talent, and persona of the character better for both the musical and the original book. In the end Rossum is the only thing that really keeps this movie afloat, and it takes a lot of work. 5/10, and that five is all Emmy's.",The Phantom of the Opera

Patrick Wilson, a smooth, pure tenor, a man who is beautiful as the young Raoul, and really remarkable as the old Count de Chagny. Gerard Butler, an exciting, heart-breaking Phantom. His voice is just right for a movie soundtrack; he can do head voice, voice mixe, and belt it out, too. A full time belter isn't appropriate for a movie when the image is so large now and so close to the audience. I couldn't have asked for or hoped for better than all that was in this marvelous Gothic fairy tale of a movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
479,Kaytee23,Amazing!,10,22 January 2005,"I thought this movie was simply amazing! I was a little afraid to see it since I'm so in love with the stage musical and I admit it's nothing compared to the play but I wasn't disappointed. For a little advice, if you've seen it on stage, completely forget that. If you try to compare it to the play, you'll hate it. Just forget about the play and just watch it as if it's something new that you've never seen before. The acting is simply amazing and the way they changed some of the scenes to fit the big screen was magnificent! After seeing this movie, I couldn't see any other actors/ actresses as the characters. The colors of the costumes and theater was wonderful and the songs were as rich as ever!",The Phantom of the Opera
480,Cal_T5X,Late but great,8,26 February 2005,"As a longtime Phantom of the Opera fan, I am pleased to say that the film not only stays true to the popular musical, but adds a new dimension as well. The movie is not quite perfect, but a strong cast, intricate setting and breathtaking Paris scenery are sure to impress viewers. One advantage the film has is that the camera can freely explore the heights, depths, nooks and crannies of the fictitious Opera Populaire. Producer Joel Schumacher generally stays close to Andrew Lloyd Webber's script, although added scenes provide the characters with more of a past and future.Emmy Rossum is sweetly vulnerable as the innocent young singer Christine. Gerard Butler is darkly seductive as the Phantom, whose longing for love and beauty captivates women young and old. Together they radiate sexual energy, particularly in the song ""Point of No Return"". On the downside, Butler can never match the hypnotic voice of Michael Crawford, the original London Phantom. Patrick Wilson completes the love triangle as Raoul. Overall he comes off as a nice guy but a bit of a dandy. He lacks Butler's sex appeal but is a competent singer and an effective good guy in a difficult role where most people are cheering for the Phantom.A first-rate supporting cast also bolsters the film. Minnie Driver savours her role as Prima Donna Carlotta while Victor McGuire plays her foppish beau Piangi. Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow play the hapless theatre managers Firman and Andre. These four vex each other masterfully, providing welcome comic relief. Miranda Richardson plays an expanded role as the mysterious ballet mistress Madam Giry and Jennifer Ellison plays Meg, Giry's daughter and Christine's closest friend.Unlike the theatre, the film is free to swoop through vast corridors, follow scurrying stagehands and plunge into subterranean rivers. Schumacher uses a journey back through time alongside the elderly Raoul to frame the story. In this respect the film reverses convention: unlike the usual flashback where the past is blurry sepia, here the present is washed-out and dreary while the past is vibrant, opulent, and alive. The chandelier's awakening early in the film is especially enjoyable, a well-constructed visual feast.Overall I enjoyed the film, and recommend it to fans of Phantom of the Opera and musical theatre in general. The fascinating visual effects and chemistry of the cast make it a fun trip down memory lane. Most of the dialog is sung, so people who dislike musicals are advised to see one of the other fine adaptations of Gaston Leroux's classic. I recommend the Lon Chaney and Claude Rains versions, two very different interpretations of the same character. Chaney makes him a monster, but Rains plays him as a wounded hero. People who loved the musical will relish the chance to hum along with their favorite songs once more.",The Phantom of the Opera
481,cillian4,Stunning Movie,9,25 February 2006,This is my favorite phantom of the opera movie and I seen dozens of the version of the opera. I never been fond of musical but I have to change my mind after I seen this movie I actually wept for the phantom. Gerald Bulter is so good at playing this trouble masked villain who wanted nothing more than to be love by Christine and to have his music played. I could have cried for him I never felt such compassion for him in the other phantom movie. The Set was exquisite so was Emily Rossum as Christine you can see the conflict she in love with two men one twisted and dark and the other good and yet she drawn to the twisted one. I love the songs so many.,The Phantom of the Opera
482,claudiamarchetti,My Favorite Movie,10,27 March 2005,"I love it the movie!In the beginning, I believed that Gerard Burtler will not make a good Phantom, but he makes as excellent as Michael Crwaford was in the stage. I liked very much Rauol this time. Patrick Willson don't make a tip of ""gay"" Rauol like in other films.I loved Emmy Rumson as Christine, she plays so well her role... and really, she ""...sings like an angel!"".Here in Brazil, where I live, the movie had bad reviews, the critics compares with the cult movie ""Phantom of the Paradise"" with Brian De Palma. But I love it, after all I'm 10 years old, and there's not so much phantom fans like me in my age. Oh, and I'm doing my ""phantom film"" and I uses the score of the movie, cause I love it, and really, this is my favorite movie! my vote: 10,0Recommend for anyone!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
483,Sidhetaur,An excellent movie that tragically missed the whole point.,2,26 March 2015,"I won't really compare this to the stage play. I did see it on stage but when I watched this I expected it to be different and I don't think I compared it unfairly to the other versions. I read the original book and I have seen all of the movies and as I said, I saw the excellent musical on stage more than once. I also won't go into the bewildering decision to never make a version with Michael Crawford singing the part. That is nothing short of a tragedy for anyone who never saw him do it. They will never know the magic of who Erik the Phantom truly is.That being said I thought that Mr. Butler was pretty good. I thought his voice was good and he had enough presence. I enjoyed the movie treatment of the story for the most part too and I thought Christine and Raoul in this movie were the best I had ever seen. What earned the low score from me was a couple of things that just sucked the whole thing dry of the things that made the original story work and had me shaking my head during the very beautiful song ""Music of the Night"" that just robbed it of all passion and had me wondering what were they thinking? ******************************spoilers after this.Basically in this version Erik is a major HUNK. He is absolutely GORGEOUS and whatever deformity lurking under the mask at that point would have to be postage stamp sized. So why should we feel any sympathy for him? In all versions I have seen you could see that he was a mess under that mask. He had obvious reasons for being who he was. The decision to make him sleek and perfect in this number is worse than casting Timothy Dalton as Mr.Rochester in Jane Eyre. (The part where she tells what is supposed to be a homely character he is not handsome always makes me laugh.) In this version of The Phantom, you end up staring at the small amount of Butler's face covered by the mask wondering just how bad could it BE? Indeed when we finally see it at the end it looks like a bad burn and no more. Hardly motivation for all the death, destruction and histrionics!Another bad blunder for me was the sword fight in the graveyard. I rather enjoyed the sword fight but having Raoul win it and grant mercy to the Phantom really fell flat. The whole story is about a deformed genius who can practically walk through walls and do miracles. He could have been a great and incredible man except for this one bad break in a cruel world that judges from appearances. Seeing him bested by beautiful and dashing and otherwise untalented Raoul was stupid and I have no idea what made them decide to do this. If they were going to have a sword fight they should have had the brilliant Erik win and let Raoul go because of Christine's intervention not the other way around!So really, this was a well made movie with just a couple of things that made the whole thing devoid of passion and meaning for me. I do recommend the other version out there ""The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall"" It suffers from not having Michael Crawford sing the part (And I never stopped missing him!) but it is a beautiful production. I also recommend the Susan Kay book ""Phantom"" as a very good retelling of the story that goes into Erik's early life and how he became what he became.",The Phantom of the Opera

My wife and I are going back this week to see it again and give Mr Loyd Webber more of our money. For us it worked, what can I say? I found the cast and the costumes beautiful,the acting inspiring,songs well-sung,cant wait to go back and am telling all my friends here in Rome to go see it.

I find that this musical is too campy for me ... there is too much pink ... it's really not for us guys to watch. I mean, I watched it because i love going to the cinema but I really recommend to the male movie lovers to rent it on DVD ... or something. It is filled with opera (VERY CAMPY), and it's not really entertaining. I did not even like the music! The only thing I liked was the end in which the theater goes on fire ... I liked that scene ... really! Everybody knows the story of the 'phantom' that 'haunts' the theater in old Paris and who falls in love with the star of the theater ... there's nothing new to watch and you don't really get to 'love' the characters. The stuff that the phantom does to the actors to frighten them is not that bad but not too evil either, and the way they are portrayed in the movie seemed abit clichéd and expected! even though i liked the scene in which a dead body hanged in the middle of the everybody during a performance. I think it is amazing to watch in a real theater but boring to watch on the big screen! It seemed to me that the movie was not made to show talents but simply to make money ... there was no 'soul' in it! The acting did not impress me much but they've got GREAT voices! I recommend this movie to the opera lovers ... the rest rent it!",The Phantom of the Opera
486,BernMaya,A movie of rising stars - wonderful and mesmerizing!,10,17 January 2005,"I am a big musical fan and phantom of the opera is my second favorite Broadway musical after Les Miserables. I had seen the Phantom of The Opera several times on stage and hesitated to see the movie until I realized that Andrew Lloyd Webber was heavily involved in it (Some of you may remember the horrible movie adaptation of Les Miserables starring Liam Neesam and Uma Thurman!!).The movie was mesmerizing, the music and singing sublime. I actually thought Gerard Butler was the best Phantom I had ever seen (and yes, I did see Michael Crawford on stage, so don't shoot me). He played the phantom with such an intensity, it took my breath away and drove me to tears. While you never get to see much of his face, he dominates the screen with his charisma. The chemistry between him and Chritine (Emmy Rossum) vibrates through the screen. Emmy Rossum was fabulous, just fabulous, as Christine. She managed to convey innocence, beauty, courage and fear so exquisitely. And boy what a voice! I was dumb founded when I realized she was only 16 while making the movie. She's definitely established herself as Hollywood's most promising new star. Patrick Wilson made Raoul more memorable, more solid and more alive than I can ever recall him to be. The theatrical performance has always left Raoul more on the sidelines. In the movie, he has a larger role and he portrays Christine's lover and protector with fervor. It does not hurt that he is also a very handsome man. Thumbs up to Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson. I'm glad to see directors beginning to tap into Minnie Driver's comic ability after her guest role on Will and Grace. And while she did not sing in the movie, she also has a beautiful voice that can be heard in the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" at the end of the credits. While I loved everything about this movie which I have seen 3 times so far, I think it was inexcusable that the lip synching was so badly coordinated, especially since all the songs were performed by the proper characters (except for La Carlotta). I would have expected more perfectionism out of Joel Schumacher and Webber. Apart from that, it is an A+++ all the way.Please go see this movie. If you liked the stage performance, you'll love the movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have never seen it in theater so i don't know how it is in its real version, but i really loved this cinema version (as i love all movie versions of Andrew LLoyd Webber works). So i go directly to the point: in Italy this movie has been totally translated, and people that have seen in a cinema had to hear the songs in Italian! I watched it on DVD in its original language and of course i have appreciated it, but - since the translation was poor and changed the meaning of most songs ( i still tremble thinking at Italian version of ""Music of the night"")- people in cinema didn't do the same and the movie lasted only a week. Italian distributors didn't make a good service to this masterpiece, but i fear that they cannot understand it.",The Phantom of the Opera
488,jhobson1,"A great opera could be made from the novel, but this isn't it",3,8 June 2005,"The film looks gorgeous. The costumes, the sets, the colors are all magnificent. The acting isn't bad, Simon Callow and Minnie Driver are both great in supporting roles, and everyone can sing.However: Andrew Lloyd Weber has a reputation for giving his works a few catchy melodies and reusing these. Over and over. And then repeating them. This reputation is, unfortunately, fully lived up to here. I kept thinking of Lloyd Weber's Requiem, with its magnificent ""Pie Jesu"" and its revolting ""Dies Irae"" -- the second of which is used far too often.Moreover, there are two glaring anachronisms in the film. First, dancers in 1871 did not ""vogue"", as is shown in the Masquerade sequence. Second, the Phantom's opera Don Juan would have been hounded off the stage in 1871. Lloyd Webber should have tried to imitate 19th century operatic style when writing the music for it -- after all, some have accused him of plagiarizing Puccini in Evita. Too bad he didn't do that here.Oh, and in 1870 and 1871, there were these minor affairs known as the Siege of Paris and the Paris Commune. Not mentioning them is akin to setting a play in Washington, DC in 1864/1865 and not mentioning the Civil War.",The Phantom of the Opera

He is, unequivocally, a genius. In my opinionThe Acting: Gerard Butler is...""In a word, ideal."" He is amazing as The Phantom! His voice astounds me, in that it is beautiful and powerful. He makes a very moving Phantom. I passionately love him. Emmy Rossum is perfect for the role of Christine. Her age, voice, and loveliness all add to her acting skills to make Christine complete. I have nothing but respect and admiration for her. Patrick Wilson does a very nice Raoul. His look and voice are great for the role, and I respect him despite the fact that I adore Gerry.I am obsessed with this movie. I will not even go into how obsessed I am.

I have seen the musical and loved it on the stage, so I was eager to see how this would compare. I have had the soundtrack for years and love it. I have considered The Phantom of the Opera one of my favorite musicals, and this movie reaffirms that statement. From the opening scene to the credits, this movie keeps your attention. The singing is very good! Minnie Driver is excellent as Carlotta! Emmy Rossum is a very persuasive Christine. And the guys are easy on the eyes. Patrick Wilson is a wonderful Raoul and makes you fall in love with him yourself. The critics might say that it is not good, but you should see it for yourself before making any judgments.

491,mike-1828,Almost as good as the show!,10,31 October 2005,"I was lucky enough to see the original cast production at Her Majesty's Theatre a couple of months after it opened in 1986, and I remember it as the most spectacular and exciting theatre production I've ever seen. The film captures the glorious spirit of the original, and I've been saddened to read a few negative reviews of the film on other sites, notably the BBC site. Where does the BBC get these people? The voices are a little weak in places, so even that aspect matched the theatre production! We're talking musical theatre here people, not the Royal Opera House!The one thing I regret is that the film version of the Masquerade sequence musically doesn't match the original. This had a magical arrangement starting using drums and mediaeval instruments, building to the full climax, but it's set up more conventionally on the film. Spectacular sets, fluid camera work, a joy from start to finish. Forget the critics: you know they are usually jaded and bored people.

492,freddievalentine,So good I've seen it twice!!,9,19 December 2004,"Having not seen the musical before, and only being familiar with some of the well know songs I had no preconceptions, but was eager to see the film being a lover of all things musical. From the black and white opening scene I knew it was going to be visually splendid and from the atmosphere created knew I was in for something dramatic. Then the theatre turned to colour and all was sent spinning back in time and the busy backstage frolics of the cast at the Opera House were bought to life. It was not apparent who the leading lady would be for a while until the chorus girl Christine was encouraged forward to sing replacing the Diva and was transformed from rags to a Cinderella style dress and sang with a pure beautiful voice and made me feel all magical and warm inside especially when she hit that note at the end!! Anyway the film went on and she was re united with her childhood sweetheart who was very charming and although most say wet, I think was very caring and charming (any girl wants prince charming on a white horse) despite what they say :-) There were lots of dream like scenes to follow and the film heightened emotionally all the way to the end, I've heard the song ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" but never knew its context, but the song and scene merged beautifully together for a very sentimental moment in the film enhanced by the angel statues covered in misty snow and a very Tim Burton moment. The phantom was a mixture of anger/sadness/genius and you could understand why Christine was very weak willed in his presence. I loved it, saw it twice bought the soundtrack and rate it 9 out of 10. Karen (Freddies girlfriend) and he liked it too!",The Phantom of the Opera
493,jmm61850,Better Than Expected!,9,11 March 2005,"I just saw Phantom the movie and was thinking I wasn't going to like it because it got trashed by critics. I don't see lots of new movies so you'll have to take that into consideration when you read my review. I also have never seen the Phantom musical on stage. I had, however, heard some of the music before seeing the movie and I enjoyed most of the pieces I had heard, especially ""All I Ask"". I'm also not a fan of either opera or musical productions because I prefer realism in drama, not pantomime or melodramatic acting. That said, this movie is unlike all other movies I have seen. Compared to other traditional movie musicals, it is truly a musical because it's almost entirely sung. The typical movie musical incorporates lots of naturalistic acting with song and dance numbers that often spontaneously appear for no obvious reason. The addition of song and dance numbers that spring from naturally acted story lines is very awkward and breaks the continuity and realism of the underlying drama.Phantom, however, does away with this problem by sticking to one state of being, namely the ""unreal"". The creators are presenting an obvious fantasy by telling the story using nearly all song and music. The few spoken words are only added where it is necessary for plot clarity. The phantom's character was developed in a way that instilled both pity and sympathy in the audience while simultaneously stimulating a sense of repulsion. These opposing emotions were strongly felt by Christine as well as the audience. Dominating the second half of the movie, this emotional anxiety was heightened by the powerful music, the staging and near perfect dramatic timing.The acting was good and the actors were well suited for their parts. The phantom looked a bit like Dylan McDermot from ""The Practice"". He was indeed attractive. His singing voice was a bit coarse and not typical of grand opera; however, I can understand perfectly why Webber chose him. Webber wanted us to feel repulsion towards his phantom. But he also wanted us to be attracted to him. Hence, he chose a good-looking phantom. At the same time, the phantom needed a voice that sounded coarse and unrefined as a reflection of the rough and dejected life the phantom must have lived. One can only imagine his lonesome life in the underworld was not quite as beautiful as the sets may have suggested. Therefore, a gorgeous, well trained singing voice would not have been appropriate and believable, absent a subterranean singing coach. The ending was well done and unexpected. It caught me off guard and at the point where compassion overcomes Christine and she kisses the unmasked phantom, I nearly bawled. The movie is clearly fantasy, but by this point, it had become touchingly human as well. The phantom was a man who had been facially scared from birth; raised in a sideshow circus cage where everyone laughed at him and then he was finally doomed to solitude in the dark, deep dungeons of an opera house where he cultivated his fantasy romance for the real but inaccessible Christine. Only a stone would not usher forth empathy for this man, in spite of his near madness. And Christine proved she was no cowardly stone as she drove out the phantom's agonizing madness with her one kiss. It was truly the kiss that set him free. With her one kiss, it was like she was saying she COULD love him despite the disfigurement that had tormented him all his life. When the phantom realizes that someone can love him unconditionally, his heart melts; his anger dissipates. He's transformed. As stated before, this movie is in a genre of its own, so it's both unwise and unfair to compare it to other movies. I just sat back and let my emotions do the judging. When the ride was over, I knew the journey had been worth it. I knew the creators had a goal and a purpose which they effectively achieved.Most classic movie musicals have bored me. Many of their well known songs are trite and dated. Remember ""Chim-chim-cheree"", anyone? It won best movie song in the mid 60s. How that silly song could win and not one of the songs from Phantom win is a total mystery. I get the feeling that some of the professional movie critics just don't like Webber's style of music, which made it easy to trash the movie. I loved his score and unlike so many famous and classic musicals where you have silly and corny songs mixed with a few catchy tunes, Webber's score is thoroughly listenable. It both sustains and advances the dramatic thread of the movie. The emotional thrust of this movie is not about romantic love or Gothic horror; it's about compassion and understanding for those who are social outcasts. It's about squelching hate and anger with love. The movie critics totally missed this because they were trying to force the movie into a different mold.",The Phantom of the Opera
494,frozenbiscuits-1,"romanticism and more, the stage play is now a motion picture",10,23 December 2004,"I adored the stage-play of Phantom, so I admittedly was going to be hard to please. I fell into that chasm of romanticism all over again. From the first notes of Andrew Lloyd Webbers' score as the chandelier is drawn again to the ceiling and we are swept back in time and into the story. I had hope that this production would be even an echo of the play. Bravo! It has the same spirit. At first I was worried that the phantom( so critical to the musical) was not going to take us where we need to go for this to work as a movie. However, by the 3rd act ,he had me. maybe even in the 2nd act. It is so important to feel a certain ambiguity toward the phantom, or you'll never feel the pure romanticism Phantom Of The Opera is as a musical legend.If you have not heard the score, or seen the play , Even if you have - and have not heard it in a long while, Webbers' score is haunting, and ultimately is what carries you. You'll remember. the film succeeds in that it is true to the original stage musical. There is only one Micheal Crawford.. true But , this phantom comes as close as possible without being a blatant imitation. Are you a romantic or are you not? If you are you'll love this film for it's richness and music if nothing else.",The Phantom of the Opera
495,citizen813,When Gargoyles Cry,7,22 December 2004,"Would that Sir Andrew had taken a cue from one of the more successful scenes toward the beginning of his musical version of ""Sunset Boulevard."" Joe Gittes, having stumbled upon Norma Desmond's decaying domain, finds himself suddenly recruited to edit or rather endorse her epic retelling of Solome to be presented to C.B. DeMille for her impending return to the screen. Try as he may, Joe cannot convince Norma to change or edit one word, let alone an entire scene; so her tome remains at record length. It's this same sense of hubris that prevents this new film version of Webber's spectacularly successful stage musical from achieving lasting excellence.It's not to say that what A.L.W. has wrought isn't worth preserving. The Puccini of the modern musical theater has created a popular work of entertainment that has earned its place in the record books. Shamelessly melodramatic and romantic moments are wielded with Jeti like precision and to often triumphant effect. How can you not be moved by Christine's final acknowledgment of the Phantom's obsession or the tremendous opening when the story hurls you into the past with such vivid theatricality. Those and other moments actually survive well under director Joel Schumacher's steady hand. It's the in between stuff, the recitative as they say, that drags the proceedings down, as if each secondary character's word is scripture when a film edit would've been more effective. Finally, two of the show's biggest numbers, ""Music of the Night"", and ""Masquerade"" pale in memory to Hal Prince's extraordinary original staging, falling and looking rather flat. That's the point. One wonders if Schumacher had free rein; or what a Baz Luhrmann or Robert Marshall might have realized.Still the casting is sound with Gerard Butler a properly smoldering and shadowy figure; and if he finally doesn't bring the requisite towering tragedy that Michael Crawford created on stage, still he makes you care. Emmy Rossum is quite the find, both delicate and fierce when needed. She is the epitome of the modern operatic ingenue and is matched every step of the way by Patrick Wilson's Raul. Miranda Richardson is a lovely addition, bringing more depth to a rather functional character that helps to move the story along. Minnie Driver forges vigorously ahead with unabashed comic commitment in the part of Carlotta.Webber has provided a new song to accompany the end credits and it is truly superfluous. You have to wonder that its only purpose is to possibly provide a musical Oscar moment for a rich score that otherwise could not be considered.",The Phantom of the Opera
496,junyi2002,Brava!,7,22 December 2004,"I watched this movie twice and i have to write the comment again (i deleted the previous one)...The music was absolutely powerful and it's just stunning as the great chandelier rises to the ceiling. Being a fan of ALW i had to admit that this was of the same standard to many of his great productions i.e. Cats, Evita...The vocal was nicely done, some of the lyrics like 'music of the night' uses superb phrases, while others (wishing u were here with me), the simplicity amazed me. Anyway, music was used too excessive here (they even use dialogues in the lyrics), and i find some songs quite lengthy.Christine and Raoul did a splendid job, both their singing and acting was remarkable (Christine was a little expressionless though), as for the phantom, his voice was...a little croaky, like a piece of fragile paper being crushed, but surely an obvious hard work had been done. He started a phantom strong and intelligent, leading the mystified Christine down to his darkness, but finally he gives up and surrender Christine to Raoul, begging them to leave, weeping. The stare of the phantom at the music box was...so melancholic but full of hope, yet his eyes shines a childish light, innocent. The disfigurement was not as bad as i thought, but overall.....just fine.The diva was great! So was the two managers. The ending of the opera house was sad though...7/10...hoping another ALW's musical will be up soon!",The Phantom of the Opera

What do you people expect?,9,28 December 2004,"For those of you without a clue, Phantom of the Opera is a movie musical, not a translation of the Koran or the Bible. It is thoroughly enjoyable. The singing, editing and cinematography is two orders of magnitude better than in Chicago, which was an Oscar nominee and winner. The cinematography, art direction, and costuming was excellent. This is an opera, so like it or not, the acting and storyline are Operatic, and equal to anything of it's genre. This was an excellent film and worth paying full price to see twice and buy the DVD when it comes. I actually thought it was better than the musical, which I saw on Broadway, mainly because the story played out better and was more understandable and less ""mysterious"". Of course Michael Crawford put on a better performance but with his training and experience he should.

498,drbone007,Phantom Remains True To Stage Version,9,23 December 2004,"I, like many of you, have had some concerns about the movie adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. I remember sitting in the theatre, hearing the familiar music roll across my ears from the teaser and wanting to die when I saw Joel Schumacher's name appear on screen. (I was a big fan of Batman...not his Batman) But after seeing what he has done with Phantom, I have renewed faith in this director.Schumacher and Webber have created a wonderful version of Phantom. Everything was there in one form or another and the additions of the swordfight and other scenes really add drama to the film. The music is kept well intact and Ciarán Hinds and Simon Callow are wonderful as the groveling managers and Minnie Driver plays a very amusing over-the-top Carlotta. Rossum and Butler prove they have the power to convey these difficult leads without making them laughably overacted. I'd also like to put special props to Butler for taking on such a difficult role. With such pressure from the so called ""phans"" for Michael Crawford, Butler was very difficult to accept. I truly enjoyed his voice and thought it conveyed more pain and suffering than the overpowerful Crawford. As a die hard devotee of Crawford and Brightman, I can safely say that I enjoyed the singing just as much in the movie version as the show. Also major props to the cinematography and beauty of this movie go straight to the director.The only uncomfortable parts of this movie are Patrick Wilson's Raoul and the Masquerade Ball. Wilson is a very breathy Raoul and I just didn't believe his appeal over Butler's Phantom. Raoul came off very flat and although I realize he is supposed to be wormy and the lover-not-a-fighter type Wilson played him very soft. He's supposed to be Christine's rock and he just wasn't. The Masquerade ball didn't transfer very well to the screen. With a movie that contains only choreographed dances in the ballet scenes, the masquerade dance doesn't really fit. Although needed to convey the happiness since the Phantom has left, it comes off as very disjointed and disappointing.Overall a wonderful film filled with beautiful sets, costumes and cinematography. It is beautiful eye candy and wonderful to listen to as well.",The Phantom of the Opera

It was romantic and you could identify with the characters. Gerard Butler has such screen presence and you really feel for his character(The Phantom). Emmy Rossum's Christine appears to be torn between Raoul and the Phantom. She knows she will be safe with Raoul, yet she what she feels for the Phantom is a very powerful and deep connection. There have been very mixed views on the movie. Some say that it follows the stage production too much. What do they expect? The Phantom of the Opera is based on a book, which was turned into a musical by the genius that is Andrew Llyod Webber, who in turn worked on the movie with Joel Schumacher. I applaud them, and congratulate then for creating a musical and visual masterpiece. Movie (and musical) fans the world over, go see this movie. It is NOT to be missed.",The Phantom of the Opera

In this film, I feel it fell right into place. Andrew Lloyd Weber's score remains in both the stage version and the film version- the heart of the story. Everything else simply had to fit with that. And the visuals (lighting, costumes, sets, everything) certainly fit. The vocals weren't exactly breathtaking by most of the cast, but not bad either. What stood out to me was the overall performance of Gerard Butler as the Phantom. A character I already sympathized with, he pushed even further and made me simply fall in love with. The scenes between Christine and Raoul were also sturdy and believable, and they allowed me to relive a story I already knew well, even forming new opinions about. It was worth my money, and I'd see it again, but I've been dying to get back and see it live once more. That's just me, though.",The Phantom of the Opera

So was the stage production and a film version does not improve on the fact that Webber has absolutely no talent as a musician. His other indulgences into ""musicals"" are for the masses that want to pretend that they are musically literate but in fact have no taste or understand what is quality at all.Perfect for the ""designer generation"" that need to be told what is ""in"" or ""out"", what to eat and what is the star flavorer of the month. No matter what they spend, these folks have no pedigree and will never be part of the ""aristocratic"" set they aspire to.

I have seen the stage version in NY City and did not expect the motion picture to be an exact duplicate and thank goodness the movie put a refreshing light to the story. It is a tragic love story so to have the Phantom be young and half good looking (as the other half of his face didn't look too good without the mask)was a teasing. Gerard Butler's strong voice put his emotions into his music showing anger, passion, intimidation and jealousy...plus on the screen, you could see these feelings in his eyes without the use of binoculars. I for one hope this role launches his career upward. I am thoroughly enjoying the sound track of the Phantom as this comment is being written and plan on purchasing the DVD when it becomes available. I don't understand why a lot of movie critics have put-down this spectacular undertaking. Maybe they just enjoy giving good ratings to some of the junk out in theaters today. It is great to see a love story, sad as it was, that had no nudity or profanity. A first class picture. Hope some of those film critics find new jobs.",The Phantom of the Opera
503,Vampirella666,Beautifully under-rated film,10,18 April 2005,"This film was AMAZING. One of the best films I've seen in a loooong time! Of course Gerard was great, and Emmy, hey, I'm still trying to get over the fact that she was just 16!!! I think the critics went a bit overboard, maybe? I think musicals are making a comeback, first Chicago now this, next we'll be seeing Mumma-Mia on the big screen.I think it's great that people are getting more exposed to the finer arts and that movies aren't just about the acting and drama of it, there always an extra bit to add to it. You can watch a flashy action movie for the same price as an amazingly emotional dramatic musical. I would choose the latter. I watched this movie three times in theater because it's the type of movie that needs a good sound system and well I need a good sound system too. I've found that this is a greatly powerful movie, there is just such a depth to it.One of my friends made a vague comment on how Gerard was such a horrid actor but a great singer, I gave them a look saying ""Gerard has always been an actor, but then he took like 6 months of practice for the singing part."" It was kinda funny :P.All in all, I think everyone should see this movie. It's a kids movie and a grandparent movie, it's even a teen movie.

504,parkerange,A must-see musical,10,17 March 2005,"wow! The Phantom of the Opera is now my new favorite movie. I have gone to see it 5 times and can't wait to see it again! I had seen the stage version twice before, and had high hopes for the movie, and was not disappointed - in fact, it was better than I though it would be! Gerard Butler did an incredible job as the Phantom - he was so hypnotizing, and I found that his hypnotic voice had not only an effect on Christine, but was having an effect on me! His non-opera style voice (like Michael Crawford as Phantom), really helped, and was much better, I think. I also found it very difficult to think of him as the bad guy in the movie. I felt so sorry for him - I just forgot about all of the bad things he had done and wanted to reach into the movie screen and give him a big hug and a kiss. Emmy Rossum was the most perfect person I could have thought for this role. She has a truly angelic voice, and her being so young was definitely more true to the original story. She definitely looked the part of Christine Daee, and fulfilled the role incredibly well. All of the other people in the movie did a wonderful job - Minnie Driver did awesomely as Carlotta, and even though she didn't actually sing her own part, it was impossible to tell. Patrick Wilson was very good as Raoul - definitely an improvement from the stage production. I always hated Raoul on the stage, mainly because he was such a wimp, but in the movie, he plays a more active, more heroic role. All of the other cast members did a very good job as well. This was an incredible movie, and I give it a 10 out of 10 (because that is the maximum grade I can give it)!",The Phantom of the Opera
505,ILuvDancing91,Amazing Film!!!,9,5 May 2005,"I really really enjoyed this movie. The set, for one thing was incredible. The phantom's lair was especially well constructed. The costumes were absolutely breathtaking. Christine always looked so beautiful.Christine's voice was perfect for the role and Raul's voice was quite nice as well. The phantom, however, had a slight lisp,and once you notice it, it diminishes his menace considerably. But he made up for that with his excellent acting. In fact,everyone in this production had very nice chemistry together, which made the tear-jerking moments of the movie that much more touching. I found myself quite close to bawling by the end of the film.I very much recommend that you see this movie. I, myself, bought it yesterday afternoon.",The Phantom of the Opera
506,chococat-1,Wonderful adaptation,10,1 June 2005,"I'm a true theatre fan and a several-time veteran of this show, so I was EXTREMELY skeptical when I went to see this film. I was worried I wouldn't like the acting or the singing or the adaptation. I am WONDERFULLY surprised that all singers (minus Minnie) sang themselves and the acting was absolutely breathtaking. Emmy did a fantastic job making me take all those mesmerizing sighs of passion. Gerry, too - beautiful. I was only slightly disappointed in the dubbing of the singing to the actual scenes. I imagine they actually sang while they shot the film, but editing was a tough job. I realize that so I'm not going to take any points off. The singing still beautiful and the adaptation gave me everything I wanted and more. I was spellbound and captured and devastated all at the same time. It lives up to the theatre show in almost all ways (theatre people will know what I mean).",The Phantom of the Opera

From the singing to the acting, from the songs to the sets. Every part of the show oozes and emits music, colors, and beauty.Emmy Rossum plays Christine Daae, a protégé who works in the Paris Opera House. Emmy is talented and a perfect Christine. Hell she is only 18! I think we shall be seeing her a lot in the future.Gerard Butler was perfect as the Phantom (or Erik, to those who have read the book). He is as mysterious, scary, soulful, and passionate as the Phantom himself. He clearly shows how different the Phantom is from normal people. Gerard has a wonderful voice and I hope we can hear more singing from him in the future.Patrick Wilson plays Raoul, a young man who is old friends with Christine Daae. Patrick Wilson knows how to sing powerfully and yet not overdo it. Good casting choice.This movie is beautiful and the songs are heavenly. I'll give it a 10/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
509,theonetowatch,I see the light!,5,19 December 2005,"Let me just say, the first time I saw this movie I loved it. However, now that I have been further educated on other versions of Phantom, let me just tell you that this is by far a very poor one in most aspects. On a positive starting ""Note"", I think the scenery was amazing. The sets, as most everyone agrees, were wonderful and had the perfect mood.I do think it's a little funny that Madame Giry was the ONLY ONE with a French accent, but I think it gave her some mystique, which was necessary for the character. Also, it is true that the Phantom looked like he had a bad sunburn, but I think we all understood the idea. You can't look completely deformed in a major motion picture. I will also not argue that Christine had any acting ability, because she didn't.Gerard Butler was interesting as the Phantom. He conveyed a lot of feeling through his voice, which has got to be hard. But, he is not an opera singer and should not consider himself one. That was an experiment gone wrong and we as the general public should not have been exposed to it. I mean, if the guy can't sing, don't cast him as the ""Angel of Music"". Seriously. His acting was great but they could have dubbed his voice at least.Now for Emmy Rossum...As I said earlier, her acting was pretty vacant. I think her face had about four different expressions in the whole movie. Her voice would be okay if she wasn't supposed to be an opera singer. I mean come on! Her voice was thin and at some points, scratchy. She was hardly supporting it at all. Now I'm not asking for a Sarah Brightman, because I wasn't a fan of her either, but maybe if someone could just find a happy medium between warbling and pop star! Next time get someone who actually has experience and technique. She didn't enunciate at all and during most songs I had no idea what she was saying. I seriously had to listen to some of them 45 times just to figure out one word!As for Patrick Wilson, he saved the soundtrack for me. In the movie, he looked really bad with that hair, but his voice was perfect. Acting was fine, he just needed a haircut.Miranda Richardson was amazing as Madame Giry. The accent was perfect and, as I said above, gave her a wonderful mystique.Jennifer Ellison, and allow me to be blunt, is a terribly weak singer. I don't know if that was her normal voice or if she was trying to ""tone it down"" so she wouldn't upstage Christine, but she sounded like she was about seven years old. Her voice was very thin and child-like. I know Christine was supposed to be the best, but Meg's voice could have been a bit stronger than it was. That is really all I have to say about the actors. Overall, it had a lot of flaws but some parts were good. However, if you are looking for a soundtrack, try the original Canadian one with Rebecca Caine and Colm Wilkinson- the Christine is great and the Phantom is, for the most part, passable, though his voice gets upstaged by Raoul's at points. Anyway I think this movie was a fairly passable pop-rock version of the show, so just don't think of it as the same show. As for people who don't like singing in movies, I'd advise you not to pick a musical next time.",The Phantom of the Opera
510,My_Evil_Hand,the play is better,5,11 April 2006,"I rate it this highly mainly because the music is so good. But the movie made changes to the original story (which was very good) and those changes utterly devastate the story. Several scenes were added, mainly to enhance the role of Raoul, which were either neutral or actually harmful to the story. In particular the graveyard scene, in which Raoul defeats the Phantom, yet leaves him behind, rather than either kill him or capture him. This makes Raoul and Christine morally culpable for the Phantom's later actions, including murder. The singing was very disappointing, very sloppy and loose. However, Gerard Butler's vocal changes were quite well done, deep and threatening as the Phantom, higher-pitched as the Angel of Music. But it wasn't enough.",The Phantom of the Opera
511,FeLiPe-7,Umm...what???,3,1 January 2006,"In response to you young woman's rave review about this movie, allow me to dispel some Phatom freaks' cloudy minds about this movie. In short, it reeked. I'm not the type of Kat to try and put a production down, but being that I was at one time, a huge fan of all things Phantom, I can truly say that this was really a mess. I'm sorry, but if you're going to cast a movie adaptation of a musical adaptation of a book, the FIRST thing you must do is choose actors who are MUSUCIANS! Why am I going to sit through a three-hour movie listening to half-singing-no-pitch-can't-hold-a-note wannabes drag themselves through a full-blown musical production? Especially since I know I can do twice as good as half the cast (male and female), without really trying? Seriously, that's an issue. The least you could've done is pulled an old-school and dubbed their voices. Secondly, good (or mediocre) cinematography does not make up a good movie. There has to be line, direction, and focus. Pretty costumes are only just that, pretty costumes. I almost appreciated how they tried to give more light to the common man/woman's role in the opera house, but even that was a half-hearted attempt. Lastly, DO NOT...I repeat...DO NOT speak lines from a musical that are supposed to be sung - it just sounds stupid - if you can't sing them, CUT them.Sorry for all those who liked this movie, but I guess it just goes to show that some (most) Andrew Loyd Weber musicals are probably best left to the stage...or not...let's not forget that he does hand over a sizable portion of the proceeds from 'Phatom' to the Giaccomo Puccini Estate for blatantly using part of one of his opera scores. Next time, let's try some real musicals, huh? UGH.",The Phantom of the Opera
512,ChasSaur,Not for those who ever SAW Michael Crawford on stage,5,14 June 2005,"I was lucky enough to see Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the original Broadway run, so my view of Phantom is always filtered through that experience.That being said - lovely sets, I liked Emmy Rossum (because honestly, Sarah Brightman didn't sound that great live in the high registers - if I hadn't already heard the CD's, I would have had a hard time understanding her in the show), I liked Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and I'm not sure what they were thinking with Gerard Butler. I've liked the man in other things, and while I understand he fronted a rock group, he didn't really have the chops for the Phantom. It's a role that requires something kind of otherworldly about the voice singing it - his voice just left me cold.I agree with many - the makeup and mask discrepancy was just too large to ignore. It was terribly distracting. And the lack of a Death's head costume was a disappointment - actually, many of the stage ""gotchas"" where the PTO comes popping out of the scenery or background is one of the things that make it fun - eliminating those took some edge out of the storytelling.In the book and stage show, Raoul is something of a fop, NOT exactly a hands-on kinda guy. By inserting the ridiculous sword fight (instead of the pyrotechnics used in the show), and the whole Indiana-Jones-like scene with him in the water, I'm guessing they were trying to make him more manly and heroic. Bad move, I thought. A good performance of this show on the stage (and even reading the book) leaves you with the nagging suspicion that Christine should have stayed under the Opera - tortured murderer that he was, the character of the Phantom is more sympathetic than Raoul.The one thing that truly annoyed me, however, was what I've chosen to call ""the interpretive dance sequence"" that accompanies ""Past the Point of No Return"" In the stage show this is a very intense moment, and as the two primary actors were filmed it seemed intense - but going back and forth to the dancers in the background just killed the scene for me.And I realize that since this was a movie instead of a stage show, the chandelier crash had to be moved to the climax of the movie, but it felt wrong to me. The Phantom's anger just seems to disappear for three months and you're not given a reason for it (or why there was a gap of three months between the two scenes).As for the acting - well, this is the staging of a musical - some of it is going to be over the top. I don't think Emmy Rossum did a bad job (she sang at the Met in NY - she probably knows her stagecraft) - much like Natalie Portman in the Star Wars movies, the director makes some interesting choices in how he wants a character portrayed. I think she did the best she could with the direction she was given.So basically, if you've never seen the stage show, this is a great introduction. If you've seen traveling shows, this is probably equal to anything you've seen. If you saw the original run on Broadway or the West End, don't even bother.",The Phantom of the Opera

The film adaptation of musicals (which has been done before with this very same film) are rarely as 'good' as the musical.Go enjoy the movie though. If you can stop thinking about the critics long term hate for Weber and musicals, and the fact that this is a screen adaptation, then you're in for a treat. Pretend the movie is called something else :) Is it perfect, no. In some ways the soundtrack is more enjoyable away from the movie. Kind of hard to explain. I think the visuals may have distracted me from the music while watching.

Loved the frocks and didn't mind the stagy dancing. Didn't mind the dual narrative. Waited for the 'signature tune'--there isn't one. I sure didn't go out of the theatre humming anything. The voices were okay. I agree that I've heard better on ""Idol"" which is a sad indictment of casting. By the time she was dragging through the cemetery singing the endless version of the same song I fell asleep for a while. BEST scene--the erotic pull between them during the final play. Wow, I really felt their passion. Agree about the mask thing but you can't be too ugly on the big screen. Echoes of ""Elephant Man"" with the paper bag over his head? According to the cinema Victorians either spent their time organising dinner parties/marriages or gawking at freak shows. Having read the book and knowing its psychoanalytical references I enjoyed the *underground passages* and the diva's attraction to the Phanton.Can't recommend it at all.

But I guess if you have Andrew Lloyd Webber as your executive producer, you'd better make it good. And, believe me, it's GOOD! Andrew Lloyed Webber, Joel Shumacher, Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Minnie Driver and the rest of the cast and crew of this wonderful film have taken Gaston Leroux's classic story and turned it into one of the greatest feats in cinema history - a successful 21st century musical that puts Rob Marshall's ""Chicago"" to shame!

I've never read the book or seen the stage play, although I was familiar with a couple of the songs simply by their popularity. My complaint is not of the singing, it was fine by my amateur ears. It was Joel Schumacher's direction that was at times laughable, mostly dull, and always uninspired. The man has no clue how to stage a musical number, a romantic moment or a fight scene. The slow songs were played closeup to closeup with people standing around or slowly walking around. And the more chaotic scenes and songs were done with whirling the camera around fast and quick cuts so we couldn't tell how bad the staging really was. The art direction, costumes and general aesthetic were a bad case of someone thinking ""more is better"". The editing transitions were awkward, the sound mix terrible (anytime more than one person was singing at the same time, good luck trying to understand anyone), and Minnie Driver blew the movie's only attempts at comic relief.",The Phantom of the Opera

The beginning was fine, with the fade from black and white and frozen to colour and motion along with the main song starting being quite cool. Emmy Rossum was outstanding, in her looks, her acting and of course her superb singing. But when the phantom let loose I noticed myself cringing a few times and thought who the hell is this guy. Turns out he's not even a trained singer! Hilarious. How did Schumacher sneak him past Lloyd Webber? What a mockery. I would much rather see a camcorder tape of the original stageplay with the magnificent Michael Crawford. The visuals were very good, but the lighting was too bright in the gondola scene. Yeah I know the set cost a bunch but turnoff the lights and put the candles on as it should be OK? Schumacher seems to be duck or no dinner, I was sure left hungry here.",The Phantom of the Opera
518,wiseman1024-1,Boring and uninteresting,4,8 September 2007,"I enjoyed the visuals, especially the theatre interior with the double stairs and the carnival scene which was extremely well directed, but there are important things I didn't like. Firstly, it was boring as hell, because it was like watching a movie in a language I don't understand. I would only get a few words when they sing, which happens for about 98% of the movie. This made it slow and boring. Secondly, the story, or what I could understand, was pretty simple. There's this guy who's too scared to show himself in public and everybody makes a big deal of it, and this girl who's a bit of an... airhead, and goes with the last guy that turned her on. If I were the count, I'd have dumped her the very second I saw her looking at the phantom with such a lascivious look. So they do stuff, somewhat fight over the girl, learn the sad story of the phantom, and that's it. Very uninteresting.To make matters worse, what I liked best was the last bit, where the old count sees the phantom left a rose with the ring over Christine's grave, and that's not in the theatre version of the Phantom of the Opera, but new in the movie, so what I liked best of it is a little detail they added in the movie.The soundtrack was good though. It didn't feel repetitive, and the main theme, save for the overdone pipe organ introduction, is very good (the pipe organ part got on my nerves in the soundtrack; I love pipe organ music but this kind of thing doesn't appeal to me).",The Phantom of the Opera
519,writtnby,A faithful adaptation of the Phantom,10,2 January 2005,"My friend and I eagerly awaited the screen version of this musical. We both loved Michael Crawford in the role and saw it in Los Angeles with Dale Cristian, another favorite. Despite both wishing Crawford had been the movie phantom we could forgive once we saw the picture. The critics seem to take delight in bashing this version. Of course it's over the top, so was the play! It's a musical, folks, not reality and as such it had every right to pull out all the theatrical stops. It was big and lush and satisfying overall. I'd seen clips of Butler singing and wasn't impressed. So perhaps I went to the movie with lower expectations. I was surprised he did as good a job as he did. Still, it's quite clear the actor is trying to sing and just barely getting by on film. Bottom line, Gerard Butler is just okay and it's his acting that helps him out on film here. Still, it would have been nice to have had the emotional impact of a good singer, after all, it's a musical with very little dialog. That said, I move on to an improvement in the Raoul character. Raoul was always a 2nd banana to the Phantom for this viewer, at least, as well as somewhat wimpy in the play. This Raoul comes across as manly and dashing. And Patrick Wilson has a voice, which is truly important, especially in the ""All I Ask"" song. They've given Raoul more to do in the film which also helps. Emmy Rosum sings beautifully -- still I can't fathom why it was so hard to find a beautiful actress in her 20s who could also sing. Why was it okay to have Butler cast as the phantom when he was no singer? Somewhat of a double standard there. For this movie viewer it was important for the Phantom to transport me emotionally with his singing as well as his acting. That didn't quite happen. I can't say I like all the director's choices but we are stuck with what he's put on film. And overall it works for me. The sets and costumes are beautiful. And last but not least, Minnie Driver is excellent as the Diva Carlotta. Bottom line, if you loved the play you'll like this movie.

I cannot compare it to the stage show, as I have only seen the movie, but I am more than happy watching this movie.Gerard Butler, who plays The Phantom, does a great job. OK, he's not the best singer, but he is a good singer, and his voice sounds so natural, as it has a raw quality to it that Michael Crawford's voice does not have (I may not have seen the stage show, but I have purchased the CD of the stage show, so, while I may not know how well Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman played their roles, I do know how well they sing the songs - ""Music of the Night"" is my personal favourite.), which works to his advantage. Also, he manages to convey so much passion, especially after he has heard Christine and Raoul singing ""All I ask of you"", which shows how well he can act.On the subject of ""Who would you choose - Raoul or The Phantom?"" I would absolutely choose The Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera
523,mgresk,impressive cinema,9,4 January 2005,"there were sincere doubts that this highly theatrical production could be translated to the cinema. the immediacy, the intimacy of the theater truly adds to the P.O.O. experience. this movie is an excellent version of the lloyd-weber production. i have seen P.O.O. seventeen (17) times (London, chicago, new york and numerous times in the 'provinces'). i have always been impressed with the consistent excellence of all of these productions. whether in omaha, oshkosh, London or NYC it was always the same... fantastic! the movie makes excellent use of the flash-back technique to fill-in gaps in the plot. the unities that are required to make a film 'work' are employed with great success. the plot lines that were only hinted at in the stage play (madam giry/phantom relationship, fate of the phantom, raoul/christine life together) are explained. this is a good thing. the singing of butler & Wilson were marginal at best. rossum is wonderful as christine. excellent theater, impressive cinema",The Phantom of the Opera

I just felt it was a complete bore: the actors were missed cast, there was no passion in any of the scenes, no sense of mystery or danger - it was just a lazy adaptation to the screen. I wanted to feel the despair of the Phantom, be horrified by his unmasking, be entranced by his love and music; instead i got a film that lacked vision, spectacle, and originality. It was too safe and never dared to venture outside the realm of what worked on the stage. And because of this the film failed miserably.

Breath-taking & Heartwarming.",10,5 January 2008,"Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Tony Award winning Broadway musical finally comes to the silver screen 14 years after it was originally scheduled to enthrall moviegoers everywhere, with Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman, the original stars of the Boradway production, in the main roles. The script had already been written and the costumes designed. However, Srah Brightman & Andrew Lloyd Webber divorced during this period, forcing him & Joel Schumacher to shelve the project. All this and more in ""Behind The Mask: The Story Of The Phantom Of The Opera,"" only available on the 2-Disc Collector's Edition.I knew a little bit about the show when I first saw the previews for this movie. I got excited and decided to read the original novel before viewing this movie. I finished the book in five days, though it WAS SLIGHTLY TEDIOUS, making The Phantom more of a villain. I then saw the 1925 film starring Lon Chaney (aka ""The Man Of A Thousand Faces""); it was wonderful, considering that Chaney designed his own makeup.When I saw this movie in theaters, I was literally BLOWN AWAY, as I had been when I first saw ""William Shakespeare's Hamlet,"" starring Kenneth Branagh (please see my review on that film). When the Overture started, I thought, ""This is going to be GREAT."" I LOVED THE MOVIE, especially whenever Christine was on screen (no pun intended) and when she kisses The Phantom, as she reminds me so much of my best friend, who is literally an angel from heaven. I loved all the songs, especially the wickedly dark title song and the famous ""Music Of The Night,"" as The Phantom seduces Christine in his lair. I also loved it whenever Christine sang. All the actors were wonderful in this movie. NOT A SINGLE FLAW. ""Sing for me."" Should've been rated PG (the violent images DID NOT warrant a PG-13 rating).",The Phantom of the Opera
526,imdb-543,A 'not-so-phantom' menace,1,17 July 2005,"I have been waiting a good long time to trash this film. I refused to pay $10 to see it in the cinema; I had already been aggrieved to pay for tickets to see the stage play in L.A. years ago. I am a huge lover of musical theatre, but Sir Andrew has all but twice made me want to chew off my right leg to prevent myself from going mad. I have friends and acquaintances who love this musical, who beg me to see it again with new eyes, to open myself up to the beauty and spectacle of the piece, to let myself feel the love and passion of the principle characters, to embrace what a truly fantastic work PHANTOM is.Well, I have. I paid my $1, watched the DVD while I was in an already good mood, and was immediately enchanted by the opening sequence.Then it all went pear-shaped, filthy muck, turning my delicious popcorn into ashes as it passed my lips. My friends were and are WRONG!! This musical is all spectacle without being spectacular. I daresay, if you like this PHANTOM then you probably went orgasmic over PHANTOM MENACE. It is possible you may be genetically predisposed to loving things with the word 'phantom' in it. I have to admit, it is a pretty cool word. I'm thinking of naming my firstborn 'Phantom'. Well, I was before the two aforementioned debacles were executed. (Oh, and if only they had been.... It's bad enough Sir Andrew thought this stuff up and turned an over-rated literary treasure into an over-rated Broadway phenom, but to do it in public... so unhygienic.) I liked two of the songs/lyrics. I liked 4 of the tunes/orchestration. The clothes were swell, I guess. The opening sequence, as I mentioned, was done rather charmingly. The rest left me with a gorgeous appetite for disdain. With a side order of disdain. With a disdain shake made with real ice cream. Go rent Sondheim's PASSION or SWEENEY TODD, LA BOHEME, some Gilbert & Sullivan, or even GREASE 2 for crying out loud! Something where the music isn't all either bluster or reduced to staccato when neither of these serve as characterisation nor adds tension to a scene (an amplified trick Sir Andrew used back in his Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR days).PHANTOM, for me, has always suffered from unsympathetic characters. (This is a glaring fault, especially since Mary Harron was able to provide me with such in a film like American PSYCHO.) I've always wondered if this antipathy could be remedied by placing a bit of the Phantom's back story somewhere closer to the beginning of the film. Indeed, when the story of his origins is narrated by Miranda Richardson, I had my first and all-too-brief mote of feeling since this tale began - other than annoyance, that is. It's a good scene, but by this time the Phantom has already murdered people, so I doubt anyone with a moral compass is going to feel sympathy for him. What, just because he has a good singing voice and forms an attachment to a beautiful girl we're meant to forget that he's no different than Burke and Hare, Gacy or Cole, his brother murderers? Oh dear, but he's disfigured, so perhaps it's no more than should be expected of him. What claptrap.In one scene, the Phantom is all but overthrown, captured, but Christine pleads for mercy. Fine. Her new beau lets the blighter go free. But in the very next scene, the dullard mounts an even more elaborate plan to try to get the Phantom in the exact same position from which he had just released him a moment ago, this time using Christine as bait. This leads to great danger... that's not so great.I have much more venom to spew - this amount of hate could take weeks to harvest - but I feel like lifting my spirits with a bit of D-I-Y root-canal work. But as I exit, mumbling to myself and walking into walls - the effect all Sir Andrew's musicals have on me (save SONG AND DANCE and SUNSET BOULEVARD) - I must posit: How could Christine go off with what's-his-name over the much better-looking (scars, psychoses and all) Phantom? And while one can understand a certain lack of springiest in the choreography of a live performance, why the hell didn't Mr Schumacher use another cut or some fancy editing to make the larger ensemble scenes less unruly? Ah, who knows... maybe the prequels will be better.(from my review at DVDStation)",The Phantom of the Opera

The first time I watched it, I fell in love with it, and since then, I have bought the movie, and the soundtrack. The movie is about an opera house ""haunted"" by the happenings of the Phantom. A young girl, Christine, becomes the Phantom's new obsession, and though he taught her to sing, she doesn't really love him. In fact, she loves Raoul, the opera's new patron. Things get pretty bad when the Phantom figures this out, and he'll do anything to get back his prodigy. This movie is wonderfully made, and beautifully done.

528,goodkarma2,Simply the best musical I've ever seen!,10,1 January 2005,"This movie took my breath away!! The first tunes of the Phantom theme at the beginning of the movie sent shivers down my spine.Andrew Lloyd Webber must be such a genius! This movie tops all the new musicals of the last few years, like Chicago and Moulin Rouge. The cast was perfect too: Emmy Rossum is gorgeous as Christine, Gerard Butler is a good looking Phantom (at least with his mask on) and I really liked Raoul too.Since I don't intend to post any spoilers (not that the plot itself would be new anyway), I just want to comment on the directing. This movie has some excellent special effects that work so beautifully on screen, like when the camera suddenly seems to drop from the roof of the Opera House into the dark, after Christine leaves with Raoul. Or when the camera starts the next scene through an eye. Not to mention the beginning when the old Opera House changes back to its former beauty when we are introduced to the myth of the Phantom. After watching these scenes I can tell you the director truly created a piece of art, not just another movie.This one has to be part of my DVD collection as soon as they release it.",The Phantom of the Opera

Well I can't. Most actors are fantastic and especially the lovely angel of music that plays Christine. This angle of music is fabulous, her voice and charisma is perfectly fitted to this role. Her two male counterparts is also very worth listening to.The director of this film has made his production very captivating and from the film technical point of view it was very pleasing for the eye, very pleasing indeed.Just to set record straight, I wouldn't say that I m a fan of musicals but this was a most excellent experience.The only thing I now wish for is.... da capo!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
530,mattyboombattie74,"Wonderful Music, Exquisite Set Design, Mediocre Phantom...",7,23 May 2005,"This film was well-done for the most part, but its casting choices remove the passion and torment expressed by the title character. Gerard Butler is a wonderful actor, but he is not a singer. His portrayal of the deformed Phantom in love with the young Christine Daae does not capture the emotion that the audience sees when viewing the story on the stage. Too much was given away regarding the Phantom's past. In the stage version, the audience is left to decide for themselves; is he really a ghost with supernatural powers or is he merely a madman who hides from the world? The film leaves nothing to the imagination; he is a man. a He is a madman who has locked himself away behind his own private ""mask"", and scares the performers in the Paris Opera House with slight of hand, cheap tricks and outright sabotage. While the story of the film follows very closely to the play, the reworking the scene of the chandelier crashing and having it occur at the end of the film was a poor choice. When we see the Phantom do this on-stage, we understand that his battle is with Christine now just as much as it is with Raoul. Now, we just see him as angry and insane. We lose our ability to sympathize with him and in a way, secretly cheer him on. Also, the changing of the costume that the Phantom wears for the ""Masquerade"" sequence was a poor choice. It is obvious who it is behind the mask. He is not dressed as the Red Death, he simply wears a black mask and a red cloak. No intimidation is seen on the faces of the party goers, just a blank stare of bewilderment. Overall, the film was decent, yet lacked the raw passion that one experiences when seeing the performance on stage.",The Phantom of the Opera

""What if it's another poor attempt of Hollywood..?"" I felt some inner uncertainty, being ready for something different, but not ""The Phantom"" I adore. Though the name of Andrew Lloyd Webber gave certain guarantees. AND IT HAPPENED! For more than two hours I felt absorbed by music and vocal. Amasing, but even subconscious comparing with Sarah Brightman's singing couldn't break the pleasure from the heard. Casting is just wonderful! Like anything else in this movie.

533,Terraway,"A Well Made Film, but they cannot sing",7,23 December 2004,"Emmy Rossum's Golden Globe nomination was well-deserved if one ignores her strained and sometimes off-key voice. Though her acting was sublime, each time she tried to hit an especial note, her voice sounded as though it would snap. As for Gerard Butler, while his performance as the pitiful and merciless Phantom was superb, when he sang, he sounded amateur and somewhat flat.This paradox of a well-made stage-to-film movie with less than perfect singing can be explained by pointing out that if the voices of the Phantom and Christine and possibly the others had been dubbed rather than sung by the actors, it would have been as near perfect as a film could be. Unashamedly artistic and undeniably beautiful, the only low point in the film comes when the famous chandelier crash does not occur on cue. Instead of falling right after the failure of Il Muto, it is part of the drama that takes place during Don Juan triumphant.",The Phantom of the Opera
534,frankyep,Not the best songs but does make up for it,7,15 January 2005,"I have always loved the tale of The Phantom of the Opera. The original story created by Gaston Leroux is absolutely marvelous and the setting has a wonderful Gothic feel to it that is very vivid and vibrant. Now director Joel Shumacher teams up with Andrew Lloyd Webber to bring to the screen a film adaptation of not only Leroux's story but the stage musical that was also adapted by Webber. Now I am not a big fan of either Webber or Shumacher; especially Shumacher's attempt with the third and fourth installments to the Batman franchise. But I will say that this Phantom does surprise me a bit. While many of the musical numbers to me are boring and are just used as a mean to fill the time, some of them are very delightful such as the song playing when the Phantom takes Christine to his home beneath the opera house and the opera song that is written by the Phantom character. The set and costume designs in this film are also very magnificent. They are so detailed and very carefully constructed that it does make up for the so-so songs and makes this film truly visually stunning. At times, one may feel that the story starts to get lost through the dismal songs and start to wonder when it is going to start up again. And on a light note, Gerard Butler doesn't give a very frightening performance as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson is miscast as the role of Raoul. Still, the visual aspects are very stunning and I guarantee by award time that nominations will occur for its Art Direction and Costume Design. (*** out of ****) GRADE: B",The Phantom of the Opera
535,sumpleby,"An ""OK"" film, but not a great one.",6,24 December 2004,"All-in-all, this is an ""OK"" film, but not a great one. Don't go in expecting a lot and you will have a pleasant 2+ hours. i have seen it twice and I give it a 6 out of 10.WHAT'S RIGHT WITH THE FILM (It might not sound like it, but there is a lot right with this film).1) Art Direction & Set Decoration. These are SPECTACULAR. Beautifully done and deserving of a nomination.2) Cinematography. This is really a very beautiful film and artfully done.3) Emmy Rossum, as Christine, can sing.4) Patrick Wilson, as Raoul, can sing, too.4) The Andrew Lloyd Webber score, almost complete, from the stage production. Just a few bits changed or left out.5) The use of B/W in the film. It opens in B/W, with a grainy ""old film"" quality that changes to full color when the chandelier comes to life. There are other segments in the film done in B/W, all denoting the here-and-now while color is reserved for the past.6) The chemistry between Patrick Wilson as Raoul and Emmy Rossum as Christine works well.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE FILM.1) Gerard Butler, who plays the Phantom, can't sing. They should have dubbed him. It's almost painful when he reaches for higher notes--but he doesn't do all that well with the lower ones, either.2) There's not a lot of chemistry between the Phantom & Christine in this film, and there really needs to be.3) Minnie Driver just isn't right for the role of Carlotta.4) Some scenes are rushed through that really need more time: those in which the Phantom is disrupting the Opera or messing with La Carlotta, for example, or when Christine whips that mask off the Phantom--she does it immediately--no hesitation, no fearfulness on her part, just whips it right off.5) And speaking of that scene, when the Phantom is cursing her for removing his mask there isn't the feeling of rage & anguish from him there should be--sure he moans and holds his face, but one isn't driven to pity as in the stage production.6) The gorgeous masquerade ball sequence has been reduced to people all wearing shades of black, white & gray, with the exception of Christine's extremely pale pink dress. They're all singing about swirling color...and there is none. When the Phantom enters dressed as the Red Death, his costume is not the fearful, imposing one you expect--this is a ""dressed down"" Red Death.7) The falling chandelier has been moved to the very end and is almost off-hand rather than having the enormous impact it should.8) During the Don Juan sequence toward the end of the movie, after killing Piangi, the Phantom steps out of the alcove looking as he always does!! No cloak, nothing. And yet, no one seems to notice he's not Piangi! Hello! Piangi is a fat oaf & the Phantom looks nothing like him. Even when Christina notices, she doesn't give much reaction.9) The Phantom's disfigurement isn't all that horrible--a red face, a couple of lumps, some missing hair & a pulled lower eyelid--and when revealed you feel that a lot of fuss was made over not much.10) Having Raoul, the Phantom & Christine wading around in waist deep water during the last big song was not a bright idea on someone's part...11) And speaking of that last big song, there was another rushed sequence that deserves better--but I guess when you're waist deep in water you don't feel like hanging around for long.",The Phantom of the Opera

540,lyndon_gray,An amazing and spectacular film,9,9 December 2004,"I've read some previous comments on this film and if you're used to action films with blood and guts and violence...then you'll be disappointed. However, if you're after a love story with lavish sets and fabulous voices and acting, then this is the one for you.If you've never been able to get to the theatre to see the stage version of Phantom then this film offers you the same and much more.Firstly there's the singing. All characters sing the songs using their own voices except Minnie Driver. There is a great tonal quality to all of them and the male leads deliver their songs with great expression and feeling. Emmy Rossum who plays Christine has a great gift in a having a beautiful voice.Gerard Butler sings and acts very well. If you closed your eyes, you could almost think you were listening to Michael Ball or Michael Crawford. He brings a real power to the personality of the Phantom, he's mesmerising and menacing at the same time and shows a real tenderness and love towards Christine.Minnie Driver is wonderfully comedic as Carlotta and so to is Simon Callow as one of the owners of the opera. Patrick Wilson's character Raoul is a bit weak and wimpy, rather like a love struck teenager, but Raoul's strength grows through the film, exactly as it is in the stage production.There is choreography, it's not in your face Bob Fosse type, but it's done in a way that will enthrall and entertain you without shouting out ""Here I am look at me!!"".Don't compare it to Spiderman or Terminator, It's a musical, not in the same vein as Rodgers and Hammerstein, some of the words the characters say to each other are sung, that's part of the way it's written.Go into the cinema with an open mind, marvel at the opening sequence and at the end you should come out with a smile on your face.

But a brilliant movie, though 'brilliant' is an understatement.",10,15 December 2004,"Colorful sets, lavish costumes, beautiful singing, great acting, the strong emotions... this was indeed an enjoyable movie to watch and obsess over (Let's not get too carried away. Remember the Phantom.). The overture part was absolutely breathtaking. I swear I have never seen anything like that before. The camera angles of the house and the chandelier, the swift color change from an old, dull, dusty, ugly and rundown dump into the grand, lavish, bright, beautiful and simple majestic Opera House it was before, the dramatic music which blends in perfectly with the scene making it even grander than it is on its own. The production was a success. And the actors were spectacular.When I first listened to the soundtrack, I was completely touched by Emmy Rossum's and Patrick Wilson's singing. I had no idea they could sing that well, especially Wilson. Rossum's voice was soft and sweet, really that of an angel's. Wilson's was really impressive, being that I have seen him in ""The Alamo"" and had no idea he could really sing. His voice, so gentle and soothing. Then I heard Gerard Butler's for the first time. I love Butler, he is my favorite character. But I was not very impressed, almost disappointed at his singing. It sounded stiff and nothing great. Sure, I began to think twice about his singing, but it still did not impress me much. Then I watched the whole movie and I was completely blown away by him. Only then did I really see the passion and emotion in his remarkable singing, which can travel from a loud angry tone to a soft gentle one almost right away. The rest of the cast was just as amazing. Minnie Driver made a great Carlotta! The cast was just fantastic.For make-up, I wish to talk about the Phantom's. Butler's prosthetics were good, very real, but I honestly expected him to be uglier. Look at the stage version, that was really something gone wrong - the way it should be. But the movie's one, it looked like someone just punched him in the eye and made it swell. Nothing terrifying, nothing hideous as they have been describing (like the Devil's Child or like yellow parchment is his skin, the nose which never grew etc). Sure, the movie Phantom is quite ugly, but not ugly enough I say. Gerard Butler is a handsome guy, but they exposed too much of his handsome side. Should have covered his face up more to make him look uglier. Was disappointing how 'un-ugly' he was.But overall, on the whole, the movie was just spectacular!

I love musicals and have sung some of the songs in music lessons, but the film does nothing for me, the lavish sets don't work - surprising because the do in ""Chicago"".

The opera is newly purchased by two genteel businessmen whom have invested in this venture little knowing of the dark secret contained within. The Phantom, a little seen wraith overshadows every production with an air of voyeuristic menace. Becoming enraptured with the young soprano Christine, he begins to mentor the innocent girl whom assumes the Phantom to be an angelic spirit sent to watch over her by her dead father.The mysterious masked Phantom spellbinds his wide- eyed charge, and deep below the opera house unrelentingly trains the young soprano to the peak of her ability. Unable to deliver his beloved music to the world because of his monstrous appearance, the girl becomes his voice. Determined to have his music heard the Phantom deploys intimidation and fear, even the threat of death to elevate the girl until she becomes the shining star of the Opera Populaire. Becoming fearful of the Phantom's obsession and hold over her Christine turns to Raoul, a childhood friend and patron of the opera. They confess their love to one another upon the snowy rooftop of the opera house. The Phantom sees the exchange and the betrayal consumes him, he becomes filled with jealousy and fury so plots a most terrible revenge.***Additional critique... This movie is expertly directed and beautifully produced. Every scene is music to the eyes, and the music speaks for itself in it's timelessness, so little comment need be made there. Music of the Night is a musical high point as to be expected, and Masquerade is a visual feast and another memorable piece.Gerard Butler is a noteworthy Phantom conveying all of inner tragedies of the iconic figure to the best of his ability. My only arguable criticism would be that the true horror of the character's appearance was somewhat understated since Gerrard himself is no gargoyle even with makeup applied. I later joked that there was no woman that would complain about being abducted by him, myself included! With his mask removed Butler's Phantom seems rather pitiful like a crab without it's shell rather than simply an odious beast. This in itself lends a more subtle emotive overtone to the characterisation of the Phantom This point perhaps gets a little glossed over on stage because the audience is constantly waiting to see the foul makeup under the mask.Emmy Rossum's performance was equally competent as Christine, she was only seventeen at the time of this film's production and her youth added to the role rather than detracted in my opinion. Christine is an innocent, impressionable young girl seeking guidance and love in the world and Rossum for her part was well cast to fit the bill. All of the original subtle chemistry between Phantom and Christine is present. Phantom broods and enchants, Christine swings pendulous between glassy eyed acolyte and terrified child.This is a timeless tale indeed which draws the audience no matter what it's medium may be. Phantom is set in a theatre and is viewed in one- some of this magic is still present though to lesser degree than upon the stage. The stage production allows the audience to feel that the Phantom is truly amongst them and up in the rafters above, and leaves them wondering where he will manifest next. His voice appears from the darkness as the story builds to it's crashing climax. This of course is not wholly possible with Phantom in movie form, and something of the wonder of it has been inevitably lost as a result.In conclusion, a wonderful Christmas movie- take your wife or mother to see it to win some female favour. Do not go expecting that most of the dialogue will be spoken and not sung, this is a musical, and in an operatic style. Anybody who goes to see anything with ""Andrew Lloyd Webber"" in the title then complains about singing really has only themselves to blame.Opera is at it's heart about emotion and expression and for those who love it, this movie's music is enchanting. Each song befits a perfect accompaniment to a darkly romantic and achingly tragic fairytale. It can be easy to pick over the movie's shortcomings, but I just like Christine, found it impossible to resist the Phantom or be haunted by the music of the night.A spellbinding 8/10",The Phantom of the Opera
544,StudentGoo,Exquisite,10,14 January 2005,"I thought the movie was exquisite and lovely. It was the first time I have ever understood the story of the Phantom of the Opera, and Emmy Rossum was fabulous. She has so much depth and soul in her eyes and displays it beautifully for her character. The music is, of course, haunting and beautiful (but we have always known that). Costumes and sets were obviously done with great thought and care, and it is this attention to detail that makes a movie respectable. The movie is a bit lengthy, but that has become more the norm these days, and this is one storyline that deserves the extra time given to it. I certainly hope that the film, actors, set designers, and musicians are acknowledged by the Academy when it comes time for the Oscars.",The Phantom of the Opera
545,jack_skellington_,Cinematic misfire.,3,13 September 2005,"When word came that a film version of 'The Phantom of the Opera', one of the most successful and entertaining Broadway musicals ever, was about to be made, many people were excited. Very excited.But then word came that Joel Schumacher was to direct.Known for his technicolour explosions and elaborate set designs, Mr. Schumacher may seem to be a perfect candidate to head this production; but we also get some of the worst editing ever committed to film, gaudy effects, horrid acting and an all-around disaster. Things start off well for 'Phantom', with an excellent introduction complete with Moulin Rouge-style ""postcard"" digital grading effect- an excellent tool for the subject material. Then we get a rousing sequence with the chandelier, and the excellent ""Rehearsal for Hannibal"". Then things quickly fall apart with the introduction of the film's female lead, Emmy Rossum. The character Christine is clearly meant to be a prodigy- someone that we are to gaze in awe over, someone that we are to get out of our seats and yell with an enthusiastic ""Bravo!"" Rossum, unfortunately, does not suit the bill. While an excellent vocalist, she is unable to capture the mysterious X quality that draws us to a character. She stands there with a vacant stare, one that is supposed to represent nervousness, or wonderment, or whatever. She is unable to show any real emotion, and it's more or less like watching a singing wooden plank. Think a young, female Keanu Reeves. Patrick Wilson as Raoul is similarly bland- although in the film's defense, it has always been that way. Such a shame, because this guy has the vocal chops.Ridiculously gaudy art direction suits the time and subject matter, and Schumacher pulls it off, much like Luhrmann did with the now-classic ""Moulin Rouge!"". But unlike Luhrmann's masterpiece, 'Phantom' tries too hard to take itself seriously- a big mistake. This is a pop opera, and the film completely misses out on this subtlety. Minnie Driver is perfect as the pompous Carlotta, but other actors, like the aforementioned Rossum, just don't get it. And when the production is supposed to take a break from all the overblown effects, like during ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", Schumacher decides to fill the set with fake fog. Ugh.Now, my biggest problem here is the decision to change some of the vocals into plain spoken dialogue. What the hell were they thinking? ""Notes"" was brilliance in every production, yet here they decide to change half of it into spoken word. Once again, Schumacher misses the point of pop opera. By having everything to music, the play demanded your attention and allowed you to suspend belief- something that is required in this, considering some of the plot.And the editing. Oh dear lord, some of the sloppiest transitions ever. And this guy is an Oscar nominee in '81? He clearly did not age very well. And anyone else notice some very sour notes? And why, oh why, does the Phantom go from a full head of dark hair to a few strands of blonde as soon as his mask is taken away? Agggghhhhh! Keep the sets and costumes and re-do this. With a new cast, except for Minnie Driver, and for god's sake, never let Mr. Joel 'Batman & Robin' direct anything again.",The Phantom of the Opera
546,orangebaby336,Wonderful,10,12 March 2005,"I was very excited when I heard that The Phantom of the Opera was being made into a movie, but kind of nervous because the fear that they might screw it up. However, I found that I loved almost everything about this movie. The singing, the acting, and the effects were superb, but above all that was the music. The music is probably the number one reason for even seeing and the fact that it's played by a 110 piece orchestra makes it even more fantastic.The Phantom of the Opera is about a mysterious musical genius recluse, a.k.a the phantom (Gerard Butler), with a distorted face living below the Paris Opera House. The phantom becomes the tutor of the young and beautiful Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and falls in love with her. However, the handsome Raoul (Patrick Wilson), the Vicompte de Changy and Christine's childhood sweetheart, is vying for Christine's heart. It's now a contest. Christine loves Raoul, but the Phantom's voice is so seductive. When it finally comes time for her to choose, the choice could mean death for Raoul! The phantom is a very broken man who needs to be loved, but it is so very hard because people are afraid of him. However, once people get past the distortion they'll find he has a very dark soul. So can the Phantom, Raoul, and Christine all find the love they need?The singing was so tremendous. Gerard Butler had the most perfect voice for the Phantom for having never had very much experience he sounded stunning and his emotion was sensational! Emmy Rossum has such an adult voice and it's beautiful, she was only 16 when she started the movie, it's amazing! Patrick Wilson has a great voice as well, it's so strong and gorgeous! The whole cast was great and very talented.Other the chandelier crash, a few lines of music, and a few scenes, the movie pretty much follows the story line of the musical. As well as suggesting to see the movie, I recommend you to see the musical. Dare you trust the Music of the Night?",The Phantom of the Opera
547,RoadKali,An Enjoyable Film - A Good Film - But It Could Have Been A Great Film!,8,31 January 2005,"Like many others, I've anticipated the film version of Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. The stage version is a favorite - and I disagree with most of the critical opinions of ALW's music and treatment the story. However, the film version was a bit of a disappointment. It was beautiful to look at and the music is still powerful; and I accept it may be unfair to compare a film to its stage version (much like comparing a film to the book on which it is based). Dialog has to be re-written and scenes changed to fit the other medium and audience. But I love both the theatre and cinema; and I felt this Phantom could have been great.The major disappointments: Sitting through the film, tried as I could, I could not believe Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I've enjoyed his other work, and I didn't expect Michael Crawford (although that would have been a good choice  since he created the role and he is still in strong voice  just saw him in The Woman in White), but I did expect the Phantom to be larger than life, with a charisma, energy and intensity the role deserves. I would like to have seen an Antonio Banderas in the role.Raoul's character is a bit weak, even in the stage version, so I can't hold too much against Patrick Wilson. He did the best with what he had. But he, too, lacked the passion I would expect from someone really in love - he reminded me too much of a teenager with a crush on the homecoming queen. Even at the end, in the graveyard, Raoul went through the motions, but didn't exude the emotion I expected. There wasn't enough play regarding the Phantom's theatre box being occupied.A source of some conflict in the stage version is Piangi  the fat tenor. The film cut out scenes and lines that give a stronger motivation for his death during the Don Juan Triumphant scene. The same holds true for the stagehand, Joseph Buquet. There wasn't enough development of his character that warranted his death  aside from the obvious shock of his hanging from the stage sets. The lair of the Phantom didn't seem deep enough in the bowels of the opera house. The stage version gives a wonderful illusion where the Phantom takes Christine down, down, down, to the depths of the opera house. The film had some handsome effects, but the feeling of the lair wasn't the same as it was presented on stage. This came across even more so at the end when Raoul and the others are searching for the hiding place.The unmasking of the Phantom in both scenes did not have the shock value as on stage. The unmasking during Don Juan Triumphant fell flat.The greatest production disappointment was the Masquerade scene. Long before the film ever came along, I imaged how that scene would look. Sweeping shots following the flow of the music, coming into the opera house with the chorus, dancers and patrons crescendoing to the mighty climax when the Phantom appears at the top of the staircase, in his regal red costume, cape, feathered hat, and skeleton mask. The scene as shown in the film deserved better treatment. What I liked: I was impressed with Emmy Rossum as Christine. And I thoroughly enjoyed Minnie Driver as Carlotta. I liked the scene where Madame Giry tells the story of the Phantom as a boy raised by the gypsies. It brought some continuity to the story. Nice touch with the rose at Christine's tombstone at the end. Some wonderful effects with the chandelier, stage lights, tunnel lights etc. And, of course, the music as a whole I loved  and the story. I've been a fan of the story and have seen all film versions  some better than others. The book wasn't an easy read, but it gave more insight into the characters.All in all, the film was a handsome production. For most who have never seen the stage musical, and maybe even for many who have, the film will meet their expectations. And it's a film that should have been made. But only in my imagination will it be the film that could have been made.",The Phantom of the Opera
548,heyjupiter76,Phantom of the freezer ***,5,29 June 2005,"First of all, I really wanted to like this movie. Not having seen the stage version, but only heard the score numerous times and watched the old horror classic from 1943, I've always pictured the musical to be a lavish dream come through for set designers and choreographers. And the movie doesn't fail at that level. It's certainly beautiful to look at and moves from one scene to the other with much elegance. Still, it left me ice cold. Most of it's due to the choice of actors.Neither Emmy Rossum as Christine or Patrick Wilson as Raoul produce believable main characters, and so the whole love triangle aspect falls flat. Especially Rossum, although strikingly beautiful, goes through the whole movie with not much more than one - somewhat bewildered - expression on her face. Her role is in many ways a thankless one, as she plays an innocent young girl who is the object of affection of two strong minded men, and doesn't do much to advance the plot herself. Even the songs she sing are mostly sweet, non-dramatic ballads. To really pull this off, a much stronger actor than Emmy Rossum is needed, to portray the confusion and pain Christine is experiencing. Altogether the movie seems too polished for it's own good as the emotional aspect of the story, that could've been very interesting, plays second fiddle to the set pieces most of the time.Things pick up in the second act, with more interaction between characters and focus on the Phantom himself, but by then it's hard to get involved. One of the main problems with putting this musical on celluloid is that much of the action actually takes part on a stage, thus making it seem like a filmed play at times. The movie solves this issue fairly well, but doesn't stray far from the classic approach either, except for maybe in the 'flash-forward'-sequences in black & white that are used to divide the different chapters of the story. Also the editing of some of the numbers, especially the strongest and most well known one, 'The Phantom of the Opera', leaves much to be desired. This scene could've been handled much less choppy and undramatically than how it turned out. And again Rossum doesn't make the audience feel a thing. Seems to me the problem with turning Webber musicals into movies is that they often follow a very character driven and close to operatic form, and doesn't rely that much on big, catchy production numbers.All in all an OK movie, but not much more. I really missed the good chilling sensation of having seen a spectacular musical adaption.",The Phantom of the Opera
549,techcrw421,was good overall but has some minor flaws,8,28 December 2004,"Last night I had to privilege of watching the new release of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" I had never heard a song or seen a production of this particular musical before. The opera house setting was beautifully done as well were the costumes. I was slightly confused by the fact that at times the actors mouths didn't match up with the songs they were singing. I was also distracted by the phantom's mask, all of the pictures I have seen from other productions of this musical have shown an entirely different mask than what was used in this film. Overall I thought the film was very entertaining and would suggest it to all fans of movie musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera
550,jojochan,Wildly Erotic!,10,24 January 2005,"Not big on musicals, I went to see Phantom because of sexy Gerard Butler!!! Not only was I completely smitten with the dark sensuality of his Phantom, but I was blown away by the beauty of the film and the music. I can't stop singing the songs. Emmy Rossum is fantastic as well. Like Butler, she can act with her eyes.My only complaint was too many cut-aways of other people while this duo sang ""Point of No Return"" I wanted to see more of them together, as I prepared to ""rip my bra off"" (I quote another reviewer).P.S. The silent version of Phantom is very similar in story and look, except towards the end, where the Phantom remains evil, etc. Interesting that in 1925 they filmed the masquerade ball in color, with the phantom in red, with a white mask (it's at this point in the silent film that they go on the roof of the opera house.)Also, for those who have been wondering...""keep your hand at the level of your eye"" is explained in the Lon Chaney film. I won't give it away, cos it's kind of fun if you don't know.",The Phantom of the Opera
551,paverpayer,Phabulous Phantom!,10,18 February 2005,"I've seen it 5 times and plan to see it more before it is gone from the theaters. The last time I saw a movie this many times in the theater was Mary Poppins - 40 years ago! I love everything about ALW's Phantom. From Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, to the electricity of their singing, to the huge orchestrations, to the most incredible sets. The movie turned me into a true POTO phan, (and an even bigger fan of Gerry Butler). Joel Schumacher is a genius, Minnie Driver shows off a real comic flair as Carlotta, and I even liked Raoul in this version. Patrick Wilson has the perfect voice for the role and he is more swashbuckler and less fop here. Obviously if you don't like the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber you won't like the movie, but if you've loved the music before, and want to be dazzled by the spectacle of it on the screen, it is a must see. Just don't expect it to be the same as the stage play. It is different in some ways, Gerry Butler's voice isn't Michael Crawford's voice. If you can live with the differences, and embrace them, you can love both the film and the live version of this emotionally charged piece of theater.",The Phantom of the Opera
552,blu_razberry-1,Ehh...OK but not really worth the time,5,7 May 2005,"This is one of those movies where you had to enjoy the musical or at least the idea. As a non-romantic :P I can't say that I found much to get thrills off of. Since I've never seen the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, only having read the book, I just found the whole movie flat and boring in many places. Basically, the movie is about a man, the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler) who haunts the opera house in Paris. However, he's not a ghost; he's a man with a serious facial disfigurement and a very ghostly obsession with a young girl named Christine (Emmy Rossum), whom he trains to sing amazingly well. Gerard Butler carries the part of the Phantom off well. Emmy Rossum is also great, mainly because she's got a great voice and is uber pretty. Patrick Wilson, playing Raoul, Christine's lover, also puts in a good performance, especially vocally, and my favourite character, the annoying La Carlotta (Minnie Driver) provides a lot of comic relief. Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison) has a sweet girly voice too, and her acting was good. It was also interesting how the movie veered from flashbacks in colour to the present in black and white.However, the crappy bit of the movie that bothered me was that the movie was so FLAT. There were definitely some parts that were dragged out way too long with songs from the musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is a classic, but I just didn't feel that the scenes did justice to what was going on in the music. And then of course, certain parts involving the Phantom and Christine were OVER dramatic. It was a adaptation from a musical, bear that in mind, but the whole thing just reminded me of a really bad high school production that went on for a good half hour too long and overly cheesy. The love bits are especially puke worthy since they just go on forever and take away from the character of the Phantom. If you read the story, you just feel that the Phantom's actions aren't really explained. Joel Schumacher, the director, just relies on the explanation that the Phantom is too crazy in love and obsessed with Christine.In general, the movie was OK. I guess people who loved the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber will love this movie better. I just preferred the story, but that's me. I just felt that at 2 hours and 20 minutes, I thought that the movie could have cut off stuff to make it less stuffy.",The Phantom of the Opera
553,bparker225,Breathtaking,10,9 March 2005,"I think this film was absolutely one of the best musical films I have ever seen. I rank it with West Side Story, The King and I, Funny Girl and Chicago in my top five. The music, of course, was brilliant, but the sets, the costumes, the direction were all flawless. I felt transported! I especially admired the casting. All three principals were well cast. I was especially impressed with Gerard Butler. He brought a dimension of humanity, sensuality and passion to the character that was very impressive. His performance was powerful and he evoked profound sadness. When he is on the screen, you cannot take your eyes off of him. He used his voice, his eyes and his movements to great effect. I am mystified that he did not even get the recognition of an Oscar nomination for his worthy effort. A few have criticized his raw, edgy, rock star vocalizing. I found it compelling. He really drew the audience in. His voice was perfect for his character. He was the perfect Phantom! This film is a classic.",The Phantom of the Opera
554,tiger-li,A disfigured musical genius falls in love,6,5 March 2005,"Having never seen the stage show, I am unable to make any comparisons between the film and that. However, I am a fan of the book and the music and was very much looking forward to seeing this film.The film starts on a magnificent note - it is in black and white and gradually changes to colour as the fallen chandelier is lifted back into position with the title song rocking in the background. Definitely one of those fantastic cinematic moments.The film looks fantastic with its Gothic sets and the masquerade ball is a scene unto itself.However, unfortunately films cannot be held together by sets and music alone, and this is where the film falls down. Emmy Rossum is beautiful and niave as the adored Chistine. Her voice is pure and sweet but does not really have the depth of emotion required for the climactic songs in this opera. Raoul was wet in the book and fortunately Joel Schumacher was able to find an actor to portray that perfectly in the film! As soon as Raoul comes on the screen, one can hear the audience groaning and clock-watching until he leaves.Gerard Butler (as Eric) is the lifesaver of the film. He brings real emotion to the role of the Phantom and his scenes with Christine not only bring out the best in her, but they are filled with real sexual chemistry. The only real disappointment with his role of the Phantom was that he was too good looking! I appreciate that Hollywood would not have such a huge disfigurement as the book version requires, but when the Phantom's mask is ripped off, the audience should feel some of the horror that the whole tragic story is based on. Unfortunately, disappointment is the first reaction closely followed by a sense of incredulity that Christine could be so shallow in her affections that she would be put off this sexy singing bloke because of a slight facial defect! However, this is a film that I will be buying when it comes out. Overall, it is not a bad version of the classic opera and because it looks, and mostly sounds, so fantastic, it is recommended viewing.",The Phantom of the Opera
555,mithzelluque,Personal Opinion,10,28 May 2014,"I absolutely loved the music and Emmy and Gerard's singing, it was superb. Loved their acting and the way they simplified the movie with very little talking and acting as best as they could to really emphasize on the songs. The balance was very well done, but I have to admit that when I first saw it I had never before heard of the original plot of the story, but when I compared the plot from the movie to the original story I was a bit disappointed to find the differences. But nothing that could really diverge the entire idea. All in all, I absolutely loved it and would actually recommend for everyone to see. It's a simple movie worth watching and the singing will make goosebumps stay on your skin all night.",The Phantom of the Opera
556,daquinofamily,A gorgeous site to behold.....,10,22 May 2005,"This movie was more than I expected. Probably the best film adaptation of an Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical ever made. It was very true to the stage version. I hated Evita. All the people in this movie who sang were great. As with ""Chicago"", I am so glad the movie musical is ""back"" with the players actually singing in their own voices. I know Minnie Driver was dubbed, but she is a singer, just not a coloratura opera singer. And her acting more than made up for that. I wish I had seen it on the big screen since it was gorgeous to look at as well as marvelous to hear. It had a little bit of a ""Moulin Rouge"" look to it. Gerard Butler's voice was panned by so many critics, and I can't understand why. I happen to be a voice teacher, so I know about vocal technique. He was really very good and sexy even with his disfigured face! I almost wanted Christine to stay with him at the end. True the other singers were more classically trained, and that worked for them. It didn't bother me that Butler sang with a more rock feel. Remember, Andrew Lloyd-Webber was originally a ""rock"" composer. ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" were billed as ""Rock Operas"". Actually this film is almost better than watching the stage version because it explains so much more ""behind the story"" stuff. I loved the going back in forth of the time-line of the present in Black and White and the past in color. What a great concept. In any case, I would recommend anyone who loves musicals to watch this film.",The Phantom of the Opera

They had even loved it enough to bring their young boy to see this play live, with this being one of the first plays i would ever see. So when my family saw this had come out you can bet my mother was nothing but ready to see it, though the speculations did fly,,,,, (will this be satisfactory? Will Butler deliver the performance needed to show the pain the Phantom went through? Does Butler have a voice?) .... My mother was still happy to show me it. and you can believe that despite all of this, This movie did not disappoint.Butler does a fine job as the Phantom and I was amazed to find he had a good singing voice. Not only that, he was able to deliver an incredibly seductive performance that threw me back to the live performance i had seen and loved. Plus, Butler also delivers a Phantom that has a rather obsessive tone, while still allowing the audience to feel sympathy for him and wish his life could have turned out differently. And not only did Butler do well, Christine was perfect. I was amazed by how well she was portrayed by Rossum, and her voice was incredible. I was on the edge of my seat with glee every time she sang, and her alongside the phantom together blew my mind. I was so grateful i could have the opportunity to experience this masterpiece and hope to return someday to the live performance that captured my heart.I give this Angel of Music a 9 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera

Emmy Rossum gives an excellent performance as Christine, Gerard Butler truly makes you sympathise with the Phantom (and he has massive sex-appeal!), Patrick Wilson gives Raoul more depth that the stage show.Joel and Andrew have made a fantastic decision in choosing the two male leads as their voices provide the ultimate contrast and Emmy manages to capture the innocence that Christine needs.Highly recommended, even if its just for the experience..",The Phantom of the Opera

I have the DVD, read the book, seen the play twice, own the Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman soundtrack, and seen the silent movie. Of course, Gerard Butler was fantastic. I don't mind that he is not the greatest singer in the world, because he plays the Phantom exactly the way I have always seen the Phantom in my mind. Emmy Rossum was very good as Christine. Her voice is beautiful and pure. Though, again, its not the best singing voice, Butler's and Rossum's voices sound beautiful together. Everyone was great in this movie. The add-ins (like the sword-fighting sequence in the graveyard) and changes (the Phantom's Don Juan instructions during the Masquerade sequence) were great.

I grew up with the musical, I saw it twice on stage in London in the early '90s, I've seen and read almost every version of the story itself and the movies inspired by the story of Gaston Leroux. This particular movie is so touching, so lyrical, so full of ""stage"" and soul, so full of passion, colors and feelings, so full of music... Yes, the music is a masterpiece, and so the cast is. Gerard Butler is a God in his dark, underground dungeon, he is crazy, genius, demon and divine, cruel and gentleman, criminal and angel at the same time... He was the perfect one for this role with no doubt. Emmy Rossum as Christine was a fairy, a beauty, her perfect voice added the necessary power to the movie, Raoul was perfect for the role, too and the rest of the cast was in one word ""excellent"".

I thought that Gerard Butler did an amazing job in the title role. His singing made me cry, it was so moving. He really understood the character he was playing. Emmy Rossum did well, but I don't think she deserved the Golden Globe she was nominated for, much less an Oscar. This film was a work of art, and if you can't see that, then oh well.

I read the book back in middle school as I was in a charter school that had French class as a second language and we read the book than watched this version of the Opera. When I saw it for the first time I enjoyed it and fell in love it and soon later I had gotten my hands on it on DVD and it is one of my favorite musical movies I have ever witnessed. I love the story line and I love how the music stays with throughout the whole movie. With Christine and the Phantom I fell for their acting and I admired the way they had to sings some of the sings to me a lot of it was spot on. I did, however, fall for the phantom more.

I have loved the stage musical since I was young and the movie made me love ""The Phantom of the Opera"" even more. Emmy Rossum is the perfect Christine, she's young and innocent and has an amazing voice. A lot of people have criticized Gerard Butler's performance especially his voice. I think Andrew Lloyd Weber and Joel Shumacher gave the Phantom a great edge. They made him seductive which gives you a better understanding why Christine would be so attracted to him. His voice has that sexy-rock'n roll- dangerous feel to it which people thought was not fitting for the Phantom. I didn't like Raoul's character very much, Patrick Wilson has a great voice but he isn't the best actor. He showed no emotion or real love for Christine, he pretty much thought that she was crazy and that the Phantom wasn't real. Christine should have stayed with the Phantom!! He deserved her! I recommend this film to anybody who loves musicals and loves love stories, I saw this movie 3 times in the theater and cried at the end 3 times.

The realistic sets, the angelic voices, the depth of the story, the mystery behind the phantom... simply fantastic. It's not the kind of movie you just watch and then forget. It ends leaving you with a feeling of amazement and warmth for what you have just experienced. Gerard Butler is becoming one of my favorites. The man is so awesome in every role, either that is a manly king warrior, or a charming mysterious phantom. I see a rising star. As for Emmy Rossum, I personally couldn't think of anyone better for the part of Christine. She is so beautiful and sweet. Minnie Driver gave an excellent performance, a very demanding one as well This has to be seen by anyone who appreciates art, because this is cinematography at its best!",The Phantom of the Opera
565,karenchapman-87572,What a revelation,10,16 January 2018,"I have been checking out films on IMDb for years but have never felt compelled to open an account and actually leave a review so that should say something. I loved this film from the opening scene but the last 1/2 hour was just spectacular! Gerard Butler was so much more than just eye candy (although he was this and more). Classic dramatic performance that actually had me on the verge of tears.
Ignore any negative reviews this was quality.",The Phantom of the Opera
566,cos0591,"The Paris Opera House is haunted by a Phantom, who is actually a gifted composer who is horribly disfigured and lives in the bowels of the opera house.",10,20 January 2006,"This movie is definitely on my list of the top ten movies I've seen in my life. It has everything and more of what I look for in a movie beautiful music and vocals, romance, gorgeous atmospheric settings, talented actors who can sing, a bit of comedy, a bit of fantasy and a bit of horror. I've seen the live stage production of ""Phantom"" but think the movie is much better. The movie version develops the plot a little more and explains how the Phantom arrived at the Opera House. Emmy Rossum has such a beautiful, clear voice and seemed so young, sweet and innocent  perfect for the role of Christine. Gerard Butler is really handsome and played a sexier, more erotic version of the Phantom  not as menacing as the Michael Crawford version. But that was a ""plus"" in my estimation. The ""Point of No Return"" scene is one of my favorites. Proof that movies can depict sexuality and eroticism without showing any body parts!!! Patrick Wilson's portrayal of Raoul was fabulous and his voice is exquisite. I didn't have the opportunity to see ""Phantom of the Opera"" when it was released in the theaters. I caught my first glimpse when is started to air on cable TV a few weeks ago. Of course, I had to go right out and buy the DVD so I could watch it as much as I wanted and savor every minute. You won't find any gun fights, car chases, or vulgar language here, which is why my husband and two sons do not enjoy this movie the way I do. But if you are a lover of good music and a hopeless romantic like I am, don't miss this one.",The Phantom of the Opera
567,kkdkutler,it was amazing except for the phantom,8,7 March 2006,"I really liked this movie it was very good the acting was very very good Joel really got the intense drama he wanted out of it, and I felt that it was truly going to be the best version of it. Though it may have seemed wonderful, I felt though that the reason that it was not so great was the phantom's voice, I didn't like it at all!!!! Don't get me wrong the man is a great actor and even seemed that he fit the part as a masked madman but when he tried to belt out those notes to sing it almost ruined the film!!! Luckily at the end I finally got used to his annoying sound but it was not the powerful booming yet miraculous voice that should captivate crowds and awe the actor who plays Christine (emmy rossum). Emmy though, on the other hand, can you say amazing!?!?! She was incredible I never knew that a girl of that size could sing so.. it was just amazing you will have to see that part. yes there is a lot of singing it was actually not bad as I thought though, it went well with the play and I think in some scenes to bring the story along it was better than what a play could do. THe cinematography was divine and the props and entire cast and crew who played in the film just really gave this movie depth. I would have to say the only downside is that phantom's voice its haunting in a scarring type of way nothing that great and just horrible, but his acting helped not make it seem so disgusting. But all in all the film very good Minnie driver may annoy you but she did what she was supposed to, though she was not as significant. I think Raul did better than I expected and guys hey if your not interested in this just see the sword fighting that was good, and not to mention that Emmy is incredibly beautiful, and singing was just the icing on the cake.",The Phantom of the Opera
568,Caitlin-7,"beautiful filmed, but no musical soul",4,1 January 2006,"While this film was beautifully filmed with gorgeous sets that really captured the play, the singing was just awful. Go back and listen to the original cast recording to see what I mean. When Michael Crawford sings there is pain, love and a threat. When Michael Crawford sang that Christine would ""regret the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you"" one could feel the threat in those words. When they were sung in this movie, the conviction was so lifeless that the feeling was more of ""who cares, were you talking to me?"".I wish that had actually chosen people that could convey meaning along with the music, instead of just singing the songs by rote.",The Phantom of the Opera
569,Gwyn-5,Disappointing,4,23 June 2007,"Although there are some exciting scenes and the visuals are pleasing at times, I found this a bit lacking. I was expecting more of the stage performance than was offered here. To begin with, Gerard Butler's performance was lacking the power that the original stage play's Michael Crawford had in his voice. I can't say that I appreciate the fact that Sir A. L. Weber wanted a ""rock and roll"" voice quality for the phantom. Mr. Butler's performance seemed weak and forced most of the time. There were only a couple of scenes where he seemed to have any power at all. The female lead, Christine (played by Emmy Rossum), was also very weak and had little to offer to the part. Again, I might be biased because I was expecting something more powerful but I did not enjoy this movie very much. There is one bright spot within this mess and that is Raoul (played by Patrick Wilson). Simply put, he did a much better job in his part than the rest of the cast. I am sorry Sir Weber, but this did not come across as powerfully as the stage play!",The Phantom of the Opera
570,James-198,A Movie Masterpiece!,10,14 February 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is a totally mesmerizing film. The minute the film begins until it ends, it grabs you and never lets you go! I don't think I have ever really felt the way I did when the movie started and you are drawn into the world of Paris, France in 1870! The movie was spine tingling. The cinematography is outstanding; jaw dropping, in fact! The costumes were lovely as were all the sets which created the fabulous world for these lovely characters!Now to the important part - the stars. Emmy Rossum portrayed Christine with so much poise and grace. She sang like an angel. The chemistry that she had with her co-stars, especially, Gerard, was breathtaking.Patrick Wilson played the perfect role as her dashing champion. He has a voice like none I have ever heard before - so clear.Minnie Driver is excellent as La Carlotta!Now to Gerard Butler. I had heard all the criticism concerning his portrayal of the Phantom and this weekend, I came to the conclusion that this movie wouldn't be the same without his devastating performance of this tortured human being. His range of emotions alone deserve praise. People keep comparing him to Michael Crawford, which I think is totally unfair and off the mark.I loved this film, because of his performance, which is truly amazing. You have to remember that his character has been shunned by society all his life -- there are so many different emotions he conveys in just one glance. Mr. Butler conveyed them marvelously and I thought his voice was perfect for the role. He is the emotional center of this tragic love triangle between Christine, Raoul and himself. The scenes in his lair with Emmy and during ""Point of No Return"" attest to their wonder chemistry together. As he said in an interview, he would look into her eyes and his heart would break!To all of the stars: Miss Rossum, Miss Driver, Mr. Wilson, and especially, Mr. Butler, you each deserve a standing ovation. Each time that I have seen this film, the audience applauded! Yes, applauded. This film truly is a masterpiece, and I am so thankful that Mr. Webber and Mr. Shumacher chose to do this film.""Pitiful creature of darkness what kind of life have you known?"" nearly tore my heart out! Imagine what the Phantom must have felt? My point exactly! Mr. Butler deserves much praise for his performance, instead of ridicule. These last few scenes alone are worth paying admission several times over.Bottomline, this movie is extraordinary -- a masterpiece. As a lover of movies, you owe it to yourself to go see this marvelous film while it is in the theater. You will be swept away by the pure spectacle, and blown away by the performances of its key players.Also, it might be leaving the theaters this week, as I don't believe it is showing in my area after Thursday, 2/17/05. So if you want to see it on the big screen, this week may be your last chance! Go see this wonderful picture while you have the chance. When was the last time you saw people staying in the theater to watch the credits role, or sit in silence in awe of what they just experienced, or heard exuberant applause after a film ended? Each time that I saw this picture that's what happened. It truly is a marvelous film!UPDATE: It left my local theater last night. I even saw the guy role out the little red cases that the film was in. I saw it again last night (2/24/05 - my birthday present to myself). The projector broke, so they had to move it to another theater, which was one of the better ones with the great speakers and big screen. Even though I had seen it many times before (lost count actually), it was like I was seeing it for the first time, because the images were so much clearer! I must admit that this movie has brought the most fun (and thought-provoking as to the human condition of being loved or not loved) that I have had in a long time, and I'm a life-long movie lover! To those of you who still have an opportunity to see this film in your area, you have to see it on the big screen to believe it! It truly is musical masterpiece!",The Phantom of the Opera
571,ego-4,"The best version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" I have seen in 35 years",8,15 March 2005,"Of the four versions of The Phantom of the Opera that I have seen over the past 35 years, I like the one directed by Joel Schumacher best. The film, released last year and based on the musical adaptation by Andrew Lloyd Webber, is truly worth seeing in that it has the feel and flavor of operatic arts and lives. Besides, the film, for the most part, also remains faithful to Gaston Leroux's original novel of the same name in vividly depicting the madness and genius of O.G. (the phantom), who falls for and is obsessed by Christine Daaé, the beautiful prima donna.The flashback technique, the ashen scenes that gradually transform into colorful ones reflect not only the mystery of opera ghost but also the beauty and classical atmosphere of 17th century Paris where the story took place. Close up takes of the phantom as he listens to Christine and Raoul's duet of All I Ask of You captivate the audience even more, thanks to the good work of the cameramen and Schumacher's meticulous direction.Although I am not familiar with most of the actors in the film  except Miranda Richardson  I think they have played their roles well, especially Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, and Minnie Driver who, besides their fine acting, also sing beautifully.I saw the film twice last week, and I gave it and all the people involved in its making two thumbs up. I just wonder why such a superb film like this was not even nominated in the 77th Academy Awards extravaganza last month!",The Phantom of the Opera
572,bigguy728,Very good movie with the potential to be excellent,7,18 March 2005,"Having seen the play twice on stage, I came in knowing that it would be a very different experience. I have to say that the movie was good, but I am so familiar with the soundtrack to the play that I couldn't help but be disappointed in some ways. For example, I did not feel a connection with Gerard Butler's Phantom. It was difficult to feel sympathy for him in the same way I have felt sympathy for past Phantoms. I think perhaps his voice did not carry the same emotion as Michael Crawford's. Emmy Rossum did well and sang beautifully, but her voice does not seem to have the same power as Sarah Brightman's. It seemed very much like Raoul was a pansy- perhaps they should have chosen an actor with less feminine features. Miranda Richardson was excellent (as usual), as was Minnie Driver. However, I think they should have chosen someone who could do her own vocals over Minnie Driver. Nonetheless, the casting worked, but I think could have been better. The cinematography was spectacular, and the use of opulence and color fit well. The few scenes which were not in the play made sense, and the twist at the end was a great idea. This was a very good movie that had the potential to be excellent. Perhaps a recasting of the major roles would have done the trick.",The Phantom of the Opera
573,christinew,very disappointing,4,20 October 2011,I have seen the stage show twice many years ago and have always loved the music. I saw this film on a tiny television so thought that was why I didn't really enjoy it. However I recently saw the live broadcast of the 25th anniversary performance from the Royal Albert Hall at my local cinema. The performances of Ramon Karimaloo and Sierra Boggess were absolutely stunning and came away with my love for this musical reignited. So last night I noted the film was on TV. This time I watched it on a decent television with surround sound system and again I was so disappointed with the lack lustre performances and the weak voices.,The Phantom of the Opera
574,JWSIII,Phantom of the Opera is with out a doubt the best film of the year,10,13 January 2005,"Phantom of the Opera is with out a doubt the best film of the year, and the best movie musical ever produced. It is visually beautiful beyond belief, unsurpassed in artistry, and cinematography, superb in acting, and the music is better than the stage version. I have seen the original on Broadway, and have both the stage and film soundtracks. Ms Rossum's voice is a vast improvement over Ms Brightman's in that it is clear and delicate while it still retains the range, power and operatic qualities required for the role of Christine, without sounding constricted in the throat as does Ms Brightman. Emmy Rossum is absolutely perfect as Christine, and without question deserves the Globe and Oscar for best actress. Gerard Butler while having a different type of voice than Michael Crawford delivers a powerful performance in both acting and singing. He portrays the emotions and tragic personality of the Phantom brilliantly, giving new depth to the role. Patrick Wilson delivers a performance worthy of any Broadway musical lead actor. The remaining cast is also excellent. Musical theater is a unique art form and is difficult to translate to the screen, yet this is the case of the film surpassing the stage version in its beauty and the way it is conveyed. There are so many beautiful visuals, from the opening chandelier scene, the chapel, the roof -top, the graveyard, and the phantom's lair, to the final scene that many of them will remain with you long after the movie is over. The cinematography is beyond a doubt the best of the year.While the source music is unquestionably beautiful to begin with, several very minor improvements were made to make it even better. This is a musical that can be enjoyed many times, with each time unveiling a deeper enjoyment and appreciation.Some critics have given the film less than perfect reviews. It is my opinion that they are simply jealous of the success of Andrew Lloyd Weber, and obviously don't like the director. They were too busy thinking up pithy sarcastic comments to even pay attention to the beauty and emotional power of the film, or the excellence of all of the performances. This is without a doubt the best film of the year.",The Phantom of the Opera
575,antonyhart,Surprisingly Impressive - A feast for you ears!,8,12 December 2004,"Having heard on Jonathan Ross that the film was, quote: ""Woefully disappointing"" I was pleasantly surprised to be extremely impressed. That said, why would anyone ever give credence to JR's opinions regarding films. While not perfect, the Phantom of the Opera was very successful in my view. To begin with, the casting was for the most part on the mark. The vocal performance were polished, particularly from Emmy Rossum who played Christine superbly. Her voice was exceptional and the real standout of the film. Compared to the mighty Sarah Brightman, she stood her ground very well and I believe the more youthful sound of her voice gives her the edge over Sarah Brightman. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was also good, although clearly not as capable as Emmy Rossum. Gerard Butler acted the Phantom extremely well, but his voice was one of the weak links in the film. That is not to say that he was poor, he was really quite good but his lack of vocal range and inability to overwhelm the more powerful sections of his part let him down. However his performances in the more terse mid-range sections, such as ""Point of No Return"" were excellent. In all honest he had a great challenge to live up to the likes of Michael Crawford. While not dreadful as some clearly highly ignorant reviewers have labeled him, he was undoubtedly slightly weaker than those around him.The parts of Firmin and Andre were excellently performed as was Carlotta by Minnie Driver. She in particular was spectacular. The overblowness of her role was hilarious. Even the usually painful Jennifer Ellison was excellent, offering a truly 'sweet and innocent' look perfect for the role of Meg. The cinematography and look of the movie was exceptional and clearly it was a highly sumptuous and ornate group of sets!The Masquerade sequence - which I found distinctly underwhelling in the theatre - was brought to life on the stage, suddenly taking on a phenomenally impressive air as the choreography department had a chance to flex their dancing prowess. This really was a gem of a set piece. It was on par or beyond the likes of Moulin Rouge in my belief and sent tingles down my spine. I loved it.In conclusion, I can really recommend Phantom of The Opera, and I would give it 4/5, it certainly surprised me. To those of you who think the singing is dreadful I say this: I sing as the head chorister of a choir that has sung in The Royal Albert Hall, Winchester Cathedral, St Georges Chapel Windsor, Salisbury Cathedral and St Pauls Cathedal and with that comes some knowledge of music, specifically vocal talent. While I appreciate your right to dislike the performances in the movie, to label them dreadful and condemn really rather fine vocal ability (such as Rossum, whoever couldn't see her brilliance is a fool) due to your inability to recognise quality when you hear it, I suggest you shut up and go back to whistling out of tune.To everyone else I say, go along and be surprised. Its not perfect, but it is certainly very good!",The Phantom of the Opera

It far exceeding all my expectations, and it is hard for me to imagine how it could have possibly been improved upon. Having never seen the stage show, I expected the wonderful music - but not the visually stunning images and perfectly played drama that brought the powerful story to life. Everything about it made this movie such a treat from start to finish. Wow! Emmy Rossum was absolutely superb - especially when she sang, Gerard Butler was captivating as the Phantom, and all the other performers delivered colorful performances. The sound track will be well worth getting as well. What a jewel of a movie! I can't wait for the DVD. Great job!",The Phantom of the Opera
577,j-lockley,Great Soundtrack - Awful Film,3,19 February 2011,"The musical is ideal for a screen adaptation - unfortunately this film did not hit the mark. The cast was not strong enough to reach the vocal requirements of the score (apart from Emmey Rossum). However this was not the biggest problem with the film there were too many breaks between songs with added in dramatic scenes which added nothing to the story and actually broke the mood of the film. This movie was not helped by the unbelievable scenery (for example the candles which come out from under water in the Phantoms den). Schumacher has got the character of the Phantom completely wrong - portraying him as a somewhat magical figure in the film. However, this is never suggested in either the musical or any previous film adaptations of the films. The Phantom has always been displayed as a crafty and a devious character but there has been no reason to suggest that he had any magical powers. Sets - F Adaptation - F Flashback Sequences - F Soundtrack - A+ Fortunately the film only had to rely on the good soundtrack and the success of the musical to draw crowds and it still lost money.",The Phantom of the Opera
578,emily_miller,My Very Low Expectations Were Not Met,3,5 December 2007,"Where can I begin to describe the train-wreck that was The Phantom of the Opera? Since the musical first debuted on Broadway, there have been numerous calls for a film adaptation. Since then I've heard numerous horrific rumors about potential casts, but nothing, even threats of John Travolta and Antonio Banderas in the title role, could have prepared me for the actual film. It's as if the production company sat down and made a list of the worst possible directors and actors for the production - and bonus, they got their first choices for every single one.First let's talk directors - Joel Schumacher - the man single handedly responsible for bringing us the gayest, most painful to watch Batman sequel ever made. At every turn, he sabotaged the direction of the film with his singularly awful vision. The CGI helicopter shots of Paris and occasionally frenetic camera movement are such a desperately obvious attempt at Baz Luhrman's style as to render the film a pathetic knock off of Moulin Rouge.The script itself was never particularly true to the original story (which in all fairness, is practically unfilmable in it's original state) but the additions to the movie adaptation go beyond the bounds of what can reasonably be overlooked into the realm of the absurd. Raoul, riding bareback and open shirted in the middle of winter on a white horse to the cemetery to face the Phantom in a sword fight? It's like a bad Harlequin romance come to life. And the constant cuts to Old!Raoul in the middle of the story filmed in grainy sepia tones fall somewhat short of artsy and come across as merely self indulgent, not to mention they slow the movie down exponentially. Also, there were numerous elements from the stage show which served to delineate the change of scene (the candelabras rising from the lake come to mind) but in the film just make you go ""Huh?"" Why, when they had been allowed to use the actual opera house, did they not film the Masquerade scene in the foyer of the Grand Staircase with an actual cast of hundreds and instead rely on the set pieces and dummies from the stage show? The cinematographic elements that worked were largely a result of using the actual opera house - and those shots we'd already seen in the 1990 A&E adaptation.Peter Darling's choreography looked like Twila Tharp meets Thriller. It was lurchy. It was unbearable. The Point of No Return could have been done as an incredibly intense tango scene between the Phantom and Christine and instead it was some weird flamenco, cabaret number with mirrors.The acting was over the top melodrama with a side of awkward. Simon Callow - who I ordinarily love and is a great comic talent - seemed stifled and uncomfortable. Minnie Driver was inexplicable as Carlotta. Gerard Butler can't sing and has zero charisma. Emmy Rossum can sing but unfortunately can't act. Miranda Richardson - also a rather inexplicable choice for Madam Giry. Frankly, they could have switched her with Minnie Driver and it would have made a heck of a lot more sense. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was, ironically, the only casting choice I liked, and as most fans would agree - if you walk away from Phantom cheering for Raoul - something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.Make-up wise, it was no longer believable that Christine was in any way horrified by the sight of the Phantom's face. I understand that the stage production kicked it up a bit so that his face would read in the back of the theater - but Gerard Butler looked like he had a bad sunb urn on a quarter of his face. I guess what disappointed me the most, was that I was so impressed by the film version of Evita, which seemed to understand the scope of what was possible for a stage to film adaptation and garnered ALW a number of Oscar nominations, that I would have thought he might have remembered how to generate that kind of quality. If they had transfered the stage show directly to screen ala the Producers - it still would have come out better than the strange amalgamation of the two that resulted.To summarize, the movie would have been served better by cutting some of the high fantasy and style and aiming for more realism. The music stand on its own and doesn't need gimmicks to draw a crowd.",The Phantom of the Opera
579,beowulf1970,Absolutely PHANT-astic!! (Slight possible spoiler),10,10 January 2005,"WOW. Have been a fan of the stage show for some time and was both dubious about this movie and full of anticipation at the same time. Although direct comparisons cannot really be drawn as this is a work in it's own right. The movie did not disappoint.The opening sequence when the chandelier is unveiled and the decay of the theatre is swept away while the main Phantom of the opera theme plays sent shivers down my spine. It was a marvellous effect.Minnie Driver in the role of Diva was highly amusing. She mastered the characters voice and mannerisms to a tee and played the part very well. I almost didn't recognise Gerard Butler as the Phantom at first, for some odd reason I was convinced it was Dougray Scott for a while until I saw his face clearly later on. You'd think a Scot would be able to recognise his fellow Scots actors! :) This film is a must see and will be on my DVD shopping list when it's released. The film was so good I nipped out and bought the soundtrack as soon as I exited the cinema even though I already own the original stage production soundtrack.

I just discovered this film the other day when I took a chance and checked out the soundtrack from my local library; it took my breath away! Not knowing what I was getting into, I then checked out the film itself and I was hooked! My mother saw the 1943 Claude Rains version, and that was the only exposure I had ever had to ""The Phantom of the Opera"", I was surprised to see what was different in this one than the one my mom told me about.I have never seen a musical film as powerful as this one in my entire 19 years of life! The singing was awesome, the acting excellent, the sets spectacular, and the music jaw-droppingly perfect! I have never seen the stage show, but I will someday! I liked Butler's characterization as the Phantom; his voice was perfect, but I felt no pity for the Phantom; was I supposed to? Rossum was lovely, but her voice is too high! Wilson was annoying!!!!!Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who loves musicals or horror/love stories! This is a great film, and the next time I go to MovieStop I am sooooo buying it!

What a visual feast for the eyes. It's great to have music that is a throwback to the times when composers could write. From the opening scenes to the ending, I was mesmerized. I thought all the actors did a superb job. Minnie Driver was excellent, and probably deserves a supporting nomination. Christine and Raoul captured young love to a tee and Gerard Butler showed the agony of a love that was not to be. I know there will be people out there that will not agree with my opinion, but I have seen movies that critics applauded that I thought were horrible. Thanks Andrew,Joel and the actors for making a movie, that I think will stand the test of time and become a classic.",The Phantom of the Opera

Emmy Rossum's facial expressions might lack variation, but her look is certainly spot-on for the role of Chritine, something that can be said for most of the cast. Minnie Driver gives a surprisingly excellent ( and hilarious ) show as the Diva Carlotta, providing supreme haughtiness a convincing face. The Phantom is quite expertly portrayed by Gerard Butler, though the vocal performance is somewhat below par compared to the acting.

The order of the songs is more intuitive, and the backstory finally comes together. The film presents a truly exciting climax, I was on the edge of my seat! In the play the climax is a bit weak, as the critical chandelier scene appears at the end of the first act, and the true horror of the murders is glossed over in favor of complex song arrangements. Also, the stage play really loses relevancy in the graveyard scene - the Phantom is a clever guy, but magical fireballs are utterly unbelievable. The film corrects this ridiculous bit of poor writing with a great sword fight!! Now that's just plain cool! Every movie needs a sword fight! Of course, wonderful acting and singing from everybody. I enjoyed in particular that Christine is portrayed as a teenager naive to the point of stupidity, because that is exactly what she is supposed to be! Too many actresses would have tried to make her clever.. I am grateful to Emmy Rossum for just letting Christine be the little girl she is and simply singing beautifully. Gerard Butler is a perfect Phantom - smart and strong and completely insane.I never would have expected to say this until I saw it, but here it is: This film is much, much better than the play.",The Phantom of the Opera
586,notquitenglish,A BSS Movie Review,9,6 January 2005,"BSS Movie Reviews and Synopsis Synopsises what is the plural on that? Anyway: this time, The Phantom of the Opera.I'd heard good things about Phantom. I'd also heard a lot of complaining about the fact that they didn't draft Michael Crawford for the lead. Now, much as I like Crawford, and even though his is the true voice of the Phantom, I'm kind of glad they went a different direction. Because I *really* like Gerard Butler.I was probably the only person in the theatre who even knew who he is. He's been in lots of movies, but most of them were crap movies carefully chose, I suppose, so he can stand out easily as the best thing in them. A shortlist of ones I've seen Timeline, Tomb Raider 2, Tomorrow Never Dies, Reign of Fire, Atilla. He's handsome, likable, smiley, and jovial. Not, you might think, Phantom material.You may be right. First off, I suspected they'd chosen him because his lips are protuberant enough to stand out in a face half-covered by a mask. This was, I thought, right in line with a fan-girl casting agent, but kind of an odd consideration for Andrew Lloyd Webber, so perhaps I was wrong. Then he began to sing, and while he has a nice voice in many ways, lack of extensive training was marginally evident, and I just don't think Scotsmen are meant to sing opera. On top of which his voice was surprisingly high for a good-sized man (the high notes in ""Music of the Night"" earned him the nickname ""The Scotch Soprano."") I got used to it as it went along, though, and by the end was very happy that, untrained as he was, he hadn't butchered some of the most beautiful modern songs in existence, and had in fact done them what could be called justice.I can fully endorse Emmy Rossum's voice, and with good reason apparently she's been singing opera for ten years. (As we left the theatre, my mom said, ""So what have you guys been doing all your lives?"" My sister-in-law and I are both nineteen, a year older than Rossum). As my mom mentioned, she could have focused a bit more on the acting part of the role, as she had basically the same expression on her face throughout. But really, she fit the part and did a great job.Patrick Wilson I had a bit of a problem with (*cough* long hair* cough) but that's alright, because you're not supposed to like Raoul are you? Halfway through the movie I was inspired to want to write fanfiction wherein Christine tells Raoul to get lost and stays with the Phantom (that's what I would have done). Milked for comic effect, of course. It could even be a sitcom idea and I wouldn't put it past, say, ABC. The Phantom and Christine move to the suburbs of Illinois or somewhere. ""The Phantom of Springfield"" has kind of a ring to it, doesn't it? He could set himself up as a pop-song writer for N'Sync, and she could be a housewife, and they'd have lots of little kids with half-masks Christine: How'd your day at school go, dear?Phantom Jr.: Oh, Mom, those bullies put another bag over my head and hit me with sticks, and kept stealing my mask.Christine: Reminds me of early days with your father. (Audience laughter) So how did you handle all that, Junior?Phantom Jr.: I told the teacher, and then I strangled 'em with a rope. (Audience laughter.)Anyway, I've thought about writing something along those lines, but I don't want to risk being lynched by Phantom purists who are probably even now stalking poor Gerard Butler (Watch your back, Gerry!)I grew up listening to the music of Phantom, and once even got to see the play, in San Francisco. I was only seven or so, so I don't really remember it all that well. What I do remember was catching the flu shortly before intermission (headache, stomach ache, projectile vomiting, the whole works), a story I like to tell because it illustrates my perfect timing. But I do remember waking up every once in a while with Michael Crawford's voice in my head, singing ""Music of the Night"" (probably my favourite Phantom song). It's the music that made the play in the first place, and it's the music that ultimately makes the movie as well.The second half is much better than the first. Tighter, with better performances all round, better pacing. Plus, once Gerry gets the mask off, his voice somehow seems to be freed from most of the well, whatever was off with it. Spit, mostly, I think. Towards the end he becomes mesmerizing, captivating, powerful, vital enough to make you cry for him. And I never cry at movies, but I nearly did at this one. And my sister-in-law certainly did.Phantom of the Opera is one of the few movies I've seen that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to see it again. ""Return of the King"" was the last one of those it is far, far too long between times, waiting for films like that to be made. Hollywood, take note. This morning I woke up with the voice of Gerard Butler echoing around my mind, and so far its kept me smiling strangely all day.The Angel of Music sings songs in my head, The Angel of Music sing songs in my headwww.angelfire.com/moon2/sain_siathe/runintonaught The source of all BSS Movie Reviews and Synopsisesesssss...",The Phantom of the Opera
587,Lebossufantome,An over-rated musical made into a two hour long commercialism event.,4,28 December 2008,"The '05 version I find most lacking in all of the Phantom films. It is completed with mediocre actors with voices that almost barely carry the story along, and even a hint of plagiarism on Mr. Webber's part concerning Pink Floyd's Echoes. Of all the Phantom media, and there is a lot of it, this is probably the most shallow. The character development is non-existent. There are base elements of Phantom dressed in admittedly fine music. Very little is new or even that exciting. This version, the musical, and everything about it, is highly over-rated. I still recommend it, but not if you are looking for actual substance. I am very sad that this version is currently the most popular. I guess people will look for anything with a pretty face, (even if there isn't even supposed to be one.)",The Phantom of the Opera
588,Swrdqst,Phantom of the Opera is the BEST musical movie ever created!,10,18 July 2008,"The cinematography of Phantom of the Opera is far and above anything that has ever been created. From the opening jump back in time scene to the winter graveyard scene it is haunting and captivating. Andrew Loyd Weber's music is magical and beautiful, and the cast does a wonderful job of bringing it to the screen. Phantom of the Opera was without a doubt the best film of the year, and the best movie musical ever! The Costumes, and sets were perfect. The story filled in areas the stage production only touched upon. This was a brilliant adaptation from stage to screen. It is totally captivating one can easily fall under the spell of the Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera
589,revenge_of_the_joolsby,Not as good as it looks...,4,4 October 2009,"Were I to rate this for flashiness, I'd probably give it an 8 (not 10, because Phantom's disfigurement is hardly a disfigurement at all - he's got this gut-wrenching song about how hideous he is and then when you finally lay your eyes on him you think, ""is that all""? So, two points detracted thanks to the inept make-up team). However, it is undeniable that the Opera House, costumes and animals all looked magnificent.As for everything else, I'd rate this a nil; average: 4. Why a nil? Well...Neither of the leads can sing. Or act that well, but given that 9/10ths of the film's dialogue is sung, the fact that they can't sing is the greater sin here. Soullessly and tunelessly they hack their way through the Phantom soundtrack. When Gerard Butler manages to turn ""the Phantom of the Opera is there"" into ""the Phantom of the Opera is thur"", I didn't know whether to cringe or collapse with laughter.On second thought, the fact that these two aren't the world's greatest actors is quite sinful. Any Phantom fan will tell you that you're meant to feel sorry for the reclusive disfigured genius; it's the whole point, to be honest. Thanks to the two-dimensional performances, you never see Phantom as anything better than a murderer, or Christine as anything more complex than a silly, inconstant wet rag.Despite his silly hairdo, Raoul is easily the best singer/actor and most sympathetic character of the film. When I saw this on the London stage, the idea I got was that Raoul was this dull and dreary person daring to intrude between Phantom and Christine; in the film, I found Raoul to be the only hinged person in sight and felt quite sorry for him, being in love with such a dim-witted creature.At the end of the day, this isn't called Raoul Saves The Opera House from Phantom; Phantom and Christine's embrace is emblazoned on the DVD cover, and I expected to be shown their tragic love story. There was nothing tragic about any of it, not least because everything was so over-explained.The live show filled my head with questions, yet succeeded in making me cry; this pompous, badly-acted tripe of a film flashes back and forwards needlessly, pretty much employing every cinematographic technique known to man along the way - yet, for all its visual splendour, left me entirely cold. The clue is in the song: ""man and MYSTERY/are both in you"", but alas, no mystery is left unexplored here.",The Phantom of the Opera
590,MadameGia,People ask me why I watch it so much!,10,23 June 2005,"I had heard of Phantom of the Opera growing up. I learned several songs in choir as a child. The closest I came to ""Phantom"" growing up was the CD in my twenties. I have always loved the lyrics, core and talent from the singers.Joel made that movie for me. I was the first time Phantom fan.Let me say, however disappointed I was with comparing Michael Crawford and Gerry, changed 100% by Why so Silent. Gerald gave me total chills with Don Juan, & Point of no Return. I had chills.I need to get my Patrick Wilson fix everyday.And Emmy Rossum. Every song was great. I now even like Wishing you were somehow here again. She was flawless.

591,mizshely2003,"Angel or Phantom, Friend or Father",10,21 December 2004,"This film was beautifully made and I do not agree with the person who said if you have seen the stage show you can skip the film. I saw the stage show several times. For the most part, the film made good on its attempts to provide a more comprehensive plot than the stage version (we find out, for instance, what eventually happened to Christine and Raoul, and also that the Phantom survived). In addition, the hypnotic spell cast over Christine by the Phantom was far more evident in the film than in the stage production. It was a pleasant surprise to see that the role of Raoul had been expanded to allow him to participate more fully in the plot and of course, it did not hurt to have the character portrayed by one of my favorite theatrical stars, Patrick Wilson. A weak part of the film was Gerard Butler's singing voice (or lack thereof) but actually, it was a very minor weakness. Emmy Rossum was terrific as Christine.",The Phantom of the Opera
592,hyperdirector,The Phantom of All Musical Films!,9,21 January 2005,"I saw The Phantom of the Opera in Canada last week. Although I'm a little late compare to its early release date. But I saw it on the 21st of January, which is the nationwide release point. The Phantom of the Opera made its first appearance on the reel in our technological era. The story seems submissive to the music and the spectacle, but it is still extremely moving and entertaining to watch. If Webber is the musical passion, then Schumacher is the musical madness who translated and wield the tune to its fantastical environment. Last but not least, Christine (Emmy Rossum) is a wise tearjerker.",The Phantom of the Opera
593,montur,Are paid critics the right people to criticise?,9,17 January 2005,"I sometimes wonder where film critics learn their trade. I believe that, if we are invited to read the opinions of someone who gets paid for giving them, then the very least we should expect is a reasoned, objective augment of the subject. It seems to me that many professional critics use their voice, not to make considered appraisals of the movie they have seen, but to give us all an exhibition of how well they can employ irony (often bordering sarcasm) in their writing. All too frequently however, they misjudge their audience. Rather than applaud their wit, we tend rather to lament their ignorance. Some critics of The Phantom of The Opera may serve as an illustration. One even went so far as to criticize the story. Gaston Leroux may not have been the most noteworthy of French writers but, as a rather excellent biography on this website will attest, he excelled at the genre of Gothic Romance. That's what Phantom is and we mustn't lose sight of that fact. One critic speaks slightingly of the gaslamp effects conjoured in the film. ""So what?"" he asks, suggesting that modern audiences expect  and usually get  so much more. If we go to the cinema to watch Gothic Romance then we must expect to watch something like Phantom or Frankenstein or Wuthering Heights. It is fatuous to criticise the story! And this movie is Gothic Romance par excellence. All the ingredients are there in abundance. The subterranean chambers, the gas lamps, the masques, damsels in distress and of course that hint of the supernatural. All enhanced by the music of that awfully repetitive and predictably tedious composer whose work is still being listened to on Broadway after eighteen years! Oh when will people wake up to the fact they are being asked to enjoy such kitsch  as some critic from Chicago described the film? Something I have found critics singularly incapable of doing is suspending their disbelief. This impediment ensures that they also suspend their enjoyment. One dreads to think how some of them would approach Macbeth. Probably criticise the story.",The Phantom of the Opera
594,lossiebeth,Lavish and lovely,10,13 December 2004,"Not being an expert on such things, but loving films in general, I went along to this, trying not to have too many expectations. I went with my in-laws and we all three LOVED it! As far as I am concerned, Gerard Butler was a wonderful phantom, sexy and intense, as well as tortured and deranged. O.k., so he wasn't as old as he is ""supposed"" to be, but surely the magnetism is part and parcel of why Christine is so drawn to him. Anyway, like I said, I don't pretend to be an expert. I just hate to see poor Gerry slagged off so badly when he did so well. I like him anyway, but wasn't sure how he'd manage such a role, especially as he himself admitted in interview to have never really sung much before. Great fun and I can hardly wait until it comes out on DVD so I can get a copy for myself.",The Phantom of the Opera
595,allirish,Should have been left onstage,2,25 December 2004,"Without a magical, charismatic Phantom, the film is doomed, & Gerard Butler doesn't deliver. For one thing, a huge part of the character's allure should be his voice, & Butler's is like fingernails being dragged slowwwwwwwly, not-so-gently across a blackboard. He brings neither smooth, hypnotic sensuality nor its accompanying danger to the role. This Phantom is too bluntly physical; he does not belong in an opera house, he belongs in a gymnasium. He would not seduce, he would rape.Some of the sets are curious; the cemetery looks as though it's inside a theatre, the roof of the opera house looks like a stage set, & a cheap one at that. And an opera house with its own chapel? With the money obviously spent on this film, why not use it to give a more sweeping sense of the Belle Epoque rather than making the viewer claustrophobic? Quibbles - if Christine was a penniless orphan, where did her family get the gelt to build the enormous tomb for her father? As she left the opera house to visit her father's grave her dress was white; how did it become black? 'Evita' translated much better to film in large part because of the casting but also because it had a timeless 'edge' to it and a coherent vision. 'Phantom' is, or should be, all emotion, & I fear that we, as a society, no longer find such lush sentimentality appealing. If this film were to be made at all, Lloyd Webber should have done it about 15 years ago. He's still stuck in the 80s, & this 'Phantom' shows it. In addition, one cannot understand his and Schumacher's vision for this production, beyond enriching his Lordship's coffers even more. I've seen the productions of 'Phantom' in London, New York and Los Angeles as well as various road companies, & am familiar with the original book and Susan Kay's version and truly hoped that, if a film were ever to be made, that the stage magic would transfer.....sadly, it has not. Such a shame to see a stage phenomenon so let down by its very creator.",The Phantom of the Opera
596,betut-1,Good film but not as good as the stage production,7,27 December 2004,"I saw ""Phantom of the Opera"" the Weds before Christmas for a matinée so I was expecting the theater to be uncrowded but I was surprised to see SO few people there for the opening day. I enjoyed this version of the Phantom very much (and I AM NOT a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Weber as I think most of his musicals sound alike). However, some aspects were disappointing and/or confusing for me. 1) I agree with an earlier comment about the Phantom's make up. The masks keep changing shape and, in theory at least, his disfigurement should have appeared under a couple of the designs (since the forehead and chin was showing). 2) The explanation given for the Phantom's ""bad mood"" was so unbelievable! It did not appear in the stage version and was a departure from the explanation given in the original book. I guess someone figured that giving this character childhood trauma would make his actions more palatable for a contemporary film audience. 3) The continuous switching from the era of the auction shown in the beginning to the past drama. I was given just way too much information about Christine's fate.The acting was good across the board. Gerard Butler was a very romantic and dashing Phantom (I always liked the Phantom character more than that milk sop Raoul). I think that for a big screen adaptation, Michael Crawford might have been inappropriate. Emmy Rossum was a pleasant surprise. She was age appropriate for the character and her singing was impeccable. Minnie Driver was just plain fun. She gave Carlotta a kick in the pants. All in all, I liked this film...I simply wish that Schumacher would have left out some of his embellishments.",The Phantom of the Opera
597,dafydd2277,"Did the movie change production staff half way through, or what?",4,31 December 2004,"This very much two movies. For the first hour-and-a-half or so, the production sucked. Then, about when Raoul and Christine sing their love song on the roof of the Opera, the production team realized that the actors really need to sing their songs if they are going to look believable. They realized, somewhat at least, that great stage lighting left the actors in the dark and left really distracting lens flares on the film. (Those problems existed throughout the movie. The first three-fifths of the movie looked like a graduate production from USC or UCLA.)Then, Raoul and Christine actually start breathing into their songs. Then the Phantom does. And the film finally starts drawing me in.Lead actors: Who the hell told Emmy Rossum to stand frozen for Think of me? Between her stance and the editing, the sense one gets is that she hasn't the slightest clue what the lyrics are and the director and editor are trying to ""fix it in editing."" Patrick Wilson, made up to look old, reminding me strongly of Tom Skerritt. He also seemed to suffer from cinematography that suggested at the beginning that he had no idea what his lyrics were.Supporting actors: Cieran Hinds and Simon Callow both sang like they meant it throughout the movie. Minnie Driver obviously wasn't doing her own singing. But, it didn't matter. Carlotta is an over-the-top character, and Ms. Driver clearly had fun playing her.CGI: The first transition, where the chandelier comes to life, was okay, but looked like it was done with CGI animation software that was a generation or two out of date. The frames and textures were flat. If the folks who did the hair in The Incredibles had done this sequence, it would have been much more lifelike. The extra CGI bits of smashed mirror at the end were obvious and distractingMusic: The music recording suffered the same problems as everything else. In the first hour, or so, the mix was terrible. The opening chandelier sequence was muddy and hard to follow. Music editing managed to sort itself out for the most part until the climatic end. Three people singing at once is hard enough to follow on stage. Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom here were entirely unintelligible.Set building and decoration: The most consistently excellent piece of this movie. The details were amazing, when the camera stayed still long enough for me to note them.Cinematography and editing: Generally, this was the suckiest area of the movie. The movie had several scenes where the lighting was designed to bring out the details of the set, and not the actors. When the actors are black silhouettes for upward of six seconds (when Raoul and Christine first meet in the chapel), someone's priorities need to change. Also, several underground scenes had very bright backlighting that threw lens artifacts on the film. If you're filming a stage production, that's okay. In a movie movie, you don't want to draw attention to how the thing was made. That blows suspension of disbelief. Finally, what the hell was up with the ethereal closeups of Christine during ""Think of me?"" All I was shown was a wax mask. If you're going to show a tight close-up like that, at least have the actor emote something. The editing was similar. This was so not the movie for the cut-in, one second fast pan. They were entirely distracting, and, in many cases, led to the impression that they were trying to use the editors room to fix problems in staging or singing.Overall, this gets two out of five stars. It could have been so much more if the production had been more consistent.",The Phantom of the Opera
598,pianoplayinpaulie,'Phantom' Works Better as Stage Spectacle,6,25 December 2004,"Joel Schumacher's *The Phantom of the Opera* is one of the more schizoid movie-going experiences I've ever had.On the one hand, I love the music. I consistently get spine tingles when the first crash of the organ chords to the Phantom's theme occurs. Tears strolled down my face and I got goosebumps during the songs ""The Music of the Night,"" ""All I Ask of You"" and ""The Point of No Return."" While the movie is not as ravishing as I expected (with the exception of the ""Masquerade"" production number), I loved *looking* at it, and enjoyed one performance tremendously.On the other hand, I disagreed with several directorial choices, found the movie almost painfully slow, devoid of necessary tension and woefully miscast in two of the lead roles.A major problem is that the Phantom simply isn't a threatening presence. It seems to be forgotten that this story should be a little spooky! On the recording, you can sense actual terror of the ""opera ghost."" No one seems too afraid here.Perhaps this is because the screenplay gives us psychological reasoning for why the Phantom acts as he does. By making Madame Giry aware of what makes the Phantom tick we are subconsciously informed that his story has been told by her before. And if it has, what's to be spooked by? He's gone from being a seeming apparition in the bowels of the Opera House to a sexy stud with a mask, a past, and control issues. It doesn't feel right.Schumacher also makes the mistake of showing us brief shots of the Phantom as he is setting up his ""accidents,"" especially the first one, where the scythe nearly kills Carlotta. It ruins all sense of mystery. Wouldn't it have been more appropriate if we didn't see the set up? After all, we're dealing with a *phantom!* The stage version worked because the Phantom was generally showcased through use of shadow or a disembodied voice when he was not onstage.Emmy Rossum is wonderful and a real find as Christine! She has a lovely presence and I found her singing voice to be warm and engaging. She projects emotion into these songs that Sarah Brightman does not on the original recording. If there is reason to see the movie for a performance, it's Rossum's.I have a problem with the choice to make the Phantom a younger presence. It doesn't make much sense that the ""angel of music"" promised to Christine Daae should turn out to be relatively close in age to Daae herself. This becomes especially non-sensical when, after ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,"" Daae is transfixed enough to think her ""angel"" is really her late father! An older man simply serves this role better.Gerard Butler sings fine as Phantom, although he growls and whispers more than I'd like, which makes the Phantom's agony almost non-existent. Michael Crawford is definitely missed. It should have been Crawford's role....or even Antonio Banderas, as was originally suggested.Patrick Wilson is, unfortunately, a blank slate as Raoul. When he sings ""All I Ask of You"" to Christine he may as well be singing to a wall. I know Wilson to be a fine actor (check out *Angels In America*) so I can only assume he was directed to this by Schumacher. It's rather standard that Raoul is supposed to be a ""blah"" compared to the Phantom, but here he is made *too much* so.I didn't find too much in Minnie Driver as Carlotta, despite all the buzz on her performance. I know that Driver can sing (she sings the end credit song ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" which is totally incongruous with the rest of the score), but I don't understand why they didn't cast someone who actually has the operatic range to SING the role of Carlotta.I was confused by choices to turn some sung moments into dialogue. What was wrong with just having everything sung? For all the supposed complaining people are said to do when people burst into song in movies, here there is the opposite problem: it feels stilted and wrong when the people TALK the lyrics while the corresponding melody plays.Some of the musical moments are not as focused visually as I would have liked. For example, after the Phantom overhears the love duet between Raoul and Christine, as he sings the line ""You will curse the day you did not do / All that the Phantom asks of you"" he is singing up to the sky. Huh? Wouldn't it be more effective to make some sort of connection that he is projecting doom onto the lovers? During ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" Christine is walking through the mausoleum. It's only at the very end of the song that she is at her father's grave specifically. As a result, the visual seemed more like an excuse to show off a set piece than to focus on Christine's moment of prayer to her father.I mentioned the ""Masquerade"" sequence earlier. As I watched, I held my breath for the moment the Phantom arrives. It is a moment of creepy power not only in the musical but in the 1920's silent. Essentially, the Phantom arrives in a costume representing Death. I hoped Schumacher would stick to it. He doesn't, really. Even the chandelier crash is uneventful as a climax to the movie.It is clear that Webber's *Phantom* fares better as stage spectacle than as a film.Paul Katz",The Phantom of the Opera

I liked the new song, and I thought the girl that played Christine had an amazing voice. Butler as the Phantom was a wise choice, and Minnie Driver was the perfect Carlotta. The person playing Raul was so good, I found myself (for the first time ever) partially hoping he would win. However, I still cried at the end, when the Phantom is left alone. The set designs were exceptional, especially the masquerade sequence. The use of colors, and the lighting helped set a good mood for the entire film.

Some people have been disenchanted with the singing of the Phantom, but I still very much enjoyed his voice and his Phantom. I actually prefer his voice, it's got something about it. I actually found myself wanting Christine to stay with the Phantom instead of Raoul, but hey that's just me. Emma Rossum is a beautiful Christine with a sweet voice. I've seen this movie twice and may even be going back a third time.

I enjoyed the presentation. They did a great job moving from 1870 to 1919 by shifting from black & white (1919) and color for the 1870 period. The music is great and filled the Dolby Digital theater. The male lead voices were a little weak and flat in some of the songs, but ""Christine's"" voice is even better that Sara Brightman's in the same role. I read one review that called the movie a monstrosity, but he is dead wrong. This movie should win Oscars for music, set design, and customs.

This movie captures your imagination, ignites your senses, and opens your heart to your darker side of feeling lust for another. I, myself, felt that I have always been like the phantom in my own soul. Wandering this planet alone, doomed of a life of solitude that nobody else can understand. Holding a passion inside that I fear I can't share with just anyone. The phantom finds Christine, and feels that only she can understand his soul. The phantom shows Christine lust and the passion she can find within herself, he excites her and scares her. In the end, Christine, reunites with her unrequited love Raoul, and they marry, and live a long life together. But what of the phantom? This is what one is left wondering at the end of the movie, only knowing that the phantom kept his love for Christine until the day she died. That passion he felt for her, steadfast and unchanging. His broken heart was a pain of life long sentence. Every word Christine and Raoul sang in ""All I ask of you"" was yet another dagger in his soul............ who out there would have chosen the phantom????? I would have. Not for sympathy as Christine may have, but out of true passion, chemistry and that little something that we all are searching for in this world, yet may never find.",The Phantom of the Opera

I thought Emmy Rossum sounded a lot better in most of the film than Brightman portrayal of Christine. Visually the movie was great, I really enjoyed Butler's portrayal of the phantom his singing was not the best in the movie, but I thought the overall portrayal of the phantom was up to par, the emotion seen through the phantom was so moving, and it takes some courage to accept a role as loved and criticize as the phantom, overall I think Butler was a good choice the "" past the point of no return"" scene was my favorite.

There has been criticism of the leading roles, but I thought they were excellent. Emmy Rossum was perfect as the young girl with the blossoming voice, so innocent yet being awakened to passion. (Yes, the passion is there if you have eyes to see it!) Gerard Butler was the phantom, mysterious, malevolent, tortured and (of course)passionate. I thought his singing, quite raw at times, conveyed some of these emotions very very well and I can imagine that just hearing the soundtrack, you might be disappointed. It is best appreciated in the context of what is happening at the time of the songs. Minnie Driver was wonderfully over the top in her role. It brought some welcome lightness to the story.

606,paradoxical1,Casting,7,23 December 2004,"First things first. I am a fan of the original stage phantom of the opera but I never did care for Michael Crawford his voice was to pretty. As for the movie, Christine was absolutely amazing, Raoul and Carlotta were also excellent. However and this is a big one- Gerard Butler destroyed the part of the phantom. While his acting was good- his singing absolutely destroyed ""The Music of the Night."" I'm not saying I could have done better but there is no way he did the role justice. I still strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the play and the story. The set design was awesome and they also did some very nice things with the cinematography. All told if you can get past the Phantom's singing and its not bad on all songs just ""The Music of the Night"" the movie is well worth the 11 or 12 dollars you will pay to see it.",The Phantom of the Opera

608,kmjones,Decent effort,6,16 August 2005,"Schumacher's vision of Phantom of the Opera is stunning to look at, and thrilling to watch (especially the gripping final 30 minutes), but is sometimes painful to listen to. For some odd reason, somebody told Gerard Butler and Ciaran Hinds that they can sing! Hinds' terrible singing is somewhat forgivable, as he plays a comic role, but Butler's is not. Unfortunately, there seems to be a stigma against NOT doing your own singing, and Phantom suffers because of this. Minnie Driver did not do her own singing for this movie (and neither did Emmy Rossum in the more difficult passages), and Phantom is better off for it. Butler, who sounds as if he only knows how to shout-sing, is decent at times but absolutely awful at others, especially during his moments of rage and fury and throughout ""Music of the Night"".Now, in a movie musical such as Woody Allen's ""Everyone Says I Love You"", some mediocre singing is OK, as it is not a serious musical, and was not derived from a world-famous stage show, unlike Phantom. Anyone who has seen the musical and/or heard a recording of the main highlights (and I'm assuming that that would be the majority of North American and English audiences) will be disappointed by some of the singing. Does that make the movie unwatchable? No. Will you want to fast-forward some parts of some of the songs? Yes.For future efforts, stars of the screen, let someone who knows what they are doing sing the tough stuff. We don't mind that Natalie Wood didn't do her own singing in ""West Side Story"", so we certainly won't mind if professional singers get to work their stuff in future musical-to-movie productions. (There also is no harm in pulling stars off of the stage or searching for music-theater trained actors, as the casting director of Phantom obviously did in the case of Patrick Wilson (Raoul): pretty good acting, and fabulous singing!)",The Phantom of the Opera
609,emikulina,A must for all fans,8,11 January 2005,"A surprisingly good film version - visually exiting, dynamic, very romantic. Setting is lavish AND stylish. Excellent singing, too. Basically, music steals the show - it is much grander then acting, though actors try hard. Emmy Rossum is young, innocent and thus very convincing. Pity, but Raoul is AWFUL - not handsome, not sexy, and it is impossible to see why she chooses him over the Phantom. The Phantom - Gerard Butler - is a main surprise; I have seen the guy in other films (Lara Croft II, for instance) and he was really bad, no sex appeal and no acting. As Phantom, he is excellent - charismatic and sexy with a nice singing voice: strange but pleasing change. The film is very close to stage version - probably because Lloyd Webber controlled the production - and thus it, perhaps, misses some purely cinematic opportunities. But it is still very, very impressive - I've already seen it twice, and my teenage niece is completely swept over - keeps singing all the time and wants to read an original novel. And, as you know, it is not easy to impress a modern teenager with opera. But The Pantom has the deed done!",The Phantom of the Opera
610,jeremy_beach,Like nothing I have seen before.,10,23 January 2005,"I just watch the ""Phantom of the Opera"" last night and I just have to say that is a truly magnificent movie. I have seen literally hundreds of movies but I have never seen anything like this. They don't make a lot of musicals now-a-days which I think is really sad. Musicals are a strong part of cinema history. The lack of great musicals today I think has led to a receding of cultural knowledge. This magnificent movie is a great step towards a rebirth of amazing musical film. Emmy Rossum's acting is in a phrase ""breath-taking"". She puts you into her life and her fears like very few actresses can. And Gerard Butler creates a great contrast between your love and sorrow for his character, while still portraying a great villain that you can hate. It's this sense of being torn while you watch the movie between hate and love for the Phantom that just makes the movie like nothing I had seen before.11/10",The Phantom of the Opera

But this time he said I'll make something good, and he sure did. Have not seen the musical it's based on, or any other telling of The Phantom of the Opera. This makes me want to see them. Let's start with what work, the look of the opera house is some of the best production design i've seen in a while. The costumes are top notch. The musical numbers are great and very spectacular. Emmy Rossum's star making performance as Chistine was terrific,even Gerard Butler surprisingly was good as the Phantom, Minnie Driver looked like she was having the time of her life playing Carlotta and when have Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow been bad. Is the movie perfect, no. Some problems include Patrick Wilson as Christine's love interest Raoul. The way he played the role is like a typical Disney hero. That might be that way because the way some of the character's were written. Like Rauol being written as a typical Disney hero, and even Carlotta was written as a typical opera diva.

612,le-fantome,I didn't like it.,1,31 January 2005,"The characters were more than one dimensional and there was barely any character development. Gerard Butler can't sing and his face wasn't that bad. It just looks like he had eczema on a 1/3 of his face. Not enough to banish himself to the bellows of the opera house. Also, for someone who hated his face, why does he have so many full length mirrors, plus the Labyrinth was extremely well lighted; ""All I ask of you"" lighting was way darker than that. With the character of Raoul, oh geez where do I start; wimp, wimp, wimp, wimp, waste of space wimp. He had no purpose what-so-ever. If Andrew Lloyd Webber took out the ""All I ask of you song,"" the love scenes, and replace his character with Meg, but have a Frodo and Sam relationship between the two, the play would had been better. I like Jennifer Ellison, and next to Emmy Rossum, they were the only two good things in the movie.The sword fight lasted way to long and was unnecessary, and ""Masquerade"" was such a disappointment. Who choreographed it, Madonna and Paula Abdul; however the scenery was great. I won't be surprised if the movie wins an Oscar for art design.I understand why other people like the film, because it is an extremely faithful adaptation of the musical, but I was watching it for the acting and characters, and it just wasn't good.",The Phantom of the Opera
613,jcavhs,My new favorite movie,9,28 December 2004,"I have been a fan of the stage show since the first time I heard the music. I was thrilled this summer when I not only got to see the show for the first time, but also heard that the movie was coming out. I was nervous when I saw the Joel Schumacher was directing and that Gerard Butler, who had no prior singing experience, was playing the Phantom. I fell in love with Gerard Butler's voice when I first heard the soundtrack. It is very different from stage show voices but I think it works very well. I've noticed that Emmy Rossum's (Christine's) voice blends very well with both Gerard Butler's and Patrick Wilson's voices but that the two male voices do not blend well at all. I think musically illustrates the conflict that exists in the plot. I went into the movie knowing that I would like the music but still nervous that the visuals would ruin it. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie captivated me from the very beginning. Everything was very well done. When I walked out of the theater I knew that there were things that I hadn't liked but they were so small that I really couldn't even remember what they were. While this is based on the stage show, it is different from the stage show. You shouldn't go in there expecting to see what you would on stage. It is a new interpretation, and while it does not replace the stage interpretation, in my opinion that the movie's interpretation is just as good. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys musicals, or just a good story. This movie is easily my favorite and I will be seeing in numerous times in the theater before buying the DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
614,donricodelavega,Boring.,5,14 February 2005,"Unless you are one of those people who gets giddy when people sing everything I think you will find this movie very dull. I've noticed from my experience that musicals tend to be rather slow. A chorus of 20 people take five minutes to sings about something that could be easily be conveyed to the audience with a few lines of dialog. As a result the pace of the film is slow at best. It takes FOREVER for things to happen, and since the characters are little more than song birds they don't seem very real and you don't care about them. For example Christine is young and new the whole opera game. But do we ever really get to see her as a person? Not really cause even when shes remembering her dead father she sings. She's scared, she sings. When isn't she singing? The Phantom had a rough life, well I'm sure glad I learned why he is the way he is in that 30 second flashback of him with a bag over his head. Yah, that makes it ALL clear. Long story short... I think I hate movie musicals. And in this one, the opera style singing hurts my ears. And since they would sing at such a high pitch (and used the singing to tell the story) it was hard to understand what they were singing about and what was going on. The commercials say this was a contender for one of the best films of the year. Well if you believed that then you should have looked and the Golden Globe nominations.",The Phantom of the Opera

But after seeing this I definitely changed my mind. It was definitely ten times better than I thought it would be when I first walked into the theater. So if I liked it, it must have been worth seeing. Great cinematography as well. It is also good because it gets you wondering what the outcome will be. It keeps you guessing all throughout the movie.

617,BenjaminRaymond,'Phantom' should have stayed on the stage,5,10 February 2005,"Broadway genius Andrew Lloyd Webber's majestic and lavish musical enigma, The Phantom of the Opera comes to the silver screen in one of 2004's most highly-anticipated film experiences. With the film's $60 million budget (all from the pockets of Webber himself), veteran director Joel Schumacher and a capable cast, 'Phantom' looked as promising as Emmy Rossum is gorgeous. It is, however evident that behind the ""mask"" of the overtly copious set design, costumes, and cinematography, is cast a shadow as shallow as the Phantom's scars are deep and an entertainment value not nearly on par with the royalty and musical awe that is the Broadway musical.Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum, Mystic River) is an aspiring opera singer in the chorus line of the Paris Opera House's latest production starring the prima donna Carlotta (Minnie Driver, Good Will Hunting). When Carlotta, unhappy with seemingly everything about the production storms off stage with an entourage of suitors and yes-people following in suit, Christine is cast in the lead, replacing her. After her fortunate turn of events, Christine is spotted by her childhood sweetheart, now part owner of the opera house, Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Swept off her feet by her reunion with Raoul, Christine falls in love and agrees to become his wife. When the mysterious ""opera ghost"" (Gerard Butler) gets wind that the love of his life, Christine has fallen for the pretentious young pretty-boy Raoul, he (attempts to) take sweet, bloodlusty revenge on the odious Raoul in the only way he knows how singing really loudly at him *cough*. The climax, in the Phantom's damp and dank dungeon of despair, is an intense fury of discovery and imminent misfortune for the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul.Love triangles, engagement, lusty embraces, soulful stares of sultry sexual depravity 'Phantom' should have the romance. Where the stage production, with the wondrous Sarah Brighton and licentiously lustful Michael Crawford hit the musical and dramatic mark with timeless precision, Schumacher's film adaptation fails to hit the proverbial broad side of the barn. Hopelessly irritating, ""puppy-eyed,"" foe-amorous stares from the vastly disappointing Emmy Rossum are frequent and have the viewer longing to smack her back into dramatic consciousness. Where the stage play's forbidden embraces between the Phantom and Christine had invaluable romantic appeal, the film adaptation's have less romantic value than a J-Lo wedding announcement. The Phantom (without too much facetious exaggeration) seems more like a sexually-frustrated middle-aged Minnesotan than a steamy, enigmatic ghost of passion. Christine more closely resembles a beady-eyed Labrador getting a rectal examination than an innocent young beauty on the brink of becoming a woman. The wholly passionate forbidden love that poured from each scene of the stage production are completely lost in the transition to the screen and are to be found somewhere in whatever talent Rossum and/or director Schumacher may possess.While we're on the topic of missed marks and disappointment, Emmy Rossum's portrayal of Christine, without question, is one of the most disappointing performances in recent memory. The opera-trained eighteen year-old began her musical/acting career at the age of seven in her native New York. Making her (quite brief) screen debut in last year's Clint Eastwood drama Mystic River, Rossum has since made a name for herself as both a talented fresh face in Hollywood and a domineering, egotistical prima donna on the set and in interviews. Only seventeen during the filming of 'Phantom,' Rossum's critically acclaimed portrayal was more than lined-up for a Benigma and more importantly Academy Award nomination. Though I can only speculate as to why her performance bordered on Keanu Reeves-esquire woodenness and Orlando Bloom-esquire over dramatization, I am quite sure Rossum's immaturity both as an actress and a person were deciding factors in her overtly overplayed, overdone, over-everything leading debut. There is, however no mistake in the quality of Rossum's voice. Piercing, resonating, and exceedingly beautiful, her vocal performance is simply faultless and helps to offset the cardboard theatrical performance.Butler as the Phantom is a lone bright spot in the shadowy chasm that is 'Phantom's' ensemble. A complete unknown, the Scottish Butler entered the role of the Phantom with almost no vocal experience. With a voice not nearly matching that of Crawford's, but more than worthy of some gentle golf-clapping and respectful nods, Butler's performance both vocally and in respect to the misery of the Phantom's character is quite redeeming to the general mediocrity of the film as a whole. Patrick Wilson as Raoul is just hideously agitating. The viewer is more likely to throw their large Sprite at the screen than they are to find anything noteworthy about his performance. (insert what would have been an analysis of the Benigma Award-winning Minnie Driver's performance as Carlotta had she not had a voice double). (for a visual on the antithesis of directorial creativity and inventive license, give a three year-old a video camera and have him/her tape the stage production you get Schumacher).In conclusion, the sumptuous costume design, set design, and cinematography is not nearly enough to swing the cinematic balance in the direction of a film that lives up to its expectations. Disappointment all around, highlighted by the lobotomized Joel Schumacher and the narcissistic Rossum makes The Phantom of the Opera as tedious as it is. Though the film is not essentially as dull and shallow as I have portrayed it, it leaves the audience with a sense of emptiness. It's like awaiting the opening of a beautifully-wrapped Christmas present with a marvelous golden bow and silver ribbon; then you open it up and find olive green tube socks. The Phantom of the Opera shallow, gold-leafed mediocrity the Phantom should have stayed in his dungeon.6/10",The Phantom of the Opera
618,Hippiegirl68,Flawed but beautiful ... like the Phantom himself,9,26 July 2005,"It's the typical love triangle - the aggressive man of mystery with all the intelligence and tragic Gothic beauty in the world; the safe man who has a sweet deposition and a flair for the passionate sword fight and finally the woman who has a battle of lust/heat vs. true romance. Sounds like the typical Hollywood movie, doesn't it? Nevermind the easy cheap Hollywood setting, but subtract the weak love and add a beautifully suffocating feeling of possessed music, we have ""Phantom of the Opera,"" a noble and amazing book, play and now movie starring break-through singer/actors. Emmy Rossum (""Mystic River""), Gerard Butler (""Letters to Frankie"") and Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") star in the highly anticipated ""Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera"" a movie directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber with a supporting cast including Miranda Richardson (""The Hours"",)and Minnie Driver (""Good Will Hunting""). In the midst of amazing beauty in the backdrops and the costumes (note ""Mask of the Red Death"" - did the fashion designers take inspiration from the stage costume or actually did their homework?) which look astonishingly beautiful although there are some noticeable flaws that made it difficult for me to sit through. The main one to point out is the poor lip-syncing in the numbers ""Think of Me"" and ""Track Down this Murderer"" as well as through many of the numbers such as the title track were turned into little ""music videos"" using camera shots to (?) possibly to make or cover up the poor lip syncing issues. Some of the special scenes in the movie versus the stage play was un-needed, notably the sword fight. Call me a literature purist, but none of them had gone into a physical fight, for Leroux it was a mental struggle and vying for the love of one woman between two men. Again, Schumacher makes up for some of the poor moves and sweeps into the ""Masquerade"" song and dance a la ""Rodgers and Hammerstein"", which the dancing down the hall just screamed those two historical names when I first watched it. In that scene also, double props for the use of colour, and not only the black, white, and silver, but for Christine and Phantom who by ""The Music of the Night"" had been tainted by blood and therefore shades of red. Brilliant idea! All the scenes were wonderfully acted and sung. Butler, having no experience in the singing field only added to the standards that Crawford set as rather the ""rock and roll"" phantom with his growling voice (think ""What raging fire shall flood the soul"")while Rossum has the perfect voice to match the character (she has beaten out Brightman, but had generated Christine's signature poodle curly hair). It is amazing that the singing was fit for the characters. And it was surprising that Minnie Driver was all to brilliant for this role, even faking out with the opera singing voice. But another low point is showed, or perhaps with some more analysis one could figure the reasoning why Butler's makeup just looked like a bad rash. Would it be for him to have the new-age Phantom disfigurement (comparing with Lon Chaney, for example) to show yet another piece of satire in POTO? Like that society is so inept for just the tiniest detail of disfigurement to be ugly and therefore easily shunned? Another issue that is noticeable for a person who has seen POTO over and over again is the age issue. If Mme. Giry was about thirteen when she rescued the Phantom (supposedly sixteen according to Leroux), and then flash forward some years and Mme Giry is much older than the Phantom. Again, only a flaw that the ""young-Hollywood"" version could have only produced. Personally for this movie, I would have liked to have seen Baz Luhrmann or Rob Marshall take the helm of directing this movie, because at the end I felt a bit dry - as if this direction wasn't enough personally for me. But the look was beautiful and perhaps the only gaudy thing is made up in the settings and La Carlotta's acting and wardrobe. Like many people say of ""Fantome de l'Opera"" that it is a confusing book, ""Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera"" is just as confusing when it is in black and white, as well was being Hollywood purified. All in all, looking away from the bones of the movie, ""Phantom of the Opera"" is another musical that we can hope to rejuvenate the forgotten genre.",The Phantom of the Opera

I had heard that even for someone who doesn't like the music, the movie was well-made: it was not. It was well-paid-for. A lot of money had obviously been put into creating extravagant sets and costumes, but not a lot of thought was put into the making of the film, the continuity, or the talent.I had never seen the show live before, but did know some of the music. The songs, banal out of context, are painful when strung together in an unending stream of musical nonsense. The characters are flat, with hints of something possibly redeemable arriving far too late in the story. The Phantom kills numerous people, but in the end we're supposed to like him when we find out he ""loves"" Christine? I didn't buy it. The Phantom is also supposed to be an Angel of Music, and Gerard Butler cannot sing. Emmy Rossum was very nice to look at, but her character has virtually nothing to do, so one got bored very quickly. Patrick Wilson did an admirable job with an absolute sap of a character. The lyrics are dreadfully clichéd and dry. The music is the creation of a multi-million dollar hack. The story and characters are butchered.

Even though it did have a few discrepancies between the original play. I think for the on-screen version it made a little more sense. The story is powerfully moving and the power from the theater was elevated by the reactions of the audience members.

First of all, the music is excellent, I have listened to it over and over on YouTube after finishing the movie. All of the visuals are beautiful as well - aesthetically, this movie is stunning!Something I found interesting is that from the very beginning and throughout the entire movie, every other scene or so looks like an ending scene because of how beautiful and dramatic it is (as you would imagine a scene in the end of a movie) with the music, angles etc. This actually makes it a bit difficult to determine for how long the movie has been running, since the level of drama doesn't give a clue, but I personally like that a lot.As for the story, it's an interesting concept and not as predictable as most movies I've watched - I was surprised several times when things did not go as I expected them to. While the aesthetic aspects are actually the best part of the movie, the plot is great too, assuming you like this type of movies of course. It is not your typical ""love drama"" or anything like that (I personally really dislike that) even if romance is a big part of it, and it's dark or at least semi-dark every once in a while which is greatly appreciated as well!Overall this was a great experience which I would highly recommend. The reason I gave it a 9/10 is only based on personal preferences: I would've wanted it to be a little bit darker in certain ways, and maybe a slightly different ending. But again, it's only my personal preference, the movie is wonderful if you like opera, Victorian era visuals and a dramatic story with semi-dark elements.",The Phantom of the Opera
628,stephennightndream,Joel Schumacher actually did alright!,7,12 September 2005,"This movie was the ONLY movie Schumacher got right. I suppose he can do good movies once every ten movies. Phantom of the Opera was brilliant and has a more dark tone than most of his bad language and perverted stuff with language above the bar. This movie portrayed what he does right and is a more dark and Gothic film which doesn't show completely a school play. This movie did alright and shows his dark side more efficiently. After Batman and Robin I lost my patience in hope his films actually turn out right. And only one succeeded. This film is a beautiful depiction of human nature and our ways to deal with differences. I can see why Tim Burton called him a friend, this guy can SOMETIMES do good movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
629,sweetbabemia,Simply Perfect,10,18 June 2005,"WOW! This simply one of the best movies I have ever seen (and being a major film freak I've seen a few) I think all the casting was perfect. Emmy Rossum is a beautiful Christine, and she sings like an angel, Patrick Wilson sings and acts well but sometimes when he sang I felt he lacked expression in his voice. Gerlad Butler is brilliant as the phantom, and gives a tear jerking performance at the end. A Lot of people have said they don't like his voice but I thought his voice made the phantom seem more believable as it matched his personality (if you know what I mean). All the costumes and sets were magnificent. I hadn't heard any of the music before seeing the movie and I has been slightly worried that it would bore me as it was like an opera and i was only twelve at the time. But i fell in love with it from the first time Christine (Rossum) sang. I managed to convince my whole family to watch and some of my friends and they all had the same opinion as me.In conclusion this is a BRILLIANT and a MUST SEE movie. Most people will find something they like about it. Ignore all bad comments (I can't understand why there has been so many)and see for yourself what a stunning, magical and simply perfect movie the phantom of the opera really is.",The Phantom of the Opera

The best thing in this movie is the music! i love the music and how all the instrument make these beautiful sounds and how they work together. the music is so powerful and beautiful, it's the first time i can say a organ have these nice sound. the lyrics to the songs is just beautiful, how they can start slow and quit, and end up as powerful meaningful words. the acting is also kind of amazing. but i think the music is the ''main point'' at all. the movie is enjoying, romantic, adventure and a lot more.",The Phantom of the Opera
631,Fluffy_is_lovely2005,I thought the film was magnificent,10,4 January 2006,"First of all I just want to say that I absolutely loved this film. I just got it on DVD. I have never seen any of the plays nor have a read any of the books (I just check out the book today from the library) but this movie has inspired me to dig deeper into the orgins of the ""Phantom of the Opera"". I positively fell in love with Gerard Butler (The Phantom) because he played a super hot and sexy phantom (who I would have chosen over that irritating and smothering Raoul any day of the week)!!!!!!! I still don't understand what Christine (Emmy Rossum) saw in Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Anyway, Butler's singing was superb (dispite what come others had to say about his singing). On the DVD there's a section that shows the making of the movie and it was said that Butler had the right voice that the makers were aiming for. They didn't want somebody who was a contemporary singer like Wilson because they didn't want a ""good boy"" they wanted a ""bad boy"". He made you feel something for the Phantom by turning him into a human being instead of a monster especially the scene when he overhears Christine and Raoul's confession of love.Rossum was excellent. Her voice made all of the songs she sung worth listening too. I honestly didn't think she had it in her but she proved me wrong. My favorite song was the duet of her and Butler ""Point of No Return"". They took that song and made it their own. I listen to the way it was sung with Sarah Brightman and some Steve guy and it pales in comparisons to Rossum and Butler's version. Absolutely breathtaking.All of the supporting cast were also good. I loved ""Masquerade"" because it was done with great style and elegance. Everyone looked stunning and sang beautifully.I have to say that this is my favorite movie for now.",The Phantom of the Opera
632,magnusplin,Overrated piece of hot garbage,1,3 May 2019,"Boy, do I have some words for this steaming pile of trash. I have no idea why so many people love this film. This is one of the worst movie musicals to ever plague theaters, and considering this is a world where the awful 2005 Rent movie and Lucille Ball's atrocious Mame exist, that's really saying something.Joel Schumacher is a hack who should not be working in Hollywood. Not only did he ruin The Wiz and Batman & Robin, but he ruined Phantom of the Opera as well. The man absolutely cannot direct or write. A fetus could write and direct better.Visual appeal? This movie has never heard of it. The camerawork is absolutely abysmal. It is so flat and amateurish, and I've shot better video on my smartphone. The sets are so obviously tiny. Christine's outfits are so plain and boring to look at (though that may just be because Emmy Rossum is so plain and average).Speaking of Christine, the two leads are awful. Neither Gerard Butler nor Emmy Rossum can sing their way out of a wet paper bag. Butler sounds like a dying walrus. Rossum is barely on-key 99% of the time she's trying (and failing) to sing, not to mention the enormous amount of autotune on her voice. I'm not even going to get into all the technical flaws with her voice, since that would take until the next ice age. Both of their interchanging accents while singing are irritatingly distracting. Is Butler Scottish, English, French, or all three? Why does Rossum speak with an American accent but sing with interchanging English and American accents? It is the strangest thing.Rossum also cannot act for her life. She has as many facial expressions as Bella Swan in Twilight - one. Her line delivery either sounds emotionless or like she's reading to a group of kids.The framing device that keeps making its way into the movie and won't go away is pointless, stupid, useless, and demonstrates just how incompetent this movie is.Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves for taking a powerful piece of theatre and turning it into fecal matter.The only reason this movie even gets one star is because of Patrick Wilson (the best thing about this movie, even though the hairstylist just had to give him the ugliest hair ever) and Minnie Driver. How on earth do people adore this garbage movie?",The Phantom of the Opera
633,arezoucat,The best musical in a looong time,9,28 August 2005,"I have never watched the Broadway version of this story, nor have I seen the previous movie versions. I have read the story before watching the movie, however. And I must say, the choices of young actors was a genius decision on Joel Schumacher's behalf. The movie is spectacular, and a must-see. The songs are amazing as well. If you are a musical fan, or a fan of this story, you must see this movie. Emmy Rossum has been singing since she was 8, I believe. She is really the most trained of them all in terms of vocal performance. Gerard Butler, is quite handsome but is not from a musical background. So, from a technical point of view, his voice may be lacking what is typically expected from a singer in a musical. But Patrick Wilson has been in many Broadway musicals and he is quite talented. The cinematography in this picture is amazing, and it is very colorful. The sets are incredible and you hardly feel that the outdoors scenes are shot in a studio, and even the snow seems quite real. Overall, it is a very good movie about a tragic love triangle.",The Phantom of the Opera

As he watches behind the stage and along the wooden beams of the Opera, his jealousy controls him and with this he becomes violent and aggressive. Sadly consequences arise. I would say this is a film mainly aimed towards the female audience,purely because of the romance and setting ( also because the Phantom is so mysterious ) The setting is magical and the music is enchanting both together with the acting this film is definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.",The Phantom of the Opera
636,rajaat99,Should be called Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera,1,14 February 2007,"I have no idea how Joel Schumacher could take such a wonderful production and turn it into a piece of garbage. I can't believe the changes Joel made: the chandelier scene was changed (and because of this one of the songs was changed too), there was a sword fight, Erik grew up in a freak show, the Masquerade was all black and white (in the song they make mention of all the colors) and Raoul was made out to be some kind of hero. What was Joel Schumacher thinking? If it was going to be called Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, make it Andrew Lloyd Webber's, and not Joel Schumacher's. I've read some comments about how Gerard Butler did a terrible job and I would agree, but it is far from my number 1 complaint. He is not the best singer and he was way too young. My biggest complaint would have to be the sword fight. If Erik wanted Raoul dead ,at that time, he would've lassoed him.",The Phantom of the Opera
637,FamousCookie,Amazing Absolutely AMAZING!,10,9 January 2006,I have gone to see Broadway plays almost every year of my life. I remember seeing Phantom of the Opera and it coming off as my favorite Broadway play of all time and it still is to this day. When I saw there was a movie coming out I had to see it. It was everything I ever dreamed it would be. The cast was amazing. I especially loved Emmy Rossum as Christine. Her voice was like crystal in this movie and certainly an A performance from Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson.One of the scenes that always makes me tremble is Past the Point of No Return. It was undescribable the passion in that scene. The chandelier crash and not to mention of course the song. The song is one of my favorites along with Phantom of the Opera and Music of the Night.I whole heartedly recommend this movie and hope that you enjoy it just as much as i did because I certainly did enjoy it. It made me read the book...twice... and working on my third time :),The Phantom of the Opera
638,saffronsong-1,Brilliant!,8,16 January 2006,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera hits the cinematic screen and sticks to it. I was under the initial impression that the movie would be an unmusical version of the stage show. Imagine my amazement when that impression was shattered like a front of a plastic car taken out by a rogue deer. First and foremost, the directing is simply amazing. Secondly, the singing is fantastic. Thirdly, Gerard Butler makes one sexy phantom.Anyone familiar with the musical may be hesitant to watch the movie, and even more hesitant to enjoy it. There are a few differences here and there, but believe me when I say it stays true to the essence of the stage production. I rather like having this masterpiece on a DVD so that I can ravish it at any moment when a DVD player and television are at hand.The sound is remarkable, of course, but it can almost be overshadowed by the lighting. Many of the special effects were basic stage tricks, and my favorite is the moment when the phantom is revealed to be standing behind a mirror. This trick is done in the traditional stage fashion, relying on reflection and dimmed light. It's amazing and my heart races every time I realize a masked figure has been revealed. It gives the illusion that the phantom really is a phantom.Atmosphere, costumes, music- all of it is fantastic. I can't really say much more and give it proper justification. Whether you like theater or not, I'm sure you'll enjoy The Phantom of the Opera. My only regret is that some of the story has been altered, but it has been done so in a way to enable the success of the movie. If you don't jump up and begin singing along with Masquerade or Music of the Night, I'll be terribly surprised.",The Phantom of the Opera
639,daytona_peanut,I love this movie!!!,8,6 February 2006,"I have to say that ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is my new favorite movie. I gave it an eight because there are a couple of things they could have done better in the movie, but I am in love with this movie. The first time I watched the movie, I didn't totally understand it and kind of joked about it, but I had a feeling if I watched it again, I would like it more and I did! The second I watched the movie, I fell so in love with it, I was tempted to watch it all over again, and that's something that hasn't happened since I was little. One of the things I love most about it is that I discover something new every time I watch it. That's why I was tempted to watch it all over again as soon as it ended. There was a poll the other day about the best movie kisses and I was disappointed to find that ""The Phantom of the Opera"" wasn't listed. What girl doesn't sigh when Christine and Raoul kiss on the balcony? Furthermore, who can deny that the phantom was jaw droppingly handsome? I didn't feel that the bad side of his face was that bad. I have seen a lot worse. Ebert and Roeper said he was too handsome to play the phantom, but I think it makes the story a little better. If any of the people who are reading this have not seen this movie go rent it right now. This is great movie, but also be prepared to bawl your eyes out.",The Phantom of the Opera
640,murrayla,Visually stunning; but probably not for everyone,8,25 December 2004,"I am a little disappointed in this movie, but not because it's not beautiful (it is) or because it's not true to the stage show (it's not, exactly). My fear is that it won't appeal to as broad an audience as did ""Chicago"" and that may discourage future conversions of musical shows to the cinema. It isn't a comedy and, since it is an opera, there is very little spoken dialog, both of which may limit its appeal.Clearly, most of the energy (and money) was spent on the visuals which are truly stunning. It is incredible to look at and to listen to. Unfortunately, in my opinion, more time and effort should have been spent on casting. Gerard Butler, in particular, was a poor choice for the Phantom. I feel his voice just wasn't up to it and his emoting couldn't make up for it. He showed more emotional range in ""Attila"" and that's no complement,either. On the other hand, Minnie Driver practically stole the movie and that comes from both experience and star power. By the way, her voice is just as much a pleasant surprise here as Zellweger's and Zeta-Jones' were in Chicago. There should have been a few more like her in the cast.I enjoyed this movie, for the most part, and I'll see it again and I'll even buy it when it comes out. But, I'm a die-hard fan. Unlike the movie ""Chicago"", which surpassed the stage show, Phantom doesn't quite measure up. Then again, 80,000 people have seen the stage production and if they all see the movie, it will be very successful. I hope so, because I'd like to see more stage shows made into movies and it ain't gonna happen if they don't make money.",The Phantom of the Opera
641,swamp-5,One outstanding musical...now I understand it.,10,18 March 2006,"I have always liked The Phantom of the Opera, saw it on-stage but still had some confusion just how each part of the play fit into each act. However, after watching this I understand now how each section leads on the next. The sets are very well done as it the color contrasts evident on the DVD and the HD presentation on cable. The music is great as is the singing which is hard to note the dubbing or vocal enhancements. In my opinion the acting was very good. I've watched it many times and still enjoy the entire presentation...just like that of Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean,Empire Strikes Back and Batman Begins. Highly recommended,great with HD TV.",The Phantom of the Opera
642,pjgeerlings,Not to be confused with the stage play,6,25 December 2004,"The movie version of POTO is OK - nothing at all like the stage play which is IMO beyond compare. There are so many problems with Gerald Butler in the lead that it's best to avoid this topic. P. Wilson was almost adequate as Raoul. Of the principals, the standout was Ms. Rossum in the role of Christine; almost perfect - wonderful voice and a quite surprising acting ability.As has been stated elsewhere, Minnie Driver set the new standard for Carlotta - extraordinary!! My admittedly cynical view is that the movie version is intentionally hollow to boost ticket sale for the play - I know after seeing the movie I want to see the play again; it will be my 10th time seeing it in the theater ;)",The Phantom of the Opera
643,movieshopstuttga,If you have seen the musical you can skip the movie...,6,8 November 2004,"I saw this movie today in a press screening here in Stuttgart, Germany. I had seen the musical on stage in New York, London and Germany before and loved it. Well, the movie has everything the musical has - opulent sets and decorations and of course the marvelous Andrew Lloyd Webber score. But there is nothing more. Joel Schumacher - who has already almost killed the Batman franchise by turning for his entries from the previous dark BATMAN RETURNS into lollipop color adventure comedies In BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN - has nothing new to offer and sticks tightly to the scenes and to the dialog of the musical version - as if he was ordered to deliver a merchandise movie for the musical theater lobby kiosks. Emmy Rossum gave a strong and believable performance and Minnie Driver was just perfect for the role of the opera diva Carlotta. On the other side there is Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I don't want to compare him to the actors who have filled that character with life before - Lon Chaney, Claude Rains, Herbert Lom and even Michael Crawford on the musical stage. Butler acts so stiff as if he was more concentrating on the lyrics he has to sing and to reach certain tones. He could not make the audience feel any sympathy and pity for him.I watched the movie in it's original version and we were told by the distribution agent before the screening that all the actors sing on their own and are not dubbed. Again it was Emmy Rossum's Christine that stood out. And I must say that The Phantom was out of lip sync too many times.To come to a conclusion I say that this is a nice entertaining film for those who missed the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version on stage or could not afford to see it. It has the same music and the same lyrics. It should have come out a few years earlier when there was still a bigger demand for a movie version. I give it 6 out of 10 stars.",The Phantom of the Opera
644,schultz369,Excellent film adaptation of the play,10,24 December 2004,"I was captivated. The very familiar Andrew Lloyd Webber music was performed beautifully, both by the actors (or their voice-overs) and by the orchestra. The scenery and costumes were superb. The acting was quite good, although I thought Patrick Wilson's portrayal of Raul was a bit weak. Emmy Rossum was gorgeous and her voice was perfect for the role. I especially liked the flash-forward technique that used black and white to represent the future and color to represent the past ... sort of a flip-flop of the normal color scheme. Also, I thought the opening sequences were especially dramatic and set the tone for the whole film. Overall, I've always been a Phantom Phan and I loved the movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
645,johnrossiv,"You can't expect the magic of the stage, but a joyful ride nonetheless...",10,23 December 2004,"This was a beautiful recreation of the musical many have loved through the years. As with any movie, it had its flaws, but its ability to bring an honest recreation of the theater version we know and love ar outweighs those flaws. Depending on the version of the show you would see, with a different cast and a different location, there are bound to be differences. This brings us a glimpse of what Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted us to see way back in the 80s. I will give a ""blow by blow"" Emmy Rossum - I was thoroughly delighted with her singing and acting throughout. She was able to capture the innocence and naiveté of Christine perfectly. On stage, you cannot see the facial expressions of a character, and really, what was Sarah Brightman doing for 4 minutes during ""music of the Night""? Here, we see Emmy Rossum entranced by the Phantom, and she maintained that doe-eyed hypnotic feeling throughout the entirety of this scene, to which I say Bravo! She was absolutely striking in her beauty, and was well up to the task of this movie. I give her highest marks. Patrick Wilson - I was in love with Patrick,a nd I was in love with him even more after the movie. I never felt that Raoul's part was meaty enough, and while I still think that, I believe Patrick did an amazing job with what he had. His portion of ""All I ask of you"" made my heart swell, and wish he was singing it to me. Not for nothing, he did the best job on lipsynching on the overdubbed vocals. This man has raw talent. Many times in the live shows, the romantic leading man has a hard time coming off masculine; as many are played by gay men who take the sensitivity of romanticism and supercharge it - No one can doubt Patrick's machismo after seeing him in this movie; you just want to melt away in his arms. Gerard Butler - I guess since the movie is called ""The Phantom of the Opera"", I should feel that the person playing the phantom should be the strongest vocally, as was Michael Crawford. I found his voice to be uneven in that it has an abrasive, almost shouting quality until Music of the Night, when he softened it up, and showed he does have talent. Every now and again the loud and abrasive voice comes back to ""haunt us"", but the acting of Gerard balances this imperfection. Overall, as this is a musical, no matter how great he acted, I feel this was poor casting. Minnie Driver - Absolutely splendid. I never liked the character of Carlotta, and always skipped her vocals. Here, the ""camp factor"" that Minnie displays is a pure treat. Her character adds a raw humor that is welcome to the movie. She absolutely wowed me. Supporting cast - All stellar, with rare exception. Scenery - Brilliant colors, amazing cinematography. I agree with a previous reviewer in that a cinematography is well deserved. Flaws - Does anyone understand the whole ""keep your hand at the level of his eye"" part? That confused me and was not explained at all, yet mentioned several times. Also, Masquerade lacked the brilliance and sheen of the stage version. It came off as mechanical and fully staged, whereas other portions appear more organic.Overall, I feel that this was an amazing recreation of the show that I have loved for so many years. When I buy the soundtrack, I may skip over some of Gerard Butler's songs, but by the end of the movie, he had grown on me, so who knows, I may find myself listening to his parts on the soundtrack more often as well. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone that loved Phantom on stage - just know going in that you won't walk out of the theater with the same magical feeling that you did when you walked out of the stage version. I didn't feel it in Evita, or Chicago, and I didn't feel it here. But really, is it possible?",The Phantom of the Opera
646,alliwantisgerry,Great Movie!!,10,27 December 2004,I'm not crazy about musicals though I don't mind them. I've never seen the stage version and and very little knowledge of Phantom of the Opera. I knew the general idea of the story and some of the songs. It is great and would recommend it to anyone who loves musicals or doesn't mind them. I found the singing to be great and the production of the movie was excellent. The actors/actresses did a superb job. I want to go see this movie again. It runs over 2 hours but it picks up a pace and keeps moving. This is my absolute favorite movie. I'd give it a 10 out of 10. The soundtrack is great as well. I bought it after watching the movie and have listened to it a few times. So much so that I drove to work listening to the soundtrack and by the time I got to work I didn't want to shut the car off.,The Phantom of the Opera
647,regy1990,One of my favorite movies!,10,4 April 2006,"I thought the movie was excellent. I've only ever seen it once and there is a scene that is a little risqué, but it still moved me. After watching it, I was wishing that I knew all the songs so I could sing them, or that I at least had the soundtrack to listen to. It was one of those movies you are still excited about a week or two later, as if you had just seen it. One that you want to watch five more times that week so you can stay within that happy mesmerized state. The story is beautiful. There are so many elements to like about it. I would totally recommend that everyone watched it once, just so they know if they like it, because a summary alone isn't going to tell you enough. So good.",The Phantom of the Opera
648,green_leaf_girl,A brilliant job at bringing the stage to the screen.,9,11 November 2007,"I've been listening to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford sing Phantom literally since I was born, so I had exceedingly high expectations of this movie, and it did not disappoint. Emmy Rossum is a superb Christine, even if her singing can't quite compare with Brightman's, but let's face it, whose can? She portrayed Christine as an innocent child, not a take I'd seen since, so it gets more interesting all the time. Similarly, Gerald Butlet plays Erik (Phantom) as an evil genius, rather than a really insane man, which I loved, and suited him so well. His voice wasn't quite ""Angel of Music"" but it certainly was of a great quality and I very much enjoyed his singing. Minni Driver played a blustering, hilarious Carlotta, which added light to what could have been a very dark film. Patrick Wilson played a standard Raoul, but he was nevertheless a wonderful character, he made the focus go more onto the Phantom. Whether this was intentional or not, I'm not sure, but I loved it. He did, however, shine brilliantly at the end in the noose and would bring tears into even the most cynical audiences. Indeed, this is one of the two movies I've ever cried in. But that final, climatic scene was not only wonderful because of Wilson's acting. It was a mixture of Webber's perfect music, Wilson Butler and Rossum's wonderful singing chemistry and the sheer wonder of it all that makes it my favourite part of the movie. And what can I say about the music? Just listening to the soundtrack can bring tears to my eyes, such is Webber's talent. I don't think that audiences today are as focused on the music, and that's really what you have to do, rather than search for the story and characters among the few spoken lines. It's a pity really, because the music is what makes the film. I must admit that I would prefer to see it on stage, The Phantom of the Opera truly is a stage show. But Joel Schumacher truly has done a spectacular job at making a wonderful film, I'd watch it any day.",The Phantom of the Opera
649,Acanthophis,Great Movie!,10,28 May 2006,"I Loved the music, all but one of the actors did their own singing, which I think is great, in a day when even people paid millions to be professional singers don't do their own singing. However, the special effects left something to be desired. If you're going to do a movie as popular as Phantom of the Opera, you should at least go to the trouble to double check the continuity of the scenes and check the special effects before you put it in theaters. The acting was convincing, even the facial expressions were perfect. Some scenes were a little confusing, but I got them the second time. It was a little different from what I'd been expecting, but altogether far from disappointing, in fact, it was GREAT! I've watched it about 5 times since I got it 3 days ago, and I've been listening to the soundtrack nonstop.",The Phantom of the Opera
650,rik_mayall_fan8825,"Not necessarily underrated, but somehow under appreciated",10,22 July 2006,"I think I can honestly say this movie has quickly become one of my all time favourites. Before I saw it, all I knew of POTO was the main tune (and even then, only the Sarah Brightman version).I've read wonderful reviews on this movie, yet there seems to be a pattern in the dislikes and I felt that I had to critique it myself.I dribbled my drink down my front in amazement when the dusty theatre suddenly went back into time to its previous splendour, so amazed was I at the grandeur and the way the imagery of the gold figures and the music seemed to come to life. From the very beginning I was captivated.This movie is rich with visuals. It seems that Schumacher wanted no eye to go hungry.The cast had some exceptional performances and some that could have been better. Most of them weren't for reasons that ruined the movie for me. Ciarán Hinds as Firmin had a voice that seemed to cower behind the mightier and more skilled vocals of his partner, Andre. This is notable in the song ""Prima Donna"" when you listen to the pleasant harmony of them singing together, then Andre's lovely voice on its ownthen Firmin's voice, which is lacklustre in comparison.I admit  and will probably be lynched for the opinion  that I did not like Raoul. Not because I'm a Phantom supporter (though I am!), but other reasons. His VOICE is perfect  syrupy, romantic, promising and rich  completely aristocratic and everything a young girl like Christine would want. However, the actor himself I found to be quite wooden. When hearing the emotion that enters the vocals when Christine or the Phantom sing, Raoul's pleasant but unfeeling voice seems as out of place as a gorilla on a penny-farthing. The only time something akin to soul entered his voice was at the end during ""Down Once More"", but even then the attention is grabbed by the other two stars.The character who did make me consider putting the movie at 9 stars is Minnie Driver as Carlotta. Oh, she is very good at playing the diva and I don't dismiss her for the fact that she didn't sing her own opera  it's better to have someone who can play a good diva with a voice-over than to choose an opera singer with not much else in the talent department. It was her talking voice that actually upset me. While I'm sure it helped convey her character, in a film where music is paramount it is NOT wise for a character to give you a headache. Her performance should have been toned down just a little.The most confusing thing I've heard in reviews is that everyone loved Emmy Rossum as Christine, but didn't like Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Some of the people I have asked about this have said that it's the Phantom's voice they didn't like, while Christine was ""excellent"".I don't agree. For someone so young and who hasn't had official opera training since childhood, Emmy Rossum did VERY well. But maybe it was because I'm so used to the powerful lungs of Sarah Brightman that I found myself spotting flaws in Emmy's performance. Several times when sliding to a high note, I noticed that her voice would quiver and sometimes change note completely before changing back. At first I thought I was hearing things, but my dad backed me up. Maybe it's because she's quivering with emotion  who knows? I just wish it hadn't happened on the high notes! Gerard Butler has been horribly underrated and, in some cases, slandered. Owen Glieberman of Entertainment Weekly said: ""The Scottish actor Gerard Butler, by contrast, exudes little charisma beneath his mask, and he sings like a Meat Loaf stuffed with too much garlic. He's too roaringly ''overpowering'' in the Broadway manner to invite us into the Phantom's exquisite torment."" I feel this is very unfair. I am not sure what people expected from the Phantom  running around screaming about his 'torment', doing theatrics worthy of pantomime and being completely unsubtle? And please do not tell me criticisms stem from his diction? Gerard Butler did indeed perform in a role that was a giant step which was probably out of his bounds. But he did well, and people shouldn't dispute that. The Phantom had a certain charisma, yes  but through his songs. The Phantom himself never really had much confidence because no matter how much he wanted Christine, his deformity was always foremost in his mind and for all his hope, he never actually felt Christine could love him.His singing was wonderful considering he is untrained  during ""Music of the Night"" he hit notes that made my diaphragm shrink in sympathy. And, unlike other characters, he achieved something not many actors have been able to  he achieved emotion in his singing. You get the feeling he feels what the Phantom does, and by the end of the movie it could break your heart. If people are upset because his accent thickens his voice sometimes, they choose the wrong thing to criticise in the wrong musical.This movie isn't just about music, or visuals. It's a story about a man who had confidence in his voice but not himself. A person broken by people who, even if he had won the woman he loved, could never have kept her because of all his neuroses. This is a story about a man who could have had everything (just watch him with Christine in ""Point of No Return""  she was his) but lost it all because he had no faith in her to see beyond his face, and because he was too damaged from his experiences to ever truly let go.",The Phantom of the Opera
651,DMEdolph43,Glad I saw it but utterly disappointed,6,23 December 2004,"Let me preface this by saying the Phantom of the Opera was one of my favorite musicals and I could most likely recite every single verse although I am not in anyway blind to the repetitiveness, over dramatic undertones etc. Say that this movie is beautiful, Joel has given it his all here but you can clearly see that Webber was in complete control of the baby that made him a legend. About 90 percent of the actual play put to screen, copy/paste style and what people are forgetting here is that what might be great in a theater is not always so in a movie. One can actually feel when ACT one ends and want to stray outside for intermission but Alas no this is movie and there are no breaks in movies. To be honest the very thought that you can take a musical and mime it to the screen and not cast actors with the ability to be actual Broadway veterans is not only mean it is insulting to the actors that starve away in NY with a chance to use their talents on the stage. That said, the actors give it there all but movie actors are not singers and lack the ability to mouth/sing things and make it their own. Minnie Driver has the best performance in the entire show. Emme tries her best and succeeds in driving the movie but lacks the passion and the range to convey a character made famous by Sarah Brightman. The phantom is completely miscast and angered me, although I think Butler is an amazing actor because towards the end there is actual chemistry between him and Rossum. Wilson can be forgotten but tried to play a part that, to be honest, is never a staring or showpiece role. This movie is breathtaking but the spectacle brings you out of the movie. I found myself asking how it could be that bright in the sewers of Paris, what the ** a horse is doing there and (the worst thing of all) Why the *@$ are people voguing?????? The poor editor tried valiantly to hide the horrible choreography but it rears its ugly head like Zit. This movie could have been an easy Oscar contender but instead will be forgotten in 3 weeks. We must remember that it is a very difficult thing to make a musical especially when most of the people who succeeded in making them in the golden era are dead and if you notice the people who make them work started or have their roots deeply in theater.",The Phantom of the Opera

When I heard that a movie version was coming out, I did not expect it to be as wonderful as the show, so I decided not to watch it when the movie came out 2 years ago. Then for some reason when it came out on video, I was curious so I rented it. It was definitely better than I expected. Emmy Rossum is wonderful in this movie. Her voice is absolutely magical. From the first moment I heard her voice, I became a fan. Nobody else could have played this part for the movie. Now I wish that I had the opportunity to see the movie on the big screen.

I loved it from the start, the whole thing is unimaginably brilliant, the acting, the singing and the phantom. I was entranced by the music and know have all of it on my i-pod, even if it is out of place with the my chemical romance tracks and all the other metal and rock music. Earlier this month i went to see the stage show, it was magnificent, i can't say if it was better than the film but it was damn close! The phantom of the opera is easily my favourite film of all time and sad as it is i do watch it almost every day, i have the phantom as a screen-saver and a collection of phantom masks. Honestly I'm not obsessed. After seeing this movie Gerard Butler became my favourite actor, he is the greatest actor of all time! and in my opinion the most handsome as well!",The Phantom of the Opera
655,bw-50712,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,9,15 October 2021,"I saw the stage version in 1994, so it was not the original cast. Christine is supposed to be drawn to her ""darkest dreams"" (as the Phantom sings in Music of the NIght). Ok, Gerard Butler doesn't have the singing chops of Michael Crawford, but he brings the sexy ""bad boy"" to the role. On film, you can see the emotions more clearly than on stage, which is why I liked Butler in this role..you see his pain, love, obsession, etc. Not a perfect film, but very entertaining.",The Phantom of the Opera
656,Kathryn_128,"Entirely beauteous, and proves there is more than one way to present this magnificent musical",10,2 January 2007,"This film was awesome, in every sense of the word. For many, this was the only opportunity they had to experience The Phantom of the Opera, and it does not disappoint.This movie is one of the few where I think there was not a single mis-cast person. Not a one. I know, I can already hear people screaming that Gerard Butler can't sing, but I don't believe that's true. His voice, while not technically flawless, is powerful and touching and betrays everything the Phantom is feeling. I think that's really important for such a complex, heartbreaking character as our Phantom, and Emmy Rossum fulfilled everything Christine should ever be. Sweet, pious, loving, brave and a wonderful singer. I don't understand why people have it in for her. Raoul, while possessing a RIDICULOUS haircut, was a perfect lyric tenor, and played his part excellently, becoming actually way attractive once he got a little wet and had done some fighting. Carlotta was the humour in the story, and Minnie Driver, always talented, did not disappoint. Jennifer Ellison was fine for her small part, and was nothing outstanding, but didn't let the cast down, and even did her own ballet! The set is one of the most opulent and rich I have ever seen, with gold and red velvet everywhere, a real Gothic architectural masterpiece enclosing our story, and it's used to SUCH good effect. For instance, the Phantom's lair, with its complex traps, and yet aquamarine beauty struck us as the centre of the Phantom's pain, and the angel on the rooftop he cursed Christine and Raoul from created a major turning point in the storyline.Another thing I noticed was that Gerard Butler contains a HUGE amount of sex appeal as the Phantom, especially in The Point of No Return. That's the best change, in my opinion, from some of the stage musicals, as there, he's often portrayed as an old, fat, ugly paedophile. In my opinion, this left the audience never in doubt of who Christine was going to choose. However, in the movie, if you didn't already know what would happen, seeing the sword fight and the Phantom's singing/performance, especially in PoNR, with its sexy, aggressive lyrics, (and the equally so costume!) made you see that the Phantom was actually viable competition for Raoul. Raoul is Christine's romantic awakening, whereas, with the way the Phantom looks and acts, Raoul is NOT her sexual awakening, which is clearly the Phantom's job here.The fact that Christine's decision is actually A DIFFICULT ONE in the movie made all the difference, and this combined with a wonderful cast, almost all of whom did their own singing, a drop dead gorgeous set, wondrous costumes, dazzling special effects and staying true to the heartrending tragedy of the original musical have created a masterpiece.",The Phantom of the Opera

So they had some technical difficulties with them matching the words and music together,but so what? It's still a great movie.My friend saw the musical,and the movie and she said somethings were slightly different,but it was still okay.What I think probably made people so mad was that Gerald sounded like a male super model trying to sing and etc. but to me he did an excellent job.So did everyone else.Jennifer Ellison was okay but she only had two singing parts.Miranda Richardson was not bad at all either.I mean everyone looks at the bad things,why not the good?All in all,this movie will be a timeless classic your family we'll enjoy.So get the tissue and the popcorn ready,because you'll want to see it again and again.",The Phantom of the Opera
658,Iavas_Saar,"Beautiful, powerful, romantic film",10,22 December 2004,"I have been waiting for a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most moving piece of work for many years. And tonight, the time finally came to see it on the big screen. Did it translate well? In virtually every area, a very enthusiastic YES! And it even went places the stage show never went, that gave the story even more depth and resonance. The final scene of the film, which was never part of the stage show, is one of the most beautiful and poetic moments of cinema I've ever seen. It makes the film end on such a sublime note, that I would have thought anyone unsure about the film up to that point would leave the theatre with a more positive vibe.The only aspect of the movie that didn't live up to my expectations was the level of emotion of the final lair sequence - stage actors I've seen have given it a lot more than Butler, and make me cry nearly every time - I would have liked Butler to really let loose and scream and sob his heart out, it was a little too controlled and didn't move me as much as I hoped (but the mirror smashing was an awesome addition). Apart from that, I thought the actors did a brilliant job - Butler made for an appealing, sensual Phantom, Rossum was simply superb as Christine, and Wilson made Raoul much more likable than he is on stage. All the supporting cast were great, especially Driver.I have to give so much credit to the technical side of the movie - the sets, costumes, cinematography etc. all combine to create a truly sumptuous feel. And Schumacher turned out to be a great choice for director. He gave the piece energy, without ever over-killing on it (a la Moulin Rouge). Some of his visions will haunt me for a long time to come, such as the ""sculpted angels"" in the graveyard - exquisite. Or the heavenly light in the chapel when Emmy sings ""Twisted every way"". In short, the film has given me moments of cinematic beauty I never expected, and I will be seeing this many times over the next few weeks.10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
659,lunam217,Awesome movie inspired on the best musical ever!,10,26 February 2007,"I must say that this is my favorite movie of all time. When I went to watch it, I didn't knew anything about the actors/singers, about the story, about the book or even about Andrew Lloyd Webber! It was a long time ago. I have never seen the stage show, but I searched on youtube and on the DVD's extras (I bought it, of course) for Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. I don't think that what people say it's true: yes, Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford sing very well, but Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum sing very well too. They are just different. I prefer Gerard and Emmy, because they're younger - Christine has a lot of innocence, and Sarah Brightman didn't look like an innocent girl - and because I think Gerard's voice fits perfectly on the Phantom - Michael Crawford's voice was too much sweet. I just think there's one thing wrong with this film: Gerard Butler looks too much handsome - his face should be more deformed, not so clean. The Point of No Return was one of the best scenes in the film - better than in the musical. It was one of the sexiest scenes I have ever seen on the cinema. I just couldn't stop watching to it when I bought the DVD. Watch this, it's AWESOME!",The Phantom of the Opera
660,fett012000,Great movie! Critics are nuts,8,3 March 2005,"Not to copy any of my predecessors, let me first say that I was apprehensive on seeing the movie after I read various reviews, and listened to the words of critics. As a fan of the musical, their words were disheartening. But, when several friends told me how great it was, I decided to see it and watch it with an open mind ""Blown away"" are the two words that best describe the experience. The opening scene of the presents morphing into the past gave me chill-bumps. The cinematography was beautiful, capturing the grittiness of the theatre world and the vibrant colors of the stage.Emmy Rossum, although young in her voice and acting, proved that she had earned her place as Christine in a crystal clear and moving version of "" Think of Me"".Patrick Wilson proved competent in his role, though I must confess that I have little use for the "" pretty boy "" character in most films. Looking beyond that however, he brings the over-confidence that a male of that time possessed.Finally, on to the The Phantom: Gerard Butler. While I am slightly biased of his performance because I am such an fan, I don't think anyone could have played the character better. For people who don't have experience singing, they cannot possibly know how difficult it is to express extreme emotion while performing...singing or not. Mr. Butler achieves both. True, he is very nice eye-candy and every woman watching the film is sure to swoon over the sexy bad-boy. But more than that, The Phantom is not the easiest of roles to act, and for a man who had no previous vocal training to crank out a performance like that is damn near amazing. I mean come on! To round out the cast are phenomenal supporting characters: Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson to name a few.Joel Schumaucher totally redeems himself for ""Batman and Robin"". I was delightfully surprised.True die hards of the musical are sure to complain. I mean, the chandelier does fall at the end instead of the beginning. But who cares? "" Chicago "" didn't feature all the songs and changed dramatically from the stage version, but it was still a great movie.My recommendation...Fans---see it with an open mind, Regular movie goers-----enjoy!",The Phantom of the Opera
661,windamgirl,My heart hurts!,1,9 January 2005,"I have seen the stage performance of Phantom six times, so I was understandably ecstatic when I heard that the film was finally, after almost fifteen years of anticipation, being produced. I had also liked Emmy Rossum in the Day After Tomorrow, although she looks about 25 to me and thus a bit too old for Christine. But I was prepared to let the age thing roll off my back.Unfortunately, I was not prepared to let the utter lack of anything remotely redeemable about this production roll off my back.The original novel by Gaston Leroux was a searing portrait of the world of the theatre at the turn of the century, filled with every bit of detail you could wish for. The Phantom, in turn, was a character so vividly painted by Leroux that every time I read the book I fell in love with him all over again. After all, he is supposed to be the Angel of Music.Apparently no one attached to the film seemed to realize this, as the Phantom in the movie was simply twisted and creepy and not once did I think, ""Sod-all, I'd take a midnight ride through the dark sewers with you and love you forever!"" At no point in the film did the humanization of the Phantom as a tortured, brooding artistic genius come to life the way that it does in both the book and the stage version. Plus, really, if Butler couldn't hit all the notes, you'd think that they would lower the key. And the mask was wrong. And Gerard Butler is freakin' hot until he takes the mask off, revealing a mass of deformities -- only someone in script supervision didn't pay attention, because that mask would SO NOT cover all of the prosthetic ugly-face stuff they put on him.Raoul was a little prick in the film, too. I mean, he's a prat in the stage version, but in the film I didn't feel sorry for him at all. And the end -- I'm sorry, WHAT? Let's just change the ENTIRE POINT of the story by changing the end? What were they thinking? I am so disappointed in this attempt. Except for Minnie Driver, who can't ever do anything badly because she's so awesome, this movie stank the big one. Seriously, I have to wonder if AL Webber isn't going a bit dodgy in the grey matter, if he allowed this to happen to his greatest work.Perhaps if Schumacher had spent a little more time trying to put the life into the characters that is present in the stage version, instead of just worrying about their singing, I wouldn't have had to suffer almost three hours of wonderful music but crap storyline, mannequin acting, the absence of characters I might have been able to give a flying sod about, and the sad, sad experience of walking away from seeing Phantom of the Opera without being completely in love.And then, the Golden Globe nominations. I have now lost all faith in whoever it is that decides THAT.

One more thing, the old man and woman make up at the begging is just so obvious... I am sure with the budget they had, they could have chosen more appropriate voices and actors for some parts.

I have never seen it on stage nor in any of its manifestations on film. Nor have I read the book. Of course, I know a lot of the basic plot because the story is so much a part of our subconscious. So let me say this: I am not sure if it is the movie or the story in general, but I was deeply, deeply moved by The Phantom of the Opera. Maybe the movie stinks to those who know the story very well and can see the inconsistencies with the plot, singing, staging, etc. But this was my first experience with the story and I loved it. You can chalk it up to the greatness of the story if you like, but I think that the movie had something to do with it as well. I walked out of the theatre knowing I had seen something great.

I guess the audience and critics alike have gotten used to the stage actors in the original line-up of this musical that they didn't notice the wonderful performance of the cast in this movie adaptation. To tell you the truth, Gerard Butler's voice may not be as powerful as the original actor on the stage version but his voice, matching with his acting, is nevertheless, as cold and haunting as the character shows (yes! I must say he's got one effective voice). Emily Rossum's portrayal of Christine is very good although I would have like to see more depth of her character. Patrick Wilson is ravishingly good looking (it's just the hair that makes him look like Ronan Keating of an Irish boy band) and Minnie Driver is a good comic relief without looking trying hard.

The songs are so powerful, so emotional, and so touching that they will stay with you long after you watch the movie. This is a movie for everyone, and it's more than a sappy romance story.

I've seen it so many times but i never seem to get tired of it.Its that great! Christine ( Emmy Rossum) sings beautiful and can really act. I love her singing and when Raoul joins in with her it sounds awesome. The phantom was great in his part too with his voice and act. It kept me going with all the interesting scenes. Oh and the beginning where the phantom and madame giry flashback was a very good idea. Loved the music (their voices were fantastic) and the idea of this movie! You should really see this movie ASAP if you haven't seen it yet. You will fall in love with it.,The Phantom of the Opera
668,CassieBrite,My thoughts,9,22 December 2004,"This movie was absolutely wonderful. I love the black-and-white ""present day"" photography. It totally makes the past, or Raoul's memory, more vivid and fantastic. I enjoyed the by-play between Raoul and Meg (not her Mom, see end comments) during the auction and throughout the other glimpses of the present throughout the movie.I knew this was going to be a great movie when I first saw Carlotta (Minnie Driver) on the stage in that ridiculous make-up, singing those ridiculous lines from Hannibal. La Carlotta always was such a flamboyant character in my memory, and to see how ridiculous it could get acted out by such a wonderful actress made her character more real to me.I think that Gerard Butler was an excellent choice for the Phantom. Why, you ask? Because he brought his own interpretation to the character. Everyone online seems to be screaming ""Michael Crawford is the only Phantom we want,"" but I must say that they should give Butler a chance. I have read in many places that Crawford ""became"" rather than played the Phantom, and I would argue that Butler does the same. It is obvious through the work that you see in this film that he is quite an accomplished actor, and he brings a youthful desire and intensity to the character of the Phantom that I have never seen before (and I have seen two separate productions--NYC in 1999 and London (John Owen Jones!) in 2004). The disfigurement was much more real for me, seeing that it was truly a strong birthmark rather than the ""gray skin, ugly"" stuff we see in the musical production. It makes me wonder: If the Phantom was real, and was born in modern day instead, what would he be able to accomplish as an architect, designer, musician, and writer? The Point of No Return scene was absolutely wonderful--very sensual and dark, and the acting was superb. I think the decision to give the Phantom the black mask instead of the cowl/hood that hides the face was a poor design choice. I know that they wanted to show the Phantom's eyes (gorgeous intensity!), but the idea of keeping it a secret that Piangi's dead and it's really the Phantom singing with Christine was a major part of the scene for me. I think it could have been better if the hood/cowl had been used and the Phantom imitated Piangi's accent for the first part of the song (like JOJ does).Another thing that I have to complain about is that by the end of the confrontations in the Lair, when Christine and Raoul are finally leaving, I had a different feeling than I did at the end of the musical. I actually wanted Raoul and Christine together, and felt that the Phantom should be ""tracked down"" and put into prison for his crimes (murder, etc...). At the end of the musical, I always felt Christine made the wrong decision, and that Meg would have a chance to follow in her footsteps, but ""poor Phantom"" would never have what he truly deserved and desired. The musical blinded me to the fact that the Phantom had murdered (twice!) because you never see him actually commit the crime, but the film affords the audience the opportunity to see him tighten the noose around both Buquet and Piangi (of course, three victims in the movie). AND the entire Opera house catching fire from the chandelier tends to make me a little more opposed to the Phantom's cause. (By the way, that fire stuff was GREAT---of course the chandelier would be lit by candles, and when it falls, it would spread the fire, duh! That never made it into the musical.) However, when we think back to seeing Meg at the auction (first scene---no way that could be her Mom, it's 50 years after the season at the opera that started all this, it's got to be Meg. People didn't live that long, and her Mom would have been 80 years old if she had survived!), we can think... ""did Meg bid on the music box for the Phantom, but give it up for Raoul's sake?"" The mirror imagery was wonderful, too. Going through the mirror in Christine's room, the mirrors in the Phantom's Lair, the mirror room below the grand staircase, the mirror from Raoul's carriage reflecting Meg on the steps of the Opera house... the use of water as a mirror in the confrontation (the Lair) was one of my expectations, once I saw the heavy use of mirrors in the first part of the film, but I guess it's okay that it got passed on.In conclusion, the last scene made the whole movie worth it (besides the awesome music throughout! FINALLY a modern MUSICAL to see in the movies!) because of the rose imagery. Just knowing that the Phantom had been there before Raoul could get there suggests in my eyes that the Phantom never stopped trying to be better than Raoul... and I'd like to think that the ribbon was the original one the Phantom tied to Christine's rose all those long years before.",The Phantom of the Opera
669,morgbsbll,Review of the movie Phantom from a stage persons perspective.,5,9 January 2005,"I am a very critical person; and I have had Phantom memorized and ingrained in my head for years I will now give my review: The staging and filming of the movie where perfect. The cinematography was magnificent and the visuals were stunning. The costumes; magnificent. And the chorus was beautifully placed and choreographed (the best example of this being ""Masquerade"").Patrick Wilson was cast perfectly as Raoul. He was practically flawless. Bravo to him, and to Webber and Schumacher to have the taste enough to use him.Emmy Rossum was much better than I had anticipated. She has a delightful voice. However it was easy to tell that she is 17. I would love to hear her sing Christine again when she is 30 for it would be almost perfect. But at 17 there were holes in her performance. Overall I enjoyed her and she exceeded my expectations; alas she did not sound like the greatest musical genius alive had instructed her.Minnie Driver as Carlotta was cute and funny, but I still wish that they had filmed the woman that they recorded vocally.Andre and Firmin were funny, but I wish they had been better singers. They where good enough though.Meg, Giry, Piangi and the other supporting roles my hat's off to. They did delightfully.Gerard Butler; the Phantom himself. Well for a man who had never sung once before in his life very good. For the character of the Phantom not even close to good enough. The basis of the character is that there is no greater talent on earth in music and architecture. He did not have the voice that the Phantom requires. His acting was good, but not enough to compensate for his vocal failings. And his deformities were far too minimal. In the stage version he is hideous (part of the scull showing, almost no nose, sunken in eye etc). But in the film he just looked like he had been burned by some acid; not near horrid enough.My biggest complaint with the film however lies in the Chandelier. Why on earth was the dropping of the chandelier moved to the end of the film! It is meant to be dropped at the close of act one; not near the end of act two. The move added nothing to the story. In fact it detracted if you ask me for there was no inspiration for the Phantom to disappear for six months only to reappear at the ball. Why would this change be made? It makes no sense. And in all truthfulness really hacked me off! The other changes in the show did not hurt it. The change of a verse here, the drop of a recitative there, the adding of orchestrations occasionally were fine. But the damn chandelier.I have seen the stage version on national tour and on West End in London. And this film, while good, is not half of what the stage version is. On a scale of 1-10 I would give the film a 5.5. Good not good enough.",The Phantom of the Opera

The lead male voices are not as strong as previously portrayed, as well, Schumacher makes bold choices of which some may disapprove. Anyone who disliked MOULIN ROUGE, or the more recent CHICAGO, will likely fall circumspect to the new PHANTOM.Anytime a project is transferred from one medium to another (stage to film) changes are evident and often demanded. Try to remember the last time you saw a film as good as the original book. Different mediums can and do dictate changes. Changes are not altogether bad, particularly with the film version of PHANTOM.Joel Schumacher's challenge was to create the same story without losing the intensity that the Broadway production so wonderfully achieved. Though the film fails in respect to some degree, the artful direction captivates the senses with lavish scenes and articulate cinematography. Look for a possible Academy Award nomination in this category.Gerard Butler plays the tormented and disfigured Phantom with sophistication and an edge. The childhood playmate and current love interest of Christine is played by Patrick Wilson adequately. Newcomer, Emmy Rossum is a delight as Christine, the confused young chorus girl torn between memories of her long dead father and the present day devoted Phantom. Her innocence fits superbly and her voice will overwhelm. Perhaps the most surprising cast choice was Minnie Driver as the opera's resident diva. An over-the-top performance to be sure, and awkward at times, but still fun to experience. Even with a cast of largely unknowns, the music and the crescendos are not lost. For romantics that appreciate the music of the night and the craft of movie making - a resounding 8 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
671,broadwaybaby2,must see it again!,10,11 January 2005,"I have read so many arguments and discussions about why this movie will be bad, why the play is so wonderful, etc. And I have to say that you are all crazy. I thought that it was amazing. I thought that it was extremely similar to the play version, except for it contained greater detail and scenery. I read people's comments about tiny differences between the movie and the play and it blows my mind. Of course it is not exactly the same, a movie has a completely different medium than a theater setting, and I think that they did a wonderful job. The transitions are amazing, and the singing fits seamlessly into the storyline. It's not one of those, ""Um, why are they singing?"" type of situations, it fits. Also I think that the actors who were chosen fit the characters perfectly. I did not know anything about any of the actors except Patrick Wilson because he was on Broadway, but Gerard Butler completely blew me away. He was breathtaking. His voice was both beautiful and powerful. And he was um, hot. I had never really thought of the Phantom as a sexy character but wow, ""The Point of No Return."" I turned to my friend who was seeing the movie with me and all she said was ""is it getting hot in here?"" So as you've probably guessed from the first part of the review I definitely recommend this movie. I have seen it three times and I am definitely going to have to see it again. And for all you hardcore theater fans, it really is a lot like the play, the score is only missing, I think, two of the original songs, and the storyline follows the plot of the play almost exactly. If you are a fan of musicals you will definitely enjoy this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

The movie I felt was one of the best I have ever seen and I have seen all of the phantom films.Yes I'm that old.(but I wear well) Gerard Butler has one of the most thrilling persona's I have come across in a long time .Not only is he beautiful but he portrays a depth of acting that is rare in this age, He obviously gives a lot of thought to what he is doing.He became the phantom. His passion in his voice had me in tears. Maybe I felt a little personal about him as I am also a Scorpio and I know we give 100% and a Celt (welsh). Dear Frankie was also a piece of pure pleasure. Dracula 2001,my daughter Sarah thought the same as I fantastic( she is very analytical.trainee solicitor)I am looking forward to the 300 film and I know that Priest will be another one to enjoy.Thank you Mr Butler you have restored my faith in the acting profession.I wish you the best of luck,and thank you.",The Phantom of the Opera

When I heard the movie was coming out, I was thrilled, of course I thought Michael Crawford would play the part. When I found out he was not, I thought, well, the music will still be there, lets wait and see. I had never heard of Gerard Butler, I have to admit, I was curious. When I did see the movie I was not disappointed. I thought he was wonderful as the Phantom. He brought a new dimension to the role, he was forceful, and he was also pitiful when he had to be. Another movie now added to my huge collection, the music is just breathtaking. I also thought Emmy did a wonderful job as Christine. I loved the whole thing!",The Phantom of the Opera

I own it and have watched it way too many times to count and I still love it so much! Gerard Butler does the most amazing job as the Phantom. His voice can go so many levels and every time he sings, it just send shivers down my spine. Emmy Rossum is also amazing in this movie...I love it when actors/actresses that you have NO idea can do anything but act come out and show their other talent.This movie is so amazing. and you will cry. I never cry and I Cry. Every time. So bring Kleenex or maybe just a long sleeve shirt to wipe your tears on.If you are not a fan of musicals, then I guess this film isn't for you.

676,kimandco,"Beautiful, engaging, wonderful movie!",10,23 January 2005,"This is the first time I have seen an ALW production and DIDN'T sit there at the end thinking, ""This man is smoking some weird stuff!"" I usually find his music to extremely enjoyable but have always found the actual productions they were from to be weird or boring. I so looked forward to seeing ""Cats"" after hearing the music, then I was highly disappointed with the show.POTO however, was absolutely amazing, intriguing, beautiful and satisfying. I have seen comments on this board where people said the actors' voices weren't strong enough--that is rubbish!!! Their voices were wonderful, strong and joyful to listen to.The only negative comment I have about the actors is that the Phantom was much better at singing lines than saying them. The sets, costumes, and scenes were breath-taking! Any woman that wouldn't melt for Raol or the Phantom's lair, just isn't even alive!I wish there had been a little more ""enchantment"" to the movie when it came to the Phantom's lair. It was beautiful, but little touches (like the candle holders on the wall moving) were good and there should have been more magical touches like that throughout the whole movie.Overall, it was a wonderful movie --from beginning to end was full of enchantment and awe!I will probably see it again on the big screen and I will definitely buy the DVD!",The Phantom of the Opera
677,sunshiner_75,Wonderful Adaptation,10,14 January 2005,"This being my favorite musical, I was both excited and worried about this film. Will the actors live up to stage version and the performances I have seen? (4 in total = 1 in Phoenix, AZ., 1 in San Francisco, CA. and 2 in New York, NY.) I was definitely pleased. The film version touches on parts of the story you can't get in the stage production, gives a nice twist and gives you a better, more close of view of the actors. Let me be the first to say that Gerard Butler is not only handsome, a great actor, but a wonderful singer! I loved it. I would see it again and I would DEFINITELY recommend it. Don't expect it to be anything but a musical, with an entirely sung script!",The Phantom of the Opera
678,jennkat1,Magnificent film version of the stage show.,10,3 January 2005,"In many ways watching this on film was better then the stage. The biggest reason is I didn't have to worry about were I was sitting or if I could see or hear what was going on. Also for the first time I got how sensual the phantom is supposed to be. Gerard was awesome. I know critics are going to compare him to Michael Crawford in the singing department, but for someone who is not a professional singer, he did awesome. Emmy was excellent as Christine, and the actor playing Raul sounded perfect. Miss Driver was superb as Carlotta. I did notice a few small things taken out, but the scenes and dialog that was added made the movie feel more complete. It was a magnificent production to watch and I hope that others feel the way I do.",The Phantom of the Opera
679,penneyn,Very Good,10,12 May 2005,"This version of the Phantom is a feast for the eyes, with lush glittering sets, and wonderful special effects. Gerard Butler is excellent in his portrayal of the Phantom. In my opinion, though, he has only an adequate singing voice... he is definitely no Michael Crawford.I felt that the Phantom's disfigurement was not sufficient enough to provoke the kind of horror that would cause people to fear him; however, making Gerry Butler ugly would be a challenge to even the best make-up artist.While Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs are always top notch -- I adore 'Music of the Night', ""All I Ask of You' and 'Masquerade' -- I felt that there were places in the film that could have been better served with plain dialog rather than singing.All in all a very good rendition of an excellent play.",The Phantom of the Opera
680,brenring,"If you loved the play, avoid the movie",2,30 December 2004,"Do not go to this movie if you loved the play. The acting and singing is inferior to any production I have seen of Phantom of the Opera. Gerard Butler is too young for the role. He does not have the proper range, magnetism, or singing voice for this role. The powers that be chose to minimize the Phantom's disfigurement. In the movie, the Phantom's mask hid all signs of disfigurement; The rest of his face was completely smooth. This left me feeling like the Phantom had no disfigurement worth mentioning and that he chose to hide in the opera house because he was an arrogant and petulant psycho. Emmy Rossum as Christine seemed to be asleep during the whole movie. Perhaps the directors wanted her to appear overwhelmed. Her voice was more animated then she ever was. The only decent actor (of the three leads) was Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul. The music, however, is great and the staging is faithful to the play. If you are only a casual fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, give the movie a try. Perhaps you won't mind the director's choices. If you loved the play, avoid the movie at all costs.",The Phantom of the Opera
681,thill7,Faithful and Satisfying Adaptation,10,23 December 2004,"When I listened to the soundtrack CD prior to seeing the film, I was disappointed with Gerard Butler's Phantom. However he has such a compelling physical presence here that he comes off quite well and, along with an impressive Emmy Rossum (as Christine), manages to carry the film. The two principal supporting players, Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver, are less impressive --- particularly Wilson after his strong performance in ""Angels in America."" All in all, I found the film to be a faithful and satisfying adaptation of the original stage musical. I think anybody who liked the stage show will also like the film. On the other hand, people who do not like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music (and I know it is fashionable among the lemmings of the critical world to dismiss him) will of course not appreciate the film, but then they will probably not be attending anyway.For me, it was a glorious 143 minutes, and I will be seeing it again.",The Phantom of the Opera

No, he doesn't have a trained stage voice; but he did train like hell to be able to pull off the character of the Phantom as JS and ALW wanted him for this film. He is a powerful, sexy, physical and sympathetic phantom and I applaud him. I have never been so moved by anyone in a film as I was by Butler as the Phantom. Bravo! I've seen it 4 times since Christmas Eve, and I'm sure I'll see it 4 more times before it leaves the big screen. The soundtrack CD is with me always--I even work out to it in the gym.

683,jamain_villa,so lovely!!,10,1 January 2010,"This movie is probably one of the best musical/movie I've ever seen!! the experience was incredible! i may not be a broad way or a fan of the musical; I've seen some of the old phantom of the opera clips where sarah brightman and michael crawford was in it, and I have to say even though they seem to be the original people portraying the characters i like Emmy rossum and Gerard Butler better!! Emmy Rossums voice is just so beautiful, magnificent, and superb. Also her looks brings the character to its full potential! its innocent look just make me want to hug her! if i were a guy Ill be totally in love with her!! When i saw Sarah being Christine Daae i was like you gotta be kidding me her voice is to strong and nasally that she cant be this innocent and lost girl! i just don't see Sarah as Christine! no offense to the people who thinks the other way around but Emmy fits the role!! and as for Mr. Gerard Butler he did a very very awesome job!!! he just made me fall in love with the phantom AND him!! he had touched me so deeply that it made me want the phantom to end up with Christine!! I mean Micheal crawford voice is beautiful and it can reach the high notes but Gerards voice have this deep, dark, sexy, and emotional edge to it that it made his character so real! gosh!! Im so in love with him right now!! his performance was incredible!!

684,t6lem,Beautiful.,9,7 January 2005,"There is only one word to describe this movie, BEAUTIFUL. I sat in the theater with a tiny smile on my face that lasted the entire film. The movie is 2 hours and 27 minutes long. That is probably the longest I have ever smiled. If you liked the movie Moulin Rouge then be prepared for this movie to blow it out of the water. The director has such vision. The opening scenes are magnificent, creating an out of this world experience. A scene where they are lifting a chandelier into the air and spanning across the theater made me want to lift out of my seat. I felt like a kid in a candy store, my eyes alight at all the wonder. There was a secretive seductive quality to the phantom that I found most intriguing. The characters were brilliantly portrayed and I feel that the story was well told. Gerard Butler's voice seems a bit raw and untrained, but it's quite sexy. Minnie Driver does an incredible job and brings a sense of humor to a somewhat serious movie. Emmy Rossum brings an innocence to the film that is unparalleled by any other actress. I have always felt that the actress picked for the role of Christine has seemed a little too old to be playing a 16 year old girl, but Emmy does a fantastic job. Her voice is innocent and melodious. I truly enjoyed every aspect of this movie. I have never seen a more beautiful movie. I hope others will realize it's potential and enjoy it as much as I did.",The Phantom of the Opera
685,RSRMadison,The Singing Sucks,4,23 December 2004,"It's blatantly obvious that the actors are lip-synching. (By ""blatantly"", I mean things like the steady rain of water in the underground cavern being completely silent on the soundtrack, there being no visible throat strain while hitting the high or loud notes, much singing while smiling, and every now and again being ever so slightly off in the synch department.)Since the producers didn't care whether the lip-synching showed, why O why didn't they get real singers to do the singing? According to the closing credits, that's exactly what they did for Minnie Driver's Carlotta. Why, then, not for Emmy Rossum's barely passable Christine and Gerard Butler's excruciating Phantom?There's a reason WHY they call these things ""musicals"" -- it's the MUSIC, stupid! If you can't do justice to the music, why bother?The fans were right. They should have gotten Michael Crawford. What a disappointment.",The Phantom of the Opera

I'll tell you, as soon as the Overture began to play and the old photos showed in the first minutes of the film, I was hooked. In my opinion, it could not have been better cast. Everyone cast (except Minnie Driver, though she did an excellent job of lip-syncing) could sing and dance excellently. The costumes were stunning, the set and scenery breathtaking. The orchestra that performed the music did a stellar job, especially during 'Masquerade.' Everything fit the mood perfectly. The Phantom was portrayed with just the right amount of morbidity and passion. I wouldn't change a thing in this beautiful work of art, and I proudly give it two thumbs up!

When I saw it for the first time six years ago, I instantly fell in love with the music, the cinematography, the acting, and Gerry Butler. His take on the Phantom was indeed different than the Broadway version, but it brought mystery and set the mood for the tortured soul of the character. Emmy Rossum was perfect for Christine. And I know that others say that she has a blank face for much of the film, but Christine was supposed to be almost hypnotized by the Phantom. The music to this day gives me the shivers, due to the fact that such angry music in a minor key can end up sounding nearly happy. I watch this movie every week, at least twice a week. I would recommend it to anybody with an appreciation of music and Broadway. Its extremely difficult to make a movie as great as the original musical, but this film did it!",The Phantom of the Opera
689,larycrewsfl,Amazing!,10,26 December 2004,"My wife and I (56 & 58) absolutely loved this movie. We found it beautiful, romantic, lush, elaborate and sensual.

While I don't agree with that, I do think it is the best movie I've seen since Moulin Rouge. We both loved Chicago, but in a much different way. Joel was the only director who could have done this film justice and he certainly did. (It takes a gay man to make a masterpiece Musical.) The attention to Gothic detail he showed in the Batman film, which was not a good film, is put to perfect use in this film. We recommend it most highly.",The Phantom of the Opera
690,elshakiro,Good but frustrating...,9,13 December 2004,"When it comes to Phantom, there is no bigger fan than I am. I have loved the play and music for as long as I can remember and I have anxiously waited for the movie to be made. Finally it is here, and I certainly have mixed feelings about it. The movie itself is very well done. The camera work, the costumes, the acting, and the storyline itself are excellent. The movie is certainly ""eye-candy"" and I found myself grinning from ear to ear several times throughout the movie.My biggest problem I have is with the casting. I do not understand the decision to cast Butler and Rossom as Phantom and Christine. In my opinion, there were two routes the producers and director could have taken when casting for this movie: (1) Go for the big-named cast and pretty much forget about the voices, or (2) Go with a relatively unknown cast full of amazing singers. Well, neither one of these was achieved and we are left with a semi-famous cast full of weak voices and bad notes. They do a pretty good job considering the shoes they are trying to fill, but it just didn't make any sense to have those two people as the main characters.All in all, this is a pretty decent movie. Try to go into it with an open mind and try to forget how Phantom and Christine sound in the stage version, and you'll have a pretty good experience.7/10 stars",The Phantom of the Opera
691,moviemaddie24,Wishing I could somehow see it again,10,23 December 2004,"First of all I loved this movie. I have read the Leroux book, I own the 1925 silent film, I have seen it on stage, I have the original Broadway cast recording, and now this movie's soundtrack. Obviously I am a fan, and I was not disappointed. I work in theatre, and while watching the movie was reminded of how it works on stage. The only thing that did work better on stage was the fact that most of the dialog was sung; less singing might have made more people like it. I didn't mind it though.The film starts out strong, in black and white, and when the chandelier is raised as soon as the theme comes in I had goosebumps. Though it was a bit reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, it worked. The first two acts move rather slow, especially when the Phantom takes Christine down into his lair. That took a long time, but it is bearable for the music is excellent, and the cast is so hot so you can just look at them, ha ha. But once we hit the third act (the strongest) the movie picks up and redeems itself. The end makes it worth seeing, although when the Phantom's face is revealed it isn't nearly as shocking as I'd hoped, he looks a lot like Quasimodo, or Chunk from the Goonies.The singing is superb from everyone. The voices are not as strong as the Broadway cast, especially Gerard Butler's (The Phantom) and Emmy Rossum's (Christine), but their voices work extremely well in the movie. I was impressed with Rossum's voice for she was only 17 when they filmed, and I believe 16 when they recorded the music, (or had just turned 17). She deserved her Golden Globe nomination, (even if she didn't show much expression). Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is also worth mentioning, for he was extremely dashing, though the phantom was sexy, I would have chosen Raoul.People complain about Rossum's lack of expression, which I can see why, but Chrisitne is an extremely conflicted character, internally. I think her lack of expression helped show how the Phantom had control over her, and how at the end she had control herself. She proved to be an extremely strong woman at the end, and the transformation is played wonderfully by Rossum.Butler as the Phantom was brilliant, he truly showed how much of a victim the Phantom is, and i truly felt sorry for him many times. He also made the Phantom very sexy, ha ha, as odd as that sounds, and I can see why Christine was drawn to him.Wilson had a part without too much meat, but he played it well. he came off as dashing and he truly loved Christine.Minnie Driver was hilarious and one of my favorite parts of the movie. ""TESE TINGS DO APPEN? NO, IF YOU DO NOT STOP TESE TINGS FROM APPENING TIS DOES NOT APPEN, BECAUSE I WILL NOT BE SINGING"" That was great, totally over the top.One of my favorite scenes was when Christine visited her fathers give and sang""wishing you were somehow here again"" it brought me to tears."" All in all the movie is worth seeing even if you are not a fan for I dragged three of my best friends and they knew nothing about it and loved it. I cannot wait to see it again. The movie is very sexy, and fun too, with songs that will play in your head the rest of the night. I give it 4 out of 4 stars.",The Phantom of the Opera

After hearing that Antonio Banderas was not going to play the Phantom i had my doubts that it would be that good. As i have heard him many times singing The Phantom Of The Opera and it has me spellbound every time!Also having the shoes of Micheal Crawford to fill i felt Gerard would have a lot to live up to, but i sat amazed when Gerard Butler started singing while i was watching the film last night and i felt for only having a month of coaching before filming that he was amazing actually all three leading roles were superb. The Supporting roles also did the main three proud Simon Callow and Ciarán Hinds pulled off the humor very well and Minnie Driver mimed her part so effortlessly that it was hard to tell that she didn't truly sing at all!This film is for the romantics and musical lovers so that is why i enjoyed it so much.

I am not a fan of the theatre and feel the limitations detract from performances, but I was a big fan of the soundtrack to Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, which was a change from his usual work (which again I do not care for greatly), and wanted to see what this director, Joel Schumacher, notorious for the Batman sequels could do. I was originally going to see this with a group of friends, with the numbers whittling down as the night grew closer (being 16 with parents waiting at home), it ended up being me and just one of my friends. At the end, in short, we found it amazing. Neither of us knew what was to happen. I was really looking forward to the film, but hype has quashed many films (see, or don't see, the extremely lackluster Troy), and this film would have been so easy to screw up. Not the case.

I certainly look forward to seeing more of his work in the future. Minnie Driver was such a delight as well. The only thing that concerned me was the miscasting of one of three leads.I must say that it is a magnificent film- the costumes, the scenery, Lloyd Webber's sweeping score make the whole package of The Phantom of the Opera unforgettable.

697,obrienl21,Better than expected.....,8,25 December 2004,"I came onto this site to read the comments left by other users before seeing this movie. Some of the comments were quite negative, and so I went into the film a bit more jaded than I was previously. I'm a fan of the musical, so hearing that it was disappointing to other fans made it a bit hard to get into the movie at first...but after the Phantom appeared, I was hooked.What worked: you can see the characters up close. Although the singing voices of the 3 main characters weren't as impressive as the stage actors, I think that they made up for it in believability of the characters. I was particularly impressed with Gerard Butler...he played a role that's definitely not a run-of-the-mill type...and succeeded beautifully in bringing out the humanity in a man who was truly only a monster on the inside. Emily Rossum...I was impressed with her ability to hold her own against the other older, more experienced actors. And Minnie Driver was a hoot as Carlotta. It's too bad she isn't given more character roles, because she really shines in this one! It was also really nice to get the back story behind the Phantom, to see he why he's that way, and to give him a bit more humanity. I saw more than just a disfigured person then...I saw him more as someone who is seriously psychologically damaged and has been neglected by the world. It gives a ""little"" justification to some of his actions.What didn't work: my main concern here is the actor that played Raoul. Although he is supposed to be a bit of the classic young, dashing prince, I felt he still was a bit weak. I couldn't put my finger on it what it was in particular, but it might be partially because his character wasn't as developed as Phantom or Christines. I haven't decided if this is a good thing or a bad thing yet...but in a way I found the Phantom to be almost too good looking. I also tended to picture him being a bit older as well, but I wasn't necessarily complaining either...he was eye candy with the mask on. It could have been intentional....that this was a man who could have lived a perfectly normal life, if he hadn't been scarred in such a way. I would have maybe had someone other than Joel Schumacher do the movie, maybe Sam Mendes or someone who is a bit more ""arty,"" but I was pleasantly surprised that he didn't make it an over-dramatic disaster.Overall, it's a good movie, but Phantom still works better as a stage production. I liked being able to see the characters up close for the first time....when I saw the theater production I had seats up in the 3 balcony, back row so naturally I couldn't see much. Also, I think some of the fans have been a bit too harsh on the movie. Really now, to have Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman...would have worked 15 years ago but now they're getting a bit long in the tooth to play the characters believably. And yes, these actors are not as high of caliber singers, but I think they did a great job still and in some ways infused more emotion into the song then the stage actors.Finally...all I can say is I'm glad that Joel Schumacher didn't completely mess this one up!",The Phantom of the Opera
698,paul_West1,This Phantom has past point of no return,3,31 January 2005,"There was nobody but me in the cinema when I viewed 'Phantom'. It should have been a first hint of what was about to come. At first I thought, ""great, now I can bark along"" as I know the lyrics by heart, but as soon as the on screen characters started singing, my jaw dropped and all I could do was stare at the screen in utter amazement.It didn't look or feel like the actors were singing and what made it even worse is that it was completely out of sync for most of the movie! As a retired projectionist, at first I thought it was due to faulty threading of the film in the projector, but the rest of the sound proved me wrong on that. And then there was the scene I was anticipating the most: the shows title song, Phantom of the Opera. Now why on earth did the production designer and director decide to use that one set (that corner where Erik and Christine (on a horse?) keep coming down) at least three times? They might have spent a little more effort on this showstopper. How come Christine looked like she was hypnotized or drunk and just why didn't this scene have the same overwhelming effect it had on stage? And what about the scene where Raoul is caught under water? It was obviously filmed in a different image ratio then the rest of the movie and in the (digital) cutting room stretched to fit the screen. The producers might have taken the effort to at least 'pan-and-scan' those shots.Miss Rossum may have a nice voice to some, but, like child-star, by some called opera singer Charlotte Church, it has in no way matured. When I would have been presented at a performance of the Dutch Opera with an understudy like her Christine, I'd probably be throwing tomatoes at her at the end. Besides that, for her next assignment in a movie she should at least try to act. Just a reminder: acting, that's trying to move or convince an audience by pretending. Mr. Wilson, who was so believable in HBO's 'Angels in America', looked clueless, running around like a very handsome but spoiled brat. I must blame the director for that. And as for his singing career, well, in this flick Mr. Wilson should have kept his mouth shut, like the dumb blonde in a movie often does.Now as for Mr. Butler, well, I can be brief on his performance. It stinks. Michael Crawford, the actor that originated the title role on stage would have stunk too for that matter. People that say Crawford has an 'operatic voice' should have their ears checked or should try and sit through 15 minutes of a real opera. Where Crawford relied on microphones and amplifying on stage Mr. Butler's performance was lost on the DUBBING stage!I am not at all surprised the movie was withdrawn from the Amsterdam cinema's after a two week run. How come I loved the stage version so much and find myself hating this movie adaptation? How come that most comments on the IMDb I read are favorable and yet the movie is an international flop? Why do some comments say the critics were wrong when it is obvious that even the die-hard fans that saw it on stage have so obviously refused to buy tickets for this cinematic disaster? No matter how much one likes the original show, it's okay to dislike this film version. As a matter of fact, that's what I liked about the movie. Every now and then I need to see something trashy, just to remind me how good other productions are. To quote an other Andrew Lloyd Webber classic: It's fun to see how bad, bad writing can be...Think of how much cash the DVD will make at the souvenir shop in the theaters where the show is still playing, next to the coffee mugs, T-shirts, pins, masks, CD's and books.Think of it! Andrew Lloyd Webber certainly did think of it - fondly",The Phantom of the Opera

(Can u tell I'm a Christine/Erik(Phantom) fan? And the music... SO beautiful! I'm still listening to my soundtrack almost every day; I almost have all the songs memorized! Just don't ask me to pick a favorite! Raoul was even likable in the film; and I usually hate him! Ooo, I will vote for the song that gets stuck in my head the most often... Definitely ""Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer"" The lines that just won't stop going through my mind are these in particular:Raoul: I love her! Does that mean nothing? I love her! Show some compassion! Erik(Phantom): *snarling* The world showed no compassion to me!And the other lines are:Christine: Pitiful creature of darkness What kind of life have you known? God give me courage to show you You are not alone...WOW! Once again, awesome movie! Am anxiously awaiting the DVD release!

Having heard the critics opinions of it I was expecting to be badly let down. Well I wasn't at all disappointed in the slightest it is quite easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. The music is amazing and sounds awesome in a Cinema with surround sound. The three lead actors were all very good, despite being unkowns( though I don't think they will be for much longer). I was totally drawn into the story and found it very moving at times. It runs at just over two hours long and it passed so quickly. Too quickly. It is just as good, if not better than the stage play. It really has been worth the wait, I can't wait for the DVD to come out I'm sure I will wear it out. Ignore the critics this film rocks!I give 20 out of ten!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

Gerard Butler makes an extremely mesmerising Phantom. His voice is captivating and at times disturbing because it suits the dark and secretive atmosphere the Phantom inhabits below the Opera house.Emmy Rossum is perfect in the role of Christine Daae. Each song brings a significant element to the film and each character, including Patrick Wilson (Vicomte Raoul DE Chagny), captured the feelings of the audience. The Phantom was tortured and suffering, Christine was innocent and forgiving and Raoul was the hero and the seething lover!All in all I believe this film deserves 11/10!",The Phantom of the Opera
702,phynyx,Couldn't have been better!,10,27 December 2004,"My wife and went and saw this on Christmas eve in one of the few theaters showing it. We are both big Phantom fans and we absolutely loved the movie. We both got chills when the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" started playing in the beginning. It was awesome. We enjoyed that we were able to see the facial expressions we don't get to see when seeing it performed on stage. It was very well done. If you have never seen the musical itself, you may have a hard time with some of it because it comes across cheesy with them all singing in harmony to what would be general talking, but if you have seen it before on stage, you'll love it. The entire cast is wonderful. We have heard or read comments or reviews that Phantom (Erik) is too good looking to be the Phantom, but in the book and musical he is supposed to be good looking other than the scarring/marking on his face. After all, how can he seduce Christine if he's ugly even with the mask? Also, we really enjoyed that Raoul is so well cast. When we've seen it performed, you were happy that Christine went to Raoul, but you still felt like she should have gone with Phantom. In this one, the actor of Raoul is so well done, you want him to get Christine. Absolutely wonderful.",The Phantom of the Opera
703,r_bex4eva,"In one word, absolutely superb!",10,17 December 2004,"Okay, so that's 2 words, but the film was awesome, it was incredible. I've always wanted to see phantom of the opera as a stage piece, but never really did anything about it; so I was delighted when I saw it was coming out at the cinema. However, I thought that Hollywood would spoil it like it does so many other great story lines. How wrong could I have been! Everything from the acting to the singing to the scenery was absolutely magnificent! Each of the actors were outstanding, even brookside star Jennifer Ellison, though she didn't have a huge role, played her part very well. Emmy Rossum who played Christine has to be credited the most. The only other film I've seen her in is 'The Day After Tomorrow' which she isn't terrific in so I didn't expect her to be beyond average, but for a young actor she excelled! She sung beautifully, even to the extent when I questioned myself if it was really her singing. Another truly memorable performance was by the phantom, Gerard Butler. His voice was outstanding! I was completely awe-struck by it, and his acting was no less then brilliant! My favourite part of the movie however had to be the music and the delightful way it was presented and sung! It was so intense and powerful, I nearly crying at the music alone (the ending did make me cry but I won't spoil it for you if you haven't already seen the film!)I loved it so much, the following day that I watched the film I went out and bought the soundtrack and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. Overall, the movie was amazing, Andrew Lloyd Webber's input is shown makes it a memorable and extraordinary piece of work. I give it a 10 surely, maybe even an 11 and I am definitely going to see it again!",The Phantom of the Opera

I have never had the privilege to see the stage version, but I have read the novel and I loved it. To see it on the screen was just fantastic. Even though you know there is a great timeless character to the movie that I just loved. It pulls you in with the illustrious sets and the music of course puts you to tears. I Emma was spectacular. Her voice filled the shoes very well of the many woman who have sun that part. Minnie Driver played her role to perfection, as did the other actors. You really couldn't have asked for much more. Andrew Lloyd Webber should be very proud of himself. This movie was done with such color, and emotion that I don't think you would get from the stage version. Even those scenes where you know special effects were used came out beautifully. As simple as the set seemed on a whole (an Opera House) the designs and elegance just poured off everything. So much so that you could feel the class that this time period had. It was truly a wonderful movie and I can't wait to see it again. I would definitely recommend seeing it.",The Phantom of the Opera
705,estargrl88,Great spectacle,9,16 December 2004,"I just returned from seeing a screener, and I must say the Phantom of the Opera was wonderful!! I have never seen the stage version, but I have heard the soundtrack. First of all, the sets and costumes are brilliant, as is the music. I felt as if the acting was good, though maybe off a tiny bit sometimes. The singing was also done well. The one strange thing was that Emmy Rossum's Christine did not have much of an operatic voice, though she was supposed to be an opera singer. The plot line is enjoyable with the whole mystery of the ""opera ghost"" and Christine's relationship towards him. At the end, one does feel rather emotional because of the Phantom's youth, however, it is a generally happy ending depending on your viewpoint. All together, the movie is very fun to watch with all of the great embellishments, and also hear since the music is awesome! While it may not be favorable to those who dislike musical theater, I still enjoyed and would recommend it.",The Phantom of the Opera

The biggest surprise? That it actually works really well and his voice, well, is kind of perfect for the role. This is a movie for you if you are into great romances, musicals and impressive scenery and singing voices.It might seem long and dragged out at some point but just lean back, relax and enjoy the songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber's biggest success.",The Phantom of the Opera

Now I am haunted by the Phantom.The music and singing are a treat. Gerard Butler is (of course) perfect as the Phantom. He can really sing! Emmy Rossum is beautiful and has the voice of an angel.

708,esshor,Absolutely great,10,13 January 2005,"The Phantom of the OperaSummary: Chorus girl Christine (Emmy Rossum) sings in the shadow of diva La Carlotta (Minnie Driver) at the Opera Populaire, until fate - or some darker force - intervenes. She suddenly finds herself centre stage, unaware that her success is owed to The Phantom (Gerard Butler), a musical genius who lives in catacombs beneath the opera house. Hopelessly in love with Christine, The Phantom makes himself known to her but wears a mask for fear she'll be repulsed by his deformity. That fear quickly develops into murderous rage when an aristocratic pretty boy (Patrick Wilson) threatens to steal her away. Justification: Alright, I may have rated this movie a 10 but that's just because I was blown away by Gerard Butler's performance. Fair enough, he isn't a born, great singer. He isn't the great soprano like Michael Crawford. But he was the greatest pick for the 'phantom.' It's kind of pathetic, but many people will watch this and immediately compare this to any other of the past performances of this and especially to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. People will say that Emmy Rossum is too young, and that Gerard Butler can't sing at all compared to Michael Crawford. Some people will comment that Minnie Driver, rather than being dubbed, should not have been cast as Carlotta. To these I say the following: Christine is supposed to be a young choir girl. Sarah Brightman is not young, nor a choir girl. Emmy Rossum sang with the Metropolitan Opera when she was seven, and is the perfect age for the part. She has a beautiful, clear voice that doesn't sound (don't get me wrong, Sarah Brightman has an amazing voice and is great for her style of voice... but I just can't stand her voice...) like her mouth is stuffed with cotton when she sings the high notes. Michael Crawford is, anyway you look at it, WAY too old to play the sexy, mainstream appealing Phantom that a movie needs. Gerard gave the needed look to the Phantom, Webber was looking for. He needed to be the entrancing, sexy and great character Webber was trying to build upon. And not only was Gerard Butler in this movie, well one word; sexy, but Gerard Butler CAN sing. Don't be fooled by the deeper, fuller tambre his voice has. Deeper isn't bad. In fact, for the mainstream appeal the movie is unarguably shooting for, Gerard Butler's voice is better than Michael Crawford's, Crawford's voice didn't have the passion and emotion, and quite frankly horror and anger that needed to be portrayed in soo many of the songs. Like when Christine takes off the phantom's mask for the first time, Crawford didn't sound mad. Not at all, Butler really shined at this point. Gerarad's voice was better than Crawford's; none of the tinniness that has a tendency to creep in on high notes (""But that's the Phantom!"" the people will say...). Gerard Butler's Music of the Night is great (It's more impressive to be able to reach those notes without having to resort to high falsetto, guys, it gives a fuller, deeper tone.); listen to it and pretend you've never heard Michael Crawford. It's by no means bad, or anything close. I enjoyed it. And his Point of No Return runs circles around Michael Crawford's.Sure, I'm giving this movie a 10. I fell in love with it the first time I viewed it. I gave it a 10 not only to show my like for it but also to acknowledge to die-hard fans of the Original Cast that this isn't your old 1987 CD set with one track per disc. They're different actors and singers all together. Their voices have different tambres, they're completely different people. Gerard Butler is not the tenor that Michael Crawford is (thankfully, at some parts). Deal with it, and learn to be happy with the long awaited movie version of one of Broadway's greatest shows.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was loyal to the 1925 version. (Which I *still* feel to be the *definitive* Phantom film).HOWEVER.This film is stellar. From the lavish recreation of the late 19th century Opera Populaire right down to the wear on the tips of the ballerina's slippers, there is *so* much detail in this film that the eye never runs out of things to drink in.Sure I have criticisms, the film is by no means perfect, but at the end of the film I decided to let my grievances with plot and acting to go.Emma Rossem's Christine is truly delightful, and she has the voice of... well... of an angel! For the first time, I was *truly* able to identify with her character. Thanks to the... um... shall we say, *pleasing* Gerard Butler. Yes, I'd be torn too if *he* were the one entering my dreams every night.

This movie surely brings out the 1870's Victorian romance of that era. Joel Schumacher surely out did himself with this movie. The music score was great, the actors were great, every thing about the movie was terrific. I was expecting a typical romance movie but it has a way of getting to you regardless of age and gender.One thing I loved about it was at the end with the red rose and the Phantom's ring with it at Christine Daae's grave. Surely must be one last reminder from the Phantom that the Count wasn't the only one who loved Christine... maybe in her later years Christine regretted going with the Count and thought maybe she should of stayed with the Phantom... telling her husband in their later years every thing, about the music box, etc. Prompting him to go out and buy the music box...",The Phantom of the Opera

Most films tend to think about the fun value. But this film remembers what movies are...art.First off, I know some people don't like Gerard Butler's voice or what not. I personally thought that no one could play The Phantom better. And before all you Michael Crawford lovers start complaining, I've heard his Phantom and I don't like it. In my opinion, the Phantom's supposed to have a more powerful voice with more range. Crawford sounded wimpy and exactly the same in every song in my opinion. While Butler's voice is powerful on most of the sounds, he enables his voice to be more soulful on songs like ""Music of the Night"". Plus, you can practically hear what The Phantom's emotions are as he sings. Emmy Rossum was also amazing as Christine. Some have said she and Butler don't have a lot of chemistry, but I think exactly the opposite. Their performance of ""The Point of No Return"" was simply AMAZING. The character of Raoul is not one I like. I personally thought The Phantom should have been chosen by Christine but what can ya do? I also felt the sword fight scene in the cemetery was messed up. The Phantom was definitely more powerful and smarter than Raoul so how could he possibly lose to him? Anyways I truly recommend this movie.

Not only is she absolutely beautiful, her voice really is like an angels. however, on that note, i believe the casting for the phantom could have been a little better. his voice just wasn't as appealing as other phantoms i have seen in theater. i also believe that the flashback of when the phantom was a child clears up several questions one might come to from watching the play. in addition the ""flashforwards"", done in black and white, were particularly good additions. i think that the ending was much better in the play. i don't like how the phantom just walks through the mirror, it is just too anti-climactic.in conclusion the movie clears up several questions. but nothing can take the place of seeing the play live. so if you liked the movie, you will love the play.",The Phantom of the Opera

715,jkluvschachi,A great movie sunk by its source,7,6 March 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals were box office gold for the Broadway musical industry throughout the 1970's and 80's. In recent years his amount of hit shows has certainly fallen off a bit, and there is a reason for this. While his shows are commercial and marketable they just aren't that good. The lyrics are extremely surface and pedestrian and his scores are never written for character, but surely written in the hopes that a sappy chanteuse like Celine Dion or Barbra Streisand might someday record them. It has been an unfortunate problem in the business of the musical theater that Andrew Lloyd Webber achieved such wealth and fame, while a more risky composer, and far superior dramatist, like Stephen Sondheim, has never been able to achieve a commercial success.That having been said, Lloyd Webber's Phantom is probably his best and most interesting show. While the melodies might be found (if you listen carefully) in some of Giacomo Puccini's operas, Phantom, as a stage play is lush, romantic and extraordinarily theatrical. The original production which relied heavily on spectacular special effects, rendered even more spectacular by the fact they happened right before your very eyes, lent a magic to the piece that otherwise relied heavily on draperies and the architecture of the theater itself to create an environment in which the play could take place.Phantom, as a movie, loses all of that immediacy, and therefore, whether fortunately or unfortunately, becomes a hackneyed melodrama. Joel Schumacher's direction is unexpectedly great. I was skeptical that a big budget popcorn director like Schumacher could actually do a piece that was so romantic in scope. However, he succeeds, I think in making one of the most aesthetically beautiful movies of 2004. The performances in the movie were incredibly strong I thought, and Emmy Rossum is wonderful in the role of Christine. She sings the difficult role extremely well for someone so young, and maintains a sincere vulnerability throughout. Patrick Wilson sang well, as he tried to make something of an underwritten juvenile role. He comes across as unnecessarily heroic. Mostly he's dull. After his amazing performance in last year's Angels in America, I was surprised to find him so boring, however, the problem is in the under dramatized characterization. Gerard Butler was good, if not the greatest singer in the world, but he was fighting against what was probably the worst choice in the movie: his face. How are we to believe that this young singer would not love this romantic, passionate and sensitive man, if he is not hideously deformed. He is, but when he has the mask on, he looks like a runway model at a masquerade party. Who couldn't see the beauty in that? It made the story make little sense, especially since Wilson's Raoul was so intolerably stoic.Overall, the movie is worth a look see, particularly, I think, if you were not able to see the stage production from the eighties. Some of the music, while pedestrian, is quite lovely. However, minus the immediacy, when it's all said and done, all you have is turgid melodrama.",The Phantom of the Opera
716,mitchells,Pure Music of the Night,10,7 January 2005,"I was first exposed to the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. The show was a phenomenon and it still is. The movie was just as much a spectacle and such a surprise. Before reviewing it though, critics need to take note of two things: first, this is a musical, and second, theatre and film are two different mediums.Many people who are fans of the stage show, but dislike the movie state that the movie doesn't portray the same feelings as the Broadway production. The thing is, seeing a live theatre production and watching a motion picture are completely different on many levels. A live performance there is more feeling and a more realistic aura because you share the same breathing room as the actors. A movie, you are simply looking at a screen. With that said, Joel Shumacher does such an incredible job with the story and displaying the emotions with this medium. The cinematography is just outstanding. Emmy Rossum's portrayal of Christine Daae is so accurate and enchanting. Patrick Wilson is just charming as Raoul (with an awesome voice also). The Phantom I had to get used to because it wasn't Michael Crawford, but Gerard Butler still surprised me.Critics also complain about the repeating music, but in theatre the repeating of music isn't lacking of more music, it brings the show in full circle. Some people say this is not ""Chicago"" but I say it is more. ""Chicago"" is simple, ""Phantom"" is elaborate, maybe not in story but in set, costumes, and music. I highly recommend it, but urge people to see it with an open mind and not compare it to the Broadway production if they have seen it. It is such a great motion picture that explores the brink of madness love can bring. Simple in plot, complex in music, and so well done. My rating 97 out of 100.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have to say, the costumes and sets were beautiful, but the acting and singing was not as great. A lot of the songs seemed to drag, as they really just stood there and sang them without a lot of movement. Minnie Driver was amusing, but I felt that she took it over the top (perhaps to make up for her lack of singing in the film?) Gerard Butler had a very pretty voice, but he acted like a Dracula villain, swishing around his cloak so much it was comical. Emmy Rossum had a beautiful voice and did a great job in my opinion. I have to say that I didn't like some of the changes they made in the film, and they tried too hard to make some scenes better than they needed to be i.e. the gratuitous horses and the huge underground lair. A scene I did like that I was glad they put in was the carnival scene, as it does provide some explanations. I left the theatre very disappointed, the film adaptation just didn't come across very well.

And the fact that the actors sing the songs in the film by themselves makes ""ThePhantom of the Opera"" even better.For me 7.1 is too low rating for such a great film, I think it deserves nothing less than a 10. When you see it you'll see I'm right. So guys give it more tens.",The Phantom of the Opera
721,jshe0324,Wonderful Performance,10,30 December 2004,Truly Amazing It really did the musical proud and had a lot more in it than could be brought to the stage Gerard Butler really shone and so did Emmy rossum Ilook forward to seeing what the future has in store for these two actors Every emotion you thought could possibly be in any movie was in this one at some stage. I feel that Joel Schumacher has lived up to his reputation and justice was done by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber truly a genius even in this day and age of musical theater I could go and see it again and again and still want more I totally recommend this to anyone who loved the musical and even to those new to the story.

I have seen The Phantom of The Opera on stage a few years ago but never felt for the characters like I did when I saw this film.This movie moved me to tears, I loved the performances by Gerard Butler - The Phantom, Emmy Rossum - Christine and Patrick Wilson - Raoul. I really felt for the phantom and could feel his pain and loneliness. The music is very moving and greatly adds to the emotions and sentiments of the movie. Minnie Driver plays the Diva La Carlotta - and is great playing the Diva Opera star.

Phantom shines from start to finish, don't contemplate watching it, just watch it, relax, and let it weave its magic on you, trust me.

726,exquire,Phantom of the soap opera,4,8 January 2005,"If you like soft-core porn, you'll love the Phantom.I've never seen the stage show, but was already very familiar with the music. Or should I say, three or four tunes that fail to carry the whole movie.The first time we hear the resplendent organ theme I thought ""Wow, that was early."" Little did I know we were in for half an hour of each theme, slowly and histrionic stretched like butter over too much bread.It's a stretch to call this a movie, which would imply something moves. Rather, it's a lot of sitting around, repeating the same things until you're numb. The movie is clearly made so you can still follow it while you straighten your doilies, fetch a shandy in a crystal glass, and knit.Most strikingly, the film is presented in a totally soap opera style, with all the hallmarks and clichés of cheesy false melodrama. No I mean ALL the hallmarks. Soft focus eat your heart out - this is pure oil-on-the-lens fuzzy-town. Everything is candle-lit, low aperture capture, giving it that ""glowy"" with immoderate opulence.As if that wasn't enough, indoor scenes rain petals, and outdoor scenes have gently floating snowflakes. Focus softly, light it dreamy, give a soft vignette and wear an awful lot of lace and we're there. I would have fallen asleep but for one saving grace: TITTIES ON SCREEN.Face it, there's heaps of them. The actors have been carefully dressed so you can recognise them by their cleavage, so you actually never have to look at their face. I can't think of a single scene that didn't have breasts in it - not even when it's snowing. I feel it degrades the women, you'll spend the whole film thinking ""Man, I'd hit it."" But don't worry. There aren't any subtleties you'll miss.",The Phantom of the Opera
727,chelliemo,An excellent adaptation,10,22 December 2004,"I've just seen the non-Spanish version, and it's beautiful and magical and just as fabulous as the live version. Nothing of course can replace seeing Phantom in all of its theatre glory, but this movie is an art unto itself. The present in black and white and the past in color is a nice twist. The transformation after the auction scene is a cinematic wonder. It ranks up there next to Dorothy's arrival in Oz. Christine is a gem; I love that she had done practically nothing before this. Raoul is also fabulous; I caught peaks of his father Patrick Stewart constantly. He was wonderful. This is everything a live production cannot do, and is wonderful for it. Nothing of the story or passion was lost in its transformation to the screen. I worry that people will no longer go see the real thing, but this is a more accessible version for many people. Just be sure to see it in a theater whose speakers can handle the opera!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
728,sssssar420,Excellent,10,23 December 2004,"Being a great fan of musicals, and a rather obsessed musician myself, I was a little wary of this movie due to what film can sometimes do to a masterpiece. Well, I didn't have to be. While many have been bashing this film for a number of different reasons, I strongly think that this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. Even if the music hadn't been as wonderful as it was, it was visually incredible, and I can't even begin to imagine how much work went into it. Hats off to Joel S.; I think he did a fabulous job. I loved the atmosphere that was created, and the way the characters were portrayed. The depth of the Phantom was made very clear, as was his immense power and control over Christine. Many people have been cutting down the Phantom's singing, but honestly, take it in context with the story. He sings very much in character, displaying a hint of deranged madness in his voice. And face it, he's got high expectations to live up to. We all know Micheal Crawford is amazing, but that doesn't mean you have to sound as good as he does to deliver a fantastic performance. Emmy was also wonderful; what seems to be being said about her is that she was somewhat emotionless. I do not agree at all; she carried her role beautifully, in an entranced, almost bewildered state. I thought this movie was absolutely beautiful and I would definitely see it again. And again.",The Phantom of the Opera
729,degrazio7,Can you spell O-S-C-A-R-(S)?,10,24 December 2004,"Without comparing to the stage production and past actors whom devoted fans (myself included)have come to love, this movie is a WOW! An experience. Something sorely lacking in today's movies. It is simply dazzling and mesmerizing. I viewed the film with my family in a packed movie house. Aside from sniffles at the end of the film, there was not a cough, sneeze, side talk, or mumble from anyone in the theater during it's two hour and twenty minute viewing time. And like Christine entranced by the phantom, we, the audience were caught in director Joel Schumacher's enchanting spell. We were drawn right into the film. Quite the director's accomplishment. This movie is dripping with detail from lavish sets, to costumes AND yes...acting and singing. I have had the pleasure of touring the Paris Opera House and I was amazed at how close the set designers came to recreating it. Although some have criticized Mr. Butler's vocal ability, I feel that he put forth an amazing performance. His character is truly dark yet, Gerard Butler grabs at your heart-strings as you develop a sense of pity for him. As I looked around the theater towards the end of the film, many people were in tears, including my wife. The pressure was on as devoted POTO fans and nay-sayers wondered, ""can he do it?"" He did..and beautifully. Great job Gerry!!!Emmy Rossum's performance as the entranced Christine is enchanting. She will be yet another rising star in the heavens to watch for in movie land. Minnie Driver's character as the self-absorbed Diva, Carlotta is a hoot and Minnie pulls off her part hysterically perfect. Patrick Wilson as the steadfast and heroic Raoul and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry were equally as good in their performances. Each main character in this film supported each other as smoothly as a well trained singer hitting the high notes. Of all the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals that have made it to the screen, to date, this one definitely reigns supreme in my book. Flaws? Yes, there are flaws. However, this movie is so huge that the nit-picker type flaws are certainly overshadowed by the sheer magnificence of the production. Oscar buzz (in many categories) should soon be in the air for this incredible film production. If you are a fan of the book by Gaston Leroux, the stage production by Andrew Lloyd Webber, or enjoy musicals, this movie is a must see!",The Phantom of the Opera
730,celticshrew,"Seen it, loved it, going back for more!",10,24 December 2004,"(I'm not sure if I'm leaving any spoilers, but just to be safe I'm checking the box)I have loved this musical since I was a child. We had the sheet music that I tinkered with on the piano often. Having seen the musical both in Toronto and in the town I live, I had the mental images in my head of what to hope for. When the reviews came out, mostly negative, I held onto that hope - for the grandiose, and the richness... and for the right combination of voices and faces to give the story plausibility in addition to the fantastical. I was not disappointed. To start with, the Victorian era is one of my favorites. The costuming and scenery was wonderful! Perfect blend of demure and theater grand. I loved seeing what happened behind the scenes of the operas. Next - the casting. I've generally been fairly tepid concerning Michael Crawford. His voice, while a lovely tenor, hasn't quite had the right combination of brooding charm and sinister sensuality that I've always felt the Phantom required. Gerard Butler really nailed the part, putting enough charm, pain, love, insanity and just a hint of psycho-stalker into the character to make his plight plausible. Granted, I'm biased. I love a strong baritone. Emmy Rossum was perfect for a young ingénue just trying to find a place in the opera world. Very dewy and easily led by the Phantom's seductive wiles, even though she had that hint of her past drawing her back to reality. And when you add in the fact that she's so young with a voice that big - color me impressed! The casting of Madame Giry and Meg Giry also impressed me, just on physical matching alone. Raoul was a nice bright balance for the darkness of the Phantom. Minnie Driver was hysterical as La Carlotta, she really embraced the character. And all the rest  really just made the whole thing fall together in a seamless whole.",The Phantom of the Opera
731,lildoodie2004,well done,8,25 December 2004,"Having seen the Phantom five times (three in Toronto, two in Detroit) I can say that Joel did a good job directing. Despite very small (but somewhat irratable to a fan like me) parts that could have easily been avoiding change, it was a beautiful representation of the musical on Broadway. I also very much so, enjoyed the extra ending, )for those of you who have seen the play know it ends with Meg holding the mask up to the audience, and the spotlight hits then fades....) I thought it very appropriate, and it was indeed a tear jerker. I do though, think maybe a different actor for the Phantom, despite a tolerable acting job, not the voice that they should have had for a major production. I am not just comparing his voice to that of Michael Crawford, or any London or Toronto Phantom, but I will not complain. A definite must see, despite how many times you've seen it on stage, or even if you haven't!",The Phantom of the Opera
732,Porfirju,"Good, however....",7,30 December 2004,"Had cinematography been the only thing that counts for a movie musical, then this version of the classic Lloyd Webber musical would have got a 10+, however acting and singing do play a part somewhere too! I would not like to be misunderstood: all the performers were quite good, however one thing that really looked monstrous throughout was the lack of effort some showed when singing, especially on the part of Rossum and Wilson. Even though the singing was good from all, the lack of feeling and expression shown by Christine and Raoul almost everywhere makes it look really obvious that it was all playback. It was like viewing a stage performance with playback music. It is humanly impossible to reach the high notes of ""The phantom of the opera"" without showing SOME kind of expression - however Ms Rossum seems to do it here, sitting in the boat looking half asleep (well, she looks half asleep THROUGHOUT except in the final scene in the dungeons)... it looks pitifully fake. Apart from this there was another scene which looked really impossible... just after Bouquet's murder, Christine and Raoul run up(please note) several flights of stairs all the way to the roof, and singing a fast paced song all along. Had there been less stairs to run up it would have looked more credible, but I fear that no one, albeit being very professional, can run that much and sing so perfectly all along. Breath ought to lack at some point!Apart from these loopholes (and some lack of synchronization between singing and lip movement especially after Christine removes the phantom's mask while in his lair) it remains a great production. The music is enchanting* and the way the overture is presented is breathtaking. ""Masquerade"" is staged to perfection; ""The point of no return"" and the final scenes in the theatre's dungeons are nothing short than memorable. I particularly liked Miranda Richardson as Mme Giry and Ellison as Meg. Butler was satisfacory as the Phantom. I would have preferred to see Carlotta, Firmin and Andre in a more serious and less comic impersonation, but that's a question of taste. Anyway, even though it could have been MUCH better, still it is worth viewing. (*Maybe it would be better to listen to the music and not watch the movie) 7/10",The Phantom of the Opera
733,entrophyed1,Comparing Movie to Play,10,1 January 2005,"Okay, just so everyone knows, this is by far one of the best and most organized films I have seen in the past ten years. Even though the movie switched around some of the scenes, like where the chandelier came down AFTER Masquerade, and Bucket was killed right before the chandelier came down INSTEAD of right in the beginning, it was still an excellent movie for all moviegoers to see and enjoy. But, I admit that I had to choose who I saw it with, because it leaves a distinct feeling of love, betrayal, and passion that is only to be shared with those one cares about and is comfortable sharing it with. I don't really recommend this for kids under ten or eleven, because some of the deeper themes and meanings might go sailing right over their head, but it is one movie that needs to be added to the movie connoisseur's collection.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was not disappointed in the slightest way and if you want a taste of Broadway with awesome seats where you can actually see the actors and the costume details and the emotion of the story, then you should go see this movie! You could hear the emotion through the singing at the play, but you can feel it completely when you see the movie! It was amazing and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!

I've seen it five times now and am anxiously awaiting next weekend when I hope to see it again. I dread the day they take it out of the theater because it just won't be the same without the big screen and the powerful surround sound. I read today that it's expected to be released May 5th on DVD - I know I have to wait, but I don't want to.Many people keep comparing the film to the stage and/or to the book, but I believe that is so unfair. I haven't seen the stage version, but hope to some day. I did purchase the book and am in the middle of it. I can see where ALW adapted the story for the stage. The film is an adaptation of the stage version. It's not meant to be the same as either the stage or the book - it's an ""adaptation,"" it's another story. This one is much more romantic and tragic.Also, the more I see it the more I believe that Gerard Butler is the perfect phantom - for this version. Yes he is sexy, but it's more than that. You can literally feel his pain. He portrays so well the anger, the frustration, the absolute despair of a man who is denied what others take for granted.The entire cast of this film was amazing. Emmy Rossum was perfect as the naive and innocent ingénue. Patrick Wilson's voice was so smooth and sweet and I think he was a perfect and charming suitor.This is a must see for anyone who is a sucker for romantic movies ... and if you enjoy musicals.

736,holisticgardener,Most Entertainment at a Movie in Years,10,3 May 2005,"I don't know where else you could get so much gorgeous music, overwhelming romanticism, gorgeous sets and costumes, and even more gorgeous actors than in this production. It's the most fun you can have for the price of a movie ticket! Gerard Butler is a sexy rock-star phantom. Emmy Rossum is sweet and quite willing to be seduced! Patrick Wilson does a great job in a pitiful role -- no way can he compete with the Phantom's sociopathic allure! The 100+ piece orchestra used in filming this movie was money well spent. The sound is huge and does justice to the beautiful score. There have been complaints about the quality of Gerard Butler's singing and the fact that he is too handsome. That's like saying cheesecake tastes too good, and peanuts aren't almonds. Butler was a perfectly cast Phantom for this version which is much more romantic and much less creepy than the Michael Crawford versions. A 50 year old Phantom allegedly seducing a 16 year old singer is pretty much pedophilic -- a problem that is avoided by having a younger believably alluring Phantom. This movie is a blast -- so much so that I had to buy surround sound and a big screen TV so I can have the experience in my own home for years to come.",The Phantom of the Opera
737,Alexandra_Leaving,Bravissimo!!!,10,26 January 2005,"When I saw the ""Phantom of the opera"" for the first time I fell in love with it  the music, the singing, the story, the characters, the costumes, the decorations, everything was absolutely fantastic. The director managed to create an atmosphere of the theatrical musical in the film, all splendour and lustre. And the music  it is absolutely sublime in the full orchestral version.I went to see the film 5 more times, dragging all my friends along. I have acquired the soundtrack on CD. I also acquired the original musical's soundtrack on CD performed by the London cast as I wanted to compare the two.I think that someone who have never herd the original musical can probably enjoy the film more than someone who has loved the original version for years, as it could be difficult to embrace any changes in something you already like ""just the way it is"".The two of the versions are quite different mostly in the interpretation of the character of Phantom. In the musical (Michael Crawford) sounds close to my old uncle George  a kind old guy with a very nice smooth voice. The Phantom played by Gerard Butler in the film is totally different -he is a very sexually attractive person (even with the mask and disfigured face) who is torn by the power of his passions. His voice is a perfect instrument to show all the turmoil which goes on in his soul it is rough at one moment, and very soft at another. His voice is not what you call a ""sweet"" voice and this seems to cause a controversy, but his voice has a great affect on me  literally sending the shivers down my spine. I think that his acting is incredible  he makes me really feel that Phantom is a real person, not just a fruit of imagination. Christine is played by Emmy Rossum in the film. Her character is young and vulnerable there and is opposite to slightly crazy in the musical. Emmy Rossum expresses exceptionally how Christine is tossed between her feelings for Raul and her feelings for Phantom and how she does not understand her feelings half of the time. Her voice is as pure as a crystal.All supporting actors are exceptional, especially Ciarán Hinds/Simon Callow as Firmin/Andre pair and Mini Driver as Carlotte, so funny. And the icing on a cake is the ending  very clever, beautiful and emotional.If you like musicals - don't miss this film!!!!!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
738,XisLove03,Phantom fails miserably,1,20 January 2005,"THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA Starring: Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richarson and Minnie Driver Directed by Joel Schumacher Rating: ACTUALLY.... 1/2 star out of 5By the looks of things, this film has it all. But, as the movie progresses, we find that everything is a mask and nothing is revealed. Nothing. What looks like a promising journey into the recesses of a tortured soul's mind becomes a dull, overwrought version of the famed Broadway Musical.Any fans of the musical will probably be disappointed, but as a person who has not had the pleasure of seeing the Phantom on stage, I have to say that Joel Schumacher's rendition fails on its own merits. The film fails to make anyone care about any of the characters and totally relies, too much so, on the famous moments, iconography and 2 songs (about a good majority of the singing plays off the melodies of ""Music of the Night"" and the song that goes ""The Phannnnnnntom of the opera is there...inside your mind""). By the time the other song sequence comes, you really don't care.It's a shame because I can see so much potential in a film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. Yet, Joel Schumacher's upends any potential with a strong emphasis on Art Direction, which is quite some beautiful eye candy. However, the emotions are lacking in every aspect because we do not believe any of the character's actions. The Phantom (Butler) is made to be such an ass and not much more (hell, why is he hidden away with such a beautiful half face??? the other half wasn't that scarred and he could wear that mask and still live, right?), Christine (Rossum, who glows a bit) is made to be torn between two different loves when there really is no reason to, and Raoul (Wilson, who is as unbelievable as his hair) is made to be a hero when he is also an ass and a very dumb one at that. There are no true motivations within any of the characters' actions or the story's contrivances. One especially non-sensical moment comes at the end when a character brings an old music box as a gesture to another character. This action presents two problems 1)How does this guy know about the music box? Forget if there's an explanation in the musical or book, there is none in the movie. 2)Why would he think it would be such a great gesture to the other character? Again, nothing in the movie makes us believe this character would think this was at all a grand idea.The only positives are the colorful and crisp art direction and cinematography and Minnie Driver, whose character, though she does not appear in many scenes, is welcomed as hilarious moments of enjoyment in between a big pile of fluff. Some people might enjoy the fact they recognized references to both the musical and the book, but Schumacher does a very poor job of creating a cohesive, significant, and emotionally satisfying work. What remains is beauty without meaning, craft without art, a film without resonance.",The Phantom of the Opera

Indeed things were going swimmingly until Emmy Rossum opened her mouth. Out came a thin reedy voice with top notes like one of those plastic whistles you get in Christmas crackers.The near tuneless caterwauling of Gerrard Butler had to be heard to be believed. He could cope with top notes even less than his wide-eyed co-star. At best his voice was as rough as a 3 day stubbly chin. Brightman and Crawford on the original soundtrack sound like Kiri Te Kanowa and Pavarotti by comparison. The performance of the title song had me wincing in my seat.And so it went on - Emmy shrilled her songs and Gerrard shouted his and pulled between them like a rope in tug o war was poor bland Raoul. Bland he might have been but at least his singing didn't make squirm.Would I see this film again - surprisingly yes - but with a mute button handy so I could enjoy the lavish sets. If only the singing had been half as good as the setting I would definitely have given it a higher rating.

There was no thought in my head about whether the original cast, which I'd come to love, would be in it or not. Other than wishing I had the chance to audition for Christine's role, I was immensely pleased with the casting and the singing. The original soundtrack with Micheal Crawford and Sarah Brightman, I believe is more melodically beautiful, but Gerard Butler as the Phantom puts more emotion into his voice than the original. He's totally believable and tho I knew the story like the back of my hand, I cried. Wonderfully done. Beautiful set design, costume design and casting. I couldn't have been more pleased than if I'd done it all myself.

744,LVHermes,Schumacher is indeed great!,6,18 January 2005,"This is not Schumacher's best film but it was very very good. This musical is one of my all time favorites. I saved my money and bought the record when I was about 10 years old. I had a brief idea what it was about listening to the music but I hadn't seen it. Reading that one of my directing idols was about to make it has held me waiting ever since. Several times while watching the film, I got the same goosebumps I got when I first heard the music as a child. It was mesmerizing.My critique though is that I think they stayed a too long time on the same spot or the same room in the film. That made it very much a musical, sometimes so much a musical that one could wonder why it was made a film instead of a normal theater stage act. It must be more action in the picture when music becomes film. After all you see the same thing for several minutes but only the music seems to move via the singing, not the actors.Another issue I had with the film was that Christine looked like a child in make-up which makes it a bit dirty considering the age of the Phantom. She could have been played by a woman instead of a child. I never trust the ""true love"" played by a child pretending to be a grown up. Other than this, yes I will buy the DVD. I am a sucker for musicals and I have everything made by Joel Schumacher on DVD. It will mesmerize me with its beauty and filming many more times. Everything I haven't complained on was utterly awesome and I am thankful I finally got to know it in picture too instead of just hearing it. Ps.Schumacher's best film is and will probably always be Falling Down followed by Phonebooth. Those are true art!",The Phantom of the Opera
745,scheller_2003,All the wrong choices,5,19 February 2005,"Only fans of the Broadway musical may enjoy this failed attempt to repeat the success of ""Chicago"". Director Joel Schumacher made too many wrong choices for the film to work for a broader audience (which helps to explain its middle-range performance at the box office). The cast could have been much better, since there were a lot of actors willing to take part in the screen version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical. Emmy Rossum, as the female lead, is a bland presence, but does not compromise the result. But the leading men are a disaster: Patrick Wilson is inexpressive and unattractive, and Gerard Butler gives a wooden performance as the Phantom (he does not even have a good singing voice to justify the part). Schumacher also has chosen to populate the movie with ""foggy"" scenes to enhance the supernatural aspects of the story. The result, in a scene that takes place in a cemetery, is almost laughable. The scenes that take place in the theater are much better, especially the ones that show people working backstage. To save the movie, there are excellent supporting players (Miranda Richardson is classy as always and Minnie Driver is amusing as an Italian diva). In terms of direction, the only memorable musical number is the one that takes place during ""The Ball of Masks"".",The Phantom of the Opera
746,intouchmedia,A Real Surprise !,8,8 February 2005,"I am not a fan of musicals. Someone dancing down the street in the rain and then bursting out into song does nothing for me. I am even less of a fan of opera - singing that sometimes sounds like a cackling hen does absolutely nothing for me. So I went to see Phantom Of The Opera mainly for the dramatic side of the film, but with a certain amount of trepidation. My wife came too (she doesn't mind musicals, she even likes Camelot !!!!) but was also uncertain about how she would take to the film. We both loved it ! The acting and singing were great - the leading actress was superb (surprised that some people criticize her performance - perhaps they're jealous) - and some great songs and music. Admittedly, the movie may not be everybody's cup of tea, but we'd recommend it. 2004's best film in my opinion.",The Phantom of the Opera

Although I have seen the stage play three times previously, I much preferred the film version because it better explained certain aspects of the plot, and made all the lyrics totally intelligible. The added ending was a pleasant surprise that provided better closure to the story line. Gerald Butler did a fabulous job in his portrayal of the Phantom as a sensitive, emotional and wounded creature with a remarkably sensual side. His voice lent depth and masculinity to the usually bland Phantom vocals. The scenery in the film was beautiful, the costumes lavish, and the music as wonderful as always. This is a film worth seeing more than once...",The Phantom of the Opera
748,disneygirl-2,The Point of No Return,10,22 January 2005,"Once you step into the theater and you get passed the millions of previews you are swept away into a world that is unknown. You start out in the future, well not our future, but you meet Raoul, who is an aged man of around 80, and you meet Madame Giry, who should be around 100 but hasn't appeared to of aged a day.After the Prologue, you enter the Opera House at it's normal time. And instantly you become swept away, and so many emotions are touched in just one picture. The words are almost exact to the musical, and the themes remain present.The casting is wonderful-it's so incredibly perfect, and you cant imagine anyone playing the roles better. The sets and staging and directing are also so wonderful and enchanting. It seems like you are taken back into the 1800s in the days where the Opera House was at it's best.The musical continues, and there's a point where you don't know if you prefer Eric(the Phantom) or Raoul with Christine. Both relationships are so full of passion and fury, and it's so perfectly amazing, that you honestly can't decide.The interpretation of the work is wonderful too. It takes you back to see Giry and Eric as young children, and Giry is the one who brought Eric to the gruesome place in the darkness, but you can see that she is so found of him, and you wonder if there was ever more to them and if Meg is the child of them both.(my personal interpretation).So in conclusion, screw the credit's that get the big bucks, the ones who consider themselves to know so much about art and the magic of the theater, because they don't know crap(unless one managed to give POTO a good review). Go watch it, and see for yourself. Everything becomes to alive, magical, romantic, adventurous, breathtaking, mysterious, eye-dropping, and so much more. Just go and see for yourself.",The Phantom of the Opera

My wife and I think this is one of most effective, most sexually charged and erotic movies we ever saw. It is incredibly romantic and it works in every way. Emmy Rossum is the most talented actress we have seen in years, she just draws us in. We believe a 16 year old would be conflicted between these two men, drawn to one when the other was not there. The fact she was 16 when she got the part and 17 when she made the movie makes these accomplishments even more impressive. And all the parts fit together to make us almost obsessed with the result. Wow. We have seen the play but they have made it an amazing film. The inner workings of the opera are fascinating. It is unfair to compare it to Lon Chaney's silent movie, that was a horror show. This is a romantic tragedy. It is closer to the original novel than that silent film. ten stars.",The Phantom of the Opera

For those of us who didn't have the best seats in the house for the musical, the movie provides an up close look at the actors and the scenery.The casting was great, the costumes magnificent, and the background was a treat. Emmy Rossum was a pleasant surprise as Christine. Her youthful innocence and sweet voice was a perfect combo.

752,KMD2615,Surprisingly good with excellent performances (including Gerard Butler as the Phantom)!,9,3 February 2005,"When I walked into the theater about two months ago and saw the film I had very low expectations, I had never seen the show and I was unfamiliar with the music. However, I really had a good time watching this movie. Although I do not think it is the greatest film of all time, it held me from beginning to end. Some people might argue that Gerard Butler did not have the voice to be the Phantom but I have to say (as a girl) that his charisma, charm, and sex appeal made the movie for me. His voice had a stern, gruff quality that was engaging and emotional. I was able to sympathize with his character even when he was his most unlikeable version of himself. Emmy Rossum is of course lovely and deserves all of the praise that she has won for her role as Christine. I really recommend the Phantom for any viewers looking to have a good time. I know that recently I've been overwhelmed with the understated and sadder films including Million Dollar Baby, Closer, Sideways, Ray, and Finding Neverland that have dominated this movie season. Take a break and watch a film that is loud, vibrant and thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.",The Phantom of the Opera
753,Kviolin4,Visually stunning,8,20 February 2005,"A treat for the eyes and ears. Webber's story has been beautifully adapted to the screen. A + for visuals and Emmy, B+ for the singing, and a C for the phantom and Raoul. While Butler and Wilson are a sight for the eyes, their singing could have been vastly improved. Also, the phantom's face should have looked worse. Did he just have a bad sunburn? However, the stunning visuals, great music, and Emmy's performance make this movie well worth your money. You will be singing the songs for weeks! Fans of the play should enjoy this movie. The story line has been kept to faithfully, with several minor additions. You might even understand the story better.",The Phantom of the Opera

Patrick Wilson is great his singing is so romantic and passionate ,he is a great actor and singer. Over all the movie is beautifully shot but when you see them singing there lips don't match the regret of Voice-Over (if thats the right word) but I loved the movie and I encourage everyone to see it even children it is so warm and heartfelt I really wish it would have gotten more at the box office it really is a wonderful and beautiful movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
755,oranium87,Wow it's was well made,7,6 April 2005,"Well I went to see this movie some time ago. I was singing when I got out of the cinema, the music is of course such a big part and so powerful that it leaves you breathless. But one thing was extremely bad about the whole picture and that was how they dubbed the songs in the movie. You could see it so well that the actors were not singing that it kind of spoiled the movie for you. Gerard Butler did very well in this one in the role of the Opera Ghost. Also I think that Emmy Rossum had many good scenes which made this all good. Also the set is great and the opera is so beautifully made. One think I did not like about this movie that was when you were shown some of the characters many years later, looking at the opera and other things. But the overall work is good and worth to be seen , specally if you are in to operas.Mr. Hawkins",The Phantom of the Opera
756,mikeywuzhere,A Wonderful Experience,10,7 March 2005,"There is so much debate about this film from so many corners. Of course, you have the purists out there who are forever loyal to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and are unwilling to accept any other actor in their place. Then you have the stage enthusiasts who refuse to watch any film adaptation of a musical because it is not a ""live"" performance.Quite frankly, I've seen this story both on Broadway and on film and I can honestly say the experience has been equally extraordinary. At the very least, you have to begin with the exquisite sound of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical score, which for me remains his most passionate masterpiece to date. I was first introduced to the Phantom as a sophomore in high school when we played selections from the score in band. I immediately became hooked and bought the CD's. From there, I spent the next ten years picturing what this show must have looked like on Broadway. Several years ago, my wife and I finally had the opportunity and it was worth every minute of the wait. Crawford and Brightman were long gone, but the soul of the play was still intact: an extraordinary score coupled with a heart-wrenching love story. I was overwhelmed.Seeing the film was just as overwhelming. The best advice I can give anyone is don't go into this film expecting the Broadway show. You're more than likely to leave disappointed. Rather, enter knowing that there is a phenomenal sound that awaits you with a lavish, eye-popping visual parade that will have you completely enchanted. Though many would have preferred Crawford and Brightman to reprise the roles that made them so beloved by fans, the filmmakers managed to bring some new, raw talent to the front. Put simply, Emmy Rossum was a gift from God. She was the right age for Christine, she could act and absolutely stole your heart whenever she sang. As for the Phantom, I thought Gerard Butler did an admirable job. Albeit, they went for the more younger, ""sexier"" Phantom look, I think it worked for today's film audiences. Both of these talented thespians had very tough shoes to fill. Minnie Driver was absolutely delightful as Carlotta. Patrick Wilson had the dashing good looks for Raul but unfortunately lacked the charisma of a knight in shining armor for Christine. Joel Shumacher was the ideal choice to direct this film, combining a skilled visual style with passionate storytelling. There are so many moving moments in this fable which worked on both mediums and it all comes down to a timeless, tragic love story that continues to haunt us long after we've left our seats. So if you continue to say, ""well, he wasn't Crawford"" or ""well, it wasn't the show,"" then you're simply denying yourself a wonderful experience. In this day of assembly line film-making where quantity is demanded more than quality, ""Phantom of the Opera"" allows us to slow down and worship the magic that keeps us going to the movies.",The Phantom of the Opera

Yes Gerard Butler wasn't as good but who is? For an actor who's never sung before he's pretty darn good! After all, who can say they don't fall for the Phantom? As for Patrick Wilson, he's lived up to being the best Tenor on Broadway, as for Emmy Rossum, need I comment?

The beginning transition was impressive. Most of the movie was really good. Emmy Rossum wonderful as Christine. The problem, and its a big problem...was the Phantom.Gerard Butler is terrible. And I like Gerard Butler. His voice was not up for the role, and instead of casting someone who could sing the phantom's part, they allowed him to pretty much scream his high notes. And to a trained ear...someone screaming a high A flat is really upsetting. This to me ruined the movie. Its hard to get into it when you are forced to hear music fed through a cheese grater. They should have pushed for Michael Crawford at least. Many people only heard him on the cast recording, but having heard a bootleg of his final performance, I can see why he was cast to begin with. He was amazing, and he can act. So why not get the man who created the role? All in all, it was a good movie though...I just wish the phantom had been better cast...it left me feeling...blah afterwards...when every time I see it in theatre I leave feeling amazed.",The Phantom of the Opera

I'm really glad I went to see it. Emmy Rossum was phenomenal! I had no idea she wasn't even 18 when the movie was filmed. She presents her character in a way that really makes it come alive. Another big surprise for me was Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Even though his voice wasn't what I believed the phantom's voice should be, his acting definitely made up for it. I was completely drawn into his performance. There were points in the movie where I felt sorry for the phantom and other parts where I wanted to go up to the screen and strangle him. If that isn't the mark of a superior performance, I don't know what is. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has either seen the stage show, which I really want to do now, or to anyone who just wants to see a fantastic musical.

One song, ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" had me in tears.Gerard Butler made a much more tantalizing Phantom than what I imagined from the play.

She made a gorgeous Christine, and I was totally blown away by the fact that she is a trained opera singer.I barely recognized Minnie Driver as Carlotta.The scenes of the movie were both dark and brilliantly illuminated. The tunnels of the opera house flooded with water and candlelight was one of the most amazing scenes on stage and were equally well done in the movie.The story of a love triangle is timeless, and this movie with it's wonderfully scenery, costumes, actors and music tells it with so much emotion, it haunts you long after you leave the theater.",The Phantom of the Opera

His singing and acting was the best of all three.

763,writin_irish,Not as great as all that,5,13 May 2005,"Without question, this is a beautiful film. The cinematography, the sets, the costumes are all gorgeous. The acting, most of the time, is well done. Past that, though, things go downhill. Christine, for example, may have an utterly wonderful voice, but it was apparent that she was deliberately holding back through the entire movie. Her lack of oomph is most noticeable on the high notes, which are fairly painful. She is nothing compared to the Phantom, though, whose voice is clearly untrained. While he may have the potential to be a good singer, he at present should not be attempting to hit even the moderately high notes in his part. How many actors are there in the world who would love to play this role, and they chose one who cannot sing for the massive movie version.The offenses of the other singers are not as major. Meg is guilty of the same sin as Christine, never using her full voice. Raoul acquits himself acceptably, and Firmin has arguably one of the better voices of the lot. As far as the orchestration, however, there comes a question at least as great as the casting of the Phantom. Why, in a Hollywood production with a huge budget, do they use a simulated percussion set instead of the real thing? All in all, it's a very enjoyable movie, but it's not what it could be. Someone just wasn't thinking as they were making it.",The Phantom of the Opera

766,charleskbyrne,Disappointment lies directly on the Phantom's shoulders.,1,5 June 2017,"As I prepare to see another live version of Phantom at the Smith Center here in Vegas, I thought I'd watch the DVD again (""Maybe it's not as bad as I remember""). Now I remember why I justifiably hate this incarnation. First the good things.. 1) Emmy Rossum as ""Christine"". As much as I love Sarah Brightman's portrayal of Christine and her bell-like voice (a requirement for the role), I actually prefer Emmy's ""Christine"" to Brightman's. Part of this is due to the fact that with cinema, you can take advantage of subtlety in facial expressions and Rossum performs those very well. She's is anything but a one-dimensional ingenue! Her voice is excellent, and her acting is stellar. 2) Supporting Cast. The Managers are far more interesting in this version than in the musical. They have fine ""pipes"" and play their characters well. The same for Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry and Minnie Driver as Carlotta. 3) More ""true"" to the original story. The mirrored room, labyrinth, and the Phantom's ""lair"" can be more fully fleshed out on screen than stage. As a film adaptation of the STORY, this is one of the very best, and worth it for that much. 4) Sets, Set Decoration, CGI, costuming. ALL of these are stupendous and exactly what a West End/Broadway-to-Screen spectacle SHOULD be! The opening scene's transition back in time is nearly worth every penny spent on the Blu-Ray. In fact, the entire beginning of the movie - up through ""Little Lotti"" is precisely what you want from a movie adaptation of a musical drama.Then comes ""The Mirror"" and the movie crashes quickly. GERARD BUTLER CAN'T SING to save his life. Sorry but it's true. Oh, he can screech, scream, growl, and under-hit his notes, but he can't sing! This is especially a problem when the character he's playing is supposed to be a MUSICAL VIRTUOSO!! He is a master of music, so when he sings, it should be perfection! Butler sings like someone who is afraid of the notes, hedging them, resorting to patter and yelling instead of belting. I would even have preferred a 61-year- old Michael Crawford to reprise the role. Which brings up the second biggest problem with Butler's casting - he looks too young! Sure, Butler was 35 when he was cast, but with his Hollywood looks, he comes across as early 20's... FAR too young to have become a master architect, designer, musician, and make-up professional! He seems to be a contemporary of Raul rather than an older master. As someone who loves the character in both the film and the book, Butler doesn't do EITHER version justice. He never comes across as a man confident due to his complete control over every situation. In fact (and this blame goes to Joel Schumacher more than Gerard Butler) the entire CHARACTER of the Phantom is a plastic one- dimensional OGRE! The nuance Michael Crawford brought to the role was incredible (and probably responsible for most of the musical's success.) On stage, he is a flawed, loving, though damaged and hurt man. In the movie, there is really no sympathetic side of him - from the moment he brings Christine through the mirror, he is portrayed as a scheming, manipulative, narcissistic stalker-type. The stage presentation, on the other hand, presented a much more complex character struggling with true love, compassion and admiration for Christine (NOT just a drive to possess and ???? her!) I recall an interview where Michael Crawford spoke of intentionally NOT touching Christine because to do so would introduce a ""sleazy"" and ""base"" aspect the Phantom would consider rude and intolerable. This Phantom, on the other hand has his hands all over Christine which makes him creepy. The one part that SHOULD be creepy (the scars below his mask) are SO disappointingly understated, it looks like he had a bad night on the town after beating up his hair-dresser. If the big screen allowed ANYTHING in terms of improving the stage production, it would be in giving a wonderfully vivid, grotesque face to the Phantom. I've seen more frightening visages on a Freddy Kruger doll! Unfortunately, in Phantom Andrew Lloyd Webber does what he seems to do best - ruins a perfectly crafted stage production in their transition to the big screen. He did the exact same thing with Evita (except his major problem there was emasculating Che and making him some kind of jilted ex-lover). In his movies, Webber often improves his female leads while sacrificing his male characters in search of ""box office draw"" - which is the only justification I can see in casting Gerard Butler. The result a beautiful, enchanting feast for the eyes - ruined by a Phantom that is neither true to the character we fell in love with, nor can he carry a solid note in a paper sack. Had someone with even the vocal qualities of Ewan McGregor been cast, my rating would probably have been up between a 7 and a 9 (depending on his performance). But a movie about the Phantom lives or dies by the Phantom himself, and with all the movie has going for it, nothing can save it from Butler's presence as The Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera

It is apparent that Emmy Rossum has spent time in operas herself by the way she portrays Christine Daae, and Minnie Driver is absolutely hilarious as the spoiled leading soprano diva, Carlotta. Gerard Butler (The Phantom) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) are also very good, both vocally and in acting. The scenes are set beautifully and done so artistically with the music that it makes you feel as though you are sitting right there in the Opera Populaire at the production of ""Il Muto""!

It has both action, adventure, great special effects, a story, and the musical score is such that a fan of classical, rock, pop, and even opera itself can enjoy. Andrew Llyod Webber knows how to make music rock and carry a tune, Joel Schumacher certainly proved he can direct thus redeeming himself of the 'Batman' fiasco. Such songs provoke both wonder and strike at the imagination. Gerald Butler's interpreting of the Phantom himself stirs memories of the ancient classics of both Lon Cheney and Bela Logousi and his singing is extraordinary. Emmy Russum is the perfect Christine, and you could see the enjoyment on her face as she sang the various songs. And Minnie Driver does a superb job as the often pompous and extremely out of tune 'Diva.' Having seen the actual play on Broadway, I will certainly say, the movie is BETTER. Enjoy!

Much attention to details and the human experience, including our innermost conflicts and strangeness.This is a tragedy in which there are no real winners.

771,DorothyLWM,A masterpiece!!,10,13 September 2005,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is (as always) breath-taking and beautiful. Emmy Rossum does a lovely job with her part, and her voice is a delight. The supporting actors did a very good job of rounding out the story, the musical number ""Masquerade"" displaying a wonderful piece of coordination by the actors/singers. Gerard Butler's performance is intense, sensual, and perfect. His heartfelt renditions of his musical numbers are haunting and beautiful, and his portrayal of the Phantom evokes feelings of empathy, and indeed, love for the lonesome, lovelorn man behind the mask. I think this is the message the original author was trying to get across: that to lose the love and genius of a man because we can't overlook an unearned physical flaw is a tragedy, and creates more tragedies. Mr. Butler's performance of this role indicates that he understood this, and knew how to relay it. I predict a long, successful career for this highly talented actor. I have only just been made aware of his work, and will certainly watch for more.",The Phantom of the Opera
772,tjb286,"Classic Love triangle between rising soprano star, her young childhood sweetheart, and a disfigured phantom.",5,23 October 2005,"This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The casting decisions were bogus. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler's redeeming quality is their stunning beauty, for they possesses no talent for acting or music. No amount of auto-tuning or other studio tricks could've saved the vocal performances of the handsome couple. All they could do was transpose their music down a third and pray for the best. The films credibility was saved by the antics of Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, and Patrick Wilson (even though I think he was miscast).Joel Schumacher also managed to make crap out of a great show. Instead of capitalizing on the performances of the opera scenes within the show, and the fact that some of the music is damn hard to sing, he keeps taking you attention away from the performers, and the spectacle that makes Phantom so opulent. Songs like ""Masqerade"" need to be beautiful, rich and exhilarating, instead of another opportunity for monochromatic fluff in the form of a can-can-line with chorus members dressed like a deck of cards. There was also some sloppy editing when it came to dubbing over the soundtrack. There was many a time when sustained notes continued to float beyond the image of some fifty closed-mouthed performers. On top of all of this, the soundtrack contains so much reverb it's hard to appreciate any kind of demonstration of musical excellence that may or may not have been present. However, the reverb disguises the sub-par performances of the singers: One of the film's few plus-es. Another plus is that everyone is really young and attractive, legitimizing the love triangle. A young Christine paired with a 54 year old Phantom has grown weary. And finally: even if the film sucks, at least it's unintentionally, hysterically funny.",The Phantom of the Opera

However,Christine has another man in her life,Raoul(Patrick Wilson)The Vicomte De Chagny.The Phantom sees this as a betrayal and will do anything to get Christine back. This film version is a lot better than the stage musical w/ Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.Emmy Rossum was the perfect choice for Christine.She is absolutely beautiful and has a beautiful,angelic singing voice to go with it.She steals the film,and her voice is much better than Brightman's.Gerard Butler is simply wonderful as The Phantom.Though he isn't a conventional singer,he brings a lot of manliness to the role.The Phantom is supposed to have a rugged sounding voice,not high-pitched.Gerard is definitely a better Phantom than Michael Crawford(Crawford doesn't bring any manliness to the role).Many don't believe he is the right guy for the role because he is a good-looking guy.The best scenes/songs in the film are Overture,Think Of Me,The Mirror,The Phantom of the Opera,Music of the Night,All I Ask of You,Masquerade,Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,Wandering Child,Point Of No Return,Down Once More/Track Down this Murderer.

I've never seen the stage show, but I definitely plan on seeing it, and I'm sure I'll love it just as much as the movie. Everything was magnificent, from the sets, to the costumes, and most especially the actors. Emmy Rossum perfectly portrayed a young, innocent, dreamy Christine, and her voice is phenomenal! Gerard Butler was fantastic, and despite what others say, his voice was a wonderful change from the more ""traditional"" voices of the previous Phantoms. And his acting, especially at the end, is flawless and heart-breaking. He really emphasizes the emotional aspect of this tortured soul. Patrick Wilson was great as Raoul, and Jennifer Ellison was lovely as Meg. Minnie Driver cracked me up as Carlotta, as did the managers at times. Overall this movie is magnificent and didn't get the respect it deserves from critics. A definite 10 out of 10!",The Phantom of the Opera

The music was unbelievable it took my breath away I cannot stop watching this movie I will never get bored of it. The passion the Phantom has for Christine was..... I cant even put in words. They picked a wonderful cast they all played their parts perfect I also liked that the cast sang all their parts thats wonderful. I heard all the bad reviews about the movie and you know what those people are so uptight the movie was great!!!!!!!!! there have been changes made for the movie but thats okay they were for the best. They did a wonderful job bringing this movie to the big screen. It just gave people the chance to experience what the play was about because some people cant afford to go to a play or its just not playing in their state So thank you for letting us experience the passion of this movie.,The Phantom of the Opera
776,larientherocker,Opera is now Totally Cool!,9,19 February 2006,"The Phantom of the Opera is an amazing movie about a disfigured man living in seclusion in an opera house. He becomes quite attached to Christine Daae, who is a dancer at the opera house, and teaches her to sing. He falls in love with Christine and that seems to cause a lot of trouble, especially when Christine becomes reunited with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul.The music in this movie is incredible! Even if you cannot stand opera, you will be able to appreciate the musical talent of these actors. The lyrics are equally beautiful.I cannot offer comparison with the actual opera, but I can guarantee that you will not feel like you wasted about two hours of your life.Overall, this is a great movie. It is a romance, a fantasy, a thriller, and a bit of a comedy. You will hopefully love this movie and (even if you don't like the opera) feel as if it has benefited you, if even in the smallest degree.",The Phantom of the Opera

I watched the movie with another friend and I was very surprised, because normally I don't like these Opera kind of things. Then I watched it in London at ""Her majesties theater"" and I simply loved the hole piece. I went home, found some of the melodies and fell in love with music. I bought the DVD for myself and have seen it many times so far and I still love the music. I even found the hole wonderful soundtrack and hear it a lot. Some of my friends think I'm crazy, but I feel that anyone who haven't seen this movie is really missing something great. So get out and borrow it, see it a couple of times and listen to this fantastic ""music of the night"".

The way the entr'actes were merged into the action was just great! The only 'but', for me, was Gerald Butler's lack of strenght in his voice. His interpretation was brilliant, full of mention as it should be, but perhaps he hadn't had time to strenghten his voice, who knows?

779,rgross,I just don't see the love for this movie,4,16 August 2005,"I am a HUGE fan of musicals in general, and Webber and POA in particular, but this is NOT a good adaption. Schumacher was proud to state that he had never seen this or ANY musical before and it shows. This should have been a no-brainer. An intensely popular musical with great cinematic sets and scenes to boot, yet it is a mess.The musical scenes are a mess with all kinds of stuff sort of edited together. I KNOW the horse is a nod to the book, but the way Christine just suddenly shows up on it in the middle of the scene looks silly and pointless.You never really believe the effect the Phantom has on Christine.Her nightgown belonged in Mulion Rouge.The Phantom did NOT need a circus freak background. It TOTALLY changed his motivation from the play.The guys doing the bizarre Robot/Vogue dancing in the Masquerade piece were silly beyond belief.The cemetery set with the 30 foot high headstones looked like they belonged in Batman or maybe Disney's Haunted Mansion.Once his face is reveled the Phantoms make-up and hair color constantly change. Scars come and go, hair gets light and dark (AFTER the wig has come off).Most of it just comes across silly. I know I keep overusing that word, but it best sums up the production. The Phantom deserved a better film treatment. Whether you liked Evita or not, I personally feel it was a better adaption of Webber's work to the big screen.Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.",The Phantom of the Opera

The phantom was too young and handsome for the movie to even make sense if you came to this without knowing the GL book and the ALW stage version, then doing some mental double-takes to ""fill in"" or ""correct"" the confusing parts of the movie-fied story. The lyrics/dialogue about the Phantom's ""hideousness"" are completely nonsensical...you have to imagine this, given that he looks quite dapper. Replacing the full red-death mask for a small eyes-patch in the Masquerade scene also made little dramatic sense: The Phantom was supposed to be a mysterious, intimidating ""Opera Ghost"", but here he appears as a well groomed master of ceremonies who's a little peeved with the audience. No mystery at all. Christine was indeed ""confused"" looking throughout the film, and did not enunciate clearly when she had to sing high. The Phantom lost his pitch and timbre when he had to sing low.",The Phantom of the Opera

I've still got goosebumps...Went to see Phantom of the Opera last night and although I'd been told that it should be good, part of me wondered at the choice of performers...Gerard Butler as the Phantom seemed odd, but then again I'd never heard him sing, only speak with an odd sort of Irish accent.Emmy Rossum... newcomer to the scene and another voice I'd not heard sing, only speak, though I knew she was recording some vocal tracks somewhere, somehow.And Minnie Driver as Carlotta... the drama queen diva...I was blown away.Sure, it wasn't Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman but damn... they were good. They were better than good.Emmy portrayed the grace and charm and naivete of ingenue Christine Daae with ease and ran the gamut of emotions, pulling us into her world.And Gerard, both seductive and scary, enchanting and eerie, handsome and hideous. And that voice... from gentle croon to a powerful roar...This is a definite buy when it gets released.I joked with my friend, saying that I wondered if we'd have a Toccata and Fugue as an intro... They outdid themselves by playing the main theme but in such powerful tones on the organ accompanied by a reverse time lapse of the ruined old theatre regaining it's former beauty that I went cold, shocked into silence, in awe.My friend had to keep nudging me to stop singing along during the movie. It wasn't 100% accurate to the theatre production and it was done as a series of long flashbacks, but it was one of the best theatre productions turned musical that I've seen in years.I can heartily suggest that if you haven't seen it, and you enjoy good theatre performance, then go see it.As for me, I can see myself singing the songs for some time to come...",The Phantom of the Opera

Schumacher just doesn't have what it takes to handle a big-budgeted musical. His Raoul is emasculated, his Christine's acting equates to deer-caught-in-headlights big eyes, and Gerard Butler's valiant attempt to save his role fails.The singing is off-synch with lips moving in other directions than the words, and the changes to the story don't make sense. The movie ends with the opera house burning down, but when the story opens in the opera house years later no evidence of a fire exists.

783,kirby-21,A visual and sensual feast!!!!,10,8 February 2005,"We had seen only the original silent movie, not the stage play, (or even the soundtrack) before going. So we knew not what to expect. But at the very opening, as the long-dead chandelier rises to life, swinging in what seems like one endless arc, and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life, and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good. And it was. When it comes to sets, scenery and cinematography, they spared no expense. Every scene is drenched in rich detail. At the risk of sounding the heretic, I must say that a movie version removes the limitations of space and time to set up the stage, and so has the upper hand in the scenery and sets department. Some of these shots must have taken weeks to compose, and I'm glad they invested the time. The music is just wonderful. I'd dare say that even if you are not a musical fan, if you are at least romantically inclined, you will LOVE this movie. By the end of some songs, like, ""All I ask of you"" I'm restraining myself from singing the song out loud with them! The movie kind of departs from the setting of the original silent movie, in which the Phantom is actually quite hideous. This Phantom is more ""mysterious"" than hideous. But the attraction between him and Christine is pure, raw sensual. I mean it borders on erotic it's so strong. During ""Past the point of no return"" I'm sitting there with my wife, literally falling under the spell myself. ""Yea... maybe she *should* be with this guy after all..."" But that's the whole point. She WAS influenced by him, and he did cast a strong spell, and he was very alluring. The movie made it so real I was beginning to feel it myself. Some people have derided Gerard Butler's performance. Frankly, I find his throaty, sometimes raspy voice to be right on par. I heard so much ado about Michael Crawford that I went to Amazon and listened to some of his renditions of these songs. Verdict: Give me Gerard Butler! His voice is masculine, seductive, and hypnotic. In the final verdict, I find the movie versions of these songs to be FAR superiour to the Broadway versions. I say ""Bravo!"" to the selection of Gerard.Definitely worth seeing in a theatre if you can. Don't wait for the DVD. See it BIG and LOUD. My favs: Masquerade! ""All I ask of you,"" and ""Point of No Return."" Wow... Point of no return had ME believing!!!!What raging passion floods the soul,what rich desire unlocks its door,what sweet seduction lies before us, ...past the point of no return...Oh yeah, that's the stuff!",The Phantom of the Opera

There seriously was not one show stopping number and all the music just blended together. This is a sing though type of musical and the dialog is delivered in a monotonous sing song delivery that had me ready to slit my wrists. If this is really the best that Andrew Lloyd Webber can do...then he's a hack....the music was boring I had not seen the play and really had no idea what the actual story line was.

Whether or not you like musicals, this movie is sure to be one that you will never forget---> For good reasons. I encourage everyone to see it. You will be lost instantly in a world of beauty, madness, horror, magic, and love. And, if you are like most people I know who have seen this movie, you will never want it to end.

When i watched this for the first time, i immediately fell in love with it. The basic love story between the characters was sooo watchable and beautiful!! I fell in love with the Phantom (played by Gerald Butler) he played the part amazingly and he can sing which was even better! The writing and direction of the film is TOP NOTCH, i really felt part of the film (which may sound sad, but thats what i like about films - they make you feel as if your there, watching in the shadows!) Though i must confess, i have now watched this film about a million times and i still love it, just singing along to the songs and listening to the words and the fabulous orchestral music!!!

But he's just lonely and misunderstood, i mean his face isn't that bad just keep the mask on and you'll be fine!! ;) The whole production of the film is unbelievable; the sets, costumes, music, cast, choreography, and singing.

788,ghostreveries,"Haunting, achingly beautiful",10,25 July 2006,"Joel Schumacher's version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical ""Phantom of the Opera"" is beautiful in every sense of the word. Sets and costumes are periodically appropriate and glamorous, cinematography is unique and impressive, especially the wipes from black and white to colour make you gasp for breath. Webber's music on the big screen is a delight with the lush, rich tones played by a huge orchestra, which is able to deliver the textures and nuances of Webber's music. The story is tragic, beautiful, and thought provoking with themes that echoes those present in today's society.Fans of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford need not feel disappointed for Christine and the Phantom are in capable hands. The talented Emmy Rossum as Christine is a wonderful soprano, brings the right amount of innocence and curiosity to the role, and provides perfect chemistry with Gerard Butler, who as the Phantom really shined in this film. Butler never ceases to amaze me with his acting capabilities and he gives the audience much to rejoice about his performance. Butler's phantom is sexy, mysterious, ominous, but most importantly, the phantom is portrayed most effectively as a tormented soul who fails to express properly his obsessive love for Christine and is tragically stripped of the right for love due to his deformity. There has been some criticism of Butler's voice, but it is necessary that his voice be able to provide the rock and roll sentimentality that is often lacking in stage versions and Butler impressively delivers the phantom's feelings through every note and every pitch. I was able to feel everything the phantom was experiencing through Butler's voice alone, which in my opinion, was the most important essence of the phantom as opposed to a nice incantation because after all, the phantom is a composer, NOT a singer. The only person whose performance is slightly under-par in comparison is that of Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul. Wilson has a very smooth, silky voice and is quite lyrical but his acting is comical. Although Minnie Driver as Carlotta was joyous INTENTIONAL comic relief, the character of Raoul made me laugh even more with his static expressions and blank stares throughout the movie. In the scene ""All I Ask of You"", although Wilson sounded perfect, he looked like he was serenading his grandma rather than the love of his life. However, Wilson's acting does not impact the film too negatively, as he was able to portray a heroic Raoul opposite that to the dangerous Phantom. Honourable mention to the supporting cast who also provided strong performances to enhance those of the leads.""Phantom of the Opera"" is timeless, addicting, gorgeous, heart-breaking. Upon first view, I remember the movie lurked in my mind for weeks and I couldn't help paying big bucks to own the DVD. I guarantee you it is worth every penny.",The Phantom of the Opera

Minnie driver was particularly funny in her exaggerated depiction of the envious, ""diva-complex"" la Carlota, and the luminescent Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson's rendition of ""all i ask of you"" was certainly unforgettable, magnificent mood of the setting, voice and all. but i think Gerard butler's portrayal of the phantom topped my list. it was a far cry from the usual depiction of the lovelorn phantom as grotesque and diabolical. he was rather seen as a victim than a villain. in fact, i gravitate more to his persona than to any of the characters in the film. moreover, there is something about Gerard butler's portrayal of the phantom that gave him that touch of sexiness reminiscent of Antonio Banderas--that dark, brooding mysterious vibe that i find rather alluring...all in all, if not for certain flaws in the film remake, i would have given it a perfect 10, but i think i'd settle for 8.",The Phantom of the Opera

But that did not stop me loving this movie. The sets are gorgeous and lush, providing an incredible backdrop for a fantastic story. The stage was a little too small to be credible as the actual stage in an opera house, but otherwise, the set design was absolutely perfect. My main problems with the movie involved the casting. Gerard Butler did a fantastic job, don't get me wrong: his acting moved me to tears and his voice, while not exactly up to par with some of the stage actors, was pretty awesome. However, he was a little too young for the part, which is supposed to be played by a somewhat older man, and he is not believably creepy. Let's keep in mind that the original Phantom of the Opera was an aging, sick, psychotic genius, something straight out of an old Technicolor horror movie. There is only one scene where Butler comes across as satisfyingly creepy, and that is the scene in the catwalks during Il Muto. Patrick Wilson, an actor whom I quite like, was really too wimpy for the part of Raoul. Emmy Rossum was fabulous, and so was the rest of the cast. The sound of the movie in general was fantastic.

793,Aragorn450,Absolutely Amazing!,9,24 December 2004,"I completely loved The Phantom of the Opera and will be going at least once more. Of course, I'm a big fan of the music (it's been going through my head all day today and last night) and the play so I'm just glad that the movie was faithful to both./**RANT** On that note however, there are a few things to mention. If you don't like musicals, don't bother going. You won't like it as there are VERY few speaking parts. Also, if you didn't like the play, don't bother going. Lastly, if you don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber, DON'T GO.I'm mentioning this because there are numerous comments (and reviewers for major publications) that are complaining that it:1) Contains too much music. - That's the point of a MUSICAL 2) Too much like the play. - Um... what did you expect? It's based off the script of the play... 3) Andrew Lloyd Webber had too much of a hand in it. - Well, the play IS his so again, what did you expect? That's like saying you didn't like Star Wars because George Lucas was involved.And if your views are one of the above, please don't bother writing a comment either, it just shows that you wasted your money on a movie you should have known you wouldn't like if you'd thought about it and are annoyed about it. **RANT**/I have to admit, I was apprehensive about Emmy Rossum being cast as Christine because I wasn't sure of her singing capabilities but she certainly proved me wrong! She has an AMAZING voice and was perfectly complimented by Gerard Butler (The Phantom).The part of Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson was also well done, but his voice was just not as good as Emmy or Gerard's. He did a good job of playing the part of a love-struck ""rich boy"" however. And speaking of acting, Emmy and Gerard again were perfect. The chemistry was excellent there and there was no doubt of the infatuation he had for her and the love she had for his company.All in all, it was a very well-done production and I will be highly recommending it to all of my friends.",The Phantom of the Opera

I love the music, people who complain about hearing the same thing over and over again need to get over it, the phantom's theme song is the theme song of the movie. When ever the phantom enters, or something 'big' happens, you should expect to hear that theme. It is such a powerful piece, as is all the other songs in the musical. I thought the actors did a good job, though I don't see why they casted Minnie Driver in the piece. I would have chosen a performer who could sing her part- I hated the song at the end of the movie sung by Minnie Driver. I also think that the actors did a swell job of singing, although I wish they would haven't lip synced to their own voices- too many times I saw them mess up and their lips not match their words. I think they did fine casting everyone, but I don't think that the Phantom was portrayed correctly. He was supposed to be an older, evil, hideous genius with a soft spot for Christine. In the movie, he was too handsome, making me wonder why Christine didn't choose him over Raoul. Gerard Butler was way too hot for this role, he didn't even look that bad wearing his 'ugly' face.Many people have complained that Raoul is too big of a sissy. That is how he is supposed to be- a snobby little rich boy, weak and cowardly. Hot-headed and a wimp. Yes, that is the Raoul the book portrays. And even being a big wuss, he stills wins the girl because he offers her a chance to live and be free. Despite casting Minnie Driver in the movie, the terrible lip syncing, and the way too hot phantom (not that that's always a bad thing) I greatly enjoyed this movie. You must forget about everything and let the music take over. That is why the phantom is supposed to have such a big effect over Christine, his 'music of the night' sweeps her off her sleep and puts her in a trance. Yes, the stage version is much better than the movie, but it is still worth seeing.

When it was over, and woke up, my husband said it would have been cheaper to buy sleeping pills compared to what he had paid for the tickets.Several years later, we went to the movies (December 2004), we looked at the list of movies and Phantom was on there. Hubby said ""No Way"". We both laughed remembering the experience in New York. So we went in to see Lord of the Rings.Last night we watched a movie on cable TV (HBO) and the Phantom of the Opera was the next movie. My hubby said ""Leave it on, it'll help me fall asleep"" We laughed.Needless to say, we both had are eyes fixed on the screen. I had chills up and down my spine and tears spewing out of my eyes. We couldn't believe how good this movie version was. We stayed up all night talking about it(wink wink). Today he brought home the DVD for me.The staging and costumes were superb. The performances were mesmerizing. I suppose the Production company/Director wanted newer, fresher, younger actors for newer audiences. They made a great choice. I didn't know anyone in this cast besides Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. I looked up the others on the internet. Emmy's portrayal was exceptionally fresh. Rauol's terrific. But I can't say enough about the Phantom's (Gerard Butler). His voice was just what his character is, not the doldrum voice of a trained tenor. Not to mention that sexy bod, piercing blue eyes, and incredible acting abilities. His performance was so good, I found myself wishing that Rauol would die in the sword fight and the Phantom would win Christine. lol. If I were Christine, I would have pulled his pants off instead of his mask at the end of Point Of No Return. Wahoo!Bravo to the people who put this movie together and made it work for us who need ""No-Doze"" to make it through plays.",The Phantom of the Opera
797,patredkitty,Gerard Butler will always be The Phantom,10,25 November 2006,"I totally fell in Love with Gerard and The Phantom I wished that had made a alternate ending with Christine staying with him ,I have watched the DVD at least a 100 times and I still cry at the end when she gives the ring back to him .I could feel his pain and feel his heart breaking you just want to hold him and tell him you will stay with him.It is by far the best movie I have seen in my life and every time I listen to CD in my car I go into a trance of course I am not driving He will always be there singing songs in my head. Since ""Phantom"" I have bought almost every movie he is in.The First time I saw Phantom was on the big screen and I wanted to go back and see it but I never got a chance but I have more than made up for it with the DVD.I cn't hardly wait until Mar 9 2007 to see 300",The Phantom of the Opera
798,pjcthepanda,The best film musical I have seen.,10,24 August 2006,"My boyfriend had been to see the show in London in January 2005 and he came back and explained the story. We played a copy of the original cast recording and I immediately loved the music and have played it many times since then. Unfortunately the cinema where we lived was no longer showing the film so I had to wait until it came out on DVD in May 2005. We saw the trailer to say it was out and rushed down the video shop to buy a copy. I have always enjoyed film musicals and can honestly say that this is the best film musical I have ever seen. I thought the sets and costumes were beautifully designed with so much detail paid to everything. All the performances were fantastic but the actor who really stood out for me was Gerard Butler in the lead role, especially as I read that he was not a trained singer and took lessons especially for the part. His emotional rock tenor voice made it easy for you to tell when he was upset or angry and I really felt for his character. Emmy Rossum has a lovely voice as Christine and I actually prefer her voice to Sarah Brightman who was the original Christine in the show. I am looking forward to going to see the show in London soon but in the meantime, I have spent many enjoyable evenings singing along to this film. A fantastic evening's entertainment.",The Phantom of the Opera
799,Marcail,"Creates its own magic, but lacks the sustaining passion of the stage",6,27 December 2004,"Emmy Rossum fairs well as Christine, she has the ""gaze at the phantom with awe"" look down pat, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul has an impressive vocal talent, but I fear Gerard Butler's own vocal prowess leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, I love Mr. Butler as an actor, and his voice wasn't horrible, but he just didn't have quite the skill to manipulate the wide range and still possess the appropriate passion in the words. The singing on his part was unpredictable. Many of the songs were just beautiful, while others had me gripping the arms of my chair hoping he didn't strain himself too greatly. This circumstance drawing me completely out of the movie moments into ""critic"" mode. Having seen the stage production several times (though many have seen it more than my mere eight times), I was impressed with the clever changes allowed by movies that typically constrain the stage, but the use of flashbacks used to move from scene to scene felt stilted. More elements of the book, for those who have read the book, are also included, which was a nice touch. Overall, those who have not seen the stage version should be well pleased. Those who have seen the stage version should be forewarned that this movie lacks the stage luster.",The Phantom of the Opera
800,library_ghost,Where is my Punjab Lasso? AND my rotten tomatoes?,3,8 September 2006,"To start off, I was extremely disappointed with the casting. The production team wanted a ""younger, sexier"" phantom. Let us not forget though, that our friend the Phantom was not a very young man and was incredibly, horrifyingly, disgustingly U-G-L-Y. By taking away that element, the story line cheapens and the plot thins. Gerard's voice is not well trained, and lacks the power and flexibility to represent an ""angel of music."" Emmy Rossum's voice followed suit. I've heard all about how she was in a children's chorus at the Met, but her performance was terrible. I doubt if she is a soprano. For instance, in the song ""Think of Me"" at the line ""..trying to hard to put you from my mind"" she hits a terribly off-key note. Through out the rest of the movie, her voice squawks and shifts pitch; she sings from her throat, not her chest or abdomen. If I was the Phantom, I would probably be forced to punjab her.Let's also take note that although this story is set in France, the only person with a a french accent is Mme. Giry. For some reason, most of the other characters speak with an English accent. As for the rest, shall we start in the beginning?I don't understand why this movie insists on changing from BW to color. I suppose it adds clarity to time period switching, but I find the *flashblack* / *flashforward* a little tiresome. THe auction also is strange- we are left to assume that this ""Madame Giry"" is Meg, as the elder Giry would be older that Raoul.The overture was the best part of this film. IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY. To its credit, this version does have the BEST orchestrations for any ALW.Moving along...The date for the ""Strange affair of the Phantom of the opera"" is actually around 1880, not 1870 (see The Essential Phantom of the Opera by Leonard Wolf for further discussion on this matter).For ""Hannibal,"" I don't see why the ballet was dressed like a troupe of belly dancers. Victorian Paris would have been shocked,to say the least. And the skull seal is over-doing it, even for our man in the mask. In ""The Phatnom of the Opera"" Christine's clothes are a bit...scanty. If I were to visit an Angel, I doubt I would do it in a corset and garters. And how does her eyeshadow magically change?Then, we have some silly cape swirling and a swan bed. I don't want to talk about the swan bed...it was stupid. So was his little doll house.The Masquerade was another excellent part of this movie. The dancing was very nice, though the man who vouges still confuses me. I liked the edition of the torture chamber (the room of mirrors). But I don't like how Mme. Giry springs our defenseless little Phantom from the sideshow. If he was a genius, he could have figured it out himself. Next, we come to ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again."" Neither Raoul (who appears in a thin dress shirt) nor Christine (who wears a very low-cut dress) seems to notice that it is snowing. And what was with the fog? We aren't in Scotland people! The rest of this scene screams out two words ""ELECTRA COMPLEX""!!""Don Juan:"" I think the Phantom's mask shrunk to it's smallest in this scene, and lo and behold, when it is removed, a whole wad of his hair goes with it! Finally, why does he break all those mirrors? 21 years of bad luck for you, buddy.FINThere's more nitpicky stuff where that came from too. Don't tempt me to post it all.",The Phantom of the Opera
801,MamzelleLilliette,"An exquisite, sensuous, haunting story, does Leroux proud!",10,27 January 2007,"Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber worked in collaboration to produce this cinematic production of 'the Phantom of the Opera', so for all of you who want to insult the performances or filming of this portrayal, how could any made decisions be wrong with the actual director of the original musical constantly on set? Ever since I bought this film on DVD all I have heard is insult after insult after insult about it, especially insults directed at the Scottish actor Gerard Butler, who was bestowed with the leading role. I watched this film after a small fascination with the original story and the music of Sarah Brightman, and was astounded at the level of iridescent, sumptuous and theatrical beauty. The costumes are embedded with precious jewels, the theatre itself is styled-as if by the Phantom himself-with alluring golden Pre Raphaelite nudes and chilling skulls. The music of 'the Phantom of the Opera'is glorious enough, but here is has been perfected and enchanted-not to mention accompanied by a full scale royal orchestra!Emmy Rossum's beauty as Christine Daae is a beauty rarely seen nowadays in this world of plastic surgery and Pamela Anderson. She portrays enchanting chastity and innocence,like Botticelli's Venus, yet her awakening into woman hood is depicted by her with immaculate and ethereal sensuality. Her voice is not like that of your average soprano-low, loud and quite frankly over the top. Her vocals float and ripple like birdsong, and anybody can understand why she enchants her audience and the Phantom so much.The Phantom himself, due to Gerard Butlers magnificent acting skills, manifests the theatre all the time, even when he's not there. What Gerard Butler has done is a vast achievement; he has made sure that the Phantom is indeed 'there inside your mind', You feel his presence surrounding you constantly as if you were Christine; his aura makes you feel frightened and seduced all at once, and thats not just down to his smooth,gold face and his dark, enigmatic sensual energy. It is also down to his voice. Michael Crawford had the voice of a crabby pensioner that made you wonder how a beautiful woman could EVER be fascinated by it. Gerard Butler's voice is not full scale opera, but if it was, he would sound like Piangi-just like in Rossums case, actual operatic vocals would NOT befit this character. And Gerard Butler has a fabulous voice, that combines irresistible rock-and-roll sensuousness with flowing, rich, opulent masculinity. I can't understand why ANYONE would say he cannot sing full stop! Last time I saw him he was in 'Reign of Fire' with Christian Bale, a minor role. Now he's here, portraying the Phantom of the Opera. He is a wonderful, majestic actor who deserves more praise for his work.I can remember watching in awe and admiration as the Phantom drew Christine down into the catacombs of the theatre, yearning to be in her position, wondering at this mans inexplainable beauty and enigma.Another thing about Gerard Butler is that, unlike previous Phantom's who make the character look like a 2D cardboard cutout, he actually brings all the Phantom's emotions to the surface. He manages to portray lust, tragedy, sorrow, passion, love and murderous madness all at once with alluring dexterity. He also accentuates the Phantom's darkness, his genius and wisdom in optical illusions and his master abilities with theatre in general. He shows us that the Phantom is a maestro, and the Paris Opera House is his domain, in which the players and patrons are at HIS mercy. This is not the stage version. If you cannot stand the opinions and portrayals of anybody else other than Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, go and see the actual stage version. This is not just a magnificent vision of Gaston Leroux's famous novel and A.L.Webber's musical-it is also a fabulous film in its own right.",The Phantom of the Opera

They did like it even though it's a ""musical"", so I consider that a win.

It just didn't come across on the screen as it did on stage and I was not swept away as I'd hoped to be. Although the three lead performances were good, I thought Minnie Driver was badly miscast and couldn't pull off the diva/comic relief of Carlotta. In fact, all of the supporting cast was weak. And the dancing seemed way too modern (Madonna ""Vogue""-ing) and out of place. With a Baz Luhrmann-type director, a more raw, real setting intead of the elaborate overblown sets, and a more mature Christine, I think this could have been fantastic. It seems that Shumacher decided to film the play instead of adapting the play to film. I still teared up in the final scenes.

I have been studying film for years and even though I tried to view this stage to film adaptation with an open mind and a forgiving attitude I can't help but feel like it was a waste of time.Lets start with the positives. Sets, costumes, makeup and lighting were amazing. Singing and music were fantastic (as they should be!) Everything else about this film was lackluster. The acting was paper thin. No Characterization. After the first ten minutes of the film you will know all there is to know about these people and the director gives us no reason to care about their story or what happens to them. They delivered their lines worse than the bad guys in action movies. I felt as though the director of photography was OK. But that can't carry a film. I kept feeling like the people who worked on this film knew they hadn't made a movie but they had a cool set and they kept showing it to us as if they were trying to impress us. The plot was boring and had nothing to add depth or excitement.The first ten minutes of the film were awful. They show a guy getting into a wheel chair and peoples shoes and a robot monkey. Horrible hook for a movie. The camera work was pointless and did not carry the scene or reveal plot details. When they introduce us to the characters they have already lost our interest. THe movie crawls along at a snails pace and doesn't ever build to accomplish anything moving, intense, or exciting. Lots of downtime, wasted shots and poor editing.

I reluctantly took it.That evening I sat down with my parents to watch it. It took a while to get started and at first I was thinking about turning it off. But not long after I found myself hooked. The movie surprisingly had sucked me right in and I was so pleased that I had actually watched it.However, my parents thought differently. My father didn't mind it but said that he would probably never watch it again. My mother, on the other hand, didn't like it at all. She called it 'boring'. And by the end of it she was nearly asleep.Overall, I loved the movie and I think that people should put their thoughts of operatic music aside and watch the film anyway.

Given that the stage version is so amazing, I was uncertain whether the story would translate well onto the screen. However, my trepidations were swept aside soon enough.If one were to attend the film expecting the exact same experience as would be found sitting in the audience of the live performance, then one *might* come away disappointed. There is surround sound instead of a live orchestra playing in the symphony pit, there is the smell of popcorn instead of dry ice and warm bodies. However, if one goes to the film hoping to see the best parts of the stage musical translated into a screen rendition, then there is much to be savoured.The music is, as anticipated, powerful and beautiful. It is ""the Phantom"" - enough said. But there are a number of other features that this film boasts which merit mention. The cinematography, costumes, sets, and colours are all chosen with what is undoubtedly a specific purpose: to bring the extravagant age of nineteenth century Parisian opera to brilliant life, as well as create an aura of deep mystery and phantasmogorical otherworldliness. The film is so exquisitely textured that it almost feels at times to be a physical sensation to watch it. All of these things in combination with the awe-inspiring music create a lush sensuality on screen that frequently took my breath away.The Phantom of the Opera continues to dazzle on screen as it does on stage.

811,beautiful_midnight,Visually and Aurally the Best Screen Musical in a Decade,9,14 January 2005,"Since I was about 12 years old, I've had a deep seated love for the Phantom of the Opera. I knew all the words and loved the story they portrayed, but because of where I lived, I only knew the musical through the soundtrack, and never got to see the stage show. I always wondered though how such a lush story could be told from the stage alone.When I heard that Phantom would be gracing the big screen, I was thrilled. Having now seen the film twice, I can honestly say that it is one of the best film musicals I have seen in the last ten years.Visually, the film was pitch perfect. The colours, the costumes (I hope for an Oscar for these costumes), the choreography, it was all sensational. The music itself was greatly helped by the digital surround, for that reason alone I recommend the film be seen in the theatre at least once. The sound and spectacle is really astounding in the theatre setting.I did, despite my raves, have some qualms with the film. If you are at all used to either the London or Toronto cast recordings of Phantom, it will take you at least a half hour to adjust yourself to the singing of the actors. Another small issue I had was the altering of some verses, and the decision to make previously sung parts into spoken ones. Regardless, the film didn't lose anything through these changes, they were just things that existing fans might be put off by, as I was.The performances themselves were for the most part ""theatrical."" Emmy Rossum was the only actor of the three leads who really stood out as being remarkable, and I hope she will receive at least an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Christine. Gerard Butler, as handsome as he is, was all about the swagger and cape tossing for the better part of the film. He did win me over in the end, once unmasked, by giving a wrenchingly sad performance. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was fairly plain in his role, but you fall in love with him anyway. Minnie Driver was a little over the top for my tastes, I thought Carlotta could have been done her diva rights without seeming ridiculous, but no such luck.All in all, Phantom is what movies were made to be. Sight, spectacle, entertainment, and pleasure. Definitely a worthwhile movies ticket, whatever the cost. But invest in 5.1 Surround before you consider the DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
812,Raptor Marmalade,Soap opera acting and poorly sung music is a hit!,3,21 January 2005,"If you love soap operas, and you love fabulous music sung terribly, this is the film for you! Schumacher's film version of Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera"" is the Titanic, in so many words. The film looks fantastic, feels like it should be fantastic, and in fact, is predicted it should be a success. But as the film goes on its merry way, it fumbles through the darkness and rams right in to a gigantic iceberg and sinks miserably to the bottom of the ocean.Originally written for the stage, the music should probably be left there. Schumacher, instead of spreading his artistic canvas to incorporate much-needed back story and characteristics from Gaston Leroux's novel, from which the musical is based, the director decides the musical is complete enough in itself and stretches it for all its worth. In turn, the musical splits down the seams and is turned to shambles for the sake of the film. The singing is mediocre at best. No, this film was never meant to be a blockbuster like the director is used to making. If the movie had to be made, it should have been given to a talented director, which, let's face it, Schumacher is not. He has no idea how to direct the actors in this film, and it's blatantly telltale. Emmy Rossum is a brainless little twit as Christine, walking around on tiptoe with no mind of her own, wavering to whoever cries, ""I love you!"" There is no hint of turmoil in her character when it comes to the tear she is supposed to feel between Raoul, her love, and her desire to be with her Angel of Music. The film feels fake and so comically surreal it's embarrassing. Butler is no Phantom. The Phantom of the Opera is supposed to have a spectacular singing voice because he trains a girl to be an acclaimed opera singer. Now, it stands to reason that he should be able to sing better than anyone, right? Actually, his voice is almost as bad as the infamous Carlotta is supposed to be. Butler does not have the range for the part; it's not his fault there was poor casting choices.At the climax of the film, when the Phantom is unmasked by Christine in front of the entire opera house, there is a cut in the middle of a shot. Sloppy editing beyond belief, beyond comprehension makes me hate the director for allowing this. Butler's character goes from a slick, black-haired handsome man with a tiny white mask to a scarred, white-haired freak with a single unmasking. I didn't see a wig get pulled off, and I don't think there was supposed to be. It's the worst job I've ever seen in transforming a character. If I was supposed to see some symbolic movement in this gesture, turning the handsome idol to a disfigured creature, I didn't buy it. The whole film we could not see a hint of the scars on Butler's face, and we saw PLENTY of his face. The Phantom is a character shrouded in darkness. In the film, he's dancing in the light of day like there's no tomorrow. And, did I mention, he bears a striking resemblance to Zorro? I could have SWORN Antonio Banderas wasn't in the film, but I kept second guessing during certain scenes.I give the film three stars. One for the first five minutes of the film, which was beautiful and brought me to tears from the toy monkey playing ""Masquerade,"" leading into the story with the chandelier lifting into the air and transforming the rotted opera house into its grandeur from the past; two for the beauty of the sets and costume designing that was just beautifully done; and the third star is for the black and white sequences. This was a great trick to move the story forward; it's a pity Schumacher didn't go back to the book for his ending. Leroux's final moments in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" are among my favorite in literature. Sad, tear spilling, and quiet. The movie is two of those for unfortunate reasons.",The Phantom of the Opera

This was worth the time to go see, especially if you like ALW and the Broadway musical.There seemed to be some new music in the movie which was not as compelling as the original score.

You are there from the beginning of ""Think of Me"", and you are there by the end of ""The Point of No Return"" And, they make you feel like you want to stay with them, and your sad when the movie ends.This really is Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best. He has captured a story, that is so hard to relate to, and has made it real while still capturing that air of mystery and other-worldly charm of the story and the Phantom himself. The strange thing s though, that you are sad but you are at a strange understanding as well. You understand why the Phantom did what he did, and you understand that Roul and Christine being together was the only true ending.I think the thing that is most amazing about this movie is that Andrew Lloyd Webber took the ""villian"" of the story and made him a sort of...hero. You watch the Phantom hang the stage hand, you watch him kidnap Chrsitine, and still you want him to live happily ever-after, even though you know that can never be. Webber makes the Phantom what he really is and not just a disfigured lunatic obsessed with a pretty girl. He makes the Phantom a true human, and a genius. In this movie we hear the music, we see the opera. We see the ""man behind the mask"" if you will. we see what we could never see in all the other remakes and movies.Finally, we come to the ending scene. Which, is my favorite scene in the movie. We watch as Roaul, now an elderly man, places the Phantoms old music box on top of Christines grave and begins to walk away. And for a moment, you are more sad then at any other single moment in the movie because you think to yourself ""Thats it. No more Phantom, no more Christine. It's over."" But you are wrong. You watch as, out of the corner of his eye Roaul sees something. You watch in amazement and delight as the screen closes in on a single rose, with a black ribbon with Christines wedding ring attached, which has been placed on her grave stone. and in those last seconds, you in away, come to terms with what you have just seen in this film. It is the end of a story about an angel trapped in a demons body, and you are happy.",The Phantom of the Opera
819,miss_x32,The famous musical as a movie,8,21 February 2005,"This is an adaption of the famous musical. The film is about an opera in Paris and its staff. The opera have been haunted for many years by the Phantom. The Phantom wears a mask and does not show himself very often but hides under the opera. The Phantom have been living at the opera for several years and writes many of the plays. Suddenly one of the operas big female stars quit. Now the Phantom starts to show an interest for the new female singer. The film is a musical and the music is fantastic. The film have got everything; good music, romance, action. SEE IT!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

He is violent to all except for his lovely ""Christine"" a sweet soprano whose father died.",10,27 February 2005,"This is a beautiful film! The costumes, singing, acting, and set are fabulous! Emma Rossum who plays Christine in the film, is an excellent singer and actress and is great for the role. The tunes of enchanting Andrew Lloyd Webber's music are memorable and sweet. A sad but lovely, musical jam-packed with love, revenge, hate, and action. Suitable for ages (not any younger because of sadness and violence) 9 (with parents)- 100! Gerald Butler who plays the phantom is captivating and wonderful! The man who plays Rolf is great and plays a kind (once a friend but later a.....) lover of Christine.

821,darran300,the best musical... ever!,10,8 January 2005,"having seen the stage musical, the many big screen versions and TV adaptations, i knew the plot well.... however, i have never seen one with so much Gothic romance, the handsome production values, the costumes and of cause the music,are true Hollywood class, while it was so good to see such an interesting mixture of singers/non singing cast. gerard butler was perfect as the phantom, playing the role with such sinister sexuality yet creating sympathy as the victim of others ignorance. i left the cinema with a charge of great emotion, this is not a horror story but a tragic love story with first class music... a must see",The Phantom of the Opera
822,smittykitty10,An outstanding musical.,10,4 August 2009,This movie is amazing. I thought that it would be stupid and only watched it on the television because i wanted to see how bad it was. I was gob-smacked. I didn't see it all so i bought the soundtrack and the film. The acting in this musical is amazing. Gerard Butler (the Phantom) was utterly amazing. His voice suited the role of the phantom extremely well as did his acting. The emotion that he used at the end took my breath away and made me cry. When i saw the pain on his face my heart broke and i disliked Christine Daae for hurting the phantom like that. I was only 11 when i saw this musical. I am 15 now and still love it and still cry at the end when Christine kisses the phantom because i know what comes next. I still have not seen the Broadway version but i have a bad feeling that it will not be as good. I love this musical and once again i have to say that Gerard Butler is an amazing actor to make you believe that he is hurt and that he is the phantom.,The Phantom of the Opera
823,MJGod,Not Even Close,6,25 December 2004,"With all due respect, the movie version does not capture nearly as much of the magic as the original musical. There will be one and only one ""Phantom"", and that is Michael Crawford. When I heard that he was not considered for the movie version, I already knew that I would be disappointed. Gerard Butler's Phantom does not seem as tortured as Michael Crawford. At least they didn't use Antonio Banderas as was once rumored. The same goes for Sarah Brightman as Christine. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the role of Christine for his then-wife Sarah Brightman, and no one else can play her as she did. Joel Schumacher does a reasonable job but after hearing the soundtrack for the movie, I'm only seeing it because it is one of my favorite stories of all time.",The Phantom of the Opera
824,pictues,Awesome Movie,10,7 January 2005,"I've seen this movie twice and plan on seeing it again and buying the DVD. I really like it how the actors and actresses sung their own lines, except Minnie Driver whose lines were sung by the actress who plays Coletta in the London Play. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I really enjoyed the singing and will definitely see the play either in New York or London.I really Enjoyed Emma Russum's performance of Cristine. I suggest you see this movie even if you never seen the play or listened to the music.The Music is awesome and the Andrew Loyd Webber did a superb time at this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
825,aimz007,Spectacular!,10,18 January 2005,"When I was a little girl, my parents went to the stage version of the Phantom of the Opera..I can't remember the exact year, it may have been 1990, in which case I was very young and had no real knowledge of where they were going or what they were going to. But a couple of years later, (I think I was about 5) I began listening to the tape version we had of the entire play, and I fell in love with it. I would sing in the lounge room at the top of my lungs, and I was always Christine! Since then, and after growing old enough to realise what it was exactly, and actually understanding the story, I'd always wanted the stage version to come back to Australia, or a movie be made on it, and I couldn't have been happier when this came out.It came out on December 26, 2004 and I only saw it yesterday - and instantly fell in love with it. Emmy Rossum as Christine is stunning, her voice is amazing and her talent shines through this movie. Gerard Butler, relatively unknown to me until I saw him in this, was brilliant as the Phantom. The emotion and chemistry of these actors come through on the screen so real, it's kind of scary.Joel Schumacher has brought this to the big screen magnificently and I must recommend EVERYONE see this movie, the colours and sounds are breathtaking, the whole movie is breathtaking. A must-see! 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera

The music is amazing, the people, costumes, and sets are beautiful, and the storyline is the best of all. I borrowed it from my public library one day, and by the end of the week, I had probably watched it at LEAST 8 times!!!! I can't get the songs out of my head (not that I don't want them there), and I just imagine myself every night in Emmy Rossum's place, being loved by Gerard Butler. I love this movie out of all the movies I've ever seen.

This was the first time I have ever seen ""Phantom of the Opera"". I have always herd the music but I have never seen the movie. I am so glad that I did so. I was totally deprived of this movie and now I understand why people gasped when I said I never saw it. I seriously can't wait to see this movie again and to some day own both old and new version. I am so impressed with this movie. I think it might be one of my all time favorites now and forever. I am definitely getting the soundtrack to the movie. The music is beautiful and timeless. The movie itself is so amazing with all the colors and the emotions mixed with the music. I will also have to say that I am really impressed with the actors also. The guy who plays the Phantom ""Gerard Butler"" he is such an awesome man to play that role. He is has stolen my heart and has very kissable lips. This movie is a wonderful movie that I will watch over and over again. I hope that more people will go to see this movie and be impressed with it as much as I am.

Let me put it simply: if you have seen the stage production and even only liked it...you will love the movie. If you--as I--LOVED the stage production, then you should be standing urgently in line! I've seen every major musical on Broadway and elsewhere for the last forty years and always go to see the movie with a certain amount of intrepidation--never quite knowing how it will survive the adaption.Have no fear here---truly well done--and recognizing that it is a movie and not live-- it is unforgettable.As close as you will get to seeing any musical live--without actually seeing it live.And what I didn't say was that I am an American and have seen it on Broadway 5 or six times , naturally in English.

830,magnus101175,My faith in the human race is restored!,10,30 April 2011,"This movie is just incredible. Before I saw It, I had lost all hope for cinema. But now that I've seen that even Schumacher can create a masterpiece of this magnitude, then there may be hope yet.In my opinion, this movie was perfect. The characters were portrayed as they were meant to be, the sets were gorgeous, the music gave me goosebumps, and... Forgive me, I am still standing in awe. This is one of the very first movies to actually make me cry. *SPOILERS*Perhaps my two very favorite parts are (1) At the very beginning when the movie transitioned from a monochromatic scheme and went back to the past to tell the tale, that transition was one of the greatest I've ever seen, and (2) The first time the phantom shows Christine into the catacombs for the first time, I cant even explain my amazement at that moment.*END OF SPOILERS*In short, God bless Andrew Lloyd Webber for the creation of this marvelous musical, and god bless Joel Schumacher for the perfect transition into American cinema. This movie is definitely worth watching, and I will enjoy it for years to come. This is one of only two films in my lifetime to get a 10/10 rating from me, the other being citizen Kane.",The Phantom of the Opera
831,tambourine_man36,Big waste of time...,1,5 January 2005,"The movie starts off very well and begins to make you think it's going to be different from the play, but as soon as the first gala is over, it is far too similar to the play. Many of the songs in the play were fine when the performers simply stood around but that just doesn't work when transferred to the silver screen.The acting is completely bland for the two leads. Emmy Rossum is capable of only three facial expressions and even fewer musical notes. Gerard Butler sounds like he is singing this music for the first time in his life. The supporting cast of Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, and Patrick Wilson do their best but can't bring this project up from the downfall of the miscast lead actors.You may enjoy this movie if you have never seen the play, or haven't seen it in a while and have absolutely no clue on how good singing should sound. If you are a fan of the Broadway show, you will see no need for this movie being that it's too similar and useless. Stay away!",The Phantom of the Opera

Personally, i don't like musicals, they tend to be ridiculous (people dance all the time and we forget about the storyline, and the soundtrack usually isn't good) but as i saw it was made by Joel Schumacher i gave a try. Well, all i can say is that is one of the bests (if not the best) movies i've ever seen. Firstly the story is spectacular and, in addition all the songs helps to the development of the plot. Secondly, the soundtrack is awesome!!!! The voices are very well chosen. I call this movie a piece of real art: every song is well adapted to the situations and are contextual to the whole plot.",The Phantom of the Opera
834,raveoddgrl,Not as good as I expected,6,29 December 2004,"First off, I will say that this is one of the most visually breathtaking films that I have seen in years. I enjoy movies that are lavish in detail and that take the time to REALLY make you feel as if you were there. The whole movie had an ethereal, dream-like quality (especially scenes in which the whole cast was singing and dancing). The setting was phenomenal, the ensemble cast was delightful. However...While the choice of most of the cast was perfect, Mme Giry (for how her character was interpreted) and her daughter Meg were especially good. But was I the only one who found Meg more interesting than Christine? Emmy's Christine left much to be desired if her stage direction was something other than ""Stand there and look ethereal, sad, or in love"". I own the original score to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera"" (and yes, I am a die-hard Sarah Brightman fan). I read the book when I was still in middle school and still bring it off my bookshelf every once in a while. I saw the Broadway musical. I saw the movie with my mother, though, who knows nothing about the P.o.t.O. except my obsession with it. She fell asleep. I was just surprised that someone could take the word-for-word score of a musical and turn it into a 2 hour long music video. My mother wasn't entirely sure what was happening while she was awake. To keep her awake and interested, I had to constantly whisper parts of the plot that filmmakers omitted, ignored, or changed. My mother also has pitch perfect hearing and was a little disturbed at some of the singing. But this is my review and not hers. Let me wrap this up by saying that visually it was amazing, aurally it was a little off-putting, plot-wise it was a little vague to those who have no prior experience with P.o.t.O., and with the three main characters, they could have chosen better. I truly think the casting and some of the plot and set were what marred the movie for me.",The Phantom of the Opera
835,sweetbabygurl520,Beautiful Disappointment,8,13 April 2005,"Having seen The Phantom of the Opera twice in the theater, I was quite excited to see the movie version. However, I was disappointed. So much of the Phantom is the music, having it move you, and I felt it was too muted at times. And I also felt that the actor's voices lacked the power needed. But other than that it was great. Beautiful actually. The costumes were beautiful, as well as the sets. I also liked the way they presented the past and the present. And the chemistry between the actors was tangible. Oh and as for it not being exactly like the theater version, it was actually beneficial in this case. For example, they added the scene where it was explained just how the Phantom came to live in the opera house, and how his relationship began with...can't remember her name, the ballet teacher. The best scene was the last by far. The playing monkey on her grave, along with a single rose. Beautiful...made me cry.",The Phantom of the Opera
836,ToddLo,Even this non-lover of opera loved it.,9,22 September 2008,"I do NOT do opera. I couldn't tell you who wrote La Traviatta or even if I spelled that right. I know Bugs Bunny sang ""Figaro"" once, and that's about it. I had figured I would never watch this movie until my wife bought us tickets to see the stage play, and my daughter confessed that it was one of her favorite movies. So ... I watched it with her. Like eight times. It gets better each time. Emma Rossum is a wonder, and so what if Gerard Butler doesn't have an operatic voice? For me, that was part of the brilliance of casting him; what he lacks in polish he more than makes up for with razor-sharp edge and intensity (and ladies: tell hubby that King Leonidas from ""300"" plays the Phantom, and they may be more willing to watch this with you!). Minnie Driver is hilarious as Carlotta, and the rest of the cast deliver perfectly sublime performances. The music is haunting and beautiful, the pyschology of Christine and the Phantom's relationship complex and fun. If there's a weak link, it's the too-pretty actor playing the love interest, Raoul -- Patrick Wilson. A minor dig, as his voice is terrific and the passion real enough. Joel Schumacher's best film to date has lavish sets, stunning costumes, and fills in the holes in the stage script brilliantly -- rounding out the character of Buqet before his big scene, making the back-story of the Phantom more solid, and converting just enough of the lyrics to spoken word to give you a respite here and there. He handles the climactic scenes with skill and daring, delivering a powerful finish. See it!",The Phantom of the Opera

Andrew Lloyd Webber created the musical stage production that remains a box-office hit on Broadway. Now, that ""rock opera"" has become the newest live production to make it to celluloid. This highly anticipated musical lives up to the expectations and leaves the audiences wanting more. The transformations from black and white to color add a visual ambiance that gives the story more depth. Though I've seen the stage show four times and love the music, this film brought me to tears.

838,kjtrimmer,Outstanding!,10,9 January 2005,"I've seen this show on Broadway seven times. I've loved this musical since I first saw it performed a decade ago.I was apprehensive at first. I did not expect it to be good at all, merely nice to look at.I was more moved by the performances and vocals in this movie than I have ever been by any of the stage productions I have seen.Emmy Rossum is outstanding. Then again, I've loved her acting and singing voice since I first saw her in ""Songcatcher"". She has the potential to be outstanding, and this film is an excellent example of that.The casting choices are flawless, Minnie Driver is entertaining as Carlotta, and normally I can't stand her.Butler is the best Phantom I've ever seen. His baritone, while certainly not the best by any means, has a haunting and heart wrenching quality to it that is necessary for this role. He brought tears to my eyes with his excellent ability to convey emotions (and with only half a face visible for the majority of the movie!). His performance in the 'Don Juan' scene is incredibly seductive and well-done.If you don't like ALW, don't even waste your time seeing this movie, since it's his show in the first place. If you don't like Schumacher, you may just change your mind after this film.I definitely give it a 10 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
839,cypress77,Extraordinary Musical Magic,10,26 June 2005,"Having seen the Broadway production of POTO with Michael Crawford and being suitably impressed I approached this film a little warily. First, as a reader of the original Leroux book, I wasn't sure what cinematic fun the audience could expect and as a fan of the older movies on the Phantom, I was cringing and hoping for something that wasn't a complete juxtaposition of the Play and all those horrid old movies that I love so much.No one expected Michael Crawford to reprise his role - he was a huge hit, deservedly so, but he's moved on with his life and career. When I heard the movie was being made I looked into it and found the names of the principles in the cast surprising - until I found out why.Gerard Butler was hand picked by Joel Schumacher and Sir ALW for exactly the qualities he brings to the role of the Phantom. They wanted a actor in that part - not a musical theatre performer - an actor with extraordinary screen presence who could convey the depth of pain, loneliness and soul deep torment that the Phantom lives with and experiences, all while using only half his face. Oh yeah, and they wanted him to sing too.My mental processor pinged when I read Gerry Butler's name - OK, so the man is unbelievably handsome, yes he has an extraordinary presence on screen, no matter what film he's in, but sing? Why yes sir, the lad can and does sing. Sir ALW has stated openly and in the special features of the extended DVD that he chose Butler both due to his acting abilities and for the rock and roll sensibility of his voice - an edgy roughness and sensuality that ALW had always longed for in the role of the Phantom and that he believes Gerry Butler does in buckets.I believe it too...now. He made me cry. He brought the tragic hero quality to the character and let the audience see and understand the Phantom - even as the opera ghost's mind was literally crumbling from the loss of his love and his tightly controlled, fantasy world - you felt his pain and fear and need. It's not easy to play someone like ""Erik""(From the book) as the psychological mess he is but still make him have qualities which are attractive and I am not referring to just the physical allure. The character himself, has gifts to offer Christine - he is creative, artistic, shares her love of music and the arts, is intelligent (Leroux makes him a genius) and is tender yet smoldering with passionate intensity. So he's got a little skin condition? What's not to like? Maybe that obsession thing? Nah.Bravo Gerry Butler for having the cajones to take this one on. You were born to play The Phantom and you gave him a soul that will never be lost.The heroine, Christine, had another familiar name, Emmy Rossum. An experienced actress with fifteen films and numerous television appearances under her belt, she is breathtaking as the naive and innocent Christine Daae. Her voice is remarkable and floats through the difficult passages of ALW's music with ease. Emmy Rossum manages to hold on to the character's innocence, letting her be responsive yet confused by the erotic pull of Butler's smolderingly sensual Phantom without cheapening her character. Christine is torn between Erik, the Phantom, who has been her teacher, mentor, and admirer for years and Raoul, her former childhood sweetheart who comes back into her life.Raoul, well played by Patrick Wilson, a magnificent lyric tenor, by the way. (The Alamo, Angels in America, My Sister's Wedding). Wilson manages to make Raoul into a strong, likable character - a contrast to the fussy, whining performances of some of his predecessors. Raoul de Chagny, a titled noble, is taken with his lovely childhood friend's performance and inserts himself back into her life immediately. His appearance into her life upsets the delicate control The Phantom has retained over her for years and sets into motion a series of events which will culminate in tragedy for the Opera House, The Phantom, and sadness for Christine.Raoul offers her life in the sunlight, carefree and pampered as the wife of a Viscount. The Phantom in contrast, represents her truer nature, her sensuality, her passion, her love of music and performing, but he can only offer her a life of adored isolation in the darkness of his lair.Raoul obtains her heart but The Phantom has her soul. She wants what Raoul is offering but can't quite be cruel to the man who has given her so much - her voice, her career, her love of music. Her obvious conflict over the two different men who love her is wrenching.Minnie Driver was the biggest surprise as the spoiled, egocentric diva, Carlotta - the starring soprano of the Opera Populaire. She provided fabulous comic relief in the film. While she is a singer of notable talent in her own right, she did lip sync in the film, but provides the beautiful vocals during the song ""Learn To Be Lonely"" which plays during the end credits.Note: On the extended DVD, there is a deleted scene with Gerard Butler singing a sweet melody nearly accapella (sp), ""No One Would Listen"", a haunting moment of character development where The Phantom is shown in his lair with sketches and drawings of Christine that he has done. Don't miss this one.Visually stunning, with heartfelt, moving performances from all of the principle players, Sir ALW and Joel Schumacher have set a banquet for the eyes and ears. Grade A+ These people put their souls into it.",The Phantom of the Opera
840,paubradley,"Inspiring, gave me the chills",9,23 February 2005,"I never saw the Phantom of the Opera on theater before although I was certainly looking forward to it. When the movie came out I didn't know if I should wait till I saw the original version. Luckily, I didn't. I saw the movie last night and I loved it, amazing performances by Emmy Rossum (and that voice!) and Gerard Butler. The music, the cinematography, the costumes, the story itself, just spectacular. Just a tiny detail, they should cut it out with putting music in parts where it is slightly out of place, like in conversations, etc. Still, the picture is great!!I think the story is much more powerful than that of other musicals as Chicago (which is very good), as the themes and contents are deeper and require of greater sensibility from us, the spectators. In a word, breathtaking.",The Phantom of the Opera
841,BoboRetraite11,"Great Movie, True To Original Story",9,11 February 2005,"As a long-time fan of Gaston Lerous'x original story and the stage productions of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. In fact, I loved it. Emmy Rossum is an enchanting Christine and Gerard Butler plays the Phantom extremely well. Most of all, I appreciated the movie's ability to closely adhere to the story line in Gaston Leroux's original story. The music is great, although not quite up to the level of the stage plays that I have seen. But, then, that is the reason we have live stage musicals, where the actors-singers can excel to great heights at any given performance.Prior to viewing the movie, I put my previous viewings of the stage production aside. It allowed me to enjoy the movie for its own theatrical merits.My only critique of the movie concerns the distinguishing evolution of the phantom's character. In the stage productions, the Phantom develops a supernatural, mysterious, and magical character during the performance, which builds and intensifies right up to his final disappearing scene in the great chair (the final mystery).The movie version does not allow the Phantom to reach the heights of superhuman mysticism that the stage production generates. In my opinion, this slightly diminishes his character. The Phantom's defeat to Raoul in the sword fight is a perfect example.I believe this aspect of the movie version detracts from the power of the Phantom's character and ultimately minimizes the Phantom's superhuman, ghostly abilities (characteristics that prevail in Leroux's original story).However, having made this minor distinction between the stage production and the movie, I am extremely satisfied with the movie version. It is is a fine production with great performances by the actors.My advice to enthusiastic and impassioned potential viewers: do not arrive at the theater anticipating a stage production. You will be giving the movie an unfair disadvantage; and, you will deny yourself an opportunity, as a first-time viewer, to enjoy all of the positive aspects of the movie. Go see the movie in the proper frame of mind and you will enjoy it immensely, as I did.",The Phantom of the Opera
842,origami232000,Beautiful...if you can look past the minor flaws.,10,24 December 2004,"This film was a treat. The sets, the scenery, the actors, the music...especially the music was an absolute treat for my ears and eyes. The acting was perfect. Christine (Emmy Rossum) made the perfect damsel in distress, Raoul (Patrick Wilson) the best hero and The Phantom (Gerard Butler) the demonic and yet the victim of the dramatic plot. They all did a wonderful job at the acting aspect of the film. When looking at the singing, Wilson and Rossum were amazing. Butler did OK but he sometimes sounded so rough instead of melodic...I felt as if he were screaming the words instead of singing them. (But overall, he did a great job). The one minor actress I have to give credit to was Carlotta (Minnie Driver). She was the perfect diva of the opera house and made some comic relief during the darker scenes. The sets were also lovely. So much color and lighting was used, I felt as if I were really watching the stage production...which was good to me. Then there was the music, lovely. Everything mixed together and sounded as good as the stage production...well at most parts. Overall, every song was done to my satisfactory. The best song was ""All I Ask Of You."" It was simple, sweet and yet very sad. (See the movie, you'll understand). Then there were some songs that were just not done that well. ""Down Once More"" was a little overdone with Butler but it ended good. Bottom line, the film was good, the music was amazing, and it's a treat when compared to those typical shows I see far too much. It really was beautiful...if you can look past the minor flaws. 10/10!

843,hpfan1989,Excellent movie until...,9,31 December 2004,"I thought the whole movie was great and it was like the book and the play they have in England. But the part that I really don't like is his gruesome eye. They didn't have to make it so gross. But anyway the costumes, and the actors and actresses voices were perfect for the rolls. The best part was the beginning when they auctioned off the chandlier and then the opera house was put back together. It was truly magnificent. Its a sure must see. I liked the actress they used for Christine Daae. They girl from the Day After Tomorrow and to believe that they all sang the actual songs and didn't lip sink is amazing. My favorite song was Masquerade. This movie everyone must see but it might be a little scary for children since there are like 5 murders.",The Phantom of the Opera
844,rb1500,Phantom shines as much on screen as on stage.,7,17 January 2005,"I saw the original stage production of The Phantom of the Opera when I was younger in Boston. The production was magnificent and I became a loyal fan of the show. But when I heard that a movie based on the show was coming out, I was less than excited. I figured, why mess with a good thing? Anyways, I was persuaded to see the movie and it is every bit as exciting and magical as the stage show. Gerard Butler makes a magnificent Phantom, insane and heartfelt. Patrick Wilson is also very good as Raoul, but the person who really shines is Emmy Rossum as Christine. She is so beautiful and wonderful that I couldn't take my eyes off of her for a moment. She makes the show.The music is also more grand due to the 100 piece orchestra to belt it out. The songs are so amazing that I am still singing them and its been a month since I've seen the movie. This is very well the best film this year. Its big, grand, and beautiful. Go see this film!!!! **** out of ****",The Phantom of the Opera
845,amuskindu,Bravissimo!,10,27 December 2004,"Wow...finally seeing this was a saga in itself...7 years ago I became wise to POTO by way of playing another Michael Crawford character in a high school musical, Cornelius from Hello Dolly...I gobbled up everything Crawford, including the Phantom recording. I fell in love instantly with the music, and a year later went to Toronto to see it live. I saw it once again here in Pittsburgh 2 summers later, and it only strengthened my wish to see it on the big screen. I once fell into the ""No one but Crawford"" crowd, but once I fell out of love with musical theatre shortly after high school I lost touch with all the updates on this...Earlier this year I began dating my 'highschool quasi-sweetheart'. She brought me back into musicals, which after knowing her for 9 years never knew she enjoyed as much as she does. I let her borrow the POTO soundtrack, being shocked that she loves Gothic settings and loves musicals, but never saw/heard POTO. SHE fell in love with it. A day before first seeing the trailer in the theatres (unbeknownst to me that they finally got the movie done), I was actually telling my girlfriend about the troubles they had back when I was heavily into the musical with getting it made into a movie. It was a surreal moment seeing the trailer, waiting for Vanity Fair to start...Thus the true waiting started. Not only was I excited on a Star Wars level, I had my girlfriend who arguably was more excited, having never seen the stage musical. I was more reserved...Joel Schumacher, Director (destroyer of all things Batman)...unknown cast (thus rekindling my no one-but-Crawford rants)...and the inevitable changes that the big screen brings to musicals.And let me tell you, being reserved was a blessing and a curse. A blessing because I was able to not be into they hype, and a curse because all three problems I had before seeing the movie were wiped away upon seeing it.MARVELOUS!!!! Gerry Butler...you made a believer out of me. Even with a lower, more rock-and-roll voice, and less crying and more reserved self-pity than displayed in the musical, I was able to feel the same for Butler's Phantom as I did with the two actors who portrayed him on the stage. Emmy Rossum, geeze, you're going places girl, beautiful acting, beautiful voice...gave me chills just like Brightman does...Patrick Wilson, you definitely are a stage trained actor, all the times you over-displayed an emotion in the movie (which is fine by me, it is from the stage originally anyway), wonderful voice as well. Miranda Richardson was a wonderful Mdm. Giry...she was less spooky and more of a real human being in the movie...Firmin and Andre were their comic relief selves :-) Webber was right, the essence of the musical is there, if not strengthened by the ability to do more with film. I recognized that as soon as I saw the chandelier light up at the beginning. From beginning to end my attention was drawn, I never once got bored, and I actually felt the unspeakable-for-a-guy sadness at the very end, with old Raoul at the cemetery. Schumacher, I'm sorry for all the crap I talked on you about Batman, you showed me that those shortcomings were not you, or at least a fluke, because you truly have made a masterpiece with Phantom.The best feeling, however, is when the movie is over, and 2 out of the 3 times I have seen it (once was in an empty Christmas eve theatre), the crowded theatre erupts into applause. The only other time I have seen that at a movie theatre was the beginning of any Star Wars film, and the end of Return of the King. This movie will definitely make a lot of money, and if you ask me, is the best of the trio of recent musical movies (Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Phantom). I might be biased, but probably not, because Moulin Rouge meant as much to me as Phantom did at a different stage of my life.10/10. The. Greatest. Musical. Movie. Ever....And the greatest musical ever :-)",The Phantom of the Opera
846,paul_adams777,Upsetting changes,6,12 June 2005,"In any theatre play that is converted to a film, some changes may be necessary - people tolerate the limitations of the theatre, but are fairly intolerant of ""constrained movies"".In this much, I accept that the screenplay writers needed to make some changes. I think they did this well in the ""flash forwards"", and using the freedom to move about the theatre (into the area above the stage, for example) in ways not available in the theatre version.However, there were some large and unnecessary changes that I felt detracted dramatically from the intensity of the theatre play.While I will still probably buy the DVD, and (if it is still showing) take my wife to see it (I was lucky enough to see the movie on an airplane), I will always view it as considerably inferior to the theatre play - for reasons I detail below.The biggest part of my disappointment was an apparent insistence by the screenplay writers on having to explain everything. In the play, the Phantom retained a sense of mystery, even beyond the end of the play - as stated in the auction scene, ""some aspects of which have never been fully explained"".However, the screenplay writers insisted on humanizing the Phantom and rationalizing everything to such an extent that it was necessary to delete an entire scene - the rehearsal for ""Don Juan Triumphant"" - because, in the theatre play, it centred around an event that simply could not be rationally explained away.SPOILER WARNING: If you do not want aspects of the story revealed, do not read beyond this point.This deletion itself seriously wounded the understanding of the death of Piangi (he had mocked the Phantom during the deleted rehearsal), which has the effect of making the movie's Phantom more into a sociopath than someone not to be crossed.Additionally, the moving of the falling chandelier from the end of act one to near the end of act two completely messed up the meaning of the Phantom's threat ""there are things more important than a broken chandelier"".Finally, why the graveyard scene needed any changes, I cannot understand. Turning this conflict into a sword fight just did not fit - it distorted the character of Raoul. And will someone tell me exactly when and where the Phantom was supposed to have learned the skill of sword fighting?",The Phantom of the Opera
847,supachik07,The Phantom of the Opera is amazing,10,30 May 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie. There is no way that you can deny Andrew Lloyd Webber's amazing talent. This romantic opera brought so much to me. I have watched it over and over again. I adore it's romantic charm, and the way it can make every girl wish to be Christine. (Kristine?) I found that the inner torture that they reveal through the phantom really makes the movie. My favorite scene is one of the lasts one, when they are in the phantoms ""Dungeon of Darkness"" and they (The Phantom, Christine, and Raoul) are all singing at the same time. It really inspires me. It is so clean so everyone can watch it, and it show's musical genius. I loved everything about it, I gave it a 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
848,crazystan,*There may be slight spoilers*Joel Schumacher Director of such great movies as The Incredible Shrinking Women,4,19 January 2005,"Well, I went to see this movie knowing it wasn't going to be good. Anyone who read the great book by Gaston Leroux would very much dislike this. Its nothing like the book. #1 There is no Persian! How can they not have Persian, he is not only the most interesting character (next to Erik of course) but he is a key element to the torture chamber scene which leads to my second notion #2 There was no Torture sequence! That was such an intense sequence and they take it out! #3 Erik's lair in the book is described by having a huge lake dividing him and land. And that where he lives is a house. In the movie its in shambles, its just not right #4 Jole Schumacher Directed it #5 The Opera house is giant on the inside right? Right. But when they do shots form outside, according to their perspective, its about two stories tall.The only good thing about this movie was the theme. Its was hysterical. I mean this is set in the 1800's, traditional instruments right? no. THe Phantoms theme starts off with heavy organs (which is right) but then they start to add Drums (and not army drums like a drum set for a band in the 80's) and then synthesizers start playing in the background, SYNTHESIZERS! It was an 80's Power Ballod. Its really was the funniest thing, I was laughing the whole way through it. THe movie is worth seeing JUST so you can laugh at that song. Plus Carolotta was rather humorous also. I would advise any person who has read the book NOT to see this movie. Any person who likes traditional over the top, super sappy musicals, go and see it, its perfect for that. And for you average movie goers out there, the choice is yours, this is just my opinion, you have every right to go and see this if you like. Hopefully someone will make a better version of POTO and really abide by the book but until then, I give this movie 4/10Crazy Stan",The Phantom of the Opera
849,Dare1025,My thoughts on the film adaption of the Phantom of the Opeara,10,23 January 2005,"I saw the movie twice on theatres, two days in a row...(December 22nd/opening day and December 23rd)My expectations were always high for the movie ever since I saw the musical this past summer with Hugh Panaro as the Phantom, Sandra Joseph as Christine and John Cudia as Raoul in NYC (42nd, 7th). The musical was amazing and it nearly brought tears to my eyes of how it affected me. So obviously if the musical had affected me in such an emotional way, I would have high expectations. I originally was upset when I heard Music of the Night in the trailer, but as soon as I saw some clips and bought the sound track November 23(again opening day) and was hyped for the movie release which was the official less than a month count down.******spoilers ahead in review. scroll down to more stars****** As soon as the movie played a huge smile served as my countenance for the next 2 hours and 20 minutes. The movie was spectacular with all my expectations met except for the end. I felt that it would have been better if Meg opened the curtain divider and u saw the throne with a some form of light shining down. Another thing that upset me was when the phantom's supernatural qualities were taken away such as in the play when he actually put some form of hex to make her sound like a toad. Other than these small set backs, it put together a great movie.******************************One of the things that made the movie better than the play was the orchestra and the electric guitar added in 'The Phantom of the Opera'. I also liked them portraying the Raoul as the cliché' hero rather than the lover boy type novel character. All the actors fulfilled their role to their best potential. The only set backs was with Patrick Wilson (Raoul), sometimes his voice drags on but he is overall good. Gerard was very good except sometimes when he used a maniacal rather than that of singing. In conclusion, I highly suggest this to everyone. It is an excellent, feel good movie that will raise your spirit.(When I saw it, it made me feel better after being rejected from chorus in my high school production of Kiss Me Kate, I'm in pit orchestra though!!!)I also suggest you DO NOT see this if you have no appreciation for musicals or if Broadway does not appeal to you. Overall grade: 10/10...P.S.- Now I just have to look forward to Rent and The Producers lol...",The Phantom of the Opera

I applaud the crew for excellent job. I never thought i would love this movie as i do.

851,jewishteddybear,Emmy Rossum is an angel,10,13 October 2005,"This movie ranks with the best i have ever seen. The shining light of this movie was without a doubt Emmy Rossum. Her voice is so beautiful, she sings like an angel. Her emotional sensitivity is remarkably it itself, but all the more amazing given how young she is. How can she understand human suffering in the mature way that she does? Wow. And she is so beautiful, so pure, so innocent, so holy, so angelic. I want to see every film Emmy Rossum ever makes in her life. I love Emmy Rossum. The story itself is highly compelling, that of a young woman's inner struggle between the father figure in her life (the phantom) who helped her become the success that she was, and with her lover Patrick, which represents her future. The cemetery scene where the beautiful Emmy Rossum is alone and so gorgeously singing, ""wishing you were somehow here again,"" therefore captures the central theme of the entire movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
852,leedygray,This sumptuous spectacle makes for delicious fun.,7,17 January 2005,"Already a lover of the musical, I was not disappointed by this spectacular adaptation to the big screen. It captured my imagination from the very beginning and never disappointed. The casting was nothing short of brilliant. The decision to cast an actor, in the form of Gerard Butler as the Phantom, gave credibility to the tragedy behind all his scheming. His performance was powerful and heart wrenching (and truthfully, if I'd been Christine, I would have happily gone down to live with that sexy Phantom anytime). My favorite scene is the very erotic performance of 'Past the Point of no Return'- makes a gal feel a little weak at the knees. Emmy Rossum makes a radiantly beautiful Christine, and her voice is much more beautiful than the original Christine, Sarah Brightman. And Minnie Driver made a very funny Diva. Check out the Orchestra conductor - a real classic.Full of humor as well as darkness, this sumptuous spectacle makes for delicious fun. Very highly recommended.",The Phantom of the Opera
853,Sarah4Jesus2005,"Yeah, it's long, but Phantom deserves a long review",10,19 August 2005,"Holy freaking cow! Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll try to sound a little more sophisticated. It started for me in elementary school...my stepsister introduced me to the Phantom of the Opera stage-play soundtrack, and I fell in love, entirely. I have to admit, though I was fond of Michael Crawford, I sometimes found that his voice was a little too bright and lacked emotion in the right places. Sarah Brightman always did sound a little too old for the role...not as innocent as Christine's character demanded. But nonetheless, ""through music my soul began to soar...and I heard as I never heard before."" ALW is, purely, a genius. So fast-forward six years. I heard that Phantom was being made into a movie, and my excitement was quickly dashed when I read review on Plugged In Online, which is a site that I respect...but they said Gerard Butler bailed on the high notes, and overall it didn't live up to the play. But my mom and my brother couldn't stop talking about the movie--they couldn't stop. I resolved to see it anyway, and what can I say? I was literally blown away. Christine was exactly--exactly--as I had imagined her to be, who I thought she should be. I can't believe she was sixteen--younger than me by a year, and about thirty-four times more talented than I am...aye. She was perfect, everything about her. Raoul just gave me de ja vu--though he didn't sound as I expected (I must say, I've learned to love him so much more than I ever thought I would), he looked absolutely perfect for the part.  And then--then my Phantom! He was entirely backward and opposite of what I expected--and to my infinite surprise, I was spellbound and breathless at this horrifically stunning and beautiful and soulful new discovery. Every time I see this movie I feel even more love for this man. His voice--isperfect for the part. Not perfect, but perfect for the part. How anyone could love Michael Crawford better, I will never, ever know. Gerard gives so much emotion--so MUCH emotion--so much passion, you can feel every tear and every smile and every lust and rage and joy ever to enter his being in just the way he forms his words...the way he'll switch from chest voice to head voice, the use of vibrato, the change in dynamics and timbre, and weaving from staccato to legato to make evident the contrasting moods--I didn't know what to think when I discovered that he'd never had a voice lesson in his entire life before Phantom became a reality. And his stage presence...holy apple pie Batman...I have a list of actors who I think surpass them all. Yul Brynner, Gene Kelly, Michael Douglas, Nicholas Cage, James Earl Jones and Sean Connery...Gerard Butler has easily, almost supernaturally, engraved his way into the top. The way he moves drives me crazy--his stance, his shoulders back and his slow-moving steps, gentle at times, and quick and authoritative otherwise, that move faithfully to the music...and, yes, I used to be disgusted by all forms of chest hair, until I saw him with his shirt unbuttoned and his collar hanging loose--sheesh, he's the sexiest man alive, I'm convinced, and I've got all my friends convinced.  Yes, I know this review is unnaturally long...but I feel it's necessary, after all the crap it's earned from culture-deprived and passion-lacking, apathetic, visually-impaired and audio-incapacitated Hollywood-standard American dummy reviewers who don't have the capacity or understanding be seduced by true beauty (I'm not talking about people who love the play and didn't like the movieI'm talking about idiotic ""professional"" reviewers who hated it without seeing the play or just dismissing it as ""another"" musical).  One last thing, other than that I own two copies of the Broadway soundtrack and two copies of the movie soundtrack, and I have seen this movie ten times in theaters (my brother has seen it fourteen times and my mother fifteen, and all of our friends at least three times, if not five or six)...where was I? Oh yes. I never cry in movies. You have to believe me. I never cry, and I pride myself on that. I cried in the Passion of the Christ, but that was for deep personal convictions. So I sat there in the theater, and my fingers were clutching the arm-rests and I was looking around for the exit, fearing that I was going to faint when I realized that the Phantom was on the roof, listening to the idiotic (and yet, somehow, understandably, though loathsomely wise, as far as not staying with an abusive, murdering madman, regardless of how deprived, gifted, and compassionate he is) Christine ask for freedom and safety from the swashbuckling and heartwarming and charmingly handsome Raoul, with his flawless voice and noble but boyish love for her. I bawled. I seriously believed I would lose consciousness...especially when Christine returns to give the ring back to Erik, my lovely Phantom, and an inhumanly perfect and horribly sorrowful expression of hope and disbelief crosses his lovely marred features that she might, just might, be returning for him as well. I coulda killed her. I mean, give me the Punjab lasso, and I'll take care of her myself. I've never felt so much compassion for a fictional creature, never encountered an actor who could draw it out of me in such a way. I swear, he must get so into his character that he honestly fell in love with Christine (not Emmy--Christine) while the cameras were rolling. His voice, you could hear how much he strained to put both emotion and rugged, flawed divinity into those notes...he is truly the Music of the Night, and an Angel of Music, in the very sense of the word. I have never felt so in love with a character in my entire life.",The Phantom of the Opera
854,wilfredpaul888,The characters of the movie made the movie itself......,10,8 April 2005,"I wasn't a fan of the Phantom of the Opera. But, when I saw the making of the movie a few months back, I was stunned by beautiful sets and the mesmerizing voices of the characters.When I started watching the film, I hoped that it won't be boring. But when the old and dusty theater started to go back in its new and shiny look, I knew that I was going to be in for a ride. I won't like the film if it isn't for the characters and their voices.Emmy Rossum did her role well. Her acting wasn't that memorable, but she still did justice to the character of Christine. Her voice isn't that strong, but it's forgivable since Christine was just 16 during those times. Her face is so expressive in certain scenes that you will just fall in love with her in a snap.Patrick Wilson's character in the movie is really easy to forget. When you are tasked to be Raoul, then prepare to annoy a lot of people. For the fans of the Phantom out there, you will hate Raoul. But, for women out there who easily fall in love, then you will love him. Anyways, Patrick still did a wonderful job of being that character. Nice voice!Ah.....the star of the show. Gerard Butler. When we first see him in the shadows, listening to Cristine's singing, we will feel in advance the mysterious aura of the phantom. You will have mixed emotions towards the phantom. I didn't know if I should hate him or like him. But, at the end, you will know the answer. Anyway, three thumbs up to Gerard Butler for being such a wonderful phantom. I didn't even know you can sing! Great job. It wont be great without him.Great sets, check. Wonderful acting, check. Superb voices, check. Awesome music, check, check, check.Watch the movie! Other people's harsh reviews aren't important. What matters is that you like it. Enjoy!",The Phantom of the Opera

This movie was what brought me into Phantom and I recommend it for any new coming Phans. It is enjoyable to watch. That said, I still do have some things im not so pleased with. I really didn't care for the seductive Phantom. He seemed to touch her as he pleases even when not in a temper. I do think that they did fine with Raoul though. Im very upset that they cut out the ""in all your fantasies.."" line from the title song but it's not that major of a deal. The Point of no Return and Final Lair however were a pretty big disappointment to me. I also dislike the fight scene after wandering child and that they exclude Raoul from it. The biggest flaw, to me, was the Red Death costume. That was NOT red death. Personally, this movie destroyed the mysterious, magical feeling you should get when you think of the Phantom but did Raoul's character justice.",The Phantom of the Opera
856,moviefan88,"Splendid, lavish, stunning Phantom!",10,4 January 2005,"I absolutely loved this film version of Phantom. I saw the Broadway production and have owned the CD with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, but this version is just fantastic! I enjoyed the film even more than the stage musical because the audience could see the actor's faces and could watch their emotions play out on the big screen. Starting with the actors, I thought that Gerard Butler infused the role of the Phantom with charisma, sexiness and suffering without being pathetic or demonic. His voice, though not as polished as Michael Crawford's, had more edge and sounded like a 'dangerous' man. I totally believed that he was the Phantom and that women would willingly fall under his spell. Emmy Rossum was an eye-opener. She had a youthful, polished and yet full voice of a budding opera star and her acting was not 'bland' as some critics have said. She played Christine with a mixture of sweetness, vulnerability, naiveté and loving-kindness without being silly. She will be a star after this. When I saw her in ""The Day after Tomorrow"" I thought that she had potential, and boy was I glad to see that I was right. The only criticism I have for the cast was Minnie Driver. She was not believable as a diva. She looked like a pale imitation of an opera diva wearing clothes which were too big, and too over-the-top for her. The clothes were wearing her. The costumes were amazing; I loved the dresses that Emmy Rossum wore and the cape and tux that the Phantom wore. The sets were visually stunning and the opera house was just incredible. The music and orchestration were fantastic and I recommend that you see this film at the biggest theater with the best sound system possible. If you like musicals, you HAVE TO SEE THIS!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
857,rasphigi,Still the greatest . . .,9,16 March 2005,"I began my journey into this amazing world of The Phantom of the Opera through the silver screen, not by watching it on stage, by seeing the old horror movies, or reading the original book. Little could I possibly know that sitting in a theater for two and a half hours could introduce me to the most amazing parade of color, life, and love I have ever seen.Andrew Llyod Webber and Joel Schumacher came together to make something original. Webber himself said that the movie is meant to be different from the stage play, and Schumacher did that. My close friends have told me they were disappointed that the movie was not close enough to the stage play, or that The Masquerade was not colorful enough. That may be true, but the movie is meant to be seen differently. It's meant to catch you off guard and sweep you off your feet. I myself could hardly stop crying after I walked out of the theater, and to this day just listening to the soundtrack makes me weep.After the Oscars finally were announced, I was furious that Phantom had not gotten more credit than several nominations. But, what does an Oscar mean? The stage version of Phantom received a Tony award in 1988. What is that supposed to mean for the movie if it doesn't receive an Oscar? Absolutely nothing. The movie is meant to live on in our dreams. As the Phantom himself said, he is there inside, and that's good enough for me.How could one possibly forget the characters and the music, when both come from your heart? So, listen to the music of the night and let your soul begin to soar. You may indeed live as you've never lived before.",The Phantom of the Opera
858,zaarmysterygirl,Excellent Adaptation,10,28 December 2004,I've seen the production two different times when it came to Kansas City. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom is one of my favorite stage productions. Others (including professional reviewers) should remember that this is a screen adaptation of Lord Webber's stage production and not a rehashing of old Phantom movies.Here is the spoiler - The screen version fleshes out various items wonderfully like the telling of the phantom's history. The way the screen changed from 1919 to 1870 as the chandelier rose was beautiful. This is probably the best adaptation of a stage production brought to screen that I've ever seen. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so that I can watch it again in my home.,The Phantom of the Opera
859,dosborn1,reality to legend to novel to movie to musical to movie musical,9,17 January 2005,"Novelist Gaston Leroux was convinced the Opera Ghost had existed. His belief was based on mysterious happenings at the Paris Opera House (including the kidnapping of singer Christine Daaé, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny, and the murder of his brother, Count Phillippe), and a letter Christine had written before her disappearance. Some believe the the opera ghost was responsible for all three crimes. Some believe that the Vicomte & his brother were vying for Christine and the Vicomte murdered his brother. Some believe that after their disappearance Christine and her Vicomte lived out their lives together in some secret unknown place. All this intrigue has very little to do with Leroux's novel nor with the theatrical productions based on it.A subterranean lake does in fact exist in the lower levels of the Paris Opera House. It was discovered during construction. It was one of the factors that delayed completion of the opera house for almost fifteen years. It was decided that the best thing to do was to leave the lake there and work with it.I had the good fortune to visit the Paris Opera House many years ago, and in the movie theater yesterday I felt like I was there. I'm quite sure that it was not shot on location, so I'm impressed.As far as the casting of the lead roles, I defer to the taste of Andrew Lloyd Webber himself. At first I was disappointed in the Phantom's voice, but as he becomes more angry and violent, his voice matches the drama. I find it interesting that Webber would cast the former lead singer in a rock band for his Phantom - but Webber's phantom is in essence a rock star - sexy, intriguing, edgy, and dangerous. He's the archetypal man your mother warned you about.The first time we hear Christine sing, her voice is soft and hesitant, as one would expect the first time a child is thrown unexpectedly into the limelight. In her first song we hear her voice grow to what I can only describe as amazing for an eighteen-year-old actress. She was perfectly cast - a young, innocent girl, living a sheltered existence, knowing very little of the real world (the opera house is her world). She's frightened of and yet helplessly pulled in by the overpowering predatory personality of the Phantom, and finding true love at the same time with Raoul.I loved Raoul from the moment I saw him on screen.A few things bothered me. Raoul had to be at least twenty years younger than Mme. Rémy, and yet in the black & white scenes they appeared to be about the same age.The audio often didn't sync with the video. The most glaring example of that was at the beginning of ""Masquerade."" For an entire line the singing was exactly one beat off from the lips. They had to have done it on purpose - perhaps they thought the dancing fit the music better one beat off, so they decided to just edit it that way and hope nobody noticed. I guess they didn't want to set up the scenery, costumes, etc. and re-shoot just to fix 5 seconds.The other instances weren't so glaring, but they were still disconcerting, and makes me think that for such an elaborate production they were in an awful hurry to get it out of production and in front of the public. I really wish they had taken the time to get it right.Other than the technical problems that at times were disconcerting, I was supremely entertained, as I was when I saw the play. So much has been made of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" but when it comes down to it, it's just great fun.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was afraid that the movie might not live up to the show, but I think it was fabulous! I read reviews about how weak the Phantom's voice is in the movie, and having seen Michael Crawford perform Phantom, I was afraid I'd be disappointed. NOT! This Phantom really lets his emotions out when he sings. The whole appearance of the movie is stunning -- the grand opera sets, the gorgeous costumes, and of course the Phantom's lair.

To give it an overall score would be unfair.Let's start by establishing the fact that The Phantom of The Opera is notoriously mediocre, and has outrun the likes of Les Miserables simply because of an unrelenting fan base. Don't misunderstand me, I enjoy the show, but only on a purely aesthetic level. There's no deep meanings, no metaphorical truths, and very, very little irony. Even the music pales in comparison when placed side to side against some of histories greatest composers like Bach, Mahler, and Puccini, to name three.I, unlike some people, am not going to try and compare this to the stage version of the show. It would be unfair, because they are not the same. On stage, there are no quick cuts; the show is taken piece by piece. In film, however, scenes which should appear in chronological order can be moved around, and the entire feel of them can be changed with something as simple as one close up, or a little background music. How about snow falling on the roof of the opera house, which is suspended against a starry background? Extra story elements can now be added, the use of black and white film can add a nice nostalgic, artistic touch to the film, which is surprising coming from Joel Schumacher, the man who put the rubber nipples and sculpted butt plate on the Batman suit.What I don't understand is, with all these extra touches that can be added to the film, why I was bored out of my mind. Could it have been the horrible sacrilege that was Gerard Butler being cast as the Phantom, which made some 'phans' feel that their favorite performer had been cheated? Or could it have been the bastardization of some of the most impressive numbers in the show? How about the one look fits all acting style of the pliable heroine, Christine? It could be one of these things, but I think that this film typifies why it is incredibly difficult to take a stage musical and try to translate it to stage. In the first place, the Phantom of The Opera is ludicrously theatrical, and by translating it to film, that theatricality was only magnified. Secondly, in an effort to keep normal, everyday moviegoers who wouldn't shuck out $75 for a ticket to see this on stage from being alienated, the director felt it necessary to make many of the sung lines spoken, and very woodenly spoken at that.Lastly, it is the remarkable connection between actor and audience that occurs in the theatre when one watches a show on stage that has kept The Phantom of The Opera alive and kicking season after season, and unfortunately for film makers, this is one thing that all the chronology splicing, black and white scenes, and close ups in the world can't emulate.In closing, The Phantom of The Opera is a lavishly mediocre, over theatrical, over hyped show that requires the actor to audience connection of the stage to be successful.",The Phantom of the Opera
862,lisa_nyc,Beautiful film,9,23 November 2004,"I was able to view this at a special screening and was very impressed. It is a visually stunning movie - the costuming and sets are as extravagant and lavish as the music. Gerard Butler gives a particularly anguishing and sympathetic performance as The Phantom. Emmy Rossum is beautiful portraying Christine and her transformation from a young innocent to a woman who is aware of herself, her sexuality, and the world of love. Patrick Wilson is a particularly dashing, heroic and protective Raoul and Minnie Driver provides hilarious comic relief as Carlotta. I particularly enjoyed the film's ability to delve deeper into the lives of characters. It provided depth and context and layers to all of the characters that the stage production cannot do. The entire cast was magnificent and I will be hearing the ""music of the night"" in my head for the next several days. I would definitely recommend it and can't wait to see it again.",The Phantom of the Opera
863,b-hath,A good film with two blaring flaws.,8,9 January 2006,"As a musical theatre actor I have had exposure to ""Phantom"" for many many years. Overall I enjoyed the film greatly. I actually thought it told the story more effectively than the stage play did, and also added more elements that were in the book. (Although Raoul in Gaston Leroux's book is whimpy beyond all belief.) The movie gives more of a complete ending. In the musical Christine and Raoul ride the gondola off into the sunset, simply leaving the Phantom on his own. I really enjoyed the touch of seeing the rose on Christine's grave. It just made a very nice bow to tie the movie off with. I thought the cast was overall very strong, with one major exception.When you are casting for The Phantom of The Opera, the concentration of musical chops are put on the two major leads, The Phantom and Christine. I thought Emmy Rossum a brilliant Christine. I already knew that every cast member except for one did their own singing. Minnie Driver's singing was dubbed over by opera singer Margaret Preece. They could have used a legit opera singer for this role on screen, but I thought Ms. Driver gave some wonderfully delivered acting moments and gave some comedic levity to the piece. Going back to Ms. Rossum, she gave an innocence and nurturing tone to her voice. And she certainly wasn't bad to look at either. I also enjoyed Patrick Wilson's performance as Raoul. I knew he would have the vocal chops for the role since he is already a musical theatre veteran. My major casting problem with this film is that of Gerard Butler as The Phantom. I can understand casting someone with star power in a major movie musical role when their talent is suspect i.e. Will Ferrell in The Producers. That will always help at the box office. However when you cast a virtual unknown, especially in terms of vocal performance, in one of the more demanding musicals roles out there, there will be problems. There are roles where you can fake your way through the show. You can perform each number so well that missed notes are quickly forgiven and forgotten. However I just can't see the reason their cast Butler in this role. He couldn't sing it! I hate to say this because I have seen Gerard Butler in interviews and he seems to be a very likable guy. You wanna go drinking with him and just hit on girls all night. He's a man's man. But that doesn't make him an appropriate Phantom.My second beef with this film is the audio syncing. It seems like they dubbed the vocals over the film with no accompaniment playing. I lost count on how many times the orchestrations and vocals were not synced with the film.Anyway, I overall enjoyed the film. It's is a very nice production. Just needed a new Phantom, and a new audio engineer. That's All Folks!",The Phantom of the Opera
864,taran244,An extraordinary achievement,10,24 December 2004,"I just saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that all of the critics who blasted it into a million pieces are 100% wrong. This is one of my favorite movies this year, second only to Spider-man 2. It is powerful, with a moving score and songs. Great singing by Rossum, Wilson and even Butler. Go see this if you are a fan of operas, the novel or the play (which I haven't seen, so I have nothing to base this comment on really). But I really enjoyed it. And even though several critics said the tunes were bad and didn't stick in peoples heads, I can't get them out of mine.

Overall, I thought this was a well-done adaptation of the Broadway smash. I give it an A for atmosphere and theatrics.Sorry, ladies, didn't care for Mr. Butler's gnarly voice.Miss Rossum was perfectly cast, and Miss Ellison was surprisingly good.Ocala Mike",The Phantom of the Opera
866,flcracker,A Jarring Note,5,25 January 2005,"Don't know if this counts as a spoiler or not, but better safe than sorry.Only one jarring note, but a big one - why did everyone freak out over the Phantom? As near as I can tell, his main physical malady was a seriously bad case of conjunctivitis.Seriously, with the state of medicine and hygiene in the 1870s, the Phantom would never have turned heads in a crowd, way much less than causing grown men to recoil in fear.I tried real hard to ignore this, but I kept getting that feeling Captain Kirk got when dealing with the white-black guy fighting the black-white guy -- what the hell is all the fuss about? Other than that, it was a beautiful movie that made me wish they had lingered longer over the sets and the costumes.",The Phantom of the Opera
867,teachergeek,Excellent interpretation,10,22 December 2004,"I've been a Phantom fan since I was 13, which amounts to roughly 12 years. I know the score by heart, and have seen the stage production at least 5 times. Which means I've been excited/ nervous /thrilled /terrified about the Phantom movie. If it was well done, it would be awesome, and if it sucked then it would suck forever and that would be that. The trailer kicked ass...which I saw back in July (it was shown before Spiderman2) and I've essentially been holding my breath since then.Personally, I loved it.1. The Phantom was played extremely well. Sensual and erotic for the first third, scary and erotic (I'm twisted about it, deal) and then scary and almost pathetic (pitiful? hard to find a word choice) for the last third. Redemption accomplished. Very happy.2. Emmy Rossum deserves her Golden Globe award for her role as Christine. She plays the character much better than I had expected and better than some stage interpretations I've seen. I also love her voice. I've never been a huge fan of Sarah Brightman, who sounds a bit shrill. Rossum is much more palatable.3. Never liked Raoul...end of story. But the guy is what he's supposed to be.4. Webber did all the orchestral changes, so it's fluid with the tone of the show/movie.5. Intelligent transitions that do a better job of furthering the plot than can occur on stage.6. They moved the part where the chandelier drops, but it was moved to the point where I always thought it should have dropped (but for staging reasons doesn't)Issues... 1. Sometimes a little too much exposition or recitation of lines that were sung in the show and should stay sung.2. Not sure I like the ""back story"" provided for Phantom (my preferred back story is Susan Kay's novel ""Phantom"")3. I got jarred here and there because of lyrical changes (expect that if you're a huge fan of the Broadway version...not bad changes, but a dropped line here, an added one there).4. The over the credits song by Minnie Driver is just unnecessary. She has a pretty folksy kind of voice, but it's just not needed. Make it go away.",The Phantom of the Opera
868,btvs_susa,Best musical ever!,10,5 September 2005,"I saw the movie a while ago, without having read the book or seen the show or even heard about it, and I absolutely loved it! I have now seen it twice, I own the DVD and the soundtrack, and, when I have enough money, the book. Visually it is absolutely stunning. The colors are so beautiful, and I love the clothes! (Why can't todays fashion go back to that time?) The wigs makes me laugh, but I suspect that this might be their purpose.... I usually don't like this kind of music, but this I loved, especially Music of the night and Phantom of the opera, and-(The list goes on to mention 19 of the 22 songs, so I'm just gonna stop now.) Emmy Rossum (Christine) has a beautiful voice, and sings her part beautifully. I was very surprised to her that she was only seventeen, but all in all she makes a wonderful and crazy Cristine. (I believe that anyone who'd choose Raoul over The Phantom is crazy....) Patrick Wilson makes a good Raoul, if an annoying one. But then again, I never liked the character much. He certainly is a prince charming, which I loathe. The whole time I can't help but hope that Christine is a bit smarter this time. I'm always disappointed on that.... Gerard Butler was amazing. He is now one of my favorite actors and singers. He is such a wonderful phantom, and though he is way to good looking, he couldn't be better. He has this tendency to make me fall in love with whatever character he's playing.I Love his voice, and I'm having trouble understanding why they left out ""No one would listen"", although this has nothing to do with the rest of this sentence.... I can't say enough good things about him... I thought all of the supporting cast was good, especially Minnie Driver, who was hysterical. I will never understand how the newspapers were allowed to give it only 2 out of 6. I give this 11 out of 10, and recommend it to everyone! It would also be wise to bring Kleenex.",The Phantom of the Opera
869,kimmchardy,A definite must see,10,20 December 2004,"I went to see this film a few days ago and I was very happy with what I saw. I loved the opening scene, it was original and blew the audience away. The opera house looked amazing, all the sets were dazzling and made the film even more spectacular. A lot of people I have talked to say that they were disappointed with the singing voices and that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were much better. I however disagree, this film went for a young cast and in my opinion they all did a very good job. Emmy Rossum had a lovely voice and portrayed Christine as a fragile and innocent girl being almost possessed by the phantom. Gerard Butler admitted that he had never seen the phantom of the opera before and I think that made his performance even better. When playing the phantom he gave his own performance, differently to Michael Crawford's yes but he made it his own and it was original. Patrick Wilson also did very well and his voice fit the part. Minnie Driver was hilarious as the Italian diva. Whilst watching the film you are meant to be looking at everything put together. Not just the acting and not just the sets but how everything looked when put together and in my eyes everything together was brilliant and it made it a great must see film and it will stay one of my favourites. All the supporting cast did well and I loved the idea of how we were told how the phantom came to be at the opera house and his connections with not just Christine but Madame Giry as well. The one thing that did disappoint me about the film was Jennifer Ellison. I know she had difficulties with her speaking parts and she did manage to sound English HOWEVER! She is not meant to be English she is meant to be French! How did that happen? Miranda Richardson playing Madame Giry managed to do a French accent very well yet Jennifer Ellison playing her daughter Meg Giry sounded the least bit French.But all in all I enjoyed it very much and would love to see it again and again.",The Phantom of the Opera
870,Caibre,In one word: Fantastic,8,24 December 2004,"Simply amazing, no doubt one of the best films of the year. I rarely post my thoughts on movies but this one was surely good enough to make an exception. The actors (particularly Gerard Butler as The Phantom) did such an amazing job, it really has to be seen. Emmy Rossum as Christine was just brilliant casting, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul was a great decision as well. The music was every bit as good as in the live show (Yes, I have seen it, a few years ago) and I couldn't have asked for more in this movie. The scene decoration was also done perfectly, and was very similar to the live show as well. Amazing. If you are at all hesitant to see this movie, admittedly as I was, go see it! You won't regret it!",The Phantom of the Opera
871,Wytchy,Amazing!,10,13 June 2005,"Having never seen the play, I cannot vouch for the movie's accuracy or inaccuracy. However, it was SO visually stunning that I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time. The music and camera angles, as well as lighting, were perfectly coordinated. Personally, I enjoyed the cast, though I understand that those who have seen the Broadway version were disappointed. The Phantom's singing voice was slightly weak, but then... I'm a singer, I notice these things. Talking with people who have seen the production, I was told that it was pretty accurate, and that the changes that were made actually made more sense. Also, it allowed people who had been sitting in the nosebleed section to really figure out what was going on. My overall favorite feature was the rich color of the scenes. It literally seemed to be glowing brilliantly in the candlelight, torchlight, et cetera. The present day scenes were also very well done, and the style allowed the viewer to avoid confusion.

I felt that he carried the emotions of the role through to their full potential and explored a much YOUNGER side to the Phantom that maybe such stars as Crawford or Travolta (both considered for the role) might not have done. I admit that I am a fan of Michael Crawford and am slightly embarrassed to say that it was Crawford's sweet tones that I was playing through my head as Butler's lovely mouth was opening and closing, but (even though I loves ya Michael) as an audience we needed to see a younger Phantom especially when I came to ""Past the Point of no Return""! Ohhhhhhhh maaaaaaaan...not to give ANYTHING away, but the whole film is worth watching to see this scene! It was WONDERFUL! Wonderfully played, and wonderfully sung!Before I shut up i have to say that Emmy Rossum was the weakest performance of the film, yes she showed vulnerability and had those big misty eyes, but it was all to vague. Even though her back plot is explained in the film (more so than in the show), I till didn't fully understand WHY the Phantom has such a hold on her, and her Yearning for the Dark and well as light was only touched on within my favorite part (""Past the Point of not Return"" again folks).On the whole I'd give this film a 4/10 for the FIRST half of the film and a 8/10 for the second.

I was not pleasantly surprised, man, I was astonished, touched, and went on to see it twice more. The last movie I went to see three times was the Fellowship of the Ring, dude! This is a great movie, believe me. Gerald Butler (Phantom), though under attack by some for the heinous crime of not being Michael Crawford, sings incredibly , Emmy Rossum (Christine) sings incredibly, marvelous casting, and, of course, a great sound track. I especially love the scene where the Phantom and Christine are boating down the underground river. I mean, any movie that can pull off a French psychopathic Opera Ghost singing along to synthetic music and organ, well, something went right.There are a few problems with it, but nothing really important. They never did explain in detail why to ""keep your hand at the level of eyes,"" or why the policemen didn't shoot the Phantom once he was singing on stage, or why the Phantom bumped off Joseph Buquet.

The story from the very beginning gave me a sense of nostalgia and a melancholic feel. Miranda Richardson plays the aloof and compassionate Madame Giry and is introduced at the beginning and acts without effort. The film is quite lavish and the music will send you through seas of emotion, I thought musically it was outstanding in its composition and delivery. Our main characters The Phantom played by Gerard Butler and Christine played by Emmy Rossum are quite hypnotic and while Butler gives the phantom a sense of dangerousness, mystery and genius he also shows his vulnerability and sadness which is at times palpable. Rossum as the gorgeous Christine gives the character a sexy minxy side she displays to great effect in ""music of the night"" and ""point of no return"". I was surprised to find I had great empathy for the phantom and how little I had for Raoul who is just the handsome rich kid who has everything, although at the end in the final scene I finally found empathy for him as you will see if you watch it.",The Phantom of the Opera
876,happybluebirdie,A tragic waste of time and money,2,4 May 2005,"The sets were lovely. The costumes were lavish. And that, my friends, is the limit of what can, even loosely, be considered ""good."" Emmy Rossum is physically stunning as Christine, but that doesn't save her never-changing vacant expression, nor does it spare us her weak, poorly-supported voice. Her enunciation is non-existent (""Thing of me, thing of me fonly when we kiss goooonigh""), and her high notes are strident and without power. I have heard her sing in other films, and I've been suitably impressed, but this was absolutely not her finest hour. Given her age and her apparent vocal range, I suspect she is merely going through a vocal change and will even out into a lovely sound very soon. Nevertheless, her stylings in this movie didn't cut it.Gerard Butler. Oh, Gerard. My dear, sweet, sexy Gerard. What were you thinking? (And, more to the point, what was the casting director thinking?) Please don't sing. Not without getting substantial help. He had his moments, and I remember holding my breath at some points, hoping the lovely tone he had going would hold out, but it never did. It was growly, out-of-tune, and lacked energy. He acted the part well, but this show is called ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and there is some singing involved. (Just a little.) Horrible miscasting here.Perhaps most unforgivable is the astonishing lack of continuity in this film. When we first see the face of the Phantom, reflected in a mirror, it looks scarcely marred. His face and hair around his little mask is pristine. At the end, at the moment of the great unveiling, you can see the special effects kick in. The face actually changes, and not only is the Phantom's face marred beyond the edges of where the mask was, but suddenly, half his hair on that side of his face is gone, when just moments before he had some lovely sideburns. Again, what were they thinking? Did they think we wouldn't notice? My husband, who enjoys the show and wanted to see this film theatres, turned to me after the DVD had spun down and said ""My God. I'm glad we didn't waste money seeing that at the theatre."" I concur. I only wish I could get those two hours back.",The Phantom of the Opera

I had low expectations for it, but I am glad that I had gone to see it in the first place. Anyone who has only seen the musical play may not like it, however. After I saw it the first time, I took one of my friends with me the next weekend. Now she is addicted to it and we both have the soundtrack and listen to it at least once a week. I know that when it comes out on DVD I will buy it. This movie is perfect for anyone who likes musicals, Emmy Rossum, Andrew Lloyd Webber, or awesome costumes.

Interestingly, I actually preferred the movie version to the stage version. Of course, I adored the stage production, but the movie's closer shots somehow allowed me to connect more easily with the characters. I also preferred the movie's vocals, with the exception of the Phantom, in which case, all of the Broadway Phantoms appropriately captured my heart. That's not to say I didn't love Gerald Butler, because I enjoyed his voice, but it's not comparable to Hugh Panaro. The fact that I saw the movie first (at a quite young age), might've contributed to my preference.

I have seen the stage musical twice and the film twice also, and it was great to see that the details of the film brought back so many memories of the musicals as they are so familiar. Emmy Rossum plays the part of Christine wonderfully, and her vocals are just outstanding. There were so many moments through the film where i felt tears in my eyes because the story was just so perfect. The scene in which Christine is taken to the phantom's lair which is surrounded with candles is just magnificent-seeing something live and on stage in front of you is one thing, but seeing it on the big screen, with every detail perfectly clear to you just gives you so much more understanding. I have been a fan of the phantom of the opera since i was 4, when my mother took me to the stage musical, and since early October last year when i found out the movie was to be released, i had been so excited and i was so glad that the film didn't let me down in anyway.

I was gripped from the very beginning with the sets, the story and, of course, the gorgeous, rich music. Loved Christine and Raoul and the Phantom.Christine's physical beauty is pure and her character so trusting and loyal. The strong animal magnetism of the Phantom is too much for her to resist yet as he slides faster towards his doom and threatens everyone around him, she still feels empathy for him to the end. I loved the clarity of her voice as she sang the signature songs. I've seen the film 3 times now and listened to the CD's numerous times. The songs spin around in my head and the imagery is still vivid in my memory.

Keep in mind that I can't compare it to the play because I've never seen it. So,I'll be comparing just to the O.L.C. which I have.First of all,I want to tell you. This movie was well worth the year's wait! I was lucky to be in a crowded theater for the showing I went to. The seats filled up really fast once 3:30 came around. (I was there at 3:15..LOL. I wanted a perfect seat!)I was certain I'd be seated beside some play-goer snob,but nope. Daniel and I had the whole row to ourselves! So,here's the breakdown!Opening Scene:100 PERCENT PERFECT! I swear,I had freakin' goosebumps! It chilled me!And now for the characters! (please remember that I have NOT seen the play,only heard the O.L.C,so this was my first time seeing the story come to life!)Christine Daae: I do NOT understand why everyone made such a big deal about Emmy Rossum! She was phemonenal! Emmy brought Christine to life the way I always imagined her! Bravisimo,Emmy! And by the way,her voice is amazing! If you haven't already heard the soundtrack for the movie,go and pick it up. That's an order!Victome Raoul DeChangy: This was the first movie I'd seen him in. I'd heard great things about him though. Raoul is supposed to be graceful,somewhat pompous,and gentle. Patrick played those parts very well,and! He can sing to boot! Not too many men can do that that I know of! Patrick was just the sort I imagined Raoul to be played by.The Phantom/Erik: Ahem. Gerard was absolutely amazing! I don't care if I AM a Crawford fan. Gerard was fantastic,and I loved the emotion the man brought to the Phantom. He's sexy,too!Others: The two people they chose to play Firmin and Andre were great! I never really considered how silly they could be portrayed until now. They were great! Minnie Driver brought a LOT of comedy into the movie. I cracked up during Prima Donna. I'll never dislike that song again,now that I have that scene to refer to! *giggle* She was just fantastic!! Madame Giry and Meg were very well done too. I can't remember who played Mme,but she was good. Jennifer Ellison was cute in her own way as Meg. I liked her a lot too. Although,I thought Meg was lot younger in the play....?? I don't know. The Costumes-THEY WERE GREAT! And so elaborate too! I never figured they'd go to all that trouble for each little opera that was featured in the movie,and for such a short period of time. The period costumes besides the opera ones were great. I love period movies for the costumes anyway,but POTO's were great. Over all: Over all,this movie was everything I hoped for from Webber,who,by the way (for everyone who keeps criticizing) helped cast and produced it!I'm very pleased with it,and CANNOT wait to own it! I urge anyone who's ever seen the play,or at least heard the music to go and see this. I promise you,you will NOT be disappointed!!I give this film 100% for pure perfection!",The Phantom of the Opera
885,wlwinner,The Phantom lives up to expectations,10,2 January 2005,"Well, I must say that I whole-heartedly disagree with the review of the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera. And, I disagree with some of the comments posted above. Here's my review: The movie version of The Phantom of the Opera is in one word spectacular. That said, here are some things that you need to understand.Everyone will have a different reaction to both the movie and the theater performance adaptations of Gaston Leroux's original novel originally published in 1911. Many different variations of this book have been created both for the stage and for the screen, however, Webber's is the closest to the actual story as set forth by Leroux.Schumacker has created a vast and beautiful opera house and has been able to take some liberties with the original Broadway play. This is in no way a bad thing. Webber created the play with the knowledge that he would be limited in his ability to portray certain things. Schumacker, with the guidance of Webber has been able to expand those areas that Webber was initially limited on.And, for those that say that the movie is too different from the stage performance, it is interesting to note that Webber is credited as both the producer and co-writer of the screenplay. The added music was not created by someone else, but by Webber himself. A quote from Webber included with the CD of the music: ""I've written several minutes of new music, but it doesn't threaten the integrity of the show in any way...(The movies's) not at all based on the theatre visually or direction wise, but it's still got exactly the same essence."" To claim that the movie does not follow Webber's original ideas is ludicrous.Another aspect that many will not truly appreciate is the music. To fully appreciate it, you must have some training and/or experience with music. Webber brilliantly uses minor and major keys to elicit the emotions from the listener. Dissonant music can be very melodious and within the confines of the Phantom, it is extremely appropriate. The listener is not supposed to feel happy and peaceful and like everything is perfect. We are supposed to feel struggle and a little chaos and most importantly, I believe, fear.I had the privilege of seeing the touring Broadway troupe in Indianapolis a little over a month ago and it's hard to compare the two. I loved both. For the price, I would much rather watch the movie, but you can't beat being in the audience and seeing the story live. The movie outperformed my expectations, though. The acting was excellent. The singing was near-perfect although, that's easier to attain when singing in a studio and not on stage live. The camera work was brilliant as well as the directing. Every aspect of the movie, in my opinion, portrayed precisely what Webber originally envisioned when he set out to create the Phantom of the Opera.The one problem I really had with the movie: Minnie Driver as La Carlotta. What happened to the fat woman?",The Phantom of the Opera
886,jcrobinson,Phantastic!,10,13 January 2005,"I've read the book and anticipated the film for a long time. I expected the film to be beautiful and romantic, but wasn't prepared for how breathtaking and thrilling it was. Gerard Butler brings a smoldering and beautifully dark presence to the Phantom. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson make one of the most romantic couples of the year. All in all, this movie is worth seeing again over and over. You'll be drawn into the amazing vocal performances and the stirring drama that is the Phantom of the Opera. The swelling music and rich sets only serve to enhance the power of the story. May the Angel of Music speak to you in a new and entirely enthralling way.",The Phantom of the Opera
887,mproll01,I loved this movie!,10,10 January 2005,"This was the most moving, wonderfully romantic movie I have ever seen. I thought the singing was excellent....the cast themselves singing the parts.....and these were by no means easy for anyone. Yes, you do need plenty of Kleenex because its that moving. Anyone who says they didn't like this movie is a very sad creature who obviously doesn't appreciate true beauty.....and who doesn't listen......truly listen to their emotions. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a musical genius who brings such emotion to his music. This is part of the magic of the Phantom. I believe it deserves only the best and I will probably go and see it again and take all of my family and friends with me. I loved this movie! Mary",The Phantom of the Opera
888,justlacee,I Absolutely Loved It !!!,10,29 April 2005,I saw the Phantom in Toronto several years ago and was a bit apprehensive about watching the movie but I must tell you it was beautifully done and I absolutely loved it. The music is the most beautiful I have ever heard.Brought back memories of seeing it at the beautiful Pantages Theatre.I had almost forgotten how magical and wonderful the entire production was. Andrew Lloyd Webber did a wonderful job. The entire production was breathtaking. I can not say enough good things about this. An absolute favorite. I will definitely own this DVD and highly recommend this to all Phantom Of The Opera lovers !,The Phantom of the Opera

890,captain_brij_sparrow,hauntingly beautiful,9,26 January 2005,"I just saw the Phantom last night and Boy! I didn't know that anyone could pull off an opera on screen so successfully! I have to admit that I did cringe at first when I heard the melodramatic music coming off the cinema screen - I'm a huge fan of operas, but to see it coming at me in the movies was a little startling at first. But once you get into the swing of it...man! that was a cool movie! The dramatic scenery, the really loud music, the gorgeous singing, the superb acting on the part of the phantom and Christine - ah! it was a masterpiece!Afterwards I went dancing into the street singing ""say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime"" swinging my handbag daintily and wishing my hair was long and curly. My poor friends must have been kinda embarrassed....but they're used to it!We girls had a big argument about who Christine should have married. Personally, I thought the end was perfect. But some of the other girls reckoned they would have married the phantom. True, I think Raoul had a rather sissy hairdo and voice (he looked much better as an old dude!), but I think his part had a heap of potential, it's just a shame that the actor couldn't quite give his interpretation of the character the strength and masculine appeal that the hero should have. He tried pretty hard, but with such luscious locks as he had to swing around, he had quite a challenge! Minnie Driver played her part very well, I thought, and provided a welcome humorous relief from the drama of the majority of the movie. The owners of the opera annoyed me, but that is a compliment to them - it was their role to annoy! It was great to see that Hollywood isn't afraid to try their hand at classics! Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Carribbean, and now the Phantom show just how successful it can be to take an old style movie and bring it to a new life with the photography, effects, and acting of today. congrats to the makers, and keep at it!",The Phantom of the Opera
891,Tatiana_Larina,This film has enchanted me.,10,12 December 2004,"This film actually made me shed a tear of joy from the sheer beauty which was filling all my senses. I loved music, loved Christine's fresh voice and had shivers down my spine every time the Phantom sang, his voice had a hypnotic quality. In fact I believe the music was the most beautiful creation I ever heard.One of the things that show for themselves was that after the film ended all people in the theatre sat quiet for few short minutes as if they didn't want to separate from it, like they were thinking that there will be another end to it.Christine was played sweetly by Emmy Rossum, but the actor who was playing the Phantom , Gerard Butler, made the story so passionate, gentle, sad and powerful at the same time (and this with the half of the face covered). Every nuance of the Phantom's character was shown and his connection with Christine was like a singing string almost visible. This film will definitely stay with me for many years like books and films that make us change a little by something in them which make our soul sing.",The Phantom of the Opera
892,mb2086,Superb,10,13 December 2004,"Worth the wait. I was not disappointed with this screen version of Lloyd Webber's infamous stage production. Good performances and attention to detail coupled with a score delivered with panash and assurance makes this one of the best movie musicals for many years. Webber has obviously settled for screenplay not too distant from the stage version but there is nothing wrong with that. The film has style and Schumacker conjurs a genuine sense of the Gothic in old Paris. Critics of this film will either be unfamiliar with or dislike Lloyd Webber's music or have no sense of imagination or romanticism. The lavish sets are there to spur the imagination, not to thwart it or to replace what there might otherwise have been. The main scenes are allowed to develop rather than being edited to death and the story is well told with monochrome flashbacks and fast forwards to a different time. Go see.",The Phantom of the Opera
893,gaias-inghean,"It is a classic on stage and now, in the theaters.",10,28 December 2004,"I must admit that I was really worried when I saw they had made a movie of a musical of this caliber. I expected it to be hacked to pieces considering the musical/play is nearly 3 hours long. I expected it to lack that mystery, that deep emotion that sometimes only stage performances can muster from you.I must say, I was PLEASANTLY surprised. I don't think they sacrificed any of the story line at all. The music was as glamorous and beautiful as any stage performance I have seen. I often found myself wanting to applaud when they were done singing and probably would have save for the silence in the audience of the theater.This is a MUST see for everyone that loves musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera
894,trenna-1,Its too much to take in the first time!,10,30 December 2004,"I'm a long time fan of the stage version, although I've never been a fan of Michael Crawford's version. I had a favorite Canadian Phantom.The first time I saw the movie, I was stunned and didn't really know what I thought. There is so much going on. I have since seen it several more times and it gets better and better with each viewing. (The tickets are cheaper than the seven times I've seen the stage version) The music and the spectacle are amazing, but it takes a couple of times before the acting, especially Gerard Butler's, really gets to you. So much has gone into making the emotions of the characters there for everyone to see as well as hear. This movie is very different from watching the overdone theatrics necessary on a stage many feet away. We are almost in the heads of the characters and I think it gives Andrew Lloyd Webber's music another dimension. I think this movie will be a classic with the fans, if not the critics.",The Phantom of the Opera
895,JMoney324,I wish to GOD I could love this film,6,31 December 2004,"Well, it's been three days since I have seen it and I can finally say I was not at all thrilled. I wanted to see this musical be adapted to a screen play years ago and was depressed at seeing it's outcome. Normally when you really love a movie, you can walk out and say ""Wow!"" However, I walked out contemplating on whether I Liked it or not. So, after three days of pondering... I did not. Of course no one can recreate the character of the Phantom like Michael Crawford did. And though Gerard Butler shined through some scenes with the same misery as Crawford showed, he was very short on emotion when it came time to sing. His voice was more of Raoul's. While he could not touch on making me feel Christine was his passion in ""Music of the Night"". I still felt his voice, as a singer, was impressive. But, singing the most famous song in Broadway history should be a task that has to come out, through the audience, as a feeling of let's say, ""goose bumps"". Again, Butler did a great job. I am just hoping they edited his solo parts wrong. The most disappointing idea of the ""Hollywood"" version is that it is created to have the Phantom love Christine the way Raoul or any other man might. Sorry, I like love stories and all... but, the original idea of the Phantom being in love with her voice and having the chance to create his idea of operas through her was much more poetic. Love through physical nature is not always as justified as love through the gift that the physical form can produce. Which, to me, was what ""Phantom"" was about. The movie diminished itself to the typical love story instead of showing how much someone can love someone else by seeing their talent instead of their looks. I am quite sure, if the ""Phantom"" was real, he'd agree.",The Phantom of the Opera
896,DreaErin,One of the best movies of 2004!,7,23 December 2004,"First off, i thought that the making of this film was a very good idea. It was soo good that there would be a version of the musical made available to the entire public, for those who'd never been to a Broadway production. Even though i'm sure it's not the same, i'm sure the heart of the story was conveyed all the same.Not only was the film visually spectacular, but each song was as beautiful as the next. The sets were detailed and the use of filming techniques were always appropriate. I was particularly taken aback by the film's opening scenes, the changing of the opera house from dusty black and white to such rich color. Having been to the Opera house in Paris, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the extravagance of Paris Opera. I have seen many musicals, from Singin' in the Rain to Chicago, and this is my favorite. One of the most impressive aspects of this film is the fact that most of the cast sings exceptionally well. Emmy Rossum's voice was as clear as crystal and i was shocked at how well Gerard Butler can sing. His performance as the elusive, deformed genius was Oscar worthy. His most beautiful scene takes place at the very end and it brought me to tears. The only negative thought i had on this film was the continuation of the songs. There were many variations on many of the songs. Perhaps the songs could have been toned down a touch, as the atmosphere in the cinema is much different than the theater. A couple more lines of dialog wouldn't have hurt. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, whether they enjoy musicals or not. Unless you are one who absolutely hates musicals, this film is well worth the over-priced ticket.",The Phantom of the Opera
897,divinemsjunebug,Very Beautiful Movie,9,17 December 2004,"I went to the Premiere of this movie. It had some GREAT moments. I would recommend going to see it in the theater just for the visual stimulation. There were several times I got goosebumps (especially in the beginning when the chandelier was raised and color came back into the old theater). Some of the voices, to me, weren't that great. The girl who played Christine seemed a little too young for the role. She had a very pretty voice but it didn't have a LOT of power (I could never believe that they would cast her in the lead of an OPERA). The higher notes that she hit were very beautiful, when she gets older she is going to have a killer beautiful voice. AND the first time she sees the Phantom, just about all of the women and some men, all gasped. He was breathtaking. Very handsome (in his mask of course)BUT even without his mask he was a little bumpy but NOT that gross and deformed, I wish they would have really made that side of his face a lot more grotesque. I found myself really feeling sorry for him and creeped out by his crazy stalking ways. But he is an excellent actor (his voice was a little too pop sounding but I could totally overlook that). Overall it was fun to just sit back and take it all in.I would recommend this film to anyone. I am going to see it again!",The Phantom of the Opera
898,mikeo988,The Phantom of the Opera,9,24 December 2004,"This new movie based on the musical The Phantom of the Opera directed by Joel Schumacher, I thought, was very good. In particular, I really liked Emmy Rossum as Christine. She did a great job and really stuck out. Her acting was very good as well. She has the best voice and she carried the entire movie. Gerard Butler, the Phantom, did a decent job with a decent singing voice. While I thought he didn't act well, the actor who played Raoul could really sing. I didn't think Minnie Driver acted that well and Miranda Richardson was OK. And the two owners of the opera house were also decent. Overall, I really liked the movie thanks to Emmy Rossum.",The Phantom of the Opera
899,imburningup_01,the musical comes alive through film,10,10 January 2005,I knew when I went to watch this that I wasn't expecting much after the bad reviews...so I was surprised when I found it was one of the most liveliest musical films i had seen for a while. The music was brilliant and the whole film came alive when the theme tune started playing. It is one of the catchiest tunes ever!! When I came out of the cinema half the people were humming it!!! The characters are developed so well. Some of them seem to be very suspicious and they have something weird about them that you don't find out till later. There is always this heart drumming suspense when the phantom appears. It is all a big fantasy and there are many questions that you find yourself asking. Like what is behind the mask??? The singing is excellent as well. Though I don't think the film touches on the dance aspect as much. The scenery is really good and suits the mood of the songs and seems to amplify the sheer size of it and the dramatic storyline and songs. There are also some humorous bits and some slightly scary bits that even i found myself edging back into my seat. There is a good storyline throughout the film i was kept in suspense and i was riveted. I recommend you go and see this film especially if you like musicals and really dramatic music and acting.,The Phantom of the Opera
900,classic_movies,Amazing Movie!!!,9,24 December 2004,"I went to go see it with some of my friends and all of us loved it. Emmy Rossum can sing!! She has an amazing voice!! I listened to an interview she gave on The Phantom of the Opera and she said that she used to take voice lessons for a long time, and then for 5 years she got into other stuff, and then did a couple movies and all. And then at the last minute auditioned for The Phantom of the Opera and got the part! Gerald Butler it wonderful, and I must say good looking too. I mean, is it even allowed for a person to fall in love with a guy who wears a mask and cape and runs around and kills people and lives in a sewer? The only actor who I didn't like that much was Raoul. He seemed to be overacting a little too much. And he really needed to get a haircut, but other than that, he was okay. I don't know why Minnie Driver is put down so much in this movie. She really was great. She was annoying and pesty, but that's who the character was. Someone who thinks herself to be higher than the other people at the opera house. And I heard that she did her own singing. That she really can sing. Her voice wasn't dubbed. The only part which kind of got to me was the chandelier didn't fall at the right time. It fell in a totally different spot in the movie. So that kinda got to me, but other than that, I thought this movie was great!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
901,lenoresden,Play it AGAIN!!,10,24 December 2004,"This is what I found myself saying when the end credits started rolling. I have seen the Stage Play 12 times. I have read the Book so may times I can not count it(LEaroux AND Kay's books). I will not put spoilers in here. All I'm going to say is go INTO it with an OPEN MIND. Some of the scenes are different from the Stage play. IT IS NOT a shot by shot remake. Bring Kleenex. Your going to need them. Butler plays Phantom with so much Intensity you CAN'T help but love him. I am NOT a fan of Minnie Driver by any means, but I have to say I liked her in this movie, she was even funny in it. As for Rossum she makes a good Christine. The costumes and the scenery were Beautiful. 2 days after seeing it, and I'm STIL IN AWE.",The Phantom of the Opera

Those people who do not have the chance to see it on Broadway live musical can experience the magic through this spectacular film.The singing is marvelous and cinematography is legendary. I was sitting at the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. After every song, i had the urge to stand and clap. It is a must watch film. I guarantee that you would not be disappointed. You would be if you missed it. trust me! Imagine watching the King of all musicals on screen for the first time! It's amazing!!! The Phantom is extremely cool too for those of you who are wondering. The bottomline is - Go watch it or you are missing a very important ""gift from God to the cinema and musicals""",The Phantom of the Opera
903,deadly_tiger11,Phantom Phan's Phandom Speaks,10,24 December 2004,"Erik is a deeply personal character. And not just because he's dark, mysterious, deadly, and caring. Everyone at some point or another feels different or all alone in the world. At some point people stop rooting for Raoul to win because 1. We love the Underdog 2. Because at some point Erik stops being Erik. We project our self onto him. He becomes what we want him to be.Thats the problem with phantoms. They are easily molded to suit us. Those who want to see a blood thirsty monster do. Those who want to see a caring loving man will. That's why there is no diffinitive ""draculaest"" version of The Phantom. Leroux left Erik open to enterpretation.In my opinion all Phantom Philms are on level ground. Not one is better than the others. I will admit that is is better than some (phantom of paradise) it is not the best film out there. Everyone has their own personal feelings that make their opinion of a good Phantom Philm.",The Phantom of the Opera
904,VampyrJesse87,Simply perfect,10,24 December 2004,"The last time I saw Phantom on stage I was five. Barely remembering the play I so wanted to see the movie. Wonderful! The roles of Christine and the Phantom were played beautifully by Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. They definitely had a lot of chemistry. Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver also did well. The songs, though most were the same, sounded wonderful. Emmy will have a bright future in the opera with that voice. The costumes and set designs were captivating and gorgeous. The best scene was definitely the Point of No Return. The cast did a wonderful job performing the Phantom's dark opera and the titled song performed by Christine and the Phantom sent chills down my spine. You could feel the passion between the two characters. Overall, the movie was spectacular and I recommend it to any. Five out of five stars.",The Phantom of the Opera
905,bawriting,Most preposterous movie I've ever seen,3,25 December 2004,"This movie is as silly as Leroux's 19th century Gothic melodramatic potboiler of a novel. The best part is the special effect that moves us out of the invented frame story into the ""real"" story. As the chandelier is hauled up, the Paris Opera comes back into color and life. (It's just like when the Titanic comes back to life in that movie.) However ... if, when the Phantom sent the chandelier careering into the stage and it set the theater of fire (we see fire in all the windows), why is there no fire damage in the opera in the frame story? This is just one of a million oddiments in the movie. (Fire the continuity person). Butler can't sing (he shouts his songs) and the various masks he wears show unblemished skin around them ... and when the mask is ripped off (what held it on?), the damaged skin makeup keeps changing and covers more facial area than the masks did. When he replaces the singer in Don Juan, who wouldn't notice that he weighs 50 pounds less?? Emmy Rossum sings splendidly, but she must be a CGI character--she has less personality than the children in Polar Express. She goes out into Parisian winters in skimpy clothing, she never gets cold,the snow never touches her, and she leaves no footprints in the snow. At the climax of the film, she wades hip-deep into the water, but when she and Raoul (who can apparently breathe under water) pole away in the boat, her wedding dress is dry and ruffly. The best acting in the movie comes from Minnie Driver--who was obviously having enormous fun as the diva--and superb English actors Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow, who can't sing but are wonderfully pompous and desperate as the new opera owners. Watching Hinds and Callow--and the scenery--is worth the price of a ticket, but Lloyd Weber should perhaps retire and donate his royalties to singing lessons for his artistes. Watching this magnificently tacky movie was the most fun I've had at the movies all year.",The Phantom of the Opera
906,jefmama-1,I can't wait to see it again!,10,30 December 2004,"I am totally blown away by this movie. I think Joel Schumacher created a fabulous interpretation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's version of the Phantom story. People who compare this film to the original Lon Chaney horror flick just don't understand that the ALW version is a tale of love, not a tale of horror. ALW's Phantom is seductive first and a bit frightening second. I think Gerard Butler was an excellent choice. To those who criticize his voice, I offer this. The Phantom is supposed to be a musical composing genius, not a singing talent. Have you ever heard Marvin Hamlish or Burt Bacharach sing? They can't carry a note between them, and yet they write great music. I think Gerard's voice was very suited to the role. You could hear his rage and passion and sadness, and that's how it should be. Emmy Rossum is an incredible find. She truly has the voice of an angel. Minnie Driver was delightfully over the top. I loved the way the movie moved between the ""real time"" of the story (in black and white) and the colorful memory. I can't wait to see it again.",The Phantom of the Opera
907,Huliagulia82,Phantom,8,26 December 2004,"Regarding the Phantom: I thought this movie was well done. I think that comparing it to a theatrical stage production is totally unfair. Its impossible to create the atmosphere of actually being there with live actors within a movie theater. The part of Christine I thought was played rather well, although at times it seemed as though she was just ""quacking"" the words rather than actually feeling them (although there were moments of greatness). The costumes and make up were disappointing to say the least, especially with the Phantom. At times you could tell his makeup was not on under the mask. I was not a huge fan of the future scenes, nor of the sword fight really. Also, the rooftop scene was lacking. But, despite all of the comments, the Phantom movie was very good. It had most of the charm of the play. I thought that the part of Raoul was played well, despite the voice difference from the play. They were more successful turning the phantom into a movie then other theatrical productions. If you liked the play, or books or anything else then go see it. The theater is well done, very beautiful sets. The direction is good, and the cinematography is also impressive. Nice symbolism that wasn't in the play.",The Phantom of the Opera
908,billconner2002,The most romantic movie ever!,10,3 January 2005,"I have seen Phantom 3 times this week, and no I am not one of THOSE kind of fans. The movie moved me like no movie ever has, when I left the theater I felt I could hardly breath, it was a complete movie experience. I had to go back again, the visuals and music would not leave my head. I have been a Phantom live show fan for years, and had positive expectations for the movie, but it surpassed all my hopes 10 fold. The cast was amazing, especially Gerard Butler, he made up for vocals with an amazing performance of emotion. Phantom is by far the most romantic movie that has ever been filmed, and I think with rapid fire word of mouth women will RUN to be transported to a time of beauty and love.",The Phantom of the Opera

Having seen the stage production with Dave Willets and John Owen Jones a total of five times I can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised with Gerard Butler as the Phantom (would he make a good Bond?)he carries off the part excellently and Emmy(Christine) is a sensation from start to finish. All the supporting cast are great and Patrick Wilson as Raoul seems a good find (The Alamo). Mr Schumachers direction is very close to the stage production which I found appealing I was hoping they would keep as close to the original stage production as possible, the only problem I have now is do I go back to London or to my local theatre for a fantastic nights entertainment, highly recommend to people who haven't seen the stage prod. as well a very powerful film.",The Phantom of the Opera

911,acricat,An amazing feast for any Phantom fan!,10,28 December 2004,"I have had such a love of Phantom for the last 15 years - from the books to the opera to the series - that hearing the negative comments about the movie made me a little concerned. Like all movies there are a few bits which could have been made stronger, but I must say I am in LOVE with this movie. It is so beautiful, and evokes such emotions that I can not applaud this movie more. The casting I must say was brilliant. The innocent love between Raoul and Christine came across so beautifully and was such a stark comparison between the love of the Phantom and Christine - a passionate sexual affair - strong and dangerous. The leads were remarkable. The singing was gorgeous, and quite different to what we have heard in the past. Emmy has such a sweet innocence about her that she evokes a much more sensitive and sweet Christine, both in her acting and singing. Patrick Wilson as Raoul made a much more dashing and likable Raoul compared to those we have seen before. Gerard as the phantom - although not having the strength of voice as past phantoms (eg Michael Crawford, Anthony Warlow), had a more guttural raw phantom that was a stark contrast to those other characters around him and only added to the phantoms danger and allure. My only complaint is he was way too good looking - but I won't complain too much here! He definitely played the part in a way that you could understand Christine's utter devotion and fascination with her angel of music. My utmost congratulations Mr. Butler on a fantastic take on a well loved character. Those expecting the stage show will be disappointed, go into the movie to enjoy it - for what it is - a movie with a new interpretation on an old story, and you will come out of it appreciating the absolute beauty of this movie. Those who loves the book can play pick the homages to the novel - a very nice touch!",The Phantom of the Opera
912,sweet-tangerine,Absolutely beautiful masterpiece,10,28 December 2004,"Before I knew there was even going to be a film adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, I was hooked on the ABSOLUTELY breathtaking and exquisite music I'd ever heard!!! When my wonderful hubby and I saw the trailer for Phantom back in Sep. I could hardly stand the wait!!!! We went to the Carmike on Christmas to see this film, but due to incorrect time in the newspaper and on the website, we were late, so saw Aviator instead, which was excellent, but we finally were able to see Phantom this evening and it was TOTALLY AWESOME, WONDERFUL AND EXQUISITE!!!!! IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT AND MORE!!! Gerard Butler, Emmy Russom, Mr. Wilson and Minnie Driver are wonderful!!!! The music sends goosebumps all over me, the costumes, sets and black and white imagery is breathtaking!!!! I see Golden Globe wins and many Oscars for this beautifully exquisite masterpiece. My 22 year old daughter, who took voice for 6 years and was in 3 opera productions in her voice teacher's opera company, will absolutely LOVE this film!!!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
913,Kassi_Nova,Amazing! I am forever captivated!,10,29 December 2004,"I have been in anticipation of this film since the trailer first hit the apple site. I have enjoyed many of Joel Schumacher's films in the past and this was no exception.I have seen the musical live (performed by Rebecca Caine and Colm Wilkinson) and this was just as amazing. Emmy Rossum was an indelible Christine Daae in this movie, producing a performance never more sincere than any other woman who has played her since Sarah Brightman christened the role in 1986. Her voice is unforgettable, and her talent remarkable.Gerard Butler delivered his performance of The Opera Ghost (aka The Phantom... Erik) in a more human light than it has ever been seen. His singing was not the best I've heard in this role (again no other performer has been able to match Michael Crawford's in this role) however he has proved his massive talent in doing all of the singing himself, and very, very well. His voice was very raw, but also very endearing. He gave a very believable, gut wrenching performance.Minnie Driver was hilarious as La Carlotta, though it disappoints (but does not surprise) me that she was unable to attempt singing her parts. She did, however, record a beautiful song for the credits.Joel allowed too many Dutch shots, which almost took over the film, but the cinematography, costuming, music and set design were Academy Award level.This was one of the absolute BEST times I have had in a movie theater in a very long time. As a die hard fan of the stage production, and as someone who has read the novel by Gaston LeRoux, seen the many other movies made based on this story, this one blew me away. My heart will never be the same. This film has captivated me, and will continue to captivate me every time I see it.I cried like a baby. Simply one of the most amazing films I've ever known. I'd venture to make it my favorite.",The Phantom of the Opera
914,stefan-locher,Are there 11 points to give?,10,29 December 2004,"First, I must admit that I have not seen ""Phantom"" on stage, before I went to see the movie. Of course, I knew the music and the story behind it, but that's all. But know, I'm completely on fire, mostly, as a lot of the male audience might say, because of the superb performance of the - perhaps - most beautiful and talented actress I've ever seen. Emmy Rossum is ""Christine"". Her performance has set the level for all actresses that will play this role in future. From this moment on, when you think of ""Christine"", in your mind you will see and hear Emmy. The rest of the ""Phantom""-cast and the entire crew have also done a perfect job, so it is the best chance for everybody who has not seen the musical on stage, to become a fan for a lifetime. The music sounds perfect, you'll never forget it. The story is well known, but it goes deep to your heart. The action on the screen is perfect for cinema and the sound of the music and the singing deals perfectly with the surround sound system offered in a modern movie theater. Also those who have already seen it on stage will love it, because it opens a new dimension for the performance of the stuff. So from now on, we desperately wait for the release of the DVD, but meanwhile we can go to our local cinema a lot of times.",The Phantom of the Opera
915,DrmAngel7,Bad Bad Bad Bad Movie...,3,29 December 2004,"This movie.. was a waste of my time.. when the actors were actually acting.. some of them were decent. It seems that Andrew Lloyd Webber was attempting to combine the elements of his original hit production on the stage with elements of the original novel written by Gaston Leroux. I've never seen Phantom on stage or off, I've only listened to the original cast CDs of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Butler is no Michael Crawford and Emmy Rossum can sing, but she's no Sarah Brightman. The only acting I enjoyed the tiniest bit was by Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, and Ellison who played Meg Giry. The main cast however appeared to me to be a bunch of little children dressing up in mommy and daddy's clothes and trying to be taken seriously. The effect was over-dramatic and pathetic. The attempt to make all the characters younger and hipper and adding in an element of rock and sex to draw a younger audience... Terrible. And unnecessary...I heard the original score when I was only 10 years old and loved it.. I didn't need rock chords and sexy motions to appreciate how wonderful it was. I enjoyed the film Moulin Rouge better, and if you ask anyone I know.. they'll tell you that I hate Moulin Rouge.. I think this movie is lucky to get a 4.. I'd give it a 3 out of 10.. 3 1/2 at the most... If you have no previous experience at all with The Phantom of the Opera in book or Broadway form then I'm sure you'll love it.. but for anyone who has had experience... well.. I saw both the young and old walking out of the theater.. and I didn't blame them.. I only stayed because I was there with a friend and we came in her car.",The Phantom of the Opera
916,Lilredrover99,Enchanting Fantasy that makes you wish it was real..,9,28 February 2005,This movie was amazing! I love the play and I have about everything about the Phantom of the opera.When this movie first came out i seriously ran to the movies to see it dragging my friends along. At the end i started to bawl. It was just so good! Emmy Rossum was a good Christine. She hit a couple off pitch notes though out the songs but she was a great actress and wore the beautiful costumes amazingly. Patrick Wilson was an amazing Raoul. He sounds almost exactly like the one from the Broadway play. Minne Driver made a amusing Caralotta. And the main star of the movie in my opinion. Gerard Butler was amazing. This was the first time he really ever sang and he did wonderful. The scenes were breathe taking. They should make more movies like this. The movie is exactly like the play but some of the scenes are different which kind of spices it up. The music is amazing it's like listening to a little bit heaven. But i will tell you if you go with a stubborn mind and at the beginning thinks it's going to stink. Then you will not enjoy it but if you go with a free open mind. You then will fall in love with the Phantom and at the end have tears in your eyes and wishing it would never end..,The Phantom of the Opera
917,OpiateOfTheMasses,A total disappointment,2,30 December 2004,"For the first time ever I was sorely tempted to walk out half way through a film (but due to the company I was with I didn't). While the sets and costumes were impressive and the acting fine, the music (and this has to be the main reason to see the film) was tedious. They constantly re-use the same score just changing the lyrics, and having paid to go see this film after all the hype about the stage version I was expecting lots of good music to paper over the thin plot, but was subjected to same three tunes over and over again.Whilst my male friend I was with also shared these views, I should point out (to be fair) that my female friend really enjoyed it, so it could be one of those male/female things...",The Phantom of the Opera
918,alma_victoria_sierra,Completely Awesome!,10,30 December 2004,"It's been about 4 days since I've seen The Phantom of the Opera, and everyday I'm asking my friends if they want to go see it with me again. I'm buying the soundtrack, but until then, I'm going online and singing the songs in my head. I can understand why some of the critics wouldn't enjoy it as much as the fellow person that lives for theatre, but I don't under stand why they give it such low ratings! I think they did a fantastic casting job, the costumes and make up were great, and the singing was AMAZING! It deserves at least 1 academy award. If I had to complain about the movie, it would be that there is't enough dancing, but I think it was a perfect 10 just the way it was.",The Phantom of the Opera
919,abby621,Brava Brava Bravissima,9,2 January 2005,"I have now seen this movie three times. It's not a perfect movie, but it certainly entertains more than other movies I have seen recently (Meet the Fockers, The Life Aquatic). And it's pointless to look for perfection in movies. Andrew Lloyd Webber's amazing music never ceases to give me goosebumps. And the cast certainly does it justice.In my opinion, Butler steals the show. He is an absolutely astounding Phantom. He manages to portray emotions so strong I was brought to tears two of the three times I saw the film. But he still keeps the mystery and horror of the Phantom. While many critics have bashed his voice, I loved it. It had the rock-y edge needed in the character, but was still clear and very nice. Butler's native accent came through a bit more when he was singing, but that didn't bother me too much. The one issue I had with his character is that Gerry is a very good looking man. And he was very VERY good looking, even without the mask. I found myself thinking that if he had gone up into Paris, kept the mask on if he must, and sang his music, he would have had everyone (especially the females) wrapped around his finger... But that was a very small issue I had with the film. And I'm not complaining about getting to look at a very good looking man, with a great voice, and a wonderful portrayal of a character for two and a half hours.Emmy Rossum stayed very true to the character of Christine. She's a very beautiful girl and her voice is quite lovely. I had a few issues with her acting- the fact that her mouth kept on hanging open... I think that was supposed to make the viewer think she's naive or innocent.. That probably leaned more to a directing error than an acting problem on Emmy's part. I personally liked her voice a lot when she was singing Phantom of the Opera with Butler, as she had a bit more of an edge in her voice. I think it's very cool that she's an opera trained singer... Very few opera singers have successfully crossed over into film. And Ms. Rossum is doing just that quite well.Patrick Wilson was an excellent Raoul. He made everything that he could of the drab character. He actually made me like Raoul. I'm still a Phantom girl of course, but Wilson was great. His voice was clear as glass and I was very happy with the contrast between he and the Phantom. They are polar opposites in every way except for their affections.Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison played the Giry women flawlessly. Minnie Driver also plays La Carlotta, the Italian prima donna of the opera house. She provides the much needed humor in this rather dramatic tale. Her song at the end, Learn to be Lonely is absolutely haunting. It's beautifully sung and the lyrics are perfect. In my opinion, it should be the front runner for best song at the Golden Globes.A large amount of the critics have commented that bad directing ruined Phantom. Personally, I thought this movie was very well directed and the cinematography was breathtaking.I recommend this movie to almost everyone. Those who cry easily should be wary. I took my mother to see this, and I have never seen her cry that hard before. I figure that's a good thing though- it takes a good movie to make someone react this strongly. Phantom is up there with my favorite films of all time. 9/10 stars",The Phantom of the Opera
920,sindarinelfmaiden,Victorian era eye candy! Great Music! Sweeeeet movie sets!,10,1 January 2005,"This movie went way beyond my expectations. Besides just having beautiful costumes, sets and actors/actresses this movie had an interesting plot. It was kind of like ""Evita"" or ""Tommy"" meets that ""Sweeney Todd"" musical. It seemed a lot like Moulin Rouge, but a lot easier to follow. Never having seen the stage production, I was blissfully unaware of any changes. If you can't get enough of old fashioned theater movies, this one's for you. The singers voices gave me goose bumps, and the phantom actually scared me a little. The sets had a Victorian Gothic feel. I live near Chicago and the theater in the movie was eerily reminiscent of some of our beautiful local Chicago Victorian architecture. There were little surprises and special effects that gave me a start. The female lead really tugs at your heart strings. I would buy the soundtrack and I would go see this movie again and again. It was surprisingly awesome! It should have had the BIG screen in our local theater.",The Phantom of the Opera
921,Quailman53,The Phantom of the Opera: masterpiece.,10,2 January 2005,"I was thoroughly impresses with The Phantom of the Opera. I have seen it four times and plan to see it more. I'm a little upset that everyone is giving Gerard Butler so much grief. The man did a great job there were times where he may not have had the perfect range but he brought a new dimension to the character. Butler had a ""phantomy"" sound he sounded scarier and looked great. The chemistry between Butler and Rossum was uncanny. every time the phantom seduced Christine i was on the edge of my seat. Emmy Rossum put on the greatest performance i have ever seen and sang like an angel. Patrick Wilson was also very good. he and Emmy's chemistry was again off the charts, all i ask of you was the best id ever seen it performed. great show i advise everyone to see it and i plan on it a few more times.",The Phantom of the Opera
922,jordyblumberg,Simply OUTSTANDING!!!,10,2 January 2005,"Two thumbs up for ""The Phantom of the Opera""! What an absolutely beautiful movie! The singing was fantastic and by no means should it be receiving unfavorable reviews. The way both Joel Schumacher and ALW depicted the story was great and it gave much more background as to the history of the Phantom. That is, it was much easier to follow the story line in the movie versus the Broadway show. Minnie Driver is absolutely hilarious in the role of the diva Carlotta and Gerard Butler made everyone fall in love with the Phantom. I have seen the Broadway show twice and it was the first time I ever felt ""warmed"" by the role of the Phantom. In summary, this movie is a MUST SEE and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys good music and a beautiful love story.",The Phantom of the Opera
923,samanthapantha,phantom of the opera,9,7 January 2005,This movie was fantastic! I've read reviews that Gerard Butler didn't have a strong enough voice to be the phantom but I strongly disagree! Emmy Rossum also shone. She has one of the best voices I have ever heard- especially for someone so young. The set was wonderful as were the costumes. The story was very much like the show and had the same goose-bump-giving music. In a few parts it did get a bit long but otherwise it was an excellent film! It was a little bit frightening in some parts but that made it more interesting. I loved the show and although you don't get the same buzz out of seeing a movie as you do seeing a live performance it is still worth checking out! :),The Phantom of the Opera
924,tinkerbellem,Breathtaking...Literally!!!,10,1 May 2005,"I must admit that whenever someone would talk to me about 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' i would think how boring! I used to think like this for years until i saw the trailer for the film, i was taken away at just how amazing it looked and just knew that id have to see it! Anyway the film came out at the cinema and my mom and i went to see it. From the moment it started i found myself becoming involved with the story. I soon jumped as the scene came on where the opera went back in time, the music literally blew me away. I found that the film had everything i wanted love, comedy, drama and fantastic music. My mom and I were in tears by the end of it- we found it so emotional, but we weren't the only people who found it very touching. I thought the film was amazing!!! I bought the soundtrack straight away and tomorrow May 2nd 2005 i shall buy it on DVD!!! I'm so excited...i can't wait to be taken back into the film again- emotionally. I would recommend this film to anyone...any age!!! This film is 5*!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
925,justkeepswimming23,Absolutely Stunning!,10,8 January 2005,"This movie is so incredibly awesome. If you loved the Broadway musical, you will absolutely love the movie. It is so captivatingly beautiful that you won't be able to help but be touched by it. The actors are awesome and the cinematography is so beautiful! The actors do a superb job of singing in it, especially Christine. For all Michael Crawford fans, you might be disappointed in the Phantom's voice, but it is still wonderful. You just have to realize that he isn't Michael and appreciate him for the voice he does have, which is not at all lacking. In fact, Gerard Butler does an excellent job at the Phantom. So excellent, in fact, that he made me cry. I've seen it twice now in theaters and I've cried both times at the same part. I won't tell you what part, but it is at the end of the movie. The whole movie is touching and beautiful and you will feel emotionally moved by it. Although the movie is not like the book (neither is the play for that matter), it is still an excellent kick-off of Gaston Leroux's book. I applaud it and give it two thumbs up. If I had more thumbs, I'd hold those up as well. ""Bravo. Bravo. Bravisimo."" You should definitely see it.",The Phantom of the Opera

With vivid memory of how fascinated I was when I saw the stage production in London some eight years ago, I had worried that I might be disappointed by the movie. It turned out that I enjoyed it from beginning to end.The Phantom was so very, very sexy. Christine was lovely and Raoul charming. The sets and costumes were gorgeous and the music stunningly beautiful. The story has been conveyed so romantically.

The music fills my mind and I have ordered the sound track. I cannot stop thinking about this movie! I am telling all my friends and family to see it. Usually when you see a movie a second time, you are not as enthusiastic about it, but I was moved even more after the second viewing. After learning the story the first time, I could concentrate on the finer details. And there are so many of those! This picture is a throw-back to the days when movies didn't just entertain you.

Never mind if you don't but I reckon its more for people who like musicals well me and my mates r all fans of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musicals. I'd just like to add that Gerard Butler the sweetest Phantom ever. I'd rate it 10/10. Even though the whole thing is singing we really got in to it and was really sad at the end we cried a bit. But i'm that sort of person All of you lot who don't like it i don't resent you. We all have different taste.

929,angustud,Pretty Awful,3,23 January 2005,"I wonder if I saw a different movie to the one many people here saw. The movie Phanton of the Opera had a man in the lead role who could not only NOT sing (he sings flat for the entire film), he's not much of an actor either. A dull, lifeless portrayal of the central character was only one of the problems. Joel Schumacher should never be allowed near a musical again. His direction is so dull and so uninspired, he's never too sure where the aciton should be, so as an audience member you become confused and a little lost at times - if the director was not too sure what to focus on, you as a viewer wont be either. Please also never allow Simon Callow near a film again. This awful ham of an actor does nothing but overact and chew the scenery. He is so unpleasant to watch. Talking of unpeasant, have you ever seen a movie which is so darkly lit that in some scenes, you have trouble working out which characters are on the screen? See this movie and wonder if they were trying to save money from what they must have over spent on the sets and so they cut down on the lighting. This movie is a sad, bad mess. I think only Minnie Driver had any clue how bad it was going to turn out. She just camps it up and sends the whole thing over the top from the moment she enters the scene. Thank God for Minnie - she does her best, but even her most valiant effort can not save this terrible movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
930,lrjam2,When I Viewed this movie I was blown away,10,15 February 2005,"I had seen the Broadway play twice and loved it, but not with the original cast.I owned the original cast CD. I was really looking forward to the movie because I love the music so much, and I grew up watching movie musicals and loving them. What I didn't expect was to be completely blown away by this movie (I had read the reviews, and was disappointed, but decided to see it anyway). From the time that the Phantoms music blasts as the chandelier rises, and the dust swirls away, restoring the opera house to it's original glory, I knew that this film was going to take us to another world in the next 2 1/2 hours, and was I right! The sets, the costumes, the camera work, the acting were all superb. The singing and music soars. The director frames these scenes with the music and gives you an unbelievably wondrous experience of sight and sound. You can tell that the director was an artist, the absolute beauty of the experience takes your breathe away..(I mean this literally, there were times when I gasped it was so unbelievably beautiful). Emmy Rossum, as Christine was superb. Her voice is angelic, and her acting was perfect. Patrick Wilson as Roaul was everything the hero should be, gallant, handsome and he has a great voice. Now I come to the most controversial part of this movie...the choice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His Phantom is gorgeous with the mask on. He has wonderful eyes that burn with love, hate, seduction, anger and grief. His voice: a gritty, rough, and at times surprising touching in it's high range. I loved it! It was perfect for this Phantom. The raw emotion that he conveys tears at the heart. You identify with the man, his horrific beginnings, his loneliness, despair,and his anger. His Music of the Night puts you under his spell right along with Christine. His Point of No Return will make you twitch in your seat. The thrilling moment when he is unmasked, the way he looks at Christine, and then cuts down the Chandelier and opens the trap door to escape with her. The whole last scene down in his lair. ANd when he looks up at Christine, with the tears streaming down his face when he knows that she IS leaving is heart breaking. He's a great actor. They all are. What an experience. I am sorry for anyone who doesn't get to see it on the big screen. That's definitely where it should be seen. It will touch you in places that have never been reached in film. What a feast for the soul!",The Phantom of the Opera
931,drosner,Her heart belonged to Raoul but her soul belonged to the phantom,4,16 January 2005,"From the previews you would think this was done extremely well. Unfortunately, it was just the opposite and many things could have been done better and what did that monkey have to do with Raoul? I thought it belonged to the Phantom so why did he purchase it at the end ?I saw the movie with my daughter who is a voice major and she felt that Christina needed a lot more practice but her acting was superb. I was a little disappointed and would have enjoyed seeing more dancing at the masked ball but the best action scene was when the phantom cut the chandelier. That was worth while seeing on a big screen. Other then that I was a little disappointed with this movie. They show the best advertisement scenes on TV and then when you see the movie it's like what happened???",The Phantom of the Opera

It was so incredible and marvelous and Emmy Rossum was unbelievable, I loved her voice and opera talent! Another favorite of mine in the Movie was of course Gerard Butler! Wow! I mean if he make me speechless its worth something! I loved his raspy voice and his acting and the way this a lot different from the other movies he has recently made. I loved the special effects on his face when she takes the mask off, but with the mask on he is a BABE!! My favorite part in the movie was when Gerard brought Emmy down to the bottom of the opera house and was singing Songs of the night I think it was, I was getting numerous amounts of goosebumps, if you didn't like this movie then either you don't appreciate art or are blind when it comes towards it!! I loved it!",The Phantom of the Opera
933,jdavis2-4,Horrid!,1,17 January 2005,"I have seen both this movie and the Broadway production. As an adaptation, it fails miserably on all counts. First of all, none of the performers have operatic voices, give Emmy R. (Christine Daae). The rest (the Phantom especially) sound like ""popera"" (pop opera) wannabes. Also, much of the spoken text was actually meant to be sung (as everything in an opera is), therefore the textural interludes in the music are not only inappropriate, but unnecessary and awkward. Many of the lyrics to many of the songs where changed for no apparent reason, especially ""Think of Me."" Also, consider the Phantom, who in the movie version is made out to be more of a sex toy and not the tortured soul of Gaston Leroux original novel. On the other hand, Joel Schumacher does create quite a spectacle with his lavish sets and breath taking scenery. ""Phantom"" is beautifully shot, but when it comes down to it, too much time was spent making a spectacle of Phantom and not enough was spent developing the story.",The Phantom of the Opera

I've seen better singing than Christine's coming from bad American Idol contestants..........not to mention she has the same expression on her face the whole movie...........

It was an extremely well made movie. It is definitely one that I will want to buy. I am a drama nerd, but I would definitely tell anybody to go see it.

936,wicked_88,Awesome movie,10,3 August 2005,"I remember seeing a preview for this movie a long time ago. It wasn't very long but it looked really cool. I finally got to see the movie, in Jan. 2005, but I didn't realize it was a musical. And I absolutely hated musicals! But as soon as they took the sheet off the chandelier and the Overture started I was hooked.1) Songs POTO has to be Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best. These songs are amazing and will get stuck in your head. The orchestral music is amazing as well as the singing. The lyrics are different from the stage version, but I like these better. There are also 2 new songs written specifically for the movie: Journey to the Cemetery and The Fairground. There is also a swordfight that was not in the play and a new song called Learn to Be Lonely by Minnie Driver at the end of the movie.2) Cast In my opinion, the casting was perfect. Fanatics of the stage-version probably won't agree with me on that, but, oh well. I'm glad that all the actors, except Minnie Driver, did their own singing I'll start with Emmy Rossum as Christine. She has the most amazing voice. I've heard Sarah Brightman sing POTO, and I think that Emmy's voice is much better. She's also perfect, acting wise, for the innocent, naive, and kinda ignorant role of Christine. For most of the movie she has a vacant ""goldfish"" look on her face that you associate with an innocent, naive, kinda ignorant person.Next, Raoul. I have mixed feelings about Patrick Wilson. He's a great singer and probably the best ""Raoul"" I've heard. And the first few times I saw the movie I felt bad for him when he was all tied up in the Phantom's lair. Now that I've watched it about 100 times, Raoul just seems funnier and funnier. The girly hair, the funny facial expressions and the whole ""Genius has turned to madness"" line make me laugh every time I watch the movie.The Phantom- Gerard Butler is my favorite phantom. His voice is perfect for this version of the phantom, who's supposed to be seductive and sexy. The fact that he looks like an Orlando Bloom sundae smothered in Johnny Depp sauce doesn't hurt either. LOL. His performance makes me feel sorry for the phantom (I cried when he broke the mirrors),and it also made facial deformities and sociopathic behavior sexy. lol Carlotta- My favorite character. She's absolutely hilarious. And a bigger diva than J. Lo. Even though she's self-centered and has a horrible voice(which for some reason I'm starting to like)you can't help but like her.",The Phantom of the Opera
937,stargoddessjoanna,The Phantom of the Opera,10,26 January 2005,"This movie is excellent! The director was wonderful and truly captured the essence of Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece. The sets are extravagant, the costumes exquisite, and the acting exemplary. I have personally seen the movie twice and the actual performance live once before and I assure you that the transition from stage to screen is seamless. There are only a few inconsistencies that only a well versed Phantom of The Opera fan would notice. I will admit though, the changes that I noticed affected the movie in a more positive way and I actually prefer the screen version to the stage. Emmy Rossum's opera experience shines through in what I believe to be a break out performance as she portrays Christine. The Phantom, played by Gerard Butler, is phenomenal and truly displays the depth of character and emotion of the Phantom. I highly recommend this film to anyone, but I do warn you, be prepared to be overcome with emotion at the very end.",The Phantom of the Opera
938,Smilygrl2006,One of the Best Movies...,10,9 December 2005,"At first when I Heard that they were coming out with this movie, I have to admit I was very skeptical. But then, while channel surfing through channels, saw this special about it on HBO... my mouth dropped, and I was speechless... from then on, every time that special was on, I was in front of the TV, watching it, memorizing the snippets of music they would allow me to hear... and when it came out... Oh My God... I saw it four times in one weekend, and I cried my eyes out each time. Now I own it on DVD, and I have to say... I absolutely love it. One of the best movies I've ever seen , and I've seen quite a few... I think it should have been nominated for more Awards, but hey I'm glad it still won some... I also fell in love with Gerard Butler. he was beautiful in this movie... if you've never seen this movie, stop what you're doing, and go and rent it right now!!!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
939,matthew-bee,"From book to stage was good, but stage to screen is amazing.",10,28 January 2005,"I'm yet to see the full stage show at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, but I have seen snippets having helped in an external production of the show in co-operation with the Really Useful Theatre Company. I can honestly say that I cannot contain my excitement to go and see it in London, and the film has just made this even more of a MUST. The film does the story, and more importantly the score ( a masterpiece in my opinion) every justice. I have read many reviews from US critics, and their profound negativity is a mystery to me. I was glued to the screen from the flicker of the candle to the credits.Having read the background in the Special Edition soundtrack CD, I realise that the cast were scrutinised for their singing at audition, but even so, I think the performances were superb. I am in partial accordance with the previous reviewer, in that Gerard Butler did show some signs of weakness in the stretching of his voice, but I think he makes up for it with his poise and stance in playing the Phantom. He brought emotion to the part. You can feel his inner pain.The orchestration and sections of new music written by Andrew Lloyd Webber are fabulous, both technically and holistically. (May think it is sad, but since studying A level music, I cant help but analyse music technically!) The opening scene with the auction gives the film an eerie stance from the beginning, and there is NOT ONE person who will not know what they are watching when the chandelier rises and the fateful organ bellows its music! Brilliant musically, brilliant theatrically. A world famous masterpiece from stage, long awaitedly and nigh on perfectly juxtaposed onto screen. What more can I say 10/10 (I'd give it more if I could!)",The Phantom of the Opera
940,shermaj,Emmy Rossum - definitely the star!,6,31 January 2005,"I think most Phantom fans will enjoy this movie as much as I did. I couldn't give it a higher mark, due in part to an interview I read from the actor playing Phantom, complaining about what he had to go through in makeup for the role. If only he had used that time in the makeup chair for voice training. I believe Emmy Rossum's vocals overpowered the Phantom by far.This movie also felt the need to keep hitting us over the head with back story. While some of it was helpful, the audience never benefits from being ""played down to"". Some of the back story, I felt, was overkill. How many times did we need to see Raoul & Giry staring back at each other in old age flashes?? The larger orchestrations in this soundtrack are beautiful. Again, Emmy Rossum shines! The movie could've used a larger budget and when, in the original phantom, does the opera house start on fire? Aren't they standing in it when the film starts before the flashbacks? I realize they were limited by budget restraints. They had one chandelier to crash (notice it was done in the end, not before the second act) and one opera house to burn... Just a question.While I am not in love with this Phantom, I am a Lloyd Weber fan and found the music (most of it) enjoyable. This Phantom did not seduce me, Raoul was the easy winner here!",The Phantom of the Opera

The only movie till now that made me fell chills on my back! the voices are powerful the songs have feeling! the sets have a beautiful mixture between the poverty behind the sets and the richness in front. i'm not a opera lover but this movie made me see that there are a lot of hidden treasures in music. i ca only compare this movie to Chicago ( the last musical i saw) and in spite of enjoying it very much the Phantom takes my preference by far. I'm sorry i never saw the live musical, but i believe the movie has all the things that made the musical so famous.",The Phantom of the Opera
942,short_n_sweet911,"If I were Andrew Lloyd Webber, I would Burn this Movie and Pee on its Ashes.",1,11 February 2006,"While the Phantom of the Opera is probably one of the most amazing and inspiring theater productions ever, it is not exactly cinematic perfection. The music is beautiful, the theme quite noble, and even the individual performances of this movie were wonderful. HOWEVER, adapting a musical into a screenplay does not simply require all of the above and a good director. Writing for the screen is almost ENTIRELY different from writing for theater. The movie is sluggish and lacks cohesiveness in the beginning. Pacing for this movie is more than bad, it's awful. We go from a 10 minute boring intro to a series of events that's more like ""wham-bam-thank-you-m'am"" intercourse than a smooth storyline. There's so many things wrong with this movie that I can't even begin to write them all. Bottom line: If I were Andrew Lloyd Webber, I would burn this movie and urinate on its ashes.",The Phantom of the Opera
943,mnrubino,This is an awesome movie!,10,19 February 2005,"Anyone who hasn't seen this movie definitely should! The cast was really good, although Patrick Wilson (Raoul de Chagny) and Emmy Rossum (Christine Daae) got a bit boring in their roles as the ""goody-two-shoes."" Gerard Butler (the Phantom) really held the movie together well. What he lacked in vocal talent (not very much), he made up for in acting. (The girls will love Gerry!) Partick Wilson's and Emmy Rossum's voices were very nice, if a bit unemotional. Minnie Driver was very good in her role as the demanding Italian diva. The minor characters, such as Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison), Andre (Simon Callow), and Firmin (Ciarin Hinds) pulled their parts off very nicely. All in all, this movie is not for someone who is looking for an boring, stuffy film. The only objectionable scenes are the Prima Donna song and the Masquerade ball. Just too corny, and I felt like doing a chorus line. So, if you like Gerry Butler, are in the mood for a good romantic/drama movie, or just want to cry at the end of a movie, POTO is for you!

It is so good that i had to see it 6 times in the cinema! The singing was very good too. The stage choreography was excellent. the film is perfect except for some loopholes. Other than that, it is just too good for words to describe. This is definitely an Oscar worthy film! Those of you who have not watched it, don't listen to negative comments, they are not true.

I must say that Gerard Butler is the best Phantom ever, his appearance and voice make a perfect Phantom, he is mysterious in the right way, dangerous but sexy. Now I understand why Christine craves for the Phantom, because before...never you mind. The music and the story always send shivers down my spine. Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson have the voice to do it and, without trying to be rude, they sing better than other actors before them, especially Gerard Butler, because they sing with their hearts, not just with the voice, and that's the point if displaying a story with your voice. I just love the movie. The best scenes for me were the masquerade and Don Juan opera. Just awesome.",The Phantom of the Opera

I loved it so much I even bought the DVD! There's action, romance, and a little bit of comedy. The Phantom was sensational. He was so handsome and had such a good voice that you couldn't help but love him, even if he did terrorize the opera house. Emmy Rossum (Christine Daae) has an incredible voice, one that I will never forget. She will go very far. And Raoul was terrific. I couldn't help but love him!

Fantastic film...great power....except for minnie driver.....,10,3 April 2005,"This was an amazing Movie, I have seen it 14 times and it never seems to get old! The set was great along with the music. This was the ultimate in seduction! Butler did a great job showing a powerful man with a hurt passed who you could both fear and feel bad for. Emmy was always innocent and up until the end I thought Christine was amazing, the end I developed a distaste for Christine. She really does have the look of innocence.Minnie Driver was pathetic, her acting was forced, and her lip singing was terrible, she after times was mouthing one world while ""singing"" something else. The true comedy of the film was that put on by the two owners, they were a riot! I have always found her annoying even when she isn't trying to be, for the life of me I don't know why they cast her she is not worth anything! A movie that I love this much and when she would come on with that terrible accent (I don't know what it was but I have been it Italy and they don't sound like that over there!)and no singing! Well except for the song at the credits that probably anyone could sing, especially with all the special things they do now a days, if they can make it look like Ashlee Simpson can sing then why now Driver? I would give her a 1 out of 10, thankfully the rest of the cast was absolutely amazing! This movie is worth seeing again and again!

950,swimgirl1433,Awesome Movie,10,7 May 2005,I had grown up listening to the Phantom soundtrack and always loved it because the music wasn't like most of the other musicals i had seen. I always wanted to see the play version but never had the chance too. So i was a little disappointed with the singing. The first time my father and I heard Gerard Butler(the Phantom) sing we were a little disappointed because we loved the strongness that Michael Crawford(the actor who played Phantom in the play that was recorded on the soundtrack) had when he sang we were disappointed because Mr. Butler sound kinda like a jazz singer rather than an opera singer. But as the movie progressed i started to warm up to him.I was confused in the beginning when they showed the woman at the auction and through out the whole movie my family and i were trying to figure out who it was because they've seen the play 3 times and know it better than i do. I was also a little confused when they didn't show you what the phantoms face looked like when Christine rips his mask from his face but i later realized they didn't show it so the second time she ripped it from his face it would apply more emphasis on it. I was a little upset that they transferred some of the singing parts to speaking parts but still it was a great movie and all of the changes made the movie amazing. Patrick Wilson(Raoul) did an amazing job in singing and so did Emmy Rossum(Christine).The sets were beautiful and the cinematography was wonderful especially the beginning with the black and white and then turning to color as the chandelier rose.Overall one of the greatest movies yet. Should be up for an Academy Award because it was so awesome.,The Phantom of the Opera
951,nathicastro,Perfect,10,4 April 2005,"Although this movie leave some mysteries behind, anyone who loves musicals or even loves this wonderful story of the most romantic and evil Phantom of all, will love this movie. It certainly deserves an Oscar. It's a shame it did not get one. Every acting person in the movie is a great singer. The songs are all great and original from London cast. The doubts which you might have during the scenes, you can put away in a simple way: Read the original book, from Gaston Leroux and you'll understand absolutely everything. And you'll see that Andrew Loyd Webber wrote the musical in a serious, complete and enchanting way. It's a pity all the details are not shown. In one word?

952,dovi1,"A let down to a true fan of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and an opera singer",5,10 May 2005,"As an life long fan of the Broadway show ""The Phantom of the Opera"" I must say it was a major let down casting horrid singers in all three major roles. I first saw Phantom on Broadway when it opened, when I was in the 4th grade. It was because of the impact of the original cast that I chose to become an opera singer and now sing with the Washington National Opera. Although no one would really ever replace the original London Cast in my ears it would have been nice had the powers that be at least cast singers of remote quality. I would not go as far as to say never view this movie, I would however point out I almost left early because it actually became annoying to listen to.",The Phantom of the Opera
953,rsmorse,For those who can't see the greatest musical of all time,10,12 May 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera has always been my favorite musical...even though I'd never seen it. I had the CD, I had sheet music I learned for the piano, all by the time I was 16. Something about the musical pulls at you. If you have a love of music, the songs in this musical will make you tingle. I was very doubtful about Emma Rossum being able to pull this roll off. I thought I'd watch her with a Phantom who was twice her age and be disgusted, but they manage to pull it off. You must also remember that back in the 1800's it was normal for an older man to take a younger bride.Everyone deserves to see The Phantom Of The Opera. And for those who can't afford to see it in the theater or on Broadway, as I couldn't, this movie is the perfect substitute. Knowing the Andrew Lloyd Webber had his hand in every part of the movie makes you realize that movie is how he wanted it to be.",The Phantom of the Opera

The actors- perfectly cast (particularly the phantom: a young woman's fantasy incarnate). The music- um... obvious. It is so brilliant, it almost blows my mind. The cinematography was fantastic, and it needed to be. The adaptation from Broadway to the silver screen must be a difficult one. The special effects are great. In fact, this movie is phenomenally visually stunning. There was nothing I would change about this movie.It was nice that those who cast this movie did not succumb to the temptation of casting famous faces, as that would have distracted the viewers from the movie itself. Yes, I walked into this movie thinking I would like it (but then, hopefully, that is true with all movies one sees in theaters), especially since I adore music and the previews made it seem like my sort of movie. Still, I was blown away. This movie transcends its categorization as a ""musical,"" since it is a romance and a character drama. This movie contains all the right ingredients- great romance, poignant characters, and a story that easily captures hearts. Add the exquisite vision of the director, good acting (the hilarious over-the-top character of La Carlotta, played by Minnie Driver)and players with natural charisma and sex appeal that allows explosive passion, and place on top the time-defying beauty of its songs, and you find yourself with a hit that will take your breath away every single time you see it.",The Phantom of the Opera

I'm not one for musicals my self but i really enjoyed this movie anyways. Right after i left the theater i went and bought the soundtrack.

The cast is amazing...you'll fall in love with even the Phantom, and you would find yourself understanding his hate, his love, his fears and just why he is how he is and why he does what he does.

The cast is perfect, with Emmy Rossum providing the innocent young girl who is discovering the beauty of things through her tutor, played by the gorgeous Gerard Butler. Butler is so suited for the role of the Phantom it is almost uncanny. He is able to show both the beautiful and the dark side to his character. Because of this I was routing for him, even though he sometimes suffers from a little anger management I still feel that Christine should have been with him instead of Raoul. After all, he does worship her, and what kind of girl would be put off by that?The directing is pretty much flawless and the scenery is stunning.

Never, I mean never, have I been so completely engrossed by a film as with this one. Haven't seen the play but did know some of the storyline. Completely exceeded my expectations. Andrew LLoyd Webber is a true genius. I'm buying the sound track and I haven't bought one of those since the '70's. Negative critics about Butler's voice are either jealous or don't understand the way it is suppose to be sung. MR. Webber hand picked GB knowing he hadn't had formal voice training then had GB trained to sing it the way he wanted it done. I saw new things each and every time I watched the movie(6 or 7 times) that connected smaller details of the story. The interaction between ""Phantom and Christine is sizzling and blood boiling. Brava! I'm hoping for a continuation of the story at some time. I can't believe that He and Christine did not see each other again before her death.

However, after 10 minutes of watching I needed to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't having a nightmare. Did these people actually think they could sing? I'm all pro-'doyourownvocals', but in this case someone should've walked up to them (especially Gerard Butler) and said ""Look guys, we appreciate the effort and realize that it takes a lot of courage to do this, but really, you shouldn't be doing this"". It's off tune most of the time, singing technique is completely missing in almost all actors and, which brings me to the next problem, it doesn't add to the story - it's just a big pain in the ... When you've seen West Side Story, you realize how musicals should be put on screen - I don't know how it's done properly, all I know is that it's hard, as PotO shows. The actors just start singing out of the blue, and as they do it so poorly, it becomes torture to listen to them (and mind you, the film is a full 180 mins) I found myself screaming to the television ""please start talking!"" whenever they began to sing and being very relieved once they stopped. Besides the awful singing and direction, the set dressing is OK and so are the costumes - not much wrong there.

I do agree that when people these days just hear the words they turn off their excitement, but if they actually watch the movie, it will instantly become a favorite.

967,emz_mingo,"Good, but no Michael Crawford",6,6 July 2005,"The screen version of POTO was very well presented. Emmy Rossum put on a great performance as Christine, and in many parts she was, in my opinion, better than Sarah Brightman. Her acting is just as good as her singing, and she could become great. Raoul is one of the hardest characters to portray. In the novel he is a very feminine character, and although they tried, I don't think that the movie or musical did much to bring masculinity to the role. He mostly comes off as a confused, rich boy who cant see the genius that Erik brings to Christine. Patrick Wilson did a fine job. Next we have the Phantom. Well Butler tried, but could simply not compare to Michael Crawford or Hugh Panaro. I think that one of his biggest issues was the fact that the part of O.G. was written for a countertenor(male soprano)/tenor singer, tenor being the lowest they sing. Tenor seems to be the highest that Gerard sings, which causes a lot of the songs to sound somewhat strained...he also has a hard rocker edge to his voice that does not work for the part of Erik, because his voice is described as soft, rich and beautiful, terms that don't usually apply to a hard rocker. All in all the film was great. I loved the special effects at the beginning, and the actors seemed to know their parts pretty well.",The Phantom of the Opera
968,dlynn1230,Amazing,10,11 July 2005,"This movie was amazing. It was one of those movies that you keep thinking about days after you've seen it. I walk around my house singing all the songs.The colors and sets were just enthralling. I've never seen the stage play but i can't wait to now.My favorite character was defiantly the phantom. I know Gerard Butler was critiqued for his performance, but i thought so differently. His performance was filled with passion, and i thought he was the definite star. Although Emmy Rossum was amazing as Christine. I was amazed to hear they all sang for themselves.I defiantly recommend this movie to everyone. 10/10. no doubt.",The Phantom of the Opera
969,estarbuck252,Beautiful!,10,15 July 2005,"I saw this movie five times in the theater and have watched it countless times on DVD. I had no idea it was coming out until it actually hit the theaters, but had been waiting for it for ten years! Of course, I was a little hesitant when I heard that Gerard Butler was playing the Phantom, having no idea who Gerard Butler was, but what he may lack in voice (as opposed to Michael Crawford) he more than makes up for with screen presence. His portrayal of the Phantom was fantastic! Strong, vulnerable, passionate and maybe a little insane! His voice had a great ""rock'n'roll"" quality to it, as well as a passionate, tormented overtone that lent a human quality to the Phantom character. I was a somewhat concerned with how the opening would be filmed, having seen the stage production twice. In the stage production, the ascent of the chandelier was the most thrilling part of the show. But in the film, Joel Schumacher carried it off with just as much excitement. The opening sequence of the film is wondrously shot and worth the price of the ticket in itself, with the black and white sweeping into glorious color. Mr. Schumacher shot it in a way that captured the excitement of the musical score. It is truly thrilling!Minnie Driver is excellent as Carlotta. Her expressions are so animate! And even though the character is somewhat over the top, she pulls it off without a hitch! Emmy Rossum's voice is angelic. It's really wonderful to see actors who can do so much more than act! It reminds me of the old days when actors had to act, sing and dance! And that's what this movie reminded me of! It has a vintage quality to it that makes it a modern-day classic!Long live the Phantom!",The Phantom of the Opera
970,webmunchkyn,An undying ache,9,3 August 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera works, in the movie incarnation anyway, because the Phantom is the soul of unrequited love. Since there are darn few of us on this planet who haven't experienced this, the character is bound to appeal to a whole lotta folks. Butler's earthy rasp is a perfect embodiment of a tortured soul haunting an underground world; an operatic tenor with a finely honed voice would have been completely wrong for the film. The music of the night deserves a powerful voice that strains now and then. Rossum's light soprano has all the fragile-as-glass delicacy that the role of Christine deserves; what an astonishingly fresh performance from this young actress. Patrick Wilson cannot be blamed if the role of Raoul pales in comparison to the Phantom's; it's hard to imagine what character could hold its own against the Angel of Music. He does the best he can: Raoul is no effete and milquetoast aristocrat, but a young buck who drives his horses chariot-style and swings a sword as well as Errol Flynn. And since this is an opera, it really doesn't matter how much of the plot holds together. Opera is all about the music, not the plot, and the lush, romantic music of ""Phantom"" does exactly what it is supposed to do: tell an emotional story of love, loss, and undying ache. Movies are all about the pictures, and ""Phantom"" is about as lush a production as anything I've seen on screen since ""Moulin Rouge"". The art direction manages to convey the frenetic, drunken menage of backstage life without descending into visual chaos. A feast for the eyes from start to finish, a story bound to touch anyone who survived high school crushes, and music that you can't get out of your head--could mortals ask for more? Bravo, bravissimo.",The Phantom of the Opera
971,terracenl,Fantastic! I will purchase a copy for myself!,10,6 August 2005,"Just finished watching the DVD version of the movie. It was absolutely fantastic and I want my own copy to watch again. I was curious to see Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul, as he is the son of one of our local news anchors in Tampa, John Wilson. He was great and really nice to look at. I liked his voice better than the Phantom, played by Gerard Butler, but all 3 leading voices were super. I have heard the music from the stage production over the years, but never seen it on stage. The music was the best element in the film, but artistically and cinematographically great too. It was a feast for the eyes, ears and heart. The soundtrack now rivals ""The Sound of Music"" for 1st place in my favorites list.",The Phantom of the Opera
972,ecoyner,My main problem with this movie,7,21 February 2006,"is that the Phantom, even with the insanity and severe deformity is like 10 times hotter than Raoul. And Rauol and Christine seemed poorly cast. Oh, and the flashback, what is the point in that?? You know from the start that Raoul lives to an old age, so you're not the least bit worried when he's fighting the Phantom throughout 1/2 the movie. I swear, sometimes they just don't seem to have thought of the most simple stuff!! In addtion to Gerard Butler, Minnie Driver and some of the supporting cast and great. Miranda Richardson seems wasted in her role (compared with other parts she's played in the past), but I guess there's not a lot out there for women her age.But, it's still worth seeing if you enjoy ALW and musicals. I'm sure the stage version is better, but if you can't see it, this is the next best thing. It is a big spectacular musical with some of the best songs ever, so if you enjoy musicals/romance there's no way to no see this.",The Phantom of the Opera
973,filene72,"Heady mixture of Love, passion, obsession and despair wrapped in a sumptuous package",10,23 September 2005,"Gerard Butler as the Phantom was not as grotesque as the original book would have us believe. Yet I think we all know someone who is not only not unattractive but actually beautiful who is convinced of their ugliness. Often our sense of self worth or attractiveness is linked to the love and acceptance we received as infants and children and I believe that many people who felt unloved as children (whether this was justified or not) do have this feeling of worthlessness in spite of whatever gifts of beauty, talent or intelligence they may have. It was Gerard Butler's portrayal of a passionate need to love and be loved that was the driving force of the film. I think Andrew Loyd Weber as a reclusive artist may have felt himself excluded from the ordinary give and take of the ""real"" world and this story and music I feel is really his lament and Mr. Butler cries out this lament superbly.",The Phantom of the Opera
974,LadyMuse,I loved it,10,14 August 2005,"This has got to be the best version of The Phantom of the Opera.I thought Butler did an amazing job as Phantom. Rossum made a beautiful and perfect Christine. Wilson did a good Raoul.The lighting and background is stunning. The little details that people barely notice in movies stand out in this movie. It's very colorful and beautiful. The costumes caught my eye the most. They look so perfect. Also, the costumes have that sexy suspense feeling when I look at them.The singing was amazing. Rossum had a nice soprano voice. Butler's voice was very attractive. It was deep and very sexy. Wilson's voice was perfect for his character. When he sang, I really felt like I knew who Raoul was.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I recommend it to anyone who loves romantic, sexy, Gothic, suspenseful type movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
975,duncanwrjames,near perfect!,9,18 August 2005,"I along with others on this site have seen the stage show, so perhaps am slightly influenced by it to the detriment of the movie version. having said that, this film is as near to perfect as any adaptation could be. From the opening where the years are swept away as the theatre comes to life, to the ending, the sets are absolute perfection, the perfect balance of paying homage to the original concept of the stage production, while at the same time allowing a new eye to contribute much more without ever going over the top. Unfortunately the costumes while pretty and in some cases elaborate are definitely underplayed. The most niggling example being the ""Masquerade"" number, where the designer for some strange reason decided to be ""Arty"" & that everyone should be in black and white Confusing when the song that is being sung at the time goes on about all the amazing colours etc? But having said all that works, and I loved it. The acting is top rate, who cares if Gerard Butlers vocal range is not Michael Crawfords, Mr Butler brings a soul to the part of the Phantom. As previous reviewers have said that they would pick him over the Vicount if they were in the same position. The Part of Christine is well played and loses nothing from being given to such a young actress. The show stealer is Minnie driver as ""la Carlotta"" Anyone who has ever worked in the Theatre will know that these people do exist and Ms Driver has her to a tee! Go and see Phantom for what it is, a glorious package of Velvet, Gilded plaster& Music, and enjoy it for what it is...Entertainment nothing more, nothing less.",The Phantom of the Opera
976,icecubepony,100% perfect,10,21 July 2006,"All I can say is this movie was awesome. The singing, acting and the actors, the sets and costuming - Really it was so good - I am not a fan of this sort of movie in general and all i can do is hurry and play it again....I bought the DVD, and if u look at the promo videos, it has parts of the play with Sarah Brightman in it - I couldn't help but comparing her to Emmy and OH MY GOSH, Emmy is SOOOOOOOOOO much better - firstly she is much prettier, secondly she is a better singer and thirdly Sarah Brightman can't act AT ALL, and Emmy plays christine's innocence, shock and despair so beautifully. The singing by all was great, not just Emmy, but also Gerald and Patrick. I personally liked Gerald's singing as he was not a high soprano - I think having the phantom as a high soprano ruins the music and the past and future fate to his character.I really don't have enough praise for this movie - I am off to see it again!! Really, get the DVD and watch it",The Phantom of the Opera
977,viniscoolensterk,Whoa!,9,30 September 2005,"wow. that was the first word to come out of my mouth when the movie was finished. I saw the movie on my school, where it got a standing ovation. The characters left an impact on me that will always have a special place in my mind (read: haunt it) and i dare to say that the Phantom is one of the coolest bad guys ever. The sets and costumes are of a quality never seen before, Lord of the Rings has met its match. The actors are talented and i can't wait to see more of them. Everything about this movie is just...perfect. Usually there are a lot of things in movies that annoy me, but this time i was so sucked up in the movie i noticed nothing. I must say, i don't like ""musical-movies"". But the songs in this movie are like the story itself, and if the story moves you, there is no doubt about it that you will like the songs too. So while i was watching this movie the story got hold of me and the songs had a much, much greater impact than they would normally have. Whether this is because of the great acting, the story itself or the absolute greatness of the world Joel Schumacher and Andrew Loyd Webber and their companions created, i cannot say. What i can say is: Watch this movie! And do it with an open mind, even if you don't like Opera/musicals/movies with those things as a subject. You'll never forget it.",The Phantom of the Opera
978,jproctor-3,"Good Christine, bad Phantom",5,13 November 2005,"I am one of the small percentage of people who have never seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on stage. However, I have seen some of the other movie versions, including the original silent version with Lon Chaney. Therefore, I watched this movie with no preconceived notions concerning the music, because I had never heard Michael Crawford (or anyone else) sing the lead.Having made that disclaimer, I can say that Emmy Rossum was marvelous as Christine, but Gerard Butler was poor as the phantom. He could not hold a note to save himself. I don't know why he was chosen for a singing role. In the old days, singing roles were assigned to singers who could act passably (Howard Keel comes to mind). With Butler, it seems the casting people wanted a strong force for the ending - and, to be fair, he was excellent as the unmasked phantom - but the bulk of the movie suffers simply because he does not have the strong singing voice required of the role. After all, this is, at heart, an opera. People come for the songs, not for the drama. I suggest Gerard Butler stick to non-musical roles, and leave the singing to people with the voice for it.",The Phantom of the Opera

He was without doubt the best thing in this movie. He can use his voice really good. He can love, suffer, feel pain, be happy and be angry just with his voice. After that he is such a great actor he roles with his body. At the end of the (spoiler) Don Juan act he sang ""Christine Thats All I Ask Of..."" I cried so hard just on those line because you can feel the love, the obsession of the phantom. Thats why I Thoth he deserves an Oscar but of course Academy knows it.About Emily Rossum. She is pretty and she has a really good voice but not so good with the acting. The movie is really good any little mistake will catch your eye. Like her acting she is good but nothing compared to Gerard Butler. Of course the music is the one thing I can say anything about. Best scene is (for me) Just before the Phantom vanishes. The music box is playing and he is singing Masqurade and you can feel his pain. Great movie go and see it and re feel the music of the north...",The Phantom of the Opera
980,uniques-1,The most magnificent film I have ever seen!,10,12 November 2005,"What a stupendous film! I'd always heard that the 'Phantom of the Opera' is good, but never could I have imagined something so spectacular. My choir had been practicing some of the songs, and I could hardly wait to see it. When I did, I almost died. The sets, the costumes, the music! The music was some of the most touching I will ever hear. And yet, without all of these, it would still be magnificent. The characters are worth their weight in gold! The phantom broke my heart every time he sang, with that voice that seemed to belong to an angel. I also loved the imagery. The mirrors, especially the distorted ones, maintained a sort of twisted significance. And the Phantom's roses, tied with their little black bows, seemed to cry out his hopeless love. All in all, this was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, and takes it's rightful place next to 'The Lord of the Rings' in my heart.",The Phantom of the Opera

How can you do this? I could submit a theisis paper for how many faults there are in this movie. Like there is no visual representation of Phantom's feelings at all! Some of the scenes were beautiful, rest of them are DP nightmares. A great movie to learn what to do and not to do at the same time. Gerard Butler's performanc, acting was unbelievably beautifu. He was never trained to sing like this, yet he poured his heart and soul in this movie. And Joel ruined it with poor directionand poor DP. I am so heartbroken by this movie.

Gerard butler was charming and left you with a sense of mystery and wonder.The scenes had just the right amount of everything, and the songs came in at exactly the right time.

Not only was the music and scenery spectacular, but the actors were superb, as well. Emmy Rossum brings a pure innocence to the role of Christine and though she might was a tad young for such a challenging vocal part, I thought she did particularly well. Gerard Butler was something of a let down as he had no professional vocal experience, but the character and attitude that he brings to the role makes up for all of that. Over all, I would have to say that after seeing this movie several times, I am obsessed and I would most certainly recommend it to everyone, even those who are not fond of musicals. I definitely give this movie 10 stars. :)",The Phantom of the Opera

I have never seen the play, never knew what it was about, other than there was a guy with a messed up face. The music gave me chills; the acting sucked me in, mentally and emotionally. I felt so bad for the Phantom, a fictional character that is how good the acting was. I would recommend this to anyone that can sit still, be quiet and get emotionally involved in the movie. The singing, colors, costumes, are great, but, this whole movie is based upon feelings for other people, so you have to let your brain forget it is a movie and believe these people are real.",The Phantom of the Opera
985,mistophofleas,beautiful...,10,10 January 2006,"i understand that the movie didn't get the most welcoming reviews in the states, some complaining that is was the exact copy of the Broadway with a poorer performance of the actors, not being the standards of Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman.i find it refreshing, since i cannot see me going to New York to see the live show unfortunately, that i can see it practically verbatim on the big screen, over and over again. i enjoy Gerard Butler's performance, he didn't try to sound like Crawford, he sounded original and i think he did the film justice. And Emmy Rossum, good grief, who knew that she had such a beautiful and powerful voice, so much so that i feel she outshines Sarah Brightman's performance in voice in several songs. And let us not talk about how incredibly attractive the two are as well...i thank Andrew Lloyd Webber for allowing it to go to the big screen so that i may watch it, i have watched it over 30 times, and i know that i will watch it even more...beautiful",The Phantom of the Opera
986,MercuryPheonix,This movie converted me...,10,4 March 2006,"Well, how can I really sum up this film? It has been almost exactly two months since I first saw it, and since then I have read the book (twice), seen the musical (blew me away) and written a phanphic on one of the phantom of the opera phan sites. But even though, I do not compare the film to the musical because it is, in every way, a completely different experience.For all the people who have said that the casting was wrong, I must firmly shake my head and say that I do not agree. I thought every role was cast to perfection. The roles such as the managers and La Carlotta and Madame Giry were beautifully acted, with humour and feeling as well. It pains me to make any comparisons with the musical, but I must say that the role of La Carlotta, played my Minnie Driver, was much better than in the stage version. Getting onto the main roles, I think that Raoul in the musical is a very undeveloped character, but Patrick Wilson made him into a fierce lover, someone who was willing to die for the person they loved, and the part, although I do not like the character, was very well acted. Emmy Rossum was superb as Christine, and as Joel Schumacher said, her character is very innocent, especially as she truly thought the Phantom was her Angel of Music sent by her dead father. Her voice was phenomenal and her acting was amazing for an eighteen year old. Gerard Butler, though, absolutely stole the movie from me. He has been getting a lot of stick from critics saying that he was ""too handsome"" to play the Phantom, not that I'm saying he's not handsome! But I think that that does not matter, and they should look past the ""meant to be's"" and see that the performance was a deep, heartfelt piece, that obviously had him collapsing after every scene as he put so much energy into it. His voice may not be the most operatic voice in the world, but the Phantom is a dark character, a murderer, but also a victim of the world around him and the prejudices of humanity; he is an unstable character. Butler's voice portrayed that; at some points he was controlling, at other points devastated, and at other points angry, and his voice changed with each emotional switch. It was a rare performance, a performance that should have gotten him a ""best actor"" nomination as the Oscars, which I was devastated to discover he wasn't even considered for. No film has ever made me cry before, although I nearly did in Titanic, and even though I have seen this film at least twenty times, the end still makes tears come to my eyes, when I see the rose on Christine's grave, and then Learn to be Lonely begins as the credits role, which is one of the saddest songs I have ever heard.All in all? This is a movie that my friends loved, and finally after two months of nagging, I relented and watched it, adamant that I wouldn't like it and it wasn't my type of film. Two months on from that? I am officially a Phantom Phreak, thank you very much, and very proud of it! I would recommend that you are not as foolish as I was, and you see this movie even if musicals has never been your thing before. Because trust me, they will be after you've seen it!

987,Pinkmaltese1,A Breathtaking Romantic Musical!,10,11 February 2006,"This movie is completely and utterly amazing! I loved how they set it up in the beginning, with the auction, and kept going back to the time farther into the future throughout the movie and finally ended with another look into the future with an elder Raoul and Madame Giry. I have become so fond of this movie because of the elegant and detailed sets, the characters, the voices of the characters, the romance, the power of the music, the feelings, the mild humor produced by Carlotta and a few other characters, the ambiance of the movie, and everything in this production. The songs like ""Angel of Music"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""All I Ask of You"",""Masquerade"" and all the other beautifully arranged songs in the movie. I felt captured by the characters especially by the Phantom and his way of being seductive to Christine in song and touch.

The songs are very catchy, as I had several, such as ""Masquerade"" and ""Music of the Night"" stuck in my head for days. Gerard Butler's voice is gorgeous, and the cast was very convincing. Emmy Rossum demonstrates the perfect casting of this movie. Also, Minnie Driver was hilarious as Carlotta, the overly dramatic diva of the Paris Opera House. This is a timeless story, and one of my absolute favorite movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
989,whiteroses006,There's a lot to say about this movie,7,3 June 2006,"There's a lot to say about this film. It has its good points and its..well..not so good points. It isn't meant for people that don't like musicals, or for people that can't get into a musical because its mostly singing. It also isn't for people that don't like romance because this movie has a lot of romance and heartbreak in it. If you love the play and Michael Crawford this also might not be the movie for you. But if you adore musicals, love to cry at a heartbreaking romantic film, and don't mind seeing someone play the Phantom besides Michael Crawford well then this just might be the film for you.THE GOOD This movies has some absolutely beautiful set designs. The Opera Populaire looks astounding, the lair, while although very different from the play, looks great, and the graveyard looks frighteningly beautiful. The sets alone make the film worth seeing as do the lovely costumes. Although I had some problems with the small mask for the Phantom, the costumes are really beautiful and impressive. You'd have to see the film to believe me. I also loved the acting of all the stars. Gerard Butler(The Phantom) does a wonderful job especially for such an emotional character. Emmy Rossum(Christine) is gorgeous, and although she has a very weird stare throughout the film I thought she did a pretty darn good job. Patrick Wilson(Raoul) is a handsome hero with a voice that could comfort me any day. Minnie Driver(Carlotta) is hilarious, she does a wonderful job getting you to laugh. Another good point for the film is the beautiful music which Phantom of the Opera is known for. From the very moment the chandelier rises in the beginning to the chilling overture you know this film is going to be something to experience just from the music. You'd have to hear it to believe how beautiful and hypnotizing it can be. So as you can see there are many good points to this film.THE BAD Although Gerard Butler did a great job with his acting his singing sent shivers down my spine and not in a good way. I couldn't stand his singing. His voice was meant to be in a rock band; it was never meant to play the Phantom who is supposed to sing like an angel. I also hated the fact Gerard was way too hot to play the Phantom. He's supposed to have a face that is so ugly he was condemned by society. So why is the Phantom one of the hottest guys I've ever had the pleasure to lay eyes on? Not only is he hot, when she finally takes the mask off at the end of Pass the Point of No Return he looks like he has bad sunburn! The film is way to sexed up. There are way too many problems to mention in one review. Whether it be the numerous goofs in the movie, or problems with the film itself it has enough bad points to equal with the good, and perhaps surpass. If you like musicals though I would still give this film a chance. It's still a beautiful film to see, and it has great story that teaches people a good lesson.",The Phantom of the Opera

The music is consistently brilliant throughout the film. The sets of the movie are brilliant and clearly took much time and effort to create. The cast of the movie clearly took the least amount of time. Many of the insignificant characters were played by actors that did not fit into the story. However, the singing roles were chosen with delicacy for obvious reasons. Emmy Rossum was the perfect actress for the role of Christine, along with Gerard Butler as Phantom. Most importantly, this movie deserves at least one re-watch and the movie appears just as good as the first watch, and appears just as enjoyable as the first watch. Despite this movie having very small mistakes, it is without doubt the best movie adaptation of Phantom of the Opera and perhaps one of the best musicals of the 21st century (so far).",The Phantom of the Opera

I watched the musical 6 years ago, and read the book 4 years ago. This pulls quite a bit from the book and from previous Phantom movies also. I loved it, and will certainly enjoy watching it again tomorrow. It's only the third movie I have not minded spending the money on to watch on the big screen twice.

I know it was hard to do justice to the role made famous in London by Sarah Brightman, but she (Emmy) was a revelation. It's also hard to believe that she is only 18. All the other characters are performed well, especially Minnie Driver as Carlotta, whilst Miranda Richardson is also good. I would have to regard this as one of my all-time top 10 movies, and without a doubt the best musical so far.",The Phantom of the Opera
996,packrat1946,A Different Phantom,10,3 March 2005,"I saw Michael Crawford in the Los Angeles production of ""Phantom"" and thought no one could do it any better. I was disappointed when the movie was announced but no Michael Crawford. I knew they would have a hard time filling this role to my satisfaction. When Gerard Butler was announced as the actor to get the part, I did not know who he was until someone said he played ""Attila"" which I had seen. I could not picture him as the ""Phantom"" and greatly worried about his singing ability. When I first saw the movie I was not sure how much I liked it but saw it again and decided that, yes, Michael Crawford did the role beautifully ON STAGE. But a movie is different. Gerard did put a lot of passion into it and, granted, he does not have the ""perfect voice"" but I enjoyed his ""Phantom"" just the same. Its just different. Michael is a tenor. Gerard is a baritone and I loved the deeper voice with the raw edge. I have now seen it 8 times and am sorry the critics did not see the same movie that I saw.",The Phantom of the Opera
997,jekyllhj7,Awful... Glad I didn't pay for it...,1,22 January 2005,"I was a little nervous about seeing this movie after hearing about the cast, but since I had a free ticket I figured I had nothing to lose. I was wrong....The jumping of times from 1917 to 1889 and back again was very distracting. (and I feel unnecessary) The original play (and the novel) take place at the Paris Opera House, not a local, smaller 'Opera Populaire'. To me the movie lessened the grandeur of the play making the action take place in such a small venue. It also takes away the explanation of all the basements, tunnels, and even the lake that are really under the Paris Opera House.As for the Phantom.... first of all, for those who say Michael Crawford was too old for the part, obviously have no knowledge of the original story. The character of the Phantom *is* and older man (at least 40s-50s) So in actuality Gerard Butler was too young for the part. His singing is not operatic enough for the part and is at times not understandable. The make up, which had such potential to make a great effect on screen, fell short. When it is finally revealed at the end, it looks as if he had just been in a fist fight and had a black eye. It seems as if, given a few days, it would heal. I was also very disappointed in the Masquerade scene. The dancers were ""voguing""... come on.... And the Red Death costume was sorely lacking. Just a simple suit and a black mask.... when the stage version has that wonderful skull and feathered hat and flowing cape. Much more dramatic.Emily Rossum's voice seemed quite weak for being such a 'great soprano' as Christine is supposed to be. Her face wore much the same expression throughout the entire film... and that seemed to be one of confusion.I have no idea why they cast Minnie Driver as Carlotta, except for the 'star power' of her name. What was the point if she doesn't even do her own singing. She was way too over the top and ruined the part for me. Sadly, the only characters that I did enjoy from the film were Meg, Andre and Firmin. I also missed the intelligence the stage show gives to the Phantom. This is very noticeable in the graveyard scene. The sword fight, while oh so exciting to movie audiences, was very out of character for the phantom. This is a man who uses his brilliant mind to fight. In the stage show, Raoul takes Christine and runs away after a verbal confrontation with the Phantom. A final note... and I am surprised there wasn't any kind of legal problems, is that Susan Kay is not given any credit at the end of the film. The scene showing the young Phantom (Erik) in the cage at the carnival was directly from her novel 'Phantom'. It is not found in the Gaston Leroux novel, nor ALW's musical. All in all, I think Joel Shumacher ruined another film, just as he did with Batman. The cutting of entire scenes, as well as moving one of the most dramatic parts of the story were extremely unnecessary. I was so disappointed in this film and I am surprised that ALW allowed this to happen to such a great play. It is a shame he 'went Hollywood'.",The Phantom of the Opera
998,tt65,Replenishes the Soul!!!,9,10 February 2005,"It's been exactly ONE WEEK since I saw the movie and I still cannot get it out of my mind. There has not been a day that has passed that I haven't told someone new about how wonderful it is...and that they need to see it. Where do I even begin??? That music....it touches my soul...I mean it. The music plays and you can't help but be moved by it. I was concerned I wouldn't like it since I was use to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. It was perfect...beautiful!!! Then the imagery itself...how breath taking the scenes/cinematography! It was sheer beauty to the eyes! The costumes...the opera house...my gosh, I felt as if I were there! The cemetery was gorgeous -- where is that place? The scene on the opera house roof top -- takes your breath away....the gently falling snow so cleansing an experience. And my gosh...how in the Sam hill did they come up with the way they brought the opera house back to life as they are revealing the chandelier at the decrepit old opera house at the auction in the beginning scene. It was sheer genius!!! I took my husband, fearing he'd sleep through and be mad at me the next day....on the contrary, he was as enchanted as I was! It's a special memory we share and will cherish -- actually the movie is quite sensual too! I've suggested every day since we saw the movie that we go see it again! What took them so long to make this into a movie. When I first saw the play in Pittsburgh at the Benedum Theater back when the musical was first playing in the late 80's - early 90's I said, they need to make this into a movie because they could do so much more in a movie than they can on stage -- I was right! I'm glad someone finally pick up on my initial thought!!! Bravo!",The Phantom of the Opera
999,aldonza99,Beautiful fantasy,10,3 January 2005,I went to see this all by myself when I was having a bad day at home....it took me away from all my problems and into a fabulous dream. It is really the most lushly beautiful movie I've seen in a long time. Overdone??...maybe...but I don't compute that concept when it comes to escapist entertainment. Gerard Butler is getting criticism for his singing but it was raw and sung with more passion then I have ever heard in anyone's interpretation of the role. Emmy Rossum and the others have been getting well-deserved good reviews and I agree with them. I saw the play twice and have been looking forward to this movie for a year. I was not disappointed at all.,The Phantom of the Opera
1000,bcv_california,Surprisingly true to the original.,7,17 July 2005,"I have been an avid fan of the original stage version since its very inception with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, so I was more than hesitant to see the film with it's younger ""hipper"" cast and a following to match. I remember ""Evita"" with extreme distaste in the film adaptation from the stage.Finally, I broke down and rented it and I was very pleased to see how much truth to the stage show. The difference being, that the stage production lacked many of the explanations for how things happened that the movie did explain. At first I didn't like it, but logic finally caught me by the scruff and reminded me that in theatre, one can suspend one's need for reality a lot easier than one can for film. The explanations of how and why various things that seemed like pure ""magic"" on stage, showed a more calculated and genius intellect at work.A plus that the film had that the stage production did not have was Emmy Rossum, who blew me away. I'm sure others might have sung better, but her every move, facial expression, and tone was spot on. Not only that, but her age was more to what is described for Christine Daae, and it bothered me quite a bit back in the 80s that Sarah Brightman was simply too old for the role. On the converse, Gerard butler, seemed too young.Minnie Driver, for the first time in her career, made me like her in a role. That's another plus.All in all, if you were a fan of the stage production, if you can put the new teenage following behind you, you won't be disappointed.",The Phantom of the Opera
1001,jockeygirlluke,Comments On The Movie,9,31 March 2006,"I thought the Movie was wonderful, but, I wish that the movie could have been a bit longer and more detailed. That's why I gave a 9 rating. Now the book was great but they made Erik out to be a horrible villain, give the guy some slack OK. The Broadway show is decent, it was less detailed as the book but that would have a rating of 8. In the movie, Erik turned out to be more romantic and Raoul was like the one who came and stirred things up. So I believe the Movie deserves a respectable 9 rating. Now I like reading the books before and after I see the movie so I can compare and contrast the script and content. My favorite character would have to be Erik.",The Phantom of the Opera
1002,sugarandspice335,The Phantom Of The Opera thoughts.,10,9 April 2006,"My opinion of the movie is that it is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I love musicals, so I was able to get interested in the movie right at the beginning. The movie will enchant you and capture your heart. If you aren't into love stories or musicals, then this movie isn't for you. The movie is so good, I watch it everyday after school. I might sound obsessed, but I love this movie. There is not a single time that I watch it, that it doesn't make my heart flutter or make me feel the emotions that are occurring at the time. If the movie was made after the most popular musical of all time, then it must be excellent. If you don't believe me, rent the movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1003,lgreeneyes86,The Phantom of the Opera 2004,10,12 April 2006,"Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to see this movie in theaters but Oh, I wish I had! I saw it on HBO a month ago and I was hooked. I went out to buy the DVD, the book, the soundtrack. I was disappointed at what some of the critics had to say about the movie. I thought Gerard Butler's voice was amazing, you can hear the heart wrenching emotion in each of his songs, but as always, critics seemed to have a problem with his singing because it wasn't up to Crawford's level. But I went to download Crawford's versions and was disappointed. I found his voice too /high and pretty to be that of a phantom... I didn't think Sarah Brightman was particularly good either but Emmy Rossum did a great job, I was surprised to know that she's even younger than me by a few months and that just blew me away. I read a few opinions on this site too. That comment about Emmy seeming like she was on ""tranquilizers""- The phantom's voice is supposed to be hypnotizing, ""intoxicating-the book says- drawing her to the mirror in that scene. I think she was trying to convey that. And another comment on Raoul having the ""character of a kitchen door cabinet"" I think he did Raoul perfectly, not to mention his singing was OUTSTANDING! Other comments on the fear of how it would turn out knowing Schumacher was directing it. Yes, he made Batman and Robin, so what? Why go in to a movie with a preconceived notion that it will be bad based solely on the director's past projects? All I can say is I love the movie. The masquerade scene was out of this world. The movie was so beautiful and I thought the casting was absolutely perfect, as opposed to what some critics say. Minnie Driver was great! At first I wondered how a deep voice like hers -Good Will Hunting could be a soprano, lol Oh well,so she didn't really sing Carlotta but she did sing Learn to be Lonely during the credits. I love EVERY SINGLE SONG in this movie. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Go see it!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1004,Francessag,The Phantom of the opera has made me a believer in musicals that I didn't think was possible,10,22 April 2006,"I've never been a lover of musicals. After watching the phantom at least six times I'm hooked. Although I think it's because of Gerard Butlers portrayal of him. I was mesmerized by that mans eyes alone. I am now reading the book and collecting any trivia that I can find on the Phantom and of course on Gerard. I wish he would make more movies of this kind.Actually I could go on for hours about this movie and not only me but all the (mostly women) in my family. Our ages range from 21 to 78. Just thought this would be another verification as to the absolute brilliance of the Phantom of the opera movie. I suspect I will be watching it over and over again. I always cry with the Phantom when he cries. I would really like to comfort him. Anyone that thinks they won't like this movie because it's a musical especially an opera should definitely give this one a chance to change their minds. My sister talked me into it as I was one of those skeptics and I'm very happy that she did. Although,as soon as I knew that Gerard Butler was in it I was already hooked.I would recommend the Phantom of the opera to anyone that enjoys a musical,mystery,action, and most of all a touching love story and at the same time a heart wrenching sadness this is the one to see. Take a box of Kleenex,you will need it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1005,criznatapia,Final critique project,4,21 May 2019,"Artistic Value- In the film of Phantom of the Opera it had an innovative style than the previous films it had; such as new style of clothing apparel, a cast with better quality of singing and more advanced cameras, but also a better plot story that makes the audience be interested in the film. It introduced the style of singing when it comes to being in the opera house such as soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, tenor, baritone, and bass. During the film, besides the acting in being in the opera house it introduced us to a love story as well, when the phantom falls for a girl named Christine, besides her beauty she also had her singing capability. The film did strengthens its' technique with focusing shots and a well written plot story to demonstrate the opera house. Before, the Phantom of the Opera was made in the 1920's making it be a classical movie to begin with, as the previous films the story seemed dull, even though it presented its' characters and how the filmed is shown, yet; it didn't seem to connect the face expressions or dramatic scenes on what the audience needs, to feel when watching a film.
The film did engage with their audience just from color and lighting, it had shadows, red- black vibrance that is strong, and a pure like a creamy soft, focus quality to show the romance and music throughout the opera house. The film had sounds, such as diegetic and non-diegetic combined, because of the cast singing and the emotion it puts in the music and when it comes to talking with each other.Entertainment Value- The popularity of this film is their soundtrack, the way they express their voice so loud or deep can get the audience to engage into their expression. However, the importance of it; is the storytelling, such as a romantic moment between a man and a woman, whom she is in not in love with him but has a connection with him. It gives an idea of how a love story can happen at an opera house. Also, the 1920's film made it even bigger to begin with since back then; their entertainment were films and arts. It even appears as a classical film, the story is very original it was first made as a book then into a film that has brought many popularity throughout the years. The book was even created in 1911 in France by Gaston Leroux. The lifestyle had an early 1900's fashion with dresses, acting, environment, etc. The scenes that stood out was Christine meeting Erik and both were engage into a love singing moment, the other one was Raoul and Erik fight also having Christine in it, making it seem like a love triangle.Educational Value- The moral theme which is the main theme is the allure, mystery, and comfort of night and darkness. The phantom embraces the dark rooms, passageways, and shadows of the Paris Opera House as his sanctuary, a haven that provides him comfort and relief from the outside world he is not a part of. One of the main moral teachings of the story is that love between two people cannot be forced. It also highlights the need for every human to be loved. These two concepts meet in the form of Erik (the Phantom), who has a fierce, one-sided and possessive love for Christine. Deformed since birth, a bitter man known only as the Phantom lives in the sewers underneath the Paris Opera House. He falls in love with the unknown chorus singer Christine, and privately tutors her while terrorizing the rest of the opera house and demanding Christine be given lead roles. The film can be easily influenced or can impact, people's perspective on love obsession they can use it on other; that can damage a relationship between each other.Literary Value- The central conflict in The Phantom of the Opera is between Erik, or the Phantom, and Christine, his love interest. The trouble is that the Phantom is in love with Christine, but Christine is in love with someone else named Raoul. At least, that's how it seems on the surface. Christine Daae, a young singer, is the protagonist. Erik, a deformed and malicious genius who lives under the Paris Opera-house, is the antagonist. The image of the mask is the key to understanding the book. When Christine makes Erik remove the mask, Erik finally understands what it means to be human and to connect with another person. The mask is something Erik wears to be able to interact with the world, yet it actually prevents him from connecting with it. Erik wishes to be loved for his own sake and accepted for who he is. He does indeed have many good qualities: he is a talented architect and engineer, an excellent musician, a brilliant composer, and he adores Christine and will do anything for her. Yet because he feels rejected and unloved by the world due to the way it reacts to his appearance, he lashes out unpredictably, violently, and sadistically. This unpredictability of behavior causes people to fear and mistrust him. Ironically, it is Erik's conduct, not his face, that causes him to be hated and feared.",The Phantom of the Opera

I liked the change of voice for the phantom and Gerard Butler has never sung before, so it was better hearing a talented newbie. Minnie driver's singing parts were not all her, i can'r remember who but they were not all her, sorry.The phantom is a much nicer phantom in this version, although in other's he seemed to be dark and obsessed with Christine. I would recommend this movie to opera lovers and those who are fans of the stage show, i bought it in 2005 and know the word to the movie, it really was absolutely fantastic!

1009,azjourney,"Magic, Pure Magic",10,25 September 2006,"I had seen POTO twice in the theater and had no expectations about what to expect from the movie version. Well, went to finally see it on the big screen, and POW, my senses were hit with such a force of splendor and awe. I was totally swept away in the magic, the romance, the beauty and the emotion of this film. I literally put all reality on hold for the duration of the film, and allowed myself to be swept away into this new world of song, romance, intrigue and sensuality.Saw it two times after that, and of course, bought the DVD. Out of all the films I have ever seen, for some reason this film has haunted me ever since. I have never been so magically swept away by a film before, and as many others have said, it took me several days to come down from the ""high"" of the film, it left such an impression on me. To this day, even when watching the DVD, it still captures my senses and imagination.Gerard Butler, this man, this actor, and the character of the Phantom that he portrayed with such sexuality, anger and sadness, to me, it was very apparent why Christine would be drawn to him. Mr. Butler really captured who this being was, in all his beauty and his horror and his angst. He represented danger and risk and temptation, as compared to Raoul, who represented sanity and safety. In a heartbeat, I would have gone with the Phantom...what a man! No, Mr. Butler's voice wasn't a typical singing voice normally that would be used in a musical, but that was the point. The role of the Phantom wasn't supposed to be communicated through a smooth and satiny voice. He was rough, rugged, and very raw.His singing voice was intentionally set apart from the silky smooth beautiful voices of Ms. Rossem and Mr. Wilson (who I feel were absolutely perfect for the roles they played). He wasn't supposed to be of their safe and clean worlds...he lived in the rough and dark underbelly of their world. His deep raw voice captured that.I am sad that Joel Schumacher did not get any recognition for this film. He did an excellent job bringing this musical to the screen, and I feel he should be commended. Well, then I'll commend him...THANK YOU Mr. Schumacher for making this beautiful film. In my unprofessional opinion, it is a masterpiece.",The Phantom of the Opera

I've never seen so much detail go into a movie like this. Minnie driver was hysterical in her role as the prima donna Carlotta, and i am seeing Miranda Richardson in a whole different perspective since i first saw her in harry potter 4 as Rita skeeter. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys music. my boyfriend and i spent a great deal of times singing the songs from the movie together and it brought us really close together. i give this movie a 10/10! be sure you listen to the music of the night!",The Phantom of the Opera
1011,JoyceRebaric,Hated the 2004 movie,1,10 May 2006,"This has to be the worst version of Phantom that has ever been. They did not stay true to the book or the characters. First of all, in the book, the Phantom appears to be very late 40's possibly middle 50's. Whey did they have him played as a 29-30 year old. The Phantom did not spend his whole life in the Opera House. The movie opens at a rehearsal in 1871. The Opera House was not finished until 1875. Neat trick if you can perform in a building that is not done. There was also a siege going on in Paris in 1870-1871. They were eating the animals at the zoo. There was no emotion from any of the characters. They acted as if they were reading a bus schedule or the yellow pages. I've seen Phantom's all over the world and this actor cannot act his way out of a wet paper bag let alone try to sing. Andrew LLoyd Webber had his choice of so many that could do justice to the role (it didn't have to be Crawford) so why did he choose so badly.

I disagree strongly that Gerard Butler's voice was not strong enough for the role. He had a winning combo of voice and appeal. I did not see the play and really don't want to know, because I simply cannot imagine a better Phantom than Gerard Butler.

Who can disagree? *It is also really nice that they cast such a hot guy as the Phantom; I'm really quite infatuated with Gerry Butler now.* I can't believe how well Gerry portrayed the Phantom and his performance could make anyone feel sorry for the Phantom and fall utterly in love with him despite his harsh side. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were outstanding in their performances also, and I was quite surprised when I learned of how young Emmy was when she was cast as Christine. She has amazing talent, especially for someone that young. Her innocence as Christine was played well against the powerfulness of the Phantom.

Emmy Rossum was excellent as the love of his life. I think an older actress would have been wrong for the part. Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver were all well casted. Minnie Driver played a perfect spoiled Diva. Since I wasn't familiar with most of the actors I had to research them and have since looked for all their movies so I can see what else they have been in. I love to watch Gerard Butler as Attila.

Also I had never seen the movie before it was nominated for an Oscar. I make it a point to view all the movies that are nominated for Oscars more out of curiosity than because they appeal to me. The Phantom of the Opera was an absolute stunner! I was especially mesmerized by the singing of the three main characters. Mostly, I could not take my eyes off the interaction of the Phantom and Christine. Since seeing this film, the music haunts me. It pops in my head at night when I go to bed, and in the morning when I wake up, also at different times throughout the day it pops in my head. The music was lovely, and the performances by the cast were excellent. I have watched this movie nearly ten times and Gerard Butler's Phantom still moves me to tears. This movie is now one of my favorite top ten musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera

Can you believe that Gerard had no prior singing experience. I also loved the songs! My favorite ones was Music of the Night and Pass the Point of no Return. I also liked All i ask of YOu. I cried at the end of the movie. I was like boo hieing crying. It should go to Broadway with the same cast and everything but it could do without Minnie Driver. Am i the only one who thinks that the Phantom was SO HOT!! he was the handsomest phantom that could have ever been. I also thought he was hot in tomb raider and dear Frankie.,The Phantom of the Opera

I went last week and it was the best movie I have ever seen...she warned me that there was a lot of singing but I liked it...everything...the singing the drama... the mysteriousness that the phantom had going on. I think this is a great movie and I'm glad my friend made me watch it because I love music. I think that Emmy Rossum did an awesome job playing the role of Christine because she nailed it...I don't think their could've been a better actress! I think that the phantom (gerard butler) was so sexy with the masks...it gave me chills down my spine...it was like a mysterious kind of sexy look that really got me. They can both sing very well and both have amazing voices...I love it and I may even see it again just because I can:),The Phantom of the Opera

Some years ago I was in London and I saw the musical and I decided to watch the movie if it there is a movie. So I was very glad when I saw that there is a movie. For me, Gerard Butler is great and he sings very well. The movie is full of passion and tragedy because Christine doesn't know what to do and whom she want to take.

Emmy Rossum did a very good job playing Christine Daea and her voice was amazing. Gerard Butler was very good in playing the Phantom and I think that he really brought the character's dark side out very well. I loved the suspense and anticipation you feel as you are watching the movie. It was very good and I think it should have won the Oscar for Best Movie and that Emmy Rossum should have won the Oscar for Best Actress. I advise that everyone should see this movie.

I've loved Lloyd Webber's Phantom for years, and have been waiting so patiently ever since I first heard there would be a film. And I was not disappointed, this film was well worth the wait.I thought the acting/singing was marvelous. Gerard Butler was a terrific lead, Emmy Rossum played a wonderful Christine, and both I thought handled the singing very well. The whole cast were wonderful really!The film just ran along so well, each part leading nicely into the next, up to the finale which was so powerful.Just go and see this film for yourself!

1031,dianamascarenhas,perfect,10,13 June 2006,"This version of 'the phantom of the opera' has some kind of magical quality which enchants souls all around. First thing I must say, is that Sir Lloyd Webber is a genius and his music makes miracles to the minds of those who listen to it. Unlike many people say, the voice of Gerard Butler (phantom) fits perfectly with those of Emmy Rossum (christine) and Patrick Wilson (raoul). Gerard has not the professional musical background of Emmy or Patrick, but his voice seduces and adds a necessary temper to the songs. Then the whole movie has a surprising taste of shape and color, mixed with Lloyd Webber's music you will want to replay over and over again. I have seen the movie many times myself, and I just can't get tired of it. Perfect for Christmas season, perfect for Halloween, perfect for dark stormy nights, and perfect for any artist, fool or daydreamer. It has a sweet scent of Gothic romance.",The Phantom of the Opera

I wanted to see if this video was as good as a stage version I'd seen in my hometown a year or two earlier. And I also had a CD of the audio recording from the original on-Broadway version. This movie did NOT disappoint. It was beautifully staged and filmed, and the Phantom as portrayed by a young and virile Phantom was so sexy! Suddenly, it made sense to me why Christine would have been so torn between the rather dull and boring dude whose name I can't even remember now (like I said, rather dull and boring, LOL) and that Phantom, wowsers! Bordering on - don't let your children under 21 see this territory - the scene from the ""play within the movie"" where Butler and Rossom were singing ""Past the Point of No Return. Hot, Hot, Hot!

Although I am not a fan of musicals i think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Emmy Rossum, who was 16 when they started filming, did absolutely amazing as Christine. She is both beautiful and has the most amazing voice. Some of the notes that she reaches are just jaw dropping. Patrick Wilson was well cast as Raoul for he also has a beautiful voice. But for me, the best performance came from Gerard Butler who plays the Phantom. I think he did an excellent job with the singing, especially since he had no experience with it whatsoever. He plays the Phantom with such emotion and intensity that you really start to feel sorry for him. Although the story is very sad, Gerry manages to make the character sexy as well which manages to make the women (and i must admit that I am included in this) become even more drawn to him. This movie is the reason I became such a big fan of his. The scenery is lavish and beautiful which just adds to the overall excellence of the film. This movie is a definite must see, but I must warn you that you will need tissues!",The Phantom of the Opera

But I must say that this is the loveliest rendition of the music I have ever heard. This film inspired me to see the ""BROADWAY"" production. That experience was awesome, but the film was spectacular in comparison. Seeing the production on stage was like being in the film. It was awesome to hear the music live, but one thing I did not find I was happy about. I couldn't enjoy the performance of the character that played ""Christine"" on Broadway!! I was spoiled by the beautiful, humble, and sweet voice of Emily Rossum. Her character, in this film, has a believable quality. She is so genuine. I have followed her career and think that her performance in this movie was fantastic. She sounded like everything that she sang came from her heart. The phantom is also very attractive, and you feel the intensity of his emotion clearly in this film. I found myself reflecting on my own life and love. Their performances made me cry with empathy. THAT IS POWERFUL ACTING. I didn't know how much I would love this film. The character ""Roul"" is played by a handsome actor that has a very sweet voice. I loved the innocence in these performances. You don't even think that you are seeing something that has been scripted. It is the natural performances that make it such a pleasure to watch. Nothing is over acted.

Gerard Butler brought the living phantom of the opera to the big screen, along with beautiful christine (emmy rossum) whom literally blessed the audience with her angelic voice. together they brought audiences to tears with passionately-charged romantical duet. My favorite song of all was ""point of no return"" the epitome of the phantom's love for christine. It personally made me cry at the top of the balcony in which the phantom held christine like a rose and sang to her 'That's all i ask of you"" the swordfight, the singing, the emotion and the glorious music definitely won a place in my heart and about 18 million other people.",The Phantom of the Opera
1042,centigrade_0,A very good film adaptation of a great musical,9,28 August 2006,"**the only actual spoiler in this is in regards to the song, ""Phantom of the Opera""**I am something of a Broadway/music buff. There was a time when I could list several casts for some of the major plays out there -- Phantom (Michael Crawford as the Phantom and Sarah Brightman as Christine), Les Miserables (Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Terrance Mann as Javert, etc), and others. I personally did not like Gerard Butler's voice, but I did enjoy his performance as the Phantom -- he may not have Crawford's voice (he is a bit raspy, I thought he spoke too many of the parts, his voice was very raw and powerful, and he has no vibrato), but he has that 'phantom' presence to him. Emma Rossum as Christine was better than I had expected. I loved the rich tone of her voice, though I couldn't help but notice that the song, ""Phantom of the Opera,"" began in a lower key than in the original, and that the final key change and fourth verse were completely cut out of the song -- which is a tragedy, because the fourth verse would have actually sounded quite good with Butler's voice. As a result, the famous high E that Christine was supposed to hit was actually a few steps lower. Nonetheless, I thought it a wonderful adaptation to film, and a great way to introduce new fans to the music and the story.The Phantom of the Opera is one of my favourite musicals of all time -- this movie did not disappoint me in the slightest. And if ever I choose to be a music snot and dislike the fact that Butler wasn't classically trained (as many very good singers are not), I can always watch the French dubbed version on the DVD, in which a much better singer sings the part while I can still enjoy Butler's visual performance. The French voice-over sounded a lot like Rufus Wainwright, actually. I'll have to find the French-dubbed cast list.All in all it was a great movie, and I recommend it to any fan of music, though in order for a music buff to enjoy, it one must view the actors and actresses as they are and not try to compare them to the Broadway originals.",The Phantom of the Opera
1043,gelsey,Romantic Phantom,7,30 January 2005,"It is interesting to read comments (including ones by professional critics) that say the Phantom in the film version is too good looking or too young or that he not horrifying enough. These people have missed the fact that this film is an adaptation of the popular stage musical, not an adaptation of the original book. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is about a tragic, romantic love story, not about a horror story. The popularity of the stage production is grounded in the memorable music that permeates this story of unrequited love.One primary reason for the film's popularity with moviegoers is the sexual attractiveness of Gerard Butler's Phantom. Without a sexy, charismatic Phantom, fans would not be flocking back to the theater for repeat performances, as indicated by many of the comments. The people who don't like the film have very valid criticisms, but those who are swooning over the leading man are blind to Joel Schumacher's shortcomings. In casting an attractive, hunky Phantom, Schumacher and Webber ensured that the movie would be a big hit with at least half of the movie going public. A smart move on their part. In addition, since Christine was played by a seventeen year old, a much older Phantom would have been distasteful and might have verged on pedophilia.With that said, I'll never understand why Schumacher didn't dub Gerard Butler who had no prior professional singing experience. Butler's acting ability could still shine through even if the singing voice belonged to someone else. This is a MUSICAL after all, and as such, the leading man should have had a phenomenal singing voice. (Dubbing certainly didn't hurt Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.) And the lip-syncing....really inexcusable. There's another problem (among others) that's particularly annoying. Why in the world was Raoul older looking than Madame Giry in 1919?? Oh well, if that's the price we have to pay to see a Phantom who's a romantic heartthrob, maybe it's worth it. If you're a romantic at heart who likes to see attractive leading men on the screen, go see this one as soon as possible.",The Phantom of the Opera
1044,edwardnygmariddler,Not Worth It,2,18 June 2020,"The biggest issue I have with this film is the singing and acting. Patrick Wilson's acting and singing was pretty good as Raoul. Emmy Rossum can sing quite well but acting falls flat most of the time. Gerard Butler CAN act, but he sings horribly. The Phantom's character is the ""Angel of Music"" for a reason; he's Christine's voice teacher for a reason: THE PHANTOM HAS TO BE ABLE TO SING.I know a lot of people go ""Oh well the Phantom taught himself so he shouldn't sing perfectly."" Well Ramin Karimloo taught himself and yet sings better than Gerard Butler; the Phantom's supposed to be a musical prodigy who sings like it's nothing.The swordfight scene was not very well choreographed and completely out of character for the Phantom, the Masquerade Ball scene was just drab with the Red Death costume looking terribly dull. The makeup on Phantom is pretty bad and the Point of No Return scene doesn't make any sense plot wise.Overall, not that good of a movie. Maybe Lloyd Webber should've gone with better actors and director.",The Phantom of the Opera

Gerard Butler was out of this world his voice is amazing and so is his looks. I just feel so bad for the Phantom that as a child he was beat up and tormented, and he didn't know any other way of life, and the fact that people were so cruel to him just because of his face. If I were to of met the Phantom I know I would of taken care of him and not thrown him out like some piece of trash like his parents did.

1048,derekdaze,Superb Film - but stage to screen comparisons inappropriate.,9,12 December 2004,"I think some other comments here are harsh, especially towards the performance of Emmy Rossum, who I thought made the film. Her performance visually (i.e. expressions etc) is mesmerizing. I'm sure a lot of this is down to Joel Schumacher who successfully steers the film away from just putting the stage show on to film, but has actually created something powerful in its own right, so I believe comparisons of the stage show to film are unreasonable.My only niggles are technicalities, the Phantom wears a mask which only goes just above his eyebrows in the Ball scene (and shows no deformation) and yet when the normal white mask is removed later the entire left side of his face is deformed. The lip sync hing is often poor, especially in 'Think of Me' which is disappointing, especially in the knowledge that all but Minnie Driver recorded their own singing parts anyway.The Soundtrack has been given a spring clean and it really benefits from it, removing some of the synthesized feel of the original and giving it much more of an orchestral grandeur.All in all, this film really took me by surprise. As I said above Stage to Screen comparisons do feel somewhat inappropriate with this film, but I was never that fussed about Phantom before or after seeing it on Broadway. I can safely say that this film has converted me.",The Phantom of the Opera

1053,AngelicDelight,"In all, a beautiful attempt at achieving mediocrity.",8,29 September 2006,"While the spectacular effects, magnificent costumes, elaborate sets, and beautiful people all aided in moving the story along, and while it was certainly not lacking in the trademark intensity of Phantom of the Opera, the skill of the leads could definitely be called into question.Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lead the cast with attempted grace and dignity, yet the most they accomplish is to appear to be adults trapped in a game of dress-up. She's under trained (vocally) & overacts, whereas his weakness is acting in general, which he attempts to cover with obnoxiously tight pants... though the eye candy thus provided is definitely respected! They both get a ten out of ten for good looks - her slender, delicate body and classic face only compliment the rawness of his alluring, well-muscled body, and the hair and makeup is magnificently done throughout.Patrick Wilson, in the role of Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, lends a stunning voice and a ridiculously large chin to the role. His talent for acting in a movie, instead of his previous Broadway stage, is mediocre at best. What's worse, his hair tells lies about the character. He is portrayed as foppish and simple, when the original novel clearly makes a point of emphasizing his compassion, dignity, and love for Christine... not the phantom, as so many in forums everywhere have made a point of saying.The supporting cast is possibly the best feature - Miranda Richardson & Jennifer Ellison lend their superb voices and character integrity to the mother/daughter roles of Mme Giry and Meg Giry, and actors Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow, Minnie Driver, and Victor McGuire are stunningly hilarious as managers Firmin & Andre, leading soprano La Carlotta, and lead tenor, Ubaldo Piangi. In all, they, combined with the sheer intense vibrancy make the movie fully worth watching. Get your daily dose of humour with the entrancingly fitted costumes in the Masquerade scene, and ogle beautiful people during the Point of No Return...That's all! Just see the movie already.

I was absolutely amazed at how great of a performance this movie was and how good it was in comparison to the play. It's not often that you can take a play and put it up on the big screen and still feel it's success. Gerard Butler made me feel so much compassion for the phantom that it made you fall in love with his character and almost made you wish for Christine to choose the phantom over Raoul...anyway, that's just my opinion. But I am such a huge fan of Gerard Butler now that i've seen this movie. and Emmy was absolutely amazing as Christine, I have a newfound respect for her.",The Phantom of the Opera
1057,ajburkinshaw,"Phantom, simply overrated and repetitive",1,8 October 2006,"I realise that I must be in the minority when it comes to reviewing this, as it has been such a world wide hit, however, I've seen the stage production in London and the film version, the music is incredibly repetitive throughout. Apart from several main numbers the theme is simply repeated throughout the whole production. Particularly in the film much of what is said, supposedly in a musical method is in fact not music at all and appears amateurish. Its very Gilbert/Sullivan in nature, something they did better, and more suited 100 years ago. From someone with such a musical history I am amazed that this is such a hit considering it is based on a few simple melodies. To hear how a musical should be done, watch My Fair Lady, Oliver Fiddler on The Roof. They are in a different league. If this had been written by anyone else then the Lord it would have disappeared without trace after a few months.",The Phantom of the Opera
1058,nrgbunny,Stunning movie all around,10,31 January 2005,"If I had to sum up this movie in one word, I would need a few more. This was one of the most visually stunning movies I have seen in a long time. I have not been a big fan of Joel Schumacher's work, especially the two Batman movies but now I have changed my opinion. The opening sequence that goes from black and white to color is just amazing. I feel like I was transported back in time through out the movie. I spent most of the movie in awe of it. I am a theatre buff/guru and was curious to see if they would do the musical justice, at least in terms of the music. I have yet to see a live version of the play but now I am dying to see it. I really feel like they did do it justice with this rendition. It was a special delight to see Minnie Driver in her role, since I have been a big fan of hers since Circle of Friends. I thoroughly enjoyed her character and can't wait to see this movie again. I don't know why the critics don't like this one, but I love it. My husband also enjoyed it and he's not all that much into musicals. See it, if even for the amazing performances given by all.",The Phantom of the Opera
1059,me_wan_u,a BRIEF on why it is good!,10,17 October 2006,"Beautiful voices and a definite cast of upcoming celebrities. A great interpretation and so good to see in film. Soundtrack has slight differences to the original, with added percussion, however this is a bonus. It sounds magnificent. A $95mil production, so you can imagine how outstanding the sets and costumes are. This production really brings the story to life. You'll be singing the songs for weeks! I highly recommend viewing this edition to anyone who has a taste for classics, romance and especially musicals! Emmy Rossum brightens up Christine and gives her a innocent, youthful look. She is outstanding, and what a voice at such a young age. She does come across mature though. I'm not big on the Phantom's voice, he cannot top Michael Crawford. But the combination of his, Christine's and Raoul's in the final number, is incomparable! Beautiful! Music lovers a must see!",The Phantom of the Opera
1060,lukun_2001,What a great movie!,10,17 October 2006,"I went to Toronto to watch the stage opera 12 years ago and was drawn to the music part of the opera at that time.I recently found out about the DVD version of the movie and watched it again. What a great movie! Knowing little about the movie production, I thought the singing was dubbed and were surprised to learn that the actors were actually singing throughout the show.Since I have no idea of what Phontam and Christine should have been, I felt that the cast members did a great job portraying each character. The movie brought the story close to me. The vocal part for all the actors and actress were just fantastic. I was even more surprised to find out that this is the first musical that Gerald Butler was on and he has done such a superb job. I hope to see future musical productions from Gerald, and Emmy of course.I went back and listened to the sound track recorded at London and concluded that the movie version is different - more real and less theatrical and better.I have been and will continue to recommend this movie to my friends and people I know.",The Phantom of the Opera
1061,purplejen07,captivating,10,29 October 2006,"I feel like I'm definitely a bit of a late comer to the Phantom as I only just saw the movie on DVD last week. I missed it on the big screen but had a vague idea of the storyline. From the opening scenes I was completely spellbound. Gerard Butler played the part brilliantly. it's impossibly to take your eyes off his performance whenever he's on the screen. You can really feel for this seductive, lonely, desperate, barking mad genius! I'd only seen him in Tomb Raider before, but since seeing him as the phantom, I'll definitely be looking out for more of his work - past and previous. he proved himself to be a truly talented actor. His voice brought such passion and realness to the part. you could feel the intensity of emotion - love, anger and pain through his voice. but the real torment was seen in a look, a gesture, or simply in the way he held himself. One of his most seductive parts is when in the role of Don Juan he holds a finger to his lips, he signals to Chrisitne to come collude with him again by not revealing his presence and seems to be drawing her again into his secret world.Emmy Rossum was excellent, her voice so sweet and sad. She plays Christine in a way that makes you understand why in the phantoms presence she is powerless to resist. She too is damaged and lonely and in need of security and love. Patrick Wilson was a good choice for brave, protective and safe Raoul. his voice perfectly fitted this. Miranda Richardson plays Madame Giry perfectly. Her understated portrayal still conveys much about the character - from her initial support and colluding with the phantom (see the little flip of her hair plait as she reveals to the new theatre owners the phantoms' annual fee)to her gradual realisation that his obsession has become dangerous.I could go on and on about how this movie and the characters (brought to life by the actors, especially Gerard Butler) has moved me. The songs have stayed in my head ever since. I will definitely have to see the stage show now. I'm only sorry I missed experiencing it on the big screen and hope that it might be re-released at the cinema at some point.",The Phantom of the Opera
1062,kathytiller1,Best Musical I have ever seen,10,29 October 2006,"This movie is awesome and the casting was pure genius. The music is haunting and it is difficult to get it out of your head. I bought the DVD so I can watch it over and over again. I can't get enough. The actors have such incredible talent that I am totally mesmerized. I saw the play on stage and I liked it, and I was prepared to like the movie. I wasn't expecting to fall madly in love with the movie but I did because it just blew me away. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is so sensual that I can't imagine anyone else in the part. He was born to play the phantom. I think everyone did and A+ acting and singing job. If ever there was a movie that should be re-released to movie theaters it is the Phantom of the opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
1063,briese-1,Phantom stole my heart,10,30 October 2006,"As a theater student, I have had the privilege of traveling the world and seeing incredible productions in London and Berlin, among other places. I was not able to see ""Phantom"" in the theater, so I bought the DVD last week. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I have watched it every day since, sometimes twice a day! Gerry Butler has stolen my heart, and were I Christine, I would have chosen him irregardless of his face. For isn't true beauty found in the soul? And all he asked of her was that she love him. But alas, I did not write the story. This is a tale of the circle of pure love, betrayal, jealousy, and hatred, which once again returns to pure love. Thank you Mr. Weber for the gift of your incredible talents! I have wept each and every time I have watched it, and Mr. Butler's voice makes MY soul take flight! Buy this video, you won't regret it!",The Phantom of the Opera
1064,davebarr63,A great musical anyone should enjoy!,10,8 November 2006,"If you view this film for the first time expecting a horror film as in the classic Lon Chaney film, man will you be surprised! Andrew Lloyd Weber and Joel Schumacher have added their own flair to this classic tale of the mysterious phantom who haunts an opera house. Instead of a horror film, the viewer is witness to a story of a tragic love triangle.The musical scores have a modern sound to them, while still conveying a sense of a classic opera. The drama of a full-length film is carried from scene to scene by brilliant musical pieces, sung by the actors themselves (with one exception of course). Personally, I love the way Gerard Butler's voice sounds, and cannot see John Travolta in the part of the Phantom, and am quite happy he did not get the part. Emmy Rossum's voice is passionate, and sounds as if she was meant to play the role of Christine.The acting easily equals the power of the singing. You will find yourself glued to your seat while watching this film, mesmerized by the splendor of the sights and sounds Lloyd Webber and Shumacher envelopes you in.This film should in no way be considered a ""chick flick"". I'm about as macho a guy as you will ever find, and I freely admit I love this film. There is plenty of action, drama, suspense, and humor to capture the attention of any movie goer. Men and women alike should see this wonderful motion picture at least once in their lifetime. Or you can do like I did, and purchase the DVD to watch, and listen, to it over and over. One of the best films of the decade, and a must see for everyone!",The Phantom of the Opera
1065,persianboy411,Disappointment beyond rational belief,2,11 November 2006,"It didn't need so many flashbacks. The flashbacks too away from the essence of the movie. Also, there wasn't enough mystery to the Phantom. You're not supposed to see him cutting ropes and locking doors. The part where Meg finds the tunnel to his labyrinth, I wanted to shoot myself right then. Goddamn. It was such a shame, cause the trailer was so f*#^$ing good. Another thing, all the focus was on Raoul. they made it look as though he was Christine's ""knight in shining armor"" saving her for this horrible beast. In the story, Raoul is obstacle between Phantom and Christine's forbidden and passionate love. Very disappointing. Shame to Joel Shumacher.",The Phantom of the Opera
1066,jaredbakerccf,A Performance That Still Leaves Me in Awe!,10,2 April 2021,"No matter what the other critics think when using their ""extensive"" vocabulary while describing this film, it still hits me in the feels 17 years later. I've seen this show in person and it is literally a bucket-list item if you enjoy close to perfection theatre performance. I personally believe that the film, the cast, the overall vocals and performance were above and beyond. If people in Musical Arts or Theatrical Performance aren't rating this just as great as I am, then musical/theatrical performances will be below parr and the do not look forward to future experiences because this has still stuck with me since I watched it in the 7th grade until now. Bravo, and I pity critics who judge this movie as anything but impressive and monumental.",The Phantom of the Opera
1067,r-71348,This movie is not very good.,3,17 April 2021,"I wish I could give this movie zero stars. If I'm listening to my heart and not my head, I'm giving this movie one star. But if I'm looking at this movie in an unbiased, critical way. It's not worth one star. So even though my heart tells me to give it one star. I'm giving it a generous three. It's insulting, not only to the reviewer, but to the original art. My feelings towards this movie are intense. This movie makes my blood boil. It almost spoils my love for The Lost Boys. Actually it doesn't, The Lost Boys slaps. Good work Joel Schumacher. But it makes the ironic enjoyment I have for his terrible Batman movies go away. I got myself mentally ready to write this review, and just for my own enjoyment I read some of the other reviews and genuinely wondered if I had watched the same movie as them. They were talking about how this movie was so good, and this movie just isn't. This was until I went to the one star reviews and met my new best friends. These people seriously couldn't be more right. This movie sucks for very many reasons. Like seriously, there's no way I could include all of the mistakes in this movie in one review. This already lengthy review would be so much longer. But the three biggest reasons I can see for why this movie blows are that it's a terrible adaptation, Gerard Butler is miscast, and it has bad elements of film.Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE most of the Phantom of the Opera adaptations. I have yet to read the book but I hear it's good. The silent film is one of my favorite silent films. Phantom of the Paradise is hilarious, one of my favorite Brian De Palma films. And the 25th anniversary songs fill up my playlist. I probably listen to a Phantom of the Opera song every other day. And something to note, this movie was my introduction to Phantom of the Opera. So I wasn't a hardcore fan coming into it. And I still didn't like the movie. Each one of the remakes listed above had one thing in common. They changed something from the original to make a new and interesting take on a classic story. The silent film gave the world a visual representation of The Phantom of the Opera. The Broadway musical took the story and added a musical element as well as taking the story in a more romantic direction, making the Phantom more human than monster. Phantom of Paradise took the idea of the story and spun it into a more parody/comedy direction. In order for a remake to stand the test of time and be known by the audience as a worthy addition to the collection of Phantom of the Opera adaptations it needs to do something different. A remake is supposed to take the original themes, conflicts, characters, etc. And take it into a new direction. Whether that's looking at it through the lenses of a different character or taking the themes and touching on them from different angles. A remake can also take the ideas of the original and instead of going a different direction, they can further elaborate on them in the same direction. Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera does neither. It is essentially the same as the Broadway version. And because this is essentially the same as the Broadway version except worse, then there is absolutely no reason you should watch this movie instead of watching the 25th anniversary Broadway version on Amazon Prime for four dollars. Everything about this is almost exactly the same except for one scene I can think of. The scene where Gerard Butler Phantom sword fights with Patrick Wilson Raoul to try and impress Emmy Rossum Christine. This scene is not only useless, but it absolutely undermines the themes of the original. The original looks at the theme that Disney Channel really likes to touch on, true beauty comes from the inside not the outside. Not trying to bash this theme, it's used excellently in Beauty and the Beast, the original Phantom of the Opera, and Hunchback of Notre Dame, but this movie does that theme very poorly. The idea is that Christine falls in love with the Phantom because he's passionate and loving on the inside even if he looks ugly on the outside. Even though in every version he has swords, he never uses them. Because he's not supposed to be an athletic superman like character, he's a magician, an illusionist. Which adds to themes, but by taking out the angle of him being a magician and replacing it with him being a swordsman muttles the themes. Every angle you look at this movie in terms of adaptation, it's not good. So let's move on already,Oh boy. Gerard Butler sure did this movie, and I'm certain he got paid very well. But why oh god why did they cast Gerard Butler. Hey Hollywood can we stop putting celebrities in Broadway adaptations, just cast someone that's good at singing. Because Gerard Butler can't sing for anything. He belts every note above or below his talking voice. His voice is supposed to be angelic, he is supposed to be entrancing Christine with his angel like voice. Christine literally calls him the ""angel of music"" but she must be tone deaf to think that Gerard Butler Phantom sings like an angel. God I wish I was actually deaf so I wouldn't have to listen to Gerard Butler belting every single note. I don't want this whole paragraph to be me ratting on Gerard butler, because it's not his fault. He's a good actor, I enjoyed his performance in 300 or whatever. It's whatever producer thought that the perfect role for the Broadway musical adaptation where the titular character is supposed to be incredibly ugly should be the gladiator from 300. How dumb do you have to be? This man obviously can't sing, and even if he could sing, the Phantom is supposed to be UGLY, did you not get it you insane LUNATIC!? That's kind of the whole point of the Phantom, did you read the script? On a different, but similar note, the makeup for the Phantom is extremely disappointing. The thing about movies is that in a movie you do things like edit, and cut. And because of that, they could make the Phantom as disgusting as you want. The Phantom in the original is extremely scary, played expertly by Lon Chaney Sr. The Phantom on Broadway is still scary and gross even though they don't have cuts or edits or a lot of time to do makeup. The one element of their makeup that solidifies this point is the lips. On Broadway the Phantom has huge bulbous lips, so that even under the mask you can still tell that the Phantom is ugly. This also makes the kiss so important. She kisses the Phantom even though he has gross lips. But in the movie the Phantom has no makeup on his lips, which makes the kiss less important. It's such a small detail, but it perfectly encapsulates the issues with the Phantom's casting in the entire movie.Even if I stop looking at this movie through the lens of casting, theme, and adaptation, how does this movie do in the department of film, cinematography and editing? Not well. I've spent a large number of hours watching a lot of movies. And throughout that experience I've learned a lot about cinematography. This movie's cinematography is laughably lazy. Most of the shots are boring and uninteresting. The only shot I can remember is the shot where we first see the Phantom. Christine is singing ""Think of Me"" and the camera pans down through cracks in the ground and in the sewer the camera stops on the top of the Phantom's head. The big reveal of the Phantom feels like a big ""screw you"" to the audience. You thought you wanted to see the Phantom, here take THE TOP OF HIS HEAD! That's what you wanted right? On Broadway the reveal of the Phantom is done much better. You don't see the Phantom until the song ""Mirror (Angel of Music)"" where you get introduced to his angelic voice and then in the reflection of Christine he is standing there. A perfect introduction to a character with such mystery surrounding him. All of the other shots are boring and, in a word that perfectly describes this entire movie, uneventful. It's the same story with the editing. It's mostly boring, but I can't help but bring this up. Right now click off IMDb and look up the music video for ""Mirror (Angel of Music) and Phantom of the Opera"" there is an edit so absolutely hilariously bad I can't stop laughing at it. So the titular song is about to play, the big ""Phantom of the Opera"" song. The big music drop is about to happen. The camera is focused on the Phantom's hand reaching out for Christine's hand. And then they grab hands. I assume the point of this was to get the music to drop the second that they touch hands, which would be really cool. But they mess it up. It's such an easy thing to edit, and it was messed up. It's only like a second off. But it's suching a glaring example of how bad the editing is throughout.So is there anything good in this movie. Yes actually. Like I said above, Emmy Rossum's voice is actually pretty good. I also think that Patrick Wilson has a nice singing voice. The songs are good when Gerard Butler is not singing them, although that could just be because it's the same songs as the Broadway version. The set decoration looks okay sometimes. I can tell the wardrobe team had a lot of fun making the costumes for this. That's pretty much it. Oh wait actually Minnie Driver is good as Carlotta. Mostly ironically, but I'll always take more Minnie Driver in my life. When she's not on screen I want her to be.This movie is not very good. I had a bad time watching it. It's a bad adaptation, there's a lot of miscasting, and it has poor elements of movie making. There is so much more I could talk about that's bad about this movie. Like actually so much. I could really rant. But it's not really worth it. This movie is a 3 out of 10 generously. Would I recommend it to anyone? No. Don't watch this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. Goodnight.",The Phantom of the Opera

I would give it a crisp ten!,10,6 December 2006,"First of all, Phantom of the opera is uh-mazing and i love everything about it.Some people though are acting like they are the best singers in the world, and so they criticize Emmy Rossum's voice... look, if you can sing better than the girl, maybe you can criticize.. and some people are saying ""well,it wasn't good enough""..... as if you were in their shoes!And yes, Gerard Butler was handsome, but he wasn't singing very well, but who can blame him? He sings in a rock band! Don't you think it was hard for him to sing classical and soft music? I love the way he put rock into the phantom's song, and he played his part beautifully. And Raoul, his hair was very much a thumbs down.. but who cares? He's a talented singer.

This film can be considered as a love film that affects the audince's feelings, and perceptions deeply. In scenerio, Christine was a weak character. It could be stronger, and Emmy Rossum was a wrong selection for this role. She has a meanless position in the film.

But now I realize it wasn't as perfect as it had seemed those few years ago.Yes, the display is fantastic. It's beautiful, appealing, and each scene is well put together. But in regards to the history behind it, I'd say you might be better staying at home. This movie is not true at all to the story of the Phantom of the Opera, and has annoyed many phans. With the elimination of the Persian, Erik's true history, Erik's name, and even something as simple as when the chandelier was to fall! But, these little hitches could be ignored. After all, it is Hollywood. They change everything and people learn to accept that. But one fact still lingers in my mind and annoys me- and many others- constantly.Erik appears to suffer from second degree burns.. And that is his only disfigurement.This completely throws the point and the meaning of this film out the window. The disfigured face is what causes him to keep himself from the opera occupants, what keeps them in constant fear of him, and, naturally, what keeps his little white mask on. But, when he takes off the mask to reveal said ""disfigured face,"" I was appalled to see nothing more than a pile of red, slightly wrinkled flesh, which is seen more clearly in the Final Lair scene than the dramatic removal. (They used many masks to make the face, and it is incredibly obvious when they change it.)

Wow!!) - lovely tone (not all stuffy or plummy like Brightman in the higher registers of her voice) - clear, crystal, and she acts rather well too.Miranda Richardson was the best as the ballet mistress - my partner David says ""ooh, it becomes a real movie when she is on camera"" and he is right. Minnie Driver is superb as Carlotta - you can hardly recognise her and I would like to say that her singing totally astounded me as I had no idea that she was such an amazing operatic soprano..... except I can't because she was dubbed by a real opera singer (so why cast her??? Personal favour from Andy??? Why not dub the whole lot of them and put in really REALLY good actors.... Er.... Very Confused Now!)Changes were very minor - in fact I expected a complete re-write and instead Andy and Joel Schumacher (another what? I mean, this director is famous for Action/adventure blockbusters..... so why not hire him to direct and re-write a musical, shall we????) seemed to have just done a cut and paste of the stage script and sort of ""moved things around"". I love Wikipedia's description of this:""While the film remained mostly faithful to the original libretto of the stage show, some minor changes were made. Some scenes were added; others were deleted; some lines that were sung on stage were spoken in the movie, as well as minor changes in the lyrics to suit the scenes. In addition, several slight changes were made to the story....""So, really, they did stuff all when it came to rewriting. They did move the chandelier crash right to the end of the Movie's climax.... So yes, another minor ""rewrite"" to the Masquerade song - ""To a prosperous New Year, to a New Chandelier"" - didn't ACTUALLY catch the new words to this blink-and-you-miss-it change.Then they end up moving ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" to a point in the show where it doesn't really make sense anymore for Christine to sing it..... Didn't Andy do the ""Square pegs don't fit into found holes"" exercise when he was younger?? The whole point is that she IS wishing for the phantom back in her life, yet in the movie he has already returned.... Er... .wishing you were somehow here again because I have the memory of a fish and forgot that you were here just a couple of hours ago.....""Don't even get me started on the design - wasn't the stage show opulent and exciting and wondrous and innovative (okay, well, it was a fairy tale show with a fairy tale setting but I loved those chandeliers rising up out of the smoke, etc.) and the movie became flat, 2D and the masquerade scene a setting of washed out whites and black bits of flickering movement that made you slightly dizzy. And the chandeliers rose out of the smoke again - hang on, that was a bit of stage wizardry meant to give an impression, an atmosphere of the underbelly of the opera house, not actually be a literal thing that was happening (exactly how do candles rise out of the water AND remain alight throughout?).The plot is a fairy tale - in the stage production - so why try to make it more realistic for the film and take away all the magic? Also the actual plot is thin and pretty ridiculous even if we go back to the original novel so dramatically the actors have very little to work with when it comes to a script - especially a ""realistic"" attempt at one. Andrew's songs are sweet but the movie shows them up as being oh so DATED now, particularly the title piece with its tinny drum machine accompaniment (if Andrew was a clever artistic should he would have done another more classical version for the movie - he ain't clever though , izzee? (and as for artistic.... Oh what are we going to do about Maria......)Emmy deserved her awards for best newcomer (she was also in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" which came out in the same year as Phantom) but as for ""Expect to see more of this girl in the future"" we-ell, how many soprano roles are there in the movie world these days? Certainly ""Day After"" is no fantabulous film, and her follow up in 2006 in the remake of the Posdeidon adventure ""Who will survive..... NOT THE AUDIENCE"" didn't do much for anyone really.All in all - Andrew Lloyd Webber has created a fabulous accessory to be selling in the foyer - no doubt by doing this he will make a profit from it all and that, I'm guessing, is the secondary reason to why he made it in the first place.

Furthermore, Phantom could not sing. Gerard Butler can't garner attention in a karaoke bar much less enchant us as the Angel of Music. One would think that with all the struggling actors, there is someone out there who can both sing and is cute enough for Hollywood. But then again, does a cute Phantom not defeat the entire purpose. Hollywood has no clue. Skip the movies and see it on Broadway.",The Phantom of the Opera
1076,bluedog1313,Wow,10,3 June 2007,"Wow is about all I could say after i watched 'Phantom of the Opera' Well, sure. I'm one of those people who gets really into movies, telling the actors what they did wrong, warning them about the obvious foreshadowing, etc. But I was completely silent through the whole movie. I've read a few reviews on other sites, and I can't really understand it. Why did everyone hark on the actor's singing? I thought Emmy was amazing, and well, Raoul and 'The Phantom' both did excellent. None of them are professional singers, so does it matter if they didn't sound PERFECT? (though they were quite close) Some of the things in the move bothered me, like the fact that the Phantom's mask only covers a small portion of his face, yet the 'burned' portion of his (otherwise handsome)face is HUGE. But let me add, I fell in love with him quite quickly. HE was such a tortured soul, and Christine understood him.Many women will go for Raoul, seeing as he's handsome, and obviously a romantic, and has a pretty good voice. He's definitely some good eye candy, but I saw his character as being almost too... needy? Spoiler BELOW!! The ending scene in the lair, which included the KISS, was by far one of the best finales i have seen in a movie in a while. I must admit, i sobbed when Christine finally kissed Erik, partially because he started crying, having never known the love of another person, but also because it wrapped up the movie so well. I actually thought Christine might go off with him for a moment, but no, she went for Raoul, who, by my standards, looked amazing wet. Haha. The kiss was amazing, i've been known to rate movie kisses, and the 'Phantom/Christine' kiss is up there with the Titanic kiss, and the upside-down Spiderman kiss. The passion was thrilling, and i thought the Phantom deserved it...The very end of the film, with the Phantom telling Christine he loved her, well that brought on more tears, it was an excellently done line, full of emotion, and Gerald did it perfectly.Well, I won't go on and on, seeing as you have other things to do. But I hope you are looking forward to the sequel as much as I am...",The Phantom of the Opera
1077,chaching1959,phantom was the best,10,30 March 2007,"The movie ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Gerard Butler was the best. I never knew what the ""Phantom of the Opera"" was about until I happened onto it one day a couple of months ago on HBO and Cinemax. I always thought it was a murder mystery type play and never bothered to see it as it didn't seem to interest me because it was in the 19th century and it was also ""Opera"". I watched part of it one day and didn't change the channel, it seemed ""okay"". About a month later, I watched it again, and then the singing words seemed to make sense, and I couldn't believe how seductive and erotic it was. The Phantom seduced me. I now have an office full of phantom memorabilia to which I have spent several hundreds of dollars. I can't get enough of the phantom. I of course went and bought the DVD and watch parts of it every single day. I am a married 48 year old woman, and have never done anything like this before in my life. Gerald Butler was the best!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1078,thecla2,Abandon thought and let the dream descend!,9,16 December 2004,"I admit I haven't watched the stage musical, I didn't even know how the story unfolds, or rather I knew the basic structure of the story from a TV movie that stared Charles Dance and Burt Lancaster. I knew some of the songs, they are all so famous that their melody is familiar if not recognizable. But I didn't know how the musical deals with the story in details, I didn't know the lyrics and how the tragedy plays out. The result: I was fighting with tears in the end and lost the battle! My goodness, I loved this film and I felt so deeply sorry for the Phantom! Such a twisted but tormented and tragic man... The dialogs/songs are excellent, the story beautiful, the images powerful. You will certainly be blown away, especially if, like me, you are not familiar with the musical at all.I also totally love Gerard Butler's performance, both as an actor and a singer. Two of my friends say that he's not that scary as the Phantom and that his voice is no match for Michael Crawford's, but I beg to differ. He just chooses to highlight the torment rather than the horror. As for his voice, yes, it's not tenor like, he wasn't an opera trained singer before, but being a committed actor, he makes up for it with such emotion that just listening to him in the soundtrack my eyes water (and no, I don't cry easily, believe me!). His voice has a hoarse tint, a masculine sound that is perfect for the Phantom in my opinion. I don't know if I'd have a different opinion on this film if I had watched the original stage musical or heard the original Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman recording fully (I have in part only). What I saw and heard in the film was beautiful, rich, engrossing, moving, thrilling. I can't recommend it enough... or stop the soundtrack playing in my mind (and cd-player)!",The Phantom of the Opera
1079,khorah,Perfect!,10,3 January 2005,"Beautiful music, beautiful visually,and beautiful actors. As close to perfect as I have ever seen. If you are not effected by this grand romantic story you are truly made out of stone. If you've seen the musical, you'll love it, because it's all there,and more. If you haven't,you couldn't pick a better way to be introduced. I have seen it twice already and at the last 30 min. there was not a sound in the theater, and at the end they applauded, loudly. I haven't seen this reaction to a movie in a long time.(And the theater was packed).GO SEE IT ! You will kick yourself if you miss it on the big screen.",The Phantom of the Opera
1080,sophiaxueyongle,Great Film!!!,9,6 May 2007,"I've seen the stage version in Shanghai when I was a pupil, and was deeply impressed by the marvelous music, but I was obviously too young to understand the story. Couldn't help dreaming of seeing it again either in China or in USA until I saw the film. It's nearly the same as the stage version except for several details such as the duel at the graveyard (that part was so weird that I rate the film 9/10). Emmy was pretty and intelligent in The Day After Tomorrow, but I haven't thought that she could sing. However, Gerry was even better. He learned to sing for the film, and his hard work was moving. His phantom was charming, passionate, desperate, sexy and sad. I've seen the film for more than 20 times to watch him. His Point of No Return was incredibly brilliant.",The Phantom of the Opera
1081,Susanm4-1,The Best movie of the Year!,10,25 December 2004,"I found myself in a state of mourning this December because of the notable absence of a new ""Lord of the Rings"" film. How would I fill that void of cinematic perfection and unparalleled fantasy and imagination? As the destruction of the one ring brought the second age of Middle-Earth to an end, I felt that with last year's release of ""Return of the King,"" an era of flawless epic film-making was likewise coming to a close.Then my salvation came in the form of a breathtaking, too-beautiful-for -words, heart-wrenching musical extravaganza. ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a divine example of how movies can affect us to the deepest reaches of our psyche, which remain stagnant and forgotten about throughout most of our day to day lives. This film stirred up a passion and eagerness in me that I never felt capable of before. Every single frame was exquisite and dreamlike, as if it had been pulled directly out of my favorite dream. There is barely any true dialogue spoken, but the many words that come through in song only heighten their impact and appeal. I get frustrated when I read reviews like Roger Ebert's that say the music is ""dreck."" Does anyone truly disagree that songs like ""The Music of the Night"" and ""All I ask of You"" are utterly mesmerizing and unforgettable? I saw ""Phantom..."" two days ago and every note of music has played through my head on a continuous wheel, all to my delight.The atmosphere and look of the film is enough to make you weak in the knees. The sets are probably best described as artsy-romantic-Gothic, but they never cross the line of seeming pretentious and corny like a bad romance novel. In actuality, the film hits every base right on target, which may be of importance to anyone who believes it takes itself too seriously or too lightly. Truly Emmy Rossum is a standout as Christine, and I dare anyone to name another actress (or woman for that matter) that could supply half the innocence, beauty and grace of this young lady. Likewise I could not imagine any other actor taking on the part of the Phantom with as much smoldering, saddened appeal and sexiness as Gerard Butler. And that voice! Hearing him belt out those powerful ballad-like words, or whispering soft seductions is truly intoxicating. Despite the rather large age difference, Rossum and Butler have a rare sparkling chemistry on screen that will leave you crying, or at least intensely grieved throughout their final moments together.I feel as though nothing I say will impart my true awe and passion towards this brilliant film. Please give it a try, and honestly I will really feel sorry for those people that watch it and remain unmoved. They are missing out on the very essence of movies, which to me means they (movies) take us away from the ordinary and mundane, showing us worlds and characters that spark imagination and delight. ""Phantom of the Opera"" makes me wistful for how much more beautiful the world could be.",The Phantom of the Opera
1082,bjbarfootatpenet,Major Disappointment,3,23 January 2005,"Although the roles of Christine, Raoul and Carlotta are well played, and these actors do a fine job, the overall production is a major disappointment to me. The role of Phantom is poorly cast and, since he is a major figure, it is very distracting. It seems they did exactly the opposite of what they needed to do to make it a fine film. It is one of those cases where less is better.In the stage production there were many 'over the top' features, but they worked because of the distance of the audience from the 'sets'. In the film there is more 'over the top' stage settings, etc., and they become the focus of the film, not the music. There is arguably no better music in a stage production today, but the movie misses the mark completely. With the advantages of film making, close ups, etc., the perfect opportunity for simplifying the staging, emphasizing the music, and not detracting from the elegance at all was nevertheless totally missed in this film. What a shame!Also there was some gratuitous vulgarity that did nothing for the show or me either.",The Phantom of the Opera
1083,bufysomers,Critics are wrong AGAIN,9,21 January 2005,"OK, I just saw this movie and I know the show pretty well. THe critics miss yet again. I don't even bother to read the ""professional"" reviews anymore. I am guessing they wanted some big effects movie or no music. I heard they called the music repetitive. Here is a concept critics. They are not going to write a bunch of new songs just to please you. The music seems repetitive because half the show is REPRISES of the earlier songs. It is done on purpose! It is a musical. FOr the most part a musical uses MUSIC to tell the story.In conclusion, the critics have no idea and are bashing a movie that should be a classic movie and IS a legendary stage show and one of the most classic novels ever written. Critics I stick my tongue out at you and give you a big raspberry.",The Phantom of the Opera
1084,torridsoul,Singing,9,23 June 2007,"The music is timeless. The story as well. Though the lead actress is lovely and her voice is very nice, it is not worthy of Christine. The high notes are spread and strained. Her lower register is much nicer. It is not terrible, it is in fact very good singing. It just isn't good enough for such a prestigious role. As someone who enjoys opera, I know there are many beautiful young opera stars that would have excelled at this role. To hear some real operatic perfection listen to Renee Fleming or Dawn Upshaw. As for the rest of the cast, I thought Minnie Driver was superb and her vocal double was quite appropriate. ""Think of Me"" will always be my favorite Andrew Lloyd Webber composition. For an interesting comparison, try to see Phantom, the version completed before Andrew Lloyd Webber, but debuted after so it has not gained anywhere near the recognition his has. It was written by Arthur Kopit and composer Maury Yeston. It is quite different, and can be entertaining to compare!",The Phantom of the Opera
1085,phantom31,Very Enjoyable,8,26 December 2004,"After having listened to the original Broadway CD in preparation for the movie, I have to say aside from a few minor details such as some parts being spoken rather than sung that I was pleased with how close all the music was. Emmy Rossum is wonderful as Christine with a beautiful voice. Patrick Wilson is fine as Raoul. Now on to the Phantom.... I had never seen Gerald Butler before and I know he trained a long time for the singing but on some songs his voice is a little rough. I am not making a big deal because I enjoyed the movie and am a big Phantom fan. Most of his songs were very well done and I am not going to make the used to death comparison between Gerald and Michael Crawford because there is none. Two completely different singers and true Phantom fans have to break the mold of Crawford and Sarah Brightman, as wonderful as they are. One other thing that sort of disappointed me was the Phantom's lack of ugliness. I know JS wanted a youthful look for the Phantom but when he is better looking then Raoul it takes some of the drama out of it for me. Especially the final kissing scene which in my opinion is the most dramatic part of the story. But that will not deter me from seeing it again. Overall very well done. Enjoy Phantom fans!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1086,lpparker,extraordinary,10,2 January 2005,"This is one of the most emotionally involving movies I've ever seen. While the beginning seemed a bit rushed and slightly disjointed, it developed into a magnificently told story. The sets and costumes were lavish and elegant but never distracting, moody but never too dark. I'm an avidly enthusiastic yet critical film buff, and while this one has its flaws, its overall power far outweighs them all. There wasn't a single part that was played out of tune with the role. Miranda Richardson was wonderfully underplayed but unfortunately underused. Her French accent was on the mark, and her mysterious knowledge and authority entirely believable. As Carlotta, Minnie Driver was a very unusual choice, but the actress' comedic skills proved the perfect pitch for the diva. She wisely did not overplay the outrageous antics or ham it up, but provided a necessary amount of humor. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was a performance that I appreciated more the second time around. He is no milksop, and I tended to think of Raoul. He is a decent, brave, if slightly bland, hero. Wilson is excellent, natural, and a good balance against the Phantom. Playing Christine, the then-17-year-old Emmy Rossum is a talent only finally being realized in film. While her voice hasn't the power of a more mature star, it is perfectly appropriate and fitting for the part of Ms. Daae. Much of her work in the film is having to react to others singing to her. It's a difficult thing to do convincingly and interestingly. Her expressions are golden, mercurial, awe-struck, enticed, fascinated, enthralled, and seductive. She is truly a young woman coming into her own as Christine. As the Phantom himself, I do not have enough good words about Gerard Butler. He is magnificent, masculine, raw, desperate, commanding, and heartbreaking. His voice has not the polish of so many stage stars' portrayal, but that seems so infinitely appropriate. He's just a man. He himself is not an opera star. His voice is so emotionally raw and rich that it's impossible to not be drawn into his every word.SPOILER-- I must comment on the finale scene, THE POINT OF NO RETURN. It is one of the most powerful, extraordinary scenes I've ever witnessed, and goes down as one of my favorites in all of filmdom. I cannot even adequately express my emotions for it, there are so many. The rush enthralls you when Phantom appears onstage in his own opera, singing to entice Christine to return to him forever. Her reactions are among the sexiest I've ever seen. Frightened at first, she's entirely drawn into his inviting masculine command, and begins to sing back with emboldened sensuality. The audience is enraptured. As they crescendo on the catwalk bridge, my heart breaks for the Phantom as he literally sings his heart out, pleading with her to love him. That's all he asks of her. All I wanted her to do was pick him. The end is so emotionally painful and then, in a wordless touch, sublimely heartbreaking, that I nearly cried. I have not cried at a movie since I was seven years old. Even though I'd seen the show, I knew the story, it has been one of my favorites, this film left me exhausted, exhilarated, touched, and feeling the weight of a tragedy that I felt was practically my own.WATCH IT, that's all I ask of you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1087,wdavis-2,Better than Broadway!,10,4 January 2012,"""Sumptuous!"" was my bride's spontaneous description of this monumentally underrated movie (we're watching again on television, though we have the DVD). Gerard Butler is surprisingly able to pull this off, musically and dramatically, and Emmy Rossum (16 when she filmed this! Now in Shameless--yuck!) is not only convincing but has a rich melodious voice. We saw the Broadway production from the middle of the 3rd row in 2006 and we both prefer the movie for both drama and music.I'm usually a sucker for live entertainment, and I do slightly prefer the original cast voices of Crawford and Brightman (my wife prefers this version), but we agree that this is the best playing out of this Musical currently available.",The Phantom of the Opera

1089,phaaidra,below,10,25 August 2007,"The story of the Phantom is the story of Man: a tortured creature-imprisoned between two worlds by his own uncertainties, he can only reach salvation throw love. The beginning introduces us a character who acts like a god- watching people from above, sending them signs showing them his will, rewarding and punishing, but first of all, writing the script, writing destinies. The world is a stage for him and he couldn't be a part of it; he seems cursed to live in the hell of his solitude. But the curse can only be broken by prayer. An angel who thinks he's a god can only create a false reality; he's an illusionist because the inside world unshared with anyone is an illusion. The world as a masquerade is the only one he can live in because it gives him the illusion that he can hide his dark side. Once the curse is broken by the kiss in the end, he has no dark side to hide anymore and he will remain uncovered. The fallen Angel of Music is disfigured by his own pride that is finally defeated. The couple cannot exist in reality, but love has changed him forever making him strong and capable of noble gestures. In the end he became powerful by not using his power. He doesn't have to use terror because he is not weak anymore. He accepts to do the will of the one he loves even if this would break his heart. But this miracle is possible only because she anticipated it when she kissed him. He became good because she believed it first, because she had the power to see the prince behind the beast, which made her the beauty winning his heart in such a way that his selfish love before the kiss became self-giving love. Now that she proved swhe loves him without a mask(which no one did before)he doesn't need to manipulate her will anymore and lets her go winning her heart forever. Now, having the consciousness of his own value-which is not terror, but love, he is ready to leave his solitude:the end of the film suggests he will not remain alone for the rest of his life throw Meg's gesture of taking his mask. The couple is not a valid formula-it's somehow a punishment for pretending to be someone else.But his great sins are repayed by his great suffering. His defeat is actually his victory because the point is not whether she chooses to stay physically with him or not, but spiritually. So their love remains pure forever, raising them both to heavens. The couple is not valid in this world, but in another one. I have to say that all this meaning was revealed for me by the movie and not by the book which is sometimes ridiculous. The movie brought o lot more realism into the story and has turned it from grotesque into sublime. I only appreciate the book because it inspired a film that reveals art's greatest themes-love and death- in a way no other film did before.",The Phantom of the Opera
1090,e_b_thornton,The phantom of the opera is there inside the celluloid,9,7 January 2005,"Andrew Lloyd's theater masterpiece Phantom of the opera has been transformed into a magnificent movie by veteran director Joel Schumacher. Many people has doubt whether the director who usually make action movies can make this musical. The result he did it perfectly.In the acting department we can see the raising star Emmy rossum as Christine, the opera singer who has wonderful voice which she got from singing with the phantom. Emmy rossum did a great job acting as a confused girl who has to choose between her old friend who she likes and the phantom who gave her talents. Emmy rossum has received a globe nomination but to get the Oscar nomination is rather tough considering many actresses who did a wonderful job in their movies this year. Nevertheless this talented young 18 year old girl will eventually get good roles in the future and get awards and quite possibly Oscar. Other actors who did a great job is Gerald butler who played the phantom he made the character so powerful and quite possibly can make the audience pity on him. Minnie Driver did a good job portraying an arrogant opera actress who can't act or sing. Can't imagine the good girl in Good will hunting did an opposite role in her character in good will.The minus point of this movie is the location they shoot in. As an audience I feel tired to see 85% of the scenes in a stage where the lighting is so obvious they were in the stage. Maybe the movie needs a balance between the stage and outdoor shooting. Maybe the budget isn't enough.One of the great things about this movie is obviously the music and the place they put it on. The first opening music in the old opera house turning color from black and white is the theme from the theater itself. A wonderful unexpected music placing, similar to the opening of star wars.This movie certainly will get Oscar nomination in the tech specs; costume, cinematography, makeup, and other art design category.

I would love to see what Baz Luhrmann could have done with this story. The costumes were amazing and the sets good; only occasionally did they seem not too convincing. I thought Gerald Butler was fine but maybe a bit too handsome. Truth is he was more appealing than her suitor which made it the outcome (for me) not as acceptable as previous productions. Emily Rossum is lovely and hopefully she will do more films. I miss seeing musicals on the big screen. Wish we had more visionaries that could bring us more Moulin Rouges and Chicagos.

Emmy Rossum was ethereal in both her appearance & her glorious voice. I patronize more than 24 productions a year, & her clear & magnificent voice left me awe-struck. Patrick Wilson, as Raoul, has the same clarity & elegance to his voice that transports you to a wondrous realm. Gerard Butler's sensual & sensitive portrayal of the phantom was perfection personified. What Gerard might have lacked in the classical & professional (singing) training of his two lead actors, he more than made up for in his rendering of the phantom. I only agreed with one critic when they said, "" What red-blooded woman would not choose the phantom over Raoul even knowing the physical flaws behind the mask?"" In the past, the phantom's disfigurement & the crimes he committed were magnified & emphasized. Gerard understood the phantom's tormented existence both past & present, & the voyeur is faced with the realization that the phantom is just a man.. a man with a soul encased in sadness & torment. The audience somehow forgives & momentarily forgets, the murderous acts committed by the so-called monster & helplessly walks away feeling true compassion for the man with all his imperfections.Bravo to Joel Shumacher & encore to Andrew Lloyd Webber for his unearthly ability to translate beauty into song & lyrics.

I really wish I could have seen it again! I thoroughly enjoyed the film and, not being able to compare it to the stage show, must say that it is not necessary to - the film is excellent in its own right. The film is hard to sum up in one word - it is full of good and evil, light and dark, subtlety and extravagance, romance and seductiveness... An absolute delight!

I agree that the voices possibly weren't the best I've ever heard, but everyone managed OK.Emily Rossum is a difficult one. Well-acted, certainly. Her voice is very pretty and I felt it suited the Christine character - but at the same time, far from the best versions of her pieces that I've ever heard.Overall, I enjoyed it immensely. I did get left with the same old feeling though - that the Phantom is very much the victim of the piece and Christine is a shallow little gold digger who transfers her affections to whoever seems to be offering her the most at the time!

1096,renskevanengelen,"Stage show is much better, but the movie is a nice substitute",7,22 March 2008,"I love the phantom of the opera concept. I read Gaston Leroux's book as well as Susan Kay's and I've seen the stage show twice in London (I live in Holland so I can't go to the show too often :wink:). When I heard there was a movie based on the stage show I bought it straight away. I loved the movie, but I must say you really can't compare it to the stage show. The show is so overwhelming and so beautifully sung. OK, they sing quite well in the movie too, but when you've seen the stage show you'll probably know what I'm talking about. But well, the movie is a good substitute since the stage show is very expensive. What I did notice while watching the movie is that it has a lot of imperfections. Like Christine not wearing any make-up in her dressing room but a few scenes later she suddenly has smokey eyes. Or the fact that the skin around Erik's (Phantom) eyes is also disfigured. But when he's wearing the mask the skin that you can see through the holes in the mask is perfectly normal.",The Phantom of the Opera
1097,balanced-chick,Brilliant!,10,8 January 2008,"I loved this movie. It was visually stunning, the songs were wonderful (well, it's Andrew Lloyd Webber after all!) and the singing was lovely. As for the acting, that was fantastic. I though Gerard Butler as the Phantom did an especially brilliant job. I'm rather annoyed that Emmy Rossum won some awards (for her acting as Christine) but Mr Butler didn't. Ms Rossum did a great job but Mr Butler had a more difficult role and played it with incredible sensitivity and intensity.The three stars in the film had really good voices, especially Emmy Rossum. In fact the music, especially her singing, has converted me to actually liking opera I think! Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul, also has a very nice voice. (Sometimes I think he has a bit too much vibrato but that's being picky. His voice is actually very smooth and lovely.) I've heard a couple of people saying they thought Gerard Butler's voice left a little (very little) to be desired, but although I understand why they say that I don't really agree. His voice might not be as good as Raoul's in the conventional way but he puts so much expression into it that I wouldn't want anyone else in the role. In most of the parts in the movie where his voice doesn't sound 100% beautiful the reason is that they are parts where the Phantom is angry or upset, and Mr Butler sings accordingly. I would probably him a 10/10 for his voice (and definitely a 10/10 for his acting).The cinematography, special effects and so on are also really good. The story is of course a classic, and I can see why -- it just drew me in and wouldn't let me go even once the credits were rolling. It's very passionate and sad in a beautiful kind of way.People who aren't into musicals, opera, or ""gothic romances"" (as somebody called it) might not like The Phantom of the Opera, but go see it with an open mind and you may well be surprised. I highly recommend this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

It would have been a disaster in casting had John Travolta won the role of the Phantom, having Gerard as the phantom added the air of mystery the film makers said they were hoping to create.The hottest scene that literally sizzled on the screen was one of the later numbers ""Past the point of no return"" The line Emmy sings ""When will the flames at last consume us?"" was very apt. She does a wonderful job as the wide-eyed innocent Christine.The film plays like an erotic tale of moral and sexual awakening. Recommended to Musical lovers everywhere.",The Phantom of the Opera
1099,myager,Schumacher does it again.,3,14 December 2004,"Well, just this weekend I was lucky enough to attend the 24-hour Butt-Numb-a-thon 6 festival here in Austin and we caught a screening of Phantom. I've been around theatre, and musical theatre for several years, I'm studying theatre here at the University of Texas, and I really wanted to see this movie work. Sadly however, and somewhat unsurprisingly, Schumacher has crafted another complete and total misfire. Phone Booth was not what it could have been, Tigerland was pretty overrated, he single-handedly sunk the Batman franchise (although Chris Nolan will probably prove otherwise with Batman Begins), and his Phantom of the Opera is a muddled piece of shallow spectacle to which he could not seem to bring any cohesion. The set and costume designs can be fairly good at points, but most set pieces are far too artificial, especially the knick-knacks in the Phantom's lair (what is with that mannequin?), and there is never a decision made one way or another if they wanted a cinematic or a decidedly theatrical look. And granted, I'm not a huge fan of the musical, or Weber in particular, so if he's your cup of tea you might very well enjoy it. The acting is not great. Not terrible, but not great. Emmy Rossum does the best she can given some cardboard acting partners and some atrocious synching with the voice track. Gerard Butler is a massive disappointment as the Phantom. There just seemed to be a lack of chemistry on all accounts when it came to the two leads and the love interest, Raoul. Also not a help is some truly terrible choreography (Masquerade and the Don Juan sequence, in particular). Minnie Driver comes out looking okay; she's got a surprising set of pipes. Anyway, overall I'm extremely disappointed. The melodrama of everything makes the few moments of dramatic potential turn unintentionally hilarious, and nobody involved in the project seemed to be on the same page. More than anyone, I blame Schumacher, who again proves to have an unequaled gift of ruining films that really could have been great in other hands. I can't believe the Golden Globes have jumped behind it, but I'm just one man. So, if you're intrigued, give it a shot, but don't say I didn't warn you.",The Phantom of the Opera

There was too much singing and they were long! I couldn't bare to watch anymore.I have a few questions though and if someone could answer them for me I would appreciate it.1. Whats with the black & white sections? 2. Is the Phantom real or a ghost? 3. Did Christine feel something for the Phantom? Why did she kiss him towards the end? Why did he get angry when she did? 4. What ever happened to the little girl who helped him escape? Is she the lady in the present, the one explaining his history? 5. What couldn't she love him? I thought the Phantom was better than the other guy. I kind of wish she would've fell in love with him instead. 6. In the end what happens to him? Please answer someone. If the answers interest me, I might reconsider watching it properly.Thanks",The Phantom of the Opera

Not now and I'm shocked by that. I've never really been either an opera fan or a fan of musicals in general. I didn't see it in the cinema but I did go with friends to the stage show 3 weeks ago. I was so impressed I went out the next day and hunted down a copy of the D.V.D. which wasn't easy I might add. I expected to be a little disappointed but loved the story so much I thought I'd take a chance on it fulfilling the need I had to watch the show over and over again and it's done that very well. I've watched it almost daily since I bought it ,listen to the soundtrack in the car constantly and still have not got enough of it. My 4 sons aged between 15 and 27 all love it and want to see the stage show and all of us sing along with it and have the fantastic songs stuck in our heads. I don't know how anyone could compare Gerard Butler's amazing emotional gut-wrenching performance with Michael Crawfords foppish sounding performance. I have both soundtracks and much prefer the one from the movie. I know I'll never tire of watching and listening to this wonderful piece of work. Bravo Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher. Brilliant in every way. Thank you.",The Phantom of the Opera

And when I went to the theatre I thought it couldn't possible get close to the ""real thing"". I was in AWE as I left the theatre. It was amazing. My two best friends and I sang the score the entire way home and we can't stop bragging about it to our friends! They were even able to include original parts of the script that Broadway cannot(behind stage). I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you don't like ""Opera""...go anyway its not your typical Opera!As for technical stuff. Having worked in theatre myself, I can tell you that the costumes and music were sublime, they made it seem as though you are watching this on a stage not a screen, and for you ladies out there...the Phantom is Hott!",The Phantom of the Opera

However, when i saw this movie I instantly fell in love with the story and characters.

We saw it the first time in LA with Michael Crawford as the lead. He was unbelievably good! His voice ""live"" is much better than on the CD's or tapes that were recorded with him. Anyway - the movie version is fantastic! It's actually a bit better in that it adds just a touch of dialog that clarifies the movie's plot. We took our two daughters (10 and 13) and they fell in LOVE with the whole movie. They were singing the songs for days. I can't recommend this more highly. I can't imagine why in the world people would review it badly. They just must not like musicals. Thankfully, the movie stays true to the musical nature of the stage play. Go see it.

1105,hannible_king,Good Movie BUT.....,7,16 September 2008,"The phantom of the opera, is one of my all time favorite plays/books. This movie has been done so many times it is ridiculous. The 2004 adaption is visually stunning, Emmy Rosum's Christine (even though stated by another user voice was lip synced same with the other leads other then Minnie Driver) was amazing, but she pales in comparison to Sarah Brightman's Christine. Emmy Rosum defiantly stole the movie, and made it better in my view. I will state this Flat out Gerard Butler is No Michael Crawford. Gerard Didn't even lend his voice to the role. Who's ever voice is singing for the phantom, it lacks the passion and emotion that Crawford had when he was the Phantom. This newest phantom's voice in the movie is too forced and grated on my ears like nails on a chalkboard. Don't get me wrong butler is a good actor (See 300) But his Phantom was sub-par at best. I like this movie, I don't Love it, it takes a lot for me to love a movie. It is directed and produced well and the script was translated to screen well, the voice casting could have been done better though. The visual effects are amazing even though you can see the Crew in one scene.",The Phantom of the Opera
1106,thomasfunch,Genius turned to madness!!!,4,17 January 2005,"In the movie, Madam Giry tells to Raoul the story of the Phantom. Raoul responses with this line ""Genious turned to madness"". This was the exact feeling i met when i saw this movie. Andrew Lloyd Webber has written some of the finest pieces of Musical Theatre ever, and even made a couple of good movies of them. Phantom of the Opera works fine as a Hollywood movie, if you like this type of musical. Unlike Evita this has a huge operatic feeling in the music, and i don't think people can take it. In the biggest movie theatre here in Denmark, it is running on their smallest screen, and the 144 seated room is only half full. If that much.I am a professional Musical Actor in Denmark, and i can honestly say that Phantom, Giry and Firman has very little technic to work their voices with. Phantom uses very little support, sometimes none. And the basic technic in singing is Support. Almost anything he sang was insecure, he couldn't keep the pitch (the tone), and he didn't know how to show feeling with his voice. He had good facial expressions, followed by a voice that's sound like a school teacher singing ""Old McDonald had a Farm"" It was just terrible.",The Phantom of the Opera

I wish I could say I saw it on the big screen but I didn't give it a second look it was only when I saw it on DVD that I realised what I had missed.The casting was excellent, Emmy Rossum I didn't recognise from A Day After Tomorrow she has a really good voice, the costumes and additional songs for the film presentation were really good.

The costumes were from the period of time that the movie depicts and I thought the singing and musical scores were so wonderful, I was spellbound.

1109,chocolatemooo,"nice costumes, not much talent in them.",2,29 December 2004,"The Phantom of the Opera was to say the least entertaining. not in a good way. sadly, i can never get those three hours of my precious life back. This film not only contained no acting of any value, but the songs were trite and the lyrics contained simple, laughable rhymes. The phantom of the opera screamed half the time on the low notes, and someone else's voice was spliced in for the high notes. in places, this movie tried to be quirky (reminiscent of a bad version of Moulin Rouge in some spots), but failed miserably ending up creepy and confusing. not creepy in the way that Phantom is supposed to be. not suspenseful. creepy in the ""whats going ON"" sense.for instance, the monkey. It was meant to be significant in some way (?) but was just confusing and weird, especially when they focused on it so much at the end. Also, at one point, one of the managers bit a shoe. i have no idea why. Back to the songs. The music was formulaic, and was trying to manipulate your emotions, although the orchestra played well. being a violinist, i appreciated that. ""key"" words were repeated twice in about ten different spots. it was amusing. for instance, ""SILENCE! silence..."" To Joel Shoemaker: for your own sake, i hope you turn out a great movie some day. take some classes.Baz Luhrman should have been involved with this movie. It would have been great.Something else that bothered me: Carlotta was supposed to be Italian. Minnie driver was using something that sounded like a Cuban accent. I'm not quite sure what it actually was, but it was not Italian.The worst musical numbers included electric guitar and synthesizer blended in to the organ.I realize, looking back, when i was tricked in to attending this over the top Las Vegas extravaganza that the previews never showed an actual clip of the movie, just stills of the beautiful images and costumes. yes, the costumes were beautiful. its sad that they did not spend their budget on more important things, like, i don't know, maybe hiring good actors...just a thought.in conclusion, this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it did entertain me the entire time.redeeming qualities: the costumes, and the quality of the orchestra (that is not to say the orchestral score)",The Phantom of the Opera

It is a good sample of musical films it was a lost genre When watching Tomb raider 2 , i never imagined Gerard Butler would be as talented as in the phantom of the opera. we will miss Emmy Rossum in the academy awards, although Catalina Sandino Moreno was also great i think Emmy deserved it better.

1112,gilmanc,Pretty good,7,30 January 2005,"I just got back from seeing it a second time.Without a doubt, Gerard Butler was totally miscast. The character of the Phantom would have been better served with a singer who can act, rather than an actor who can sorta sing. This is one of the quintessential roles for a male singer, and it wasn't done justice.Otherwise, the Phantom was written as a much weaker character in the movie. Nothing scary about this guy compared to the great Count Raoul. In fact, as the movie went on he lost his sympathy just for being such a whiner.Overall though, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver make the movie go. They by themselves are enough reason to go see it. Add in Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, and Jennifer Ellison as Meg and it's a very entertaining movie with great effects.

Anyone ever experience that? You adore the idea, enjoy the characters, but you despise the way it turns out. That's what I feel when I see Raoul and Christine sail away, leaving the poor Phantom to wallow in self-pity. I mean, really? He did so much for her, and you writers are just going to treat that like garbage? Amazing songs, wonderful cast, crappy end. Sorry if that's harsh, but it's my opinion.And this Raoul guy. The Victome de Changy. I have to agree with The Phantom on this one. 'Insolent boy, Ignorant fool'. Patrick, you're a great actor, but I don't like Raoul. You can sing, yeah, but the hair....urgh. And you took Christine away from The Phantom. I am pro-Erik & Christine. Luff them.Madame Giry. Wonderful past. Love it, love it, love it. But how in all that is good and sane is she still alive and Christine dead?! Christine was 16, and Giry was what, 30 something? If Christine is dead, she should be, too. You break apart Erik and Christine, then you defy the laws of nature? Unless Christine was murdered or something, I doubt your age-death cycle is accurate.The Lair. Beautiful setup! It's just so peaceful and alluring. But I have a question...Why are Christine's stockings off when she awakens? What, did the Phantom decide to take them off her while she was out? And how long was she asleep there? The book say 2 weeks. They never really indicate how long she was there, but by the way the other characters act to her absence, it seems it was a while. But who sleeps for 2 weeks straight? And who would worry if someone went missing for one night? Well, I'd worry, but so many people making such a big deal of it...Explain that.And the lapse between operas. In reality it would take a very long time to rehearse and present them. At least 4 or 5 days. But you make it seem like there's a new one every night. Hmm? Well, I can see my review is turning into a flood of questions and no answers.

Although I am partial to the story, being a Phan for over a decade, the movie did not disappoint my very high expectations. The acting is superb. Emmy really delivers as the young soprano, as does Patrick Wilson as her lover. Gerard Butler, yes, Gerard Butler, really impressed me as the Phantom. He brought fiery passion to the character, and yes, ladies and gentlemen, the man can sing. His ""Music of the Night"" is the best I've ever seen performed, and it's not even his best scene. Carlotta, the managers, Madame Giry and her daughter Meg -- they are all impressively portrayed in the movie. The music is outstanding, even more overwhelmingly beautiful in surround sound than on stage in Her Majesty's Theatre in London. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a must see this year and next year (for those whose city it hasn't been released in or want to see it again and again, like me), and there is no question that this film is going to win major awards in the spring and be remembered as one of the best musicals, and perhaps, movies, of all time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1119,johnnyjetwad,Phantom Still Breathes Without Heartbeat,7,21 December 2004,"It's difficult to watch one of your favorite stage productions as a film and not compare rather than judge the film solely on it's own merits. Phantom is beautifully shot and the production is exquisite. The opening scene in which the Opera Populaire is transformed to it's former glory is one of the most thrilling moments I can remember in recent film history. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful although a little nasal at times. Minnie Driver steals all of her scenes appropriately as the diva Carlotta, sadly the problem lies with the male leads. Like the entire production, they were beautiful to look at but not a lot there. Gerard Butler would definitely be invited to leave the mask off and sleep on my right any night, but his singing was just adequate. His performance was neutral. Butler for me didn't give the phantom a soul that I cared about and he didn't seem intimidating enough that I despised or feared him. Patrick Wilson who I was very fond of in HBO's ""Angels In America"" last year was a disappointment here as well. I sat forward ready for my heart to race and my toes to curl when ""All I Ask of You"" began. Unfortunately Wilson's soft and uncommanding voice turned it into background music for the set and snow falling around them. ""Masquerade"" the big production number halfway through the film is uninspired. The dancers move together but the choreography pales compared to the costumes and the sets the movement should be jumping out of. Phantom succeeds most where it has always succeeded, the music. The orchestrations and lyrics haven't been toyed with much and the music sweeps around you and propels you through the story. So even without the soul of the Phantom and the heartbeat of the live performance the film did leave me smiling and humming throughout the disappointments and out of the theatre.",The Phantom of the Opera

Emmy Rossum is gorgeous as Christine, she really has a beauty that passes off as Victorian. Her voice may not be as good as the stage Christines, because she's an untrained soubrette- but the acting and her looks make up for that, that's for sure. Gerard Butler makes an excellent Phantom, and shows his passionate and wild side, without making him look weird. His vocals were charming and thrilling, as was his acting. I loved his ""music of the night"". Patrick Wilson is a wonderful singer, his lyric tenor voice makes the character likable. His acting is good overall, although he could've been more passionate in a few scenes. Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver and Jennifer Ellison were brilliant in their roles. Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow were funny, almost hilarious as the managers, Victor McGuire was better than the stage Piangis.The music is so beautiful, that it stuns you, it moves you, it locks you on your screen and makes you want to keep watching it till the end.

The prototypical story arc of ""the monster and or freak falling in hapless love of the innocent and immaculate maiden"" is overplayed at this point. Characters seem to be filling in required stereotypical roles,""the beast"", ""the beauty"", ""the arrogant suitor"", but have little real growth or dimension.Ultimately, the movie sets itself up to be a piece of true dramatic tragedy, but fails to deliver a truly poignant view of anything.

1122,Wings42,"Critics be damned, my wife and I loved it.",8,24 December 2005,"Unfortunately, we read all the bad reviews and skipped it in theaters. Thanks to HBO, we finally got to see the wonderful film adaptation of one of the great recent musicals.The sets and costumes were superb, capturing what I imagine Paris and the Paris Opera House were like in the last quarter of the 19th century.Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, had a weaker voice than Michael Crawford's Phantom, but his singing was at least adequate and his pitifully wounded malevolence was convincing. Emmy Rossum has a gorgeous voice, is beautiful, and wonderfully acted the character of Christine. Her paramour, Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson, also sang wonderfully and played his role adequately. However,I feel that the real chemistry was between Christine and the Phantom, rather than with her and Raoul. The other characters were excellent, in a musical comedy/operetta sort of way, especially Minnie Driver as Carlotta.I simply disagree with all the critics who maintained that this film adaptation was calculated and without passion. We were often deeply moved watching this film, and we are very critical viewers. My wife and I are opera buffs and we love musical comedy and operetta. Rereading so many negative reviews, I believe that most of those critics don't care for or have much knowledge of music or musicals or operetta. If you love musical theater, ignore the bad reviews and treat yourself to the movie, ""The Phantom of the Opera.""",The Phantom of the Opera
1123,linn-a-hedberg,An insult to the viewer,1,21 July 2010,"I'm not going to dwell about the most obvious mistakes, such as the over-directing, the waste of money on all-too-costly (and plastic) sets, the ""modernization"" of the soundtrack (a very unfortunate idea with an even more unfortunate result), the attempt to make soft porn, the mistake of placing it 1870 (why not use the stable year of 1789 while they're at it...) and everything else that pretty much makes this movie a 2,5 hours instruction video about everything that is wrong with Hollywood.No, the major flaws of this piece are in the very core of the matter - the story, the characters and their performances.We should remember the Phantom as one of the most intricate figures of modern time, a creature half man, half living corpse, whose distorted face and body is revenged in a supernatural voice ""which was loud as thunder or soft as angels' voices, at will"". In the same manner, his mind also has the great range between high and low, from the most exquisite genius to the warped madman, and his soul is capable of both callous cruelty and sublime compassion. Even though we are supposed to pity him from time to time, we should never be made to forget that he is a lost soul who will never be quite human.It then goes without saying that anyone who portrays him on the screen should, first of all, be able to sing and, just as important, actually be a rather non-attractive man. The miscast Gerald Butler fails in both aspects, with no musical training and a face which, even without mask, is better looking than 99 out of 100 men in this world. It is of course the responsibility of the director and, to be fair, Butler is giving an effort within his own range, but has not understood the nature of his character and fails therefore to display the vulnerable madness of, for example, Michael Crawford (whether you like his voice or not, there is no denying that he is one of the most heartfelt and emotional actors of our time).Christine is in the same way left to be nothing but a humiliating shadow of the girl from the book. The Christine we knew was indeed inexperienced due to her youth, but had more the character of a young person who suddenly finds herself caught in a complicated and dangerous situation in which her inner strength and moral convictions are put to the test. Trying to save herself, spare the Phantom and protect the clueless Raoul from his own naivety, she is faced with decisions where she finally, in an act of pity, let herself fall pray for the Phantom's obsession. It is clear from the book that she was mesmerized by his voice and moved by his sad fate, but she was never sexually attracted or romantically interested in him. Neither did he represent a father figure for her (a common misconception) - although he evoke in her a memory of a favorite childhood-legend, frequently told by her father.Who then came with the idea to transfer her to one of the most stupid, vapid, weak and stereotypical female lead (and there are plenty to choose from in that category) the screen has ever seen? We are asked to care about an obviously retarded girl who without any willpower freely goes between two men depending on which one calls to her loudest at the moment. The characterization in this film is neither fair nor interesting and is made worse by the inadequate performance of Emmy Rossum, who is taking the art of failing to a new low. Where Butler at least tried to make something out of his role, Rossum displays no effort or will to give Christine a personality or even mobility. (In fact, she doesn't even take the effort to change her facial expression throughout the movie.) It is clear that someone told her the lie that if you are just beautiful enough you don't have to bother to do any acting (if such a stone face can indeed be considered beautiful - I suspect that those who finds her attractive in this movie are mostly males whose every romantic encounters have been with an inflatable doll, since that is what she is made to resemble).We are then coming to Raoul, the third part of the threesome. Raoul has been constantly criticized for being the most inept excuse of a hero in ages, which is a very fair observation given that he was never supposed to be a hero at all. In fact, the original character is a sympathetic anti-hero who is just as young and inexperienced as Christine but who is yet willing to sacrifice whatever he can out of love for her (which he ends up doing in a rather clumsy way). But most of the time he is confused, lovesick and rather whining - far from the sword fighting savor on the white horse.It is virtually impossible to give a review of Patrick Wilson's performance in this movie due to his anonymous role. I suppose he sings well enough to suit a musical and can pass as an actor. There is no charisma or much of a screen presence, but then again, how could it be different with Raoul? If a script is deficient, it takes a whole lot of heart to compensate and unfortunately this movies was made with focus on style rather than story. This could have been a chance to improve and make the stage version more complete, instead the audience is left cheated both of their time, money and expectations.

First Batman forever/Batman & Robin and now this!! I really love musical-films but ""Phantom"" with latino-rhythms ? NO WAY ! Do I have to mention that there is no one in this movie who is able to match the stage-actors ? Gerard Butler sounds like he has a bad cold and Minnie Driver.....ah.... let's not talk about Minnie Driver. But what is really sad is the work of A.Lloyd-Webber in this movie. He took his great music and turned it into something really awful. He destroyed his own beautiful creation.""Evita"" was a good example on how to adapt a musical for the big screen.

1125,iamgollum2002,Definitely worth a try,8,19 December 2004,"went to watch phantom of the opera movie today and i feel that i have to write an entry on it. i never got the chance to see the stage musical though i wish one day i could, so comparatively i can only touch a little bit of the singing as i've heard of the original cast recording. poto is quite a big thing for me in a way because it is the first musical that i've ever listened to, i bought the original cast recording on impulse. i didn't know back then (it was 1995) that it's a huge thing a i know nothing of musical what so ever. nevertheless i am impressed with the songs and i liked it instantly so watching the movie i can't help but to compare the movie and the recording.i was quite disappointed with gerard butler's singing. and i was especially disappointed with the title song because personally for me michael crawford's rendition was much much better. i didn't quite like gerard's vocal quality. however i was pleasantly surprised with emmy rossum and patrick Wilson's vocal. i think as christine and raoul their perfect. one of my best moment in the movie was when they were singing 'all i ask of you'. i had tears welling up in my eyes. however to i must say that somewhere half way through the movie i did warm up to gerard's singing and i can see why they casted him and emmy and patrick in this.acting wise i had nothing to complain although i kind of agree with one review i read online that the phantom should at least be somewhat older than christine and raoul. after all the phantom is somewhat a father figure to christine. that said however, i still think they did a pretty commendable job and i especially liked minnie driver as carlotta. it added a pretty much needed break from a rather sombre movie, i think. i had nothing much to complain about the direction either. the editing was nice. the choreography was wonderful.i especially like the use of colour (reminded me of moulin rouge somehow). it's nice that some lines were spoken to the music rather than sung as in the recording. some of the new materials that andrew lloyd webber composed for the movie did jive together with the original material, though i feel it is not as good as the old stuff.i was really looking forward the prologue as i've read some supposedly original draft about the treatment for the movie and i loved it. the phantom make up was OK i guess, just nice: not too grotesque and not too 'plain' and i did feel for him towards the end of the movie. if i didn't actually fought real hard to contained my tears i would probably have cried my eyes out. overall it is great movie and i will definitely watch it again. will it convert non-musical lover after watching this i'm not so sure but everyone should definitely give this movie a try. bravo bravissimo!",The Phantom of the Opera
1126,kymimcniven,Review for the Phantom of the Opera,10,20 September 2010,"Kym McNiven 9-15-2010 Film Review Film Studies 6th PeriodThe 2004 motion picture The Phantom of the Opera definitely found a place in my heart. The acting and music combined, the costumes and the brightness of the set are absolutely stunning. When I viewed the film for the first time, I was immediately hooked. I had heard about this extraordinary movie when my older sister told me about it, and it sounded superb. I love movies, and The Phantom of the Opera sounded like one which was not worth passing up. So, I thought I would watch it simply to see for myself if this film was worth watching, and it was indeed. Everything about this film drew me to it. I cannot criticize a film of this quality.In my opinion, the acting and singing of all of the stars is sublime, but one actor's talent stunned me completely as I viewed this film for the first time. Gerard Butler possessing the role of the Phantom definitely makes him stand out. The way he shows the passion and the emotion which resides within this extreme character is astonishing. The Phantom's emotions are so strong and passionate that he can't help expressing himself the way he does. Since this film is a musical, the Phantom expresses his feelings through song throughout the entire film. Each song contains a different emotion which Butler portrays very thoroughly while singing as the Phantom. If the Phantom is doleful, his voice possesses a doleful tone; if he is livid, his voice is so as well. Since the Phantom's attitude is antagonized and sad in this film, no blissful tunes escape his tongue. Though this is so, his vocal skills in the film exceed my expectations. The phantom's voice shows his emotions exactly as they intend to be shown. While he is singing words ""how you've repaid me, denied me and betrayed me"" in the tune of the song ""All I Ask Of you,"" the Phantom's voice is doleful because he is deeply distraught after a devastating discovery that leaves him heartbroken. Another song in which strong emotion is expressed from the Phantom (Butler) is ""Point of No Return."" In this song, the Phantom expresses a feeling of yearning and control. a As he sings the words, ""Past the point of no return, no backward glances,"" his voice voice possesses a tone of power, intending to lure the girl he loves into his grasp. The songs in this film are all uniquely presented, especially by the phantom (Butler) to portray emotions thoroughly through his powerful voice. Gerard Butler as the phantom as well as the other actors and actresses in The Phantom of the Opera all possess such powerful voices that they make this film a musical masterpiece.The costumes in this film seem to fit the characters' roles completely as they tell their stories and reveal secret faults and scars. The Phantom's mask, for example, reflects his mysterious attitude toward all who dare to face him. The deformity of his face, being a birth defect, leaves him hiding his face away from viewing eyes. As the ending of the film approaches, the Phantom describes the mask as his first unfeeling scrap of clothing."" In other words, The Phantom's mask is a piece of material that hides his horrid scar to ensure that no one may ever see it. Other costumes that are worn by the actors and actresses of this film reveal their roles in society or their upbringing. The clothing which is worn by Raoul, (Patrick Wilson) in this film, for example, reveal that he was born into a family who possesses a high role in society as the other characters do in this film with their elegant suits and gowns of silk and satin. Christine's gowns of flowing lace, for example, reflect her role as a famous violinist by being gowns of sheer elegance and beauty. The clothing which is worn by the stars of this film is a characteristic which reveals the film's flawlessness and allure.The setting in which the film is set is 1919 in a Paris opera house. Most of this film is set here because it is where l the stars practice their musical talents. The opera house is one of massive size and beauty above, but down below, it is a dark, depressing place. Up above the lower layer of the opera house, the stars preform in a bright, joyful atmosphere, where no darkness seems to reside. In contrast, the lower layer of the opera consumed by darkness and negative energy. Since the Phantom resides here, alone and darkened by his own hatred and betrayal for the people and surroundings above, his lair is dark and depressing, consuming his own concealment and denseness. The settings of this film has much to do with the characters' attitudes and auras. The top layer of the opera house, for example, is a bright, cheerful place because the characters of the film are bright and cheerful. In contrast, the lower layer where the Phantom resides reveals his aura as being dark and dull. All in all, both settings of this film presents a very accurate match to the characters which reside in them.The Phantom of the Opera definitely has its strong points which make it a very likable motion picture. The acting and the music are the most apparent aspects of the film which give the film its phenomenal quality, with the costumes and setting in close second and third place. Over all, the film was indeed a very successful film which deserves recognition and applause from current fans and potential future fans if they are to see this film in the future. This film is definitely worth viewing for anybody who enjoys musicals. Musical films affect different people in different ways. Whether you like musicals or not, this film is sure to find a place in your heart. Everything about this film was outstanding.",The Phantom of the Opera
1127,martigro,Words cannot express how bad this film is,3,18 July 2008,"You know those DVD's of Cats or any other show where they basically just record the show? Well, let's say that this movie is sort of like that but since it says it's an actual movie you're left to wonder why did they not do anything beyond trying to replicate what would happen in a stage.I like musicals, and I loved Phantom of the Opera in Broadway, but as a movie it seems lacking. The songs are fabulous, yes (they are the original Phantom of the Opera) and the sets are well made but it's just... boring.And trust me, I had never expected to say that from this movie.But it's just such a blatant use of any film cliché, and done SERIOUSLY. As if the twinkling things behind Chritine in her first solo aren't a ""look, we're joking with you"". No, they're ""we seriously believe you're 6 and by putting twinkling stuff in the background you have been rendered powerless and have no choice but to stand and applaud the beauty and magnificence of this outdated stuff."" There are other examples, but you get the idea.The black and white scenes, bad. The lair of the ghost, bad. It just... angers me that someone could take such an spectacular Broadway show and managed it to turn in into such a bland movie.The only scene I found managed to be impressive was Prima Donna, right at the end, when she walks out of the theater and sees the crowd at her feet.In the end, I feel, what could have been a great movie ended up as a glorified recorded theater show.",The Phantom of the Opera

1129,floridagirl1025,Fantastic,10,22 January 2005,"Having never seen this in any form I did not know what to expect. Being a fan of musicals I was looking forward to see this. I must say that the movie out did any expectations that I did have. The first transition into the story of the movie was absolutely fantastic, I have never seen any transitions like that. The music in the movie is brilliant and adds to the plot of the movie.Emmy Rossum was superb in her role as Christine, being so young and pulling of the role was great. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that she actually sings her role, not many actors seem to do that even if they have a good voice.Gerard Butler as the role of the Phantom was also really good. The anger and loneliness surrounding him was heartbreaking as well as his emotions towards Christine. Gerard portrays all of the Phantom's qualities: anger, sadness, loneliness, genius, madness and the list goes on, better than one would hope.This movie is a must see and the soundtrack is a must have. There is a very good chance that I will see this movie again. This is one of those movies that should be viewed on the big screen first and not just on DVD or VHS.",The Phantom of the Opera

Excellent! All around. I liked the outside shots of the Opera House because it looks the same then as when I saw it in March! I couldn't understand Carlotta most of the time but she was very enthusiastic and a diva to a T. Phantom was very well played and was very attractive which you wouldn't usually think of him but he was!Christine was really good but she looked a little bit dazed some of the time.

The singing was great, even though I haven't seen the play at Broadway to compare. This movie has it all: atmosphere, storyline, depth in characters, songs, musical themes,costumes, etc. Even watching it on DVD was a great experience. Butler did such a great job at portraying the phantom! One can't help but feel compassion, fascination, feral fear and at the same time pity for his character. Minnie Driver portrayed the diva perfectly (really annoying) and the parts for Raoul and Christine were perfectly casted. The chemistry between Phantom and Christine as well as the chemistry between Raoul and Christine were wonderfully portrayed.

While watching this movie, it takes you to another place where only music exists. Music is so intense that you sometimes feel like you'll just get inside the movie. If you are a musician, you'll probably LOVE this movie. When I got this movie I thought I will be watching one of those boring musicals but now I see that I was wrong.

None of the relationships are believable and the girls simply aren't hot enough.The musical is pretty much lowest common denominator consumer crap to begin with but this movie somehow takes what was big about Phantom and reduces it to nothing.,The Phantom of the Opera
1134,OperaGhost88,"Beautiful and sad, should delight both fans of the play and new people",10,27 December 2004,"I'll start by saying that I have seen the stage version twice, but as a big movie buff, this review is my best attempt at being objective. From other reviews that I've read, the major complaints are: 1. That Joel Schumacher's direction is overly lush, and detracts from the heart of the story. 2. Complaints of the singingAbout the direction, I have never been a fan of Mr. Schumachers. His films have never made me desire to see them, and those I did see, I was sorry afterwards. However, with this film, he did impress me. The film was over-the-top, but that is as it should be. It was beautiful and left me feeling as if I had waken from a dream. Perhaps it was distracting, but that is only if you let yourself be distracted. My suggestion then is SEE IT AGAIN, so the wow! factor is over and you can concentrate on the heart-wrenching story and gorgeous music by Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber (He's no longer Sir Lloyd Webber).On the singing, this is another thing that will only be bothersome if you allow it to be so. I have been trained, and I thought that Emmy Rossum had a very clear, beautiful soprano, though Think of Me was a little weak and she has a tendency to glissando to higher notes (especially on Angel of Music) which bugs me some. I was pleasantly surprised by Gerard Butler, actually. His singing was not perfect, but it certainly improves as the film progresses (Point of No Return sounded like he had been singing for ages) and I thought he sang with incredible passion and heart, something which previous Phantoms on stage, while having wonderful singing voices, lacked. Patrick Wilson brought out a part which can easily become a drag. Raoul can be kind of a bore, but Wilson truly made the part his own and he has what is certainly the strongest voice of the trio.For those fans of the play, I thought all changes from the original script were appropriate. I won't go into detail, I wish to avoid the spoiler thing, but the original play needed to have a climax before intermission, and one to tie the whole show together, which the movie combines, considering there is no intermission.All in all I thought it was a job well done, and the years of anticipation have paid off. Do see it, you won't be disappointed. 5/5 from me!",The Phantom of the Opera
1135,whitneyerin8117,So amazing,10,4 April 2011,"Although a little lengthy with a 2-hour run time, Phantom of the Opera will draw you in from the beginning, rendering you till the very end. It is everything a musical movie should be. With astounding music and costumes, the stage musical sensation magically and hauntingly comes to life in more ways than one. Gerard Butler (the Phantom) Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) give a convincing performance of a fateful love triangle that unwinds scene by scene. Musical numbers such as Point of no return, Don Juan Triumphant, Wishing you were somehow here again, and many others, will send chills down your spine. Gerard and Emmy sing with such heart and passion. Although nothing can compare to the original stage show and the vocals of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, the new cast is just as amazing. With a very accurate portrayal of the original Broadway production, director Joel Schumacher does not disappoint and will leave you wanting more. Watch it once and you will want to watch it again. To say that this film was entertaining, simply does not do it justice. It was amazing.",The Phantom of the Opera
1136,katernc,Taken In By Phantom,8,11 October 2005,"I've never seen the theater production of Phantom, either. I recently discovered Gerard Butler so have been viewing ALL of his films! having seen him in TR2 and Timeline, I could not imagine him as such a tragic figure in Phantom, much less doing all his own vocals. After buying the DVD and viewing the movie, I now own the soundtrack as well. He does have a rather untaught edge to his voice, but it only serves to add more depth to the tortured character - the gruff quality of his tenor makes it all the more real. To me, his portrayal was very deep, and sad, and full of suffering ... all that unrequited love. What a story! I am now very curious to see the stage show. I think this movie is wonderful!",The Phantom of the Opera

I found myself lip-synching the words throughout the entire movie (I have seen the play and my mom owns a copy of the entire music from the Broadway show). It was definitely best that no one for the most part had heard of any of the cast. That way they could get people who could sing AND act. Acting second, because this movie is all about the music. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. By bringing it to the big screen they were able to give better shots of the grave, the roof, etc. Plus the flashbacks were cool. Anyone who did not like this movie does not appreciate something great. And this was great.",The Phantom of the Opera
1138,iiqtkimii,Excellent Movie,10,31 January 2005,"I just saw it last night, and I was stunned. I saw the Broadway version a few years ago, and was so swept up in the amazing set and costumes, that it was hard to understand what was actually going on. The movie made everything clearer, and I actually understood what was going on between the characters. I have to go see it again in the theaters before it leaves-that organ music just gives me the shivers-in a good way. I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD!Does anyone know if they are going to offer a soundtrack with this cast singing? While the original is beautiful-Emmy's voice is just angelic in this movie. Gerald Butler was wonderful as Phantom-and absolutely gorgeous (until his mask was taken off)-but I didn't think he was terribly hideous once it was. If I didn't know how it was going to end, I honestly thought Christine would have stayed with him. The Viscomte is wonderful too! Can't wait to see it again!",The Phantom of the Opera
1139,FarmLoon,A Pleasant Surprise,10,10 December 2004,"I had a few worries about this movie, but after tonight they have quite disappeared. Yes the movie is a fairly straightforward transposition from the stage show, but is none the worse for that despite it's length. There appear to be two schools of thought developing about the leads, and I suppose I'm of the school that thinks Emmy was wonderful and isn't quite so happy about Gerard. Although I don't think he was BAD, I just wish his singing voice had been a little bit better. It would have boosted his pretty good interpretation of the role even more. The sets and costumes are sumptuous as everyone has said. As to the popularity of the show, well I don't know how well it's selling at Her Majesty's Theatre in London's West End, but not many people were watching the movie this evening with me on it's opening night in the UK. I agree with those who say the if you like Phantom and musicals in general, you'll probably love this. For those who don't like musicals and know they don't like musicals, don't bother. You'll be bored and/or irrated for two and a half hours. For those who haven't seen Phantom or aren't aware of the music (is there anyone?) you may be taken aback by the very 80s feel of some of the pieces, but others should be able to get past this to the heart of this Romantic Gothic Melodrama. With great tunes. Enjoy. I did.",The Phantom of the Opera
1140,mountjonas,A bit disappointed,4,8 May 2005,"I haven't had a chance to read the countless reviews, but from what I've read, I guess I'm in the minority. I found Butler's rendition of the Phantom rather flat. Gone was the intensity that I found in other performances of the Phantom. The singing voice of the Phantom was also lacking in depth. Maybe they needed to do more than pitch correct his voice because it flat out sucked.I must say that I had low expectations of this adaptation since Joel Shumacher directed it, and was still disappointed in this version. The movie looked great, including sets and costumes, but that was it for me. A few deletions of certain parts left me a really bummed.",The Phantom of the Opera
1141,mandi6278,I expected more. but liked what I got!,8,1 January 2005,"This movie is usually visually stunning, and the performances are usually good. The rest of the time, though, the lip syncing is terribly off in several places (the Hannibal rehearsal at the beginning, in the Music of the Night, Masquerade). I've read the book and seen the show, and as a singer myself, I was fairly dismayed at a whole lot of scooping and sliding through ALW's strenuous octave and more jumps by Christine, the synthesized high E at the end of Phantom of the Opera, and the Phantom's yelling-instead-of-singing in The Point of No Return. As we left the theater, I found myself wondering out loud why Joel Schumacher didn't use vocal takes where the actors were better rested, better practiced, or using better technique. Surely a big budget film like this could afford some extra tape to make the vocals sound less like actors trying to sing and more like singers who act (as real opera singers are!). I don't know who sang Carlotta for Minnie Driver, but I was by far the most pleased with her part. She made me laugh out loud more than once. The actor playing Raoul did a better job with all the facets of his role than any actor I've seen in the part onstage. He was well cast both as a singer and an actor. I thought that Christine did an excellent job of playing her part: a confused, dreamy, trusting and lonely young woman whose vulnerability has been taken advantage of. She was lovely, but I wish that in the grand tradition of My Fair Lady, they had had someone a little more trained do her singing- Christine is a vocally demanding role for any soprano, and it holds to reason that Madame Giry would not have suggested such a ""young"" voice to replace the power of Carlotta in the lead role of Hannibal. She has most of the notes in her range, and her tone is pretty, but it was too difficult for her to sing it with any true prowess.However, vocal pickiness aside, I thought Schumacher did an excellent job bringing this musical to life for people who don't attend Broadway shows. He captured the breathless energy of the Opera world, the dusty glamour of Paris in the 1870's, and the eerie quality which a ""haunted"" opera house should have! I recommend it to anyone who isn't a stickler for trained singers and who isn't trained to look for sound-to-mouth movement precision in lip syncing!",The Phantom of the Opera

This is one musical that should not be missed. One of the top ten best films of the year. Up and rising star EMMY ROSSUM (Christine Daae) lifts our hearts with her groundbreaking performance.

It both honors the stage show and creates something excitingly original. Gerald Butler is not Lon Chaney (who could top his chilling makeup?) but has a romantic charisma to draw lovely Emmy Rossum to him. The sets, costumes, and wide-screen photography are world-class. For everyone who could not afford the $100 a ticket stage play or to see it again and again, Schumacher and Lloyd Webber give you a faithful translation to own for about $20. Come to think of it, a 15 minute intermission, added to the movie's 140 minute length, is virtually the length of the stage show, so it IS almost all here, along with exciting extras.

The films leads are brilliant as although Gerard Butler does not have the best of voices but the emotion that he puts into the role as the Phantom more than makes up for it as you believe what he is saying / singing.

1147,killashandrac,One scene worth the whole movie,8,4 February 2005,"It's unfair, I think, to compare stage with screen. Joel Schumaker is successful in creating a movie that allows you to be more intimate with the characters--something which you can't do, despite the wonderful music, when watching the play. The close up's and ability of the camera to capture the emotions on the faces is spectacular. I was very wary of going to see this movie--I have been listening to Phantom since I was born and it is my favorite musical/play/etc. of all time. HOWEVER, even if you don't want to see the movie for the acting or the singing, go see it for the absolutely BREATHTAKING scene where the chandelier is raised and the Opera House is transformed. The scene alone is worth every penny and worth seeing over and over again. It's something you cannot do on stage and the transition in the movie from the auction scene to the past is amazing. The entire introduction is the most beautiful piece of filmaking I have seen in a long time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1148,doriswidlas,I've seen it 4 times and I'd see it again!,10,5 March 2005,The movie was beautifully made! I loved the way the music began they rose the chandelier and everything turned into color! It gave me goosebumps every time! It was my first experience seeing The Phantom of the Opera and the music was so moving. My husband purchased the Soundtrack for me for Valentines Day. Watching the movie made me cry every time! I always made sure that I brought lots of tissue! Gerard Butler is sexy as the phantom! Emmy Rossum with her angelic voice prompted me to take voice lessons. Minnie Driver gave an Academy Award performance as Carlotta. Too bad she was not nominated. It's one of those movies that you can see again and again and not get bored. I'm looking forward to purchasing the DVD,The Phantom of the Opera
1149,yours_from_above,Stupendous!,10,1 February 2005,"I am not one for the classical musicals but this one touched me deeply. The casting was amazing! The Phantom and Christine were both stupendously done, but even the smaller characters were amazingly detailed! Kleenex is a must and so is a friend or boyfriend to share in the woes of the film. The depth to which the emotion is performed is absolutely stunning and so realistic even though it is done to music. You would not expect a musical to seem realistic but this one pulls it off with honors. The costumes, sets, lighting, and effects were all wonderfully done especially the opening scene(s). The only thing that I can tell you is that it is amazing and you should go see it for yourself!",The Phantom of the Opera
1150,starving_actress,A beautiful movie!,9,12 May 2005,"Despite some bad editing, which even the biggest, most hard-core fan must admit exists, this movie is a very satisfying adaptation of both book and musical. It wasn't exactly the same but all of the things that I loved were there.. my favorite blocking moments, my favorite tech-- I actually cried when I checked out the embroidery on the Red Death costume. Some people complained that it wasn't just like the show- but I think that the scope of the show is too beautiful to be captured. Lloyd Webber, Schumacher and Co. has given us a very watchable, take home version of that nameless something that makes us love the show so much.",The Phantom of the Opera
1151,beth-coombes,not as bad as some say not bad at all in fact,10,10 December 2004,"I must disagree with a previous comment, I swear to god some people only go to films so they can moan a lot and have some sort of opinion that others will listen to. Phantom of the Opera is one of my favourite musicals and sadly I have only seen it once in Bristol. I must confess as a fellow opera singer that Emmy Rossum's voice was not the harsh opera voice that is often found on stage these days and that at first I was rather shocked at the choice however as the film went on her voice became far more mature and very pleasant. She was i think a better choice than Sarah Brightman ever was- not so obsessed with her own performance and a lot more beautiful.I agree with a previous comment that Minnie Driver was superb and that Patrick Wilson wasn't the dashing young wonder some might expect when seeing the film having seen the musical, however I care little for his character.The character of the Phantom to me is the true hero and I believe Gerald Butler was superb. It is difficult to live up to the original cast member Michael Crawford's amazing voice which few can scarcely do but Gerald Butler did exceptionally well. I thought his acting was unquestionable and so too was his singing. Not many other actors could pull off such a performance so I for one will not be so quick in discrediting those who do so well.Bravo!I shall be watching it again. Those that dislike it can allow others to make up their own minds and be less hasty in slandering those who do a sight lot better than I expect they would.",The Phantom of the Opera
1152,DamiraRose,"With very few flaws, Phantom was everything I wished for",10,23 December 2004,"By the time I could see this movie, my excitement was completely brimming over. That excitement continued to overflow after it was over to see it again! Emmy Rossum as Christine was a fresh face with a lovely voice. Some have commented that her voice wasn't strong enough, but I am not a big fan of over-the-top sopranos, so her tone and range was perfect. Gerard Butler was a definite shock, since I'm so used to Michael Crawford's voice, yet he made the role his own and did a fabulous job. He ISN'T Crawford, which made his performance even better. Patrick Wilson, I felt, was a little weak with his singing voice, but his acting was great, and made Raoul a braver figure than I've seen previously. The music blew me away. I've always loved the songs, and I'd forgotten how beautiful the score was. The costumes, makeup, and scenery were colorful and spectacular. The rest of the cast did wonderfully, and the best thing about the whole film was that it was almost EXACTLY like the play version. It really was like watching the play with more freedom. I am not at all ashamed to say that I cried at the end. I can guarantee I will be spending more and more money as I see this again and again, and I will be first in line to buy it on DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
1153,lcgilbert474,The movie is MUCH better than I expected it would be.,8,5 January 2005,"I was hesitant to see this movie after reading so many negative reviews. But I must say, I am so glad that I saw it. Of course the movie isn't perfect,and no,it didn't excite me as much as two wonderful stage productions I've seen of Phantom. But still ... I think the movie is visually stunning and, on the whole, I was quite moved by the performance of the cast. Seeing this movie has confirmed my feelings that movie reviewers can sometimes be much too critical in their opinions. By all means, if you enjoy musicals and, more specifically, if you like the music from Phantom of the Opera, do yourselves a favor and go see this movie. Don't let movie critics unfavorable reviews discourage you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1154,areka00,Hunh?,4,17 January 2005,"I've never seen an earlier version of ""Phantom"" so I didn't know the story apart from ""there's a disfigured guy running around the the Paris Opera"". Now that I've seen the movie, I still don't know the story. I thought the theater I was in had a pretty decent sound system, but I caught perhaps 10% of the dialog. Not enough to figure out what was going on. Christine and the Viscomte (Raoul?) I got. Christine and the Phantom I had no idea. The Phantom kidnaps her and she doesn't run away first chance she gets? No idea why. The masked ball was the low point for me, I thought Baz Luhrmann had wandered in and taken over (not a good thing, I watched about 20 minutes of Moulin Rouge before ejecting that tape) with Michael Jackson's choreographer. The Phantom's voice was not up to the level of the others. There were movie audio conventions that were ignored that made it even more confusing. Usually when a voice is sort-of everywhere, it's meant to be part of the background. The first time Christine hears the Phantom, I had no idea she was supposed to. For me, it was like having a character notice the narrator. I found the apparent age of the characters confusing. The Viscomte and the Phantom looked to be about the same age until the Phantom's mask is removed near the end. How did his hair go from black and slick to gray and stringy? Yeah, mostly confused.",The Phantom of the Opera
1155,breeze-o-the-bay,enchanting! a magical experience!,10,5 January 2005,"I dragged my 15 and 17 year old brothers along to see this with me last week! It was unanimous: we ALL adored this movie! Though I had no preconceived ideas about it, I was completely hooked from the opening scene. I have never had a movie ""experience"" that was so engaging, enchanting, and emotional. And just as effective the second time I saw it too! I absolutely adore the casting choices for this movie. I cannot sing Gerard Butler's praises enough! His gut wrenching portrayal of the Phantom was irresistibly sexy, dark, and emotional. In my opinion, his voice is exactly what I envision the Phantom to sound like. Raw, passionate, and incredibly alluring! I can see why ALW and JS would cast someone so young and handsome for a mainstream film production like this. It had the intended effect! I'm not particularly fond of Michael Crawford's type of voice, wonderful though it is. But thanks to GB, The Phantom just came to life for me, I loved Emmy as Christine. I can't think of anyone who I'd want to see in her place. Sure, she looked dazed and confused plenty of times, however, the pull of the Phantom does that to you. I loved everyone else just as much! Patrick Wilson made a splendid Raol and captured me in his duet with Emmy on All I Ask of You. I loved Minnie Driver as Carlotta! Perfectly hilarious. Ack! I just can't say enough about this fabulous film! I'm going to start blubbering and forgetting how to speak English. One of my absolute favorite scenes is the Music of the Night! I was entranced, and probably had the same dumb expression on my face as Christine. Just when I didn't think it could get any better, then came along The Point of No Return. (And what woman, may I ask, would NOT agree with me on this one?) I was about to pee my pants, or worse. Due in part, of course, to Butler's beautiful self, but whatever the reason, I just could not get enough of him. Believe me, I will be seeing this movie again, without my kid brothers! I have the soundtrack and am hooking my friends, left and right on this spectacular film rendition of an already classic production! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It tied with Napoleon Dynamite as my favorite movie of 2004. (Yes napoleon dynamite is a different bird all together. Don't hate me. )",The Phantom of the Opera

The reviews were mixed but hey, not everything can please everyone. I was sitting in the jam packed theater tonight hoping everyone in the audience would enjoy the film. As we walked out I heard no bad comments about the film, everyone seemed to have enjoyed it. They did move the chandelier crash which in the stage show is the Act 1 finale, the placement of the chandelier crash in the film was decent. They had to change the lyrics in 'Masqeurade' however. Gerard Butler made an excellent Phantom, Emmy Rossum was a fantastic choice to play Christine. The sets were unbelievable. From the moment the black and white opening sequence began my friends who had never seen, nor heard the music from the musical were like ""I'm liking this already"" The ending of course was different from the stage version. Instead of the Phantom vanishing from his chair, he raises a curtain to unveil a secret mirror which he smashes and reveals a secret passage way in which he goes through and the curtain falls on the secret doorway, and in the stage show Meg Giry finds the mask and lifts it up and the lights go down, well she picks the mask up and leaves. I loved the ending of this film. This however isn't the actual full ending of the film. I do recommend this film for everyone because everyone will find something enjoyable about the film, whether it is the comical performance of Minnie Driver as La Carlotta or if you love the music.",The Phantom of the Opera
1157,bj27983,Did anyone else think the singing was absolutely AWFUL???!!!,4,16 January 2005,"I absolutely love the Phantom Broadway show...I was so excited about this film. I went tonight and got there and bought the last ticket of a sold-out house. I just knew I was going to be blown away! BOY was I disappointed! The singing was more hideous than the Phantom's face (which actually wasn't hideous at all...what gives with having a mostly handsome Phantom anyway? Kinda defeats the point of the movie, doesn't it?). The Phantom is supposed to be a MUSICAL GENIUS!! And the poor fellow COULD NOT SING!!! I've heard high school chorus guys sound better than this guy. And Minnie Driver...geez, what was SHE doing? That was the worst Carlotta I've ever seen! I cannot believe the casting of this film...it was unfitting ALL the way around. Anyway, the set design was wonderful, but I was even disappointed in the costumes. The Broadway show makes this look like 3rd rate crap. Phantom's masquerade costume was not even scary...in the NY version, he looks really creepy with his skull mask and a really flowing and dominant red outfit. I don't know...I was just so sorry I didn't wait to rent it on video. I would have rather spent my $7.25 on ""A Series of Unfortunate Events.""",The Phantom of the Opera
1158,slbrown24601,Save your money ... and your ears,4,30 January 2005,"Absolutely distasteful! This movie could have been something, instead what we have is an actress who could sing (passable), but looked stoned though most of the movie, not a good thing. Also there is Gerard Butler who comes from such astounding musicals as ""Tomb Raider"" to massacre what is probably one of the best male roles out there. And what is worse that anything is that Andrew Lloyd Webber was apparently a great part of this. I went to this movie not expecting much in the singing department, as the trailers showcase just how flat Butler was. Oh and the worst part was that the Chandlier scene was moved...

1161,hhavens,Phantastic!!!,10,23 December 2004,"DISCLAIMER: I am an avid ""The Phantom of the Opera"" fan. I have seen the stage musical several times and know the libretto almost completely by heart. This is my favorite musical music, and in general, I like Andrew Lloyd Webber. So, expect this review to be incredibly biased.REVIEW: Ever since I heard that they were really going to make this into a movie (about a year ago), I have wanted to see it. In short, my expectations were completely fulfilled.For those of you not acquainted with the story of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", the movie begins in Paris, 1919 at an auction at the Opera Populaire where we glimpse an aged Raoul, the Visconte de Chagny, and Mme Giry (Miranda Richardson), the former ballet mistress of the opera. At this point the picture is black and white, and when the auctioneer announces the chandelier and turns on the power, the booming overture begins, and the picture transitions into beautiful, vibrant color.We are now back in Paris, 1870 (same place) where the Opera Populaire has just been handed over to new management. The diva (Minnie Driver) refuses to sing in the upcoming show because the ""Opera Ghost"" and his perpetual nuisances. A young chorus girl, Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), fills in and, due to her new teacher, does quite splendidly. A younger Raoul (Patrick Wilson), Christine's childhood friend, is smitten with the young star. However, things begin to get complicated when Christine's singing coach, the Phantom (Gerard Butler), turns out to be a man (instead of a ghost) who is deeply in love with Christine.The costumes and sets are terrific - this is some of the best cinematography and set design that I have ever seen! The look of the film is wonderful! The singing is almost as good as the sets. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful, and Patrick Wilson, a veteran Broadway performer, is also quite good. At first, I wasn't crazy about Gerard Butler's voice, but it grew on me, especially during ""Music Of The Night"" and ""Point of No Return"". I know there are a lot of Phantom ""phans"" out there who are purists and only like Michael Crawford or maybe John Owen Jones. I admit that I love Michael Crawford's version of phantom - I have listened to the OLC (Original London Cast) hundreds of times. However, Butler's version, while not entirely different from Crawford's (I think his voice has some of the same qualities), is good in its own right. The acting is not quite excellent, but pretty good. Emmy and Patrick, at times, seem expressionless. Minnie Driver is good as the over-the-top diva, but sometimes goes a little overboard. And Gerard Butler's acting was very fitting for the Phantom, menacing for most of the film and then heartbreaking at the end.BOTTOM LINE: If you hate Andrew Lloyd Webber and/or movies with lots of singing, this is not a film for you. If you do like musicals or if you have an open mind, I would encourage you to go. And if you like this musical at all, I strongly urge you to see this new version of ""Phantom"", which is incredibly close to the musical - the few alterations I think are for the better. This is an incredible movie, and it's a shame that fewer people like it as opposed to ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" because the target audience is more select.RATING: 5/5",The Phantom of the Opera
1162,michael_audrey_myers,A real masterpiece,10,19 December 2004,"I can't understand why some people attacks to this movie.Maybe because the wanted Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the leading roles? Because the didn't like musicals? or they hate Mr Joel Schumacher? We can't say: ""Oh, It's a Joel Schumacher film... It will be horrible!!"" No, because we're in front of the best film of this director and maybe one of the best adaptations of a theatre musical to the big screen.Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are very great, they sing very very well. The art direction is merely amazing. The music of the phantom never has been listened like in this version.I think is the best version since the Lon Chaney silent film.Overture, prologue... the black and white scenes which makes references to the present moments... the supporting actors, the music, the songs... ALL is great.Thanks very much Mr Webber and Mr Schumacher to give us a great present like this. In my opinion one of the best musicals ever made and one of the best movies of this year.",The Phantom of the Opera
1163,narwagner,Does it matter if the singing is not perfect? Spoiler,10,10 January 2005,"I now have two cds of the Phantom, the original version and the new movie's soundtrack. Compared side by side, the style and skill level of the singing are very different. And the level of emotion is very different, too -- the songs in the movie seem to me to be much more passionate. I've heard several people talk about shivers going up and down their spines during this movie... this happened to me, too, the first time I saw it, the second time, and so on :) And the cd soundtrack has the same effect. Regardless of singing skill, I think the movie's Point of No Return duet has to be one of the exciting, beautiful and compelling performances in a musical I've ever seen or heard. Butler and Rossum are on fire. It goes way beyond shivers -- I think I stop breathing I'm so in awe.So to me, it doesn't really matter if the singing isn't ""classically"" perfect. I don't think it's possible for me to like it more than I already do.",The Phantom of the Opera
1164,evil_genie,Better then I could have imagined!,8,10 January 2005,"All I can say is  Wow! I went into this movie with low hopes. I have seen the stage production four times, in Philadelphia and New York, and it is my favorite Broadway-style show. I really didn't have high hopes that the film could measure up. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. That being said, you just cant beat a live production of this, so for whoever said ""they don't need to"" see it on stage, I say GO if you have the chance!! I loved how it opened. I really didn't know what to expect, but it was so well done. We begin in ""present day"" Paris (early 1900's), and the auction at the abandoned, decrepit Opera House. The scene is beautifully shot in a black and white, grainy style. Then THAT music starts (you know the music I'm talking about), and the chandelier is raised, bringing the Opera House slowly into beautiful lush color, as we go back to the beginning of the story. Well as I saw that scene play out, I just had this huge grin spread across my face. It was breathtaking. I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.I thought the acting was all wonderful. Emmy Rossum was fantastic as Christine. She has a beautiful voice that fit the part perfectly. Minnie Driver practically stole the show as the Prima Donna, Carlotta. I knew she could sing, but I had no idea how well! My only complaint would have to be about Gerard Butler. His voice was not strong enough (or pretty enough) for the Phantom. His acting was fine, but he has some of the more powerful numbers (including my favorite: ""Music of the Night""), and I didn't think he carried them off very well. Patrick Wilson made a great Raoul, and he was pleasant to look at, too. His duet, with Emmy, on ""All I Ask Of You"" was beautiful. I was not a fan of the song over the ending credits, as I didn't think it was up to the standards of the rest of the music. I understand that they needed something new, to get on the Oscar ballot, but it just didn't fit.I enjoyed the little bits of story they added, to round things out, though I could have done without the sword fight. I was a little unsure about Christine getting onto the white horse, towards the beginning, but after reading the ""trivia"" note on this, I can appreciate it now. I love little nods like that, that are only meant for a certain sect of the audience (I, obviously, was not a member of that sect).All in all, it was more than I could have hoped for in an adaptation. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you've seen the play or not. I give it 8 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1165,erirain,"What a beautiful, beautiful movie...",10,8 January 2005,"First of all, the music is, of course, the most beautiful, heart-wrenching music I've ever heard. I've grown up listening to the soundtrack from the stage version, and had read part of the book, so I thought I knew what to expect. I actually didn't even want to see it, but my friend wanted to, so I went along. The movie just blew me away. Having a handsome phantom, just made it that much better. :) The chemistry between Christine and the Phantom was absolutely incredible. I felt every emotion that every character felt in this movie. I just can't get the music or visuals out of my head. The way they lead into the movie, with the mysterious black and white, and then using ""The Phantom of the Opera"" song to lead us from the run-down theater and chandelier to the past when everything was bustling, just gave me goosebumps off the back. Whew.",The Phantom of the Opera
1166,herzschlag_13,Not for long-time fans,4,9 May 2005,"If you've never seen the stage version of Phantom of the Opera and don't have the opportunity to go, this film is a passable imitation. If you're looking for another cliché love triangle with two handsome guys fighting over a girl, by all means see this movie. If you want mindless eye candy, be my guest.However. If you walk into the theater expecting to see Phantom in all its grandiose, musical, tragic glory, you'll likely be disappointed. This film's biggest failure is its inability to convince the audience; after a while, it simply becomes impossible to suspend your disbelief. Your disbelief that a girl with the voice of an ill-trained twelve-year-old could dazzle the Paris stage; that Gerard Butler's growly rock voice could ever convince anyone he was the Angel of Music; that costumes as plastic as storebought Halloween outfits could have existed in 19th-century France; that the ruggedly handsome Butler could ever have been shunned from society for ""his abhorrent face."" Which, by the way, consists of a blotchy patch on the right side that looks remarkably like a bad sunburn. Butler himself has a firm grasp on the Phantom's character, but unfortunately, director Joel Schumacher's relentless focus on making the film as sexy as possible stole the character's soul. The Phantom's greatest handicap, his repulsive ugliness, has not only been removed but directly contradicted in making him a sex symbol, and not only does it pull his underdog status right out from under him, it makes all his ranting about his accursed face sound like a load of meritless whining.So, in the wake of the gutting of the Phantom's character, what remains to prop this movie up? Certainly not Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson. Rossum, though pretty enough, was not vocally prepared for the role of Christine: her low range sparkles, but the high notes are ridiculously thin and strained, and her diction is consistently muddy. Her acting is decent but nothing to rave about. Wilson, the only trained singer of the three leads, looks great compared to Rossum and Butler, but was handed a rather boring role as Raoul. He brings it to life far more than most of the Broadway actors to land the role, but there's only so much he can do with it. As for the design, the sets are gorgeous, but most of the costumes are blatantly inaccurate for a period setting. In the end the only things holding the movie up are the music and the script, which are basically the same as the stage show. Since they mostly haven't been tampered with, they do give some idea of the impact of the original show. The Phantom story is the Phantom story, no matter how much bad directing and casting may undermine it, and that's the only thing that gets this movie four stars.",The Phantom of the Opera

Its definitely the best movie I've seen in the theater since LOTR 3;) No comparison between the two films. Emmy's voice is so beautiful - I had no idea she could sing like that but it turns out shes a TRAINED opera singer! The guy who plays Phantom was so good, even I was entranced by his voice.

The music in my opinion was good, most of the actors sung beautifully, but I wasn't sure about Gerard Butler, it seemed as if he may have had a sore throat or something. Minnie Driver (Carlotta, the Diva) and Miranda Richardson (Madame Giry) were the only ones that put on a French accent, Minnie Driver was very funny but her over the top accent did get a bit annoying. Miranda Richardson's accent was perfect and she did a mysterious and even sexy performance. Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) put on a great performance as well, their singing voices were surprisingly good, while Jennifer Ellison (Meg Giry) did nothing much but stand there and look pretty.All in all i found this movie to be amazing, I didn't get bored at all.",The Phantom of the Opera

Although at first I didn't agree with the selection of some of the stars I was immensely pleased at what I saw and heard. This was obviously the agreement of the 150+ theatergoers who started to applaud when the movie concluded. This was also obvious from the comments that were heard, the emotions expressed and many who shed a few tears connecting with the Phantom character.

Since then, I have just about memorized the score, seen the musical on Broadway, and waited anxiously for a movie to come out. I have to say that when I heard about the movie, I was at first thrilled, and then apprehensive. I was afraid that the movie wouldn't be up to scratch, and would ruin the Phantom of the Opera for me. Fortunately, the movie was all that I expected and more. From the first scene in the Opera House, to the end at Christine's grave, I was absolutely blown away. The scenery was perfect, the costumes were gorgeous, and I loved how the story wasn't just a filming of the musical. The back story of the Phantom, and the extra sword fight only added to the storyline, and made it new and refreshing.The acting and singing also left me with tears in my eyes. Emmy Rossum did a fantastic job, and although her voice seemed a bit weak at times, she successfully conveyed Christine's innocence at first and then her growing confidence as a opera star. Patrick Wilson was also a very talented singer, although his acting seemed, at times, a bit stiff. Minnie Driver provided some comedic relief, and played the Spanish opera diva quite well. But to me, the real star of the whole movie was Gerard Butler. His character was the one that I was most worried about, since the Phantom, to me, has always been Michael Crawford. Gerard, I think, shocked everyone with the powerful rawness he put into playing the Phantom. His performance brought tears to my eyes, because he made one feel sorry for his situation by the end of the movie. He made me wish the movie didn't have to end the way it did, and the ending of the movie, with the rose and the ring tied to it with black ribbon, left me with both shivers and a smile.I am so glad that this movie was a success. In my eyes it was so much more then I expected, and if people are worried about it not being just the same as the musical, I say that it's not supposed to be the exact same as the musical. It's a movie that's based on the musical, and I feel that it has surpassed the grandeur and glory that the musical originally had. This was a total and complete success.""You alone can make my song take flight Help me make the music of the night""",The Phantom of the Opera
1174,zel29,Glorious!,10,5 January 2005,"This movie is the most beautiful production I have ever seen on the screen. To date I have seen it 7 times and can't wait to go back for more. Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, is superb. I have seen the stage production many times, several times starring Crawford, but GB surpasses them all and brings something to the character that tears at your heart. A fabulous actor and quite lovely to look at, I might add. Emmy Rossom, as Christine, has the voice of an angel and brings her character alive in a unique way. Patrick Wilson was also a delight, with his sweet voice and lovely face and smile. I must admit that it is my all time favorite stage musical - the sweet music is always running through my mind. I can't get over how well the movie was cast and the wonderful special effects.",The Phantom of the Opera
1175,airportbabe,Very disappointing,4,8 January 2006,The anticipation of this film far exceeded the actual movie. The role of the Phantom needed to be filled by someone who could carry the music with the same commanding power as Michael Crawford did on the original soundtrack but the movie fell very short of that mark. The actor playing Raoul was just to foppish to inspire much of a love interest for Christine and his singing voice didn't inspire much lust either. The choice of Emmie Rossum for Christine was good. She was one of the brighter spots of the movie. But the most interesting casting choice was Minnie Driver's rendition of Carlotta. She was better than any stage version I've seen of the part.,The Phantom of the Opera

But that's about the only thing wrong with his performance."" Gerard Butler doesn't have the voice or the sheer stage presence of Michael Crawford. I don't think anyone else could. But that aside, he brings considerable talent to the role. He doesn't try to be a second-string Crawford; he makes the role his own and does a decent job of it.Emmy Rossum is simply stunning as Christine. Her voice is just as good as Sarah Brightman's, and her acting is superb. Film shows a lot more up-close expression (which I would think is harder than projecting from a stage)and Rossum's wide-eyed beauty is perfect for the part.I've forgotten the name of the young man who plays Raoul, but he was good, too. At first, I thought he was just ""another pretty face,"" but he evolves into a thoroughly likable character.The visuals are far more intricate than on stage, of course, and this adds depth to the story. (I found the artificial snow a little irritating, but you can't have everything.) All in all, it's worth seeing.",The Phantom of the Opera

The acting is superb. The sets and costumes are amazing. Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is fantastic. And it's hard to believe that the same guy who made Batman and Robin made this. Ignore the critics. They are, like someone said earlier, either haters of the musical or haters of new talent. Take LotR for example. I had never heard of Billy Boyd or Dominic Monaghan, and they brought Merry and Pippin to life with amazing performances. The same has been done with everyone that you have not heard of in this film. So basically, if you hate good music, superb acting, and a beautiful and well written story, do not see this film. 10/10 Gerald Butler should win an Oscar, along with Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson.

I had never heard the music before but I was familiar with Emmy Rossum's career. I, myself, am a singer and love theater so I thought I'd probably like this movie. I could have never guessed how much I would get out of this movie. First of all, the music? In a word...exquisite. The acting? Phenomenal. This movie is a combo of great singing and fantastic acting. I immediately fell in love with The Phantom (Gerard Butler). My fave scene is when he first appears to Christine and takes her to his lair. The shots of him leading down the corridor are amazing. Throughout the film, I can really feel all of the character's emotions. Especially, The Phantom. I could feel his love for Christine and then his feelings of betrayal. I've seen this movie twice and I plan on seeing it again at the theater. I can't wait till I can own this masterpiece. If you haven't seen this film yet, cherish every second of it and bring tissues! When the film ends, you just want to go back in and experience it all over again. This film is so real you can almost smell the candles burning.

The story is well known. There are no surprises, and nothing at all compelling to keep your interest. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. None were interesting, or were worthy of sympathy. The only thing holding this mess together is sets and costumes. This was easily the most boring film I've seen in the last few years.

1182,kirilu,Wrong director for this film,5,9 May 2005,"I rarely go to the movies any more, so I waited to see ""Phantom"" on video. I was somewhat disappointed. I have never seen the play, as I don't get many opportunities to go see plays, and professional, Broadway plays would definitely be out of my budget allowance. With all due respect to the people who love this ALW production, the movie was long and tedious. It really had nothing to do with the production, it had to do with Joel Schumacher directing it. Joel Schumacher should be allowed to design sets for movies, and that is it. It seems he always gets so carried away in the production of the visuals and never pays attention to the storyline. He always seems to try to cram all the characters and the action in, never developing either enough to make the plot and characters clear. If I had not already been somewhat familiar with the plot, I would have really gotten lost. I actually put the captions option on my television so I could read the lines and the lyrics to see if if would help me follow things better. There were scenes in this movie that just went on and on-the point had already been made, the visual impression had already been made. An example of this was the Masquerade scene. Now, I understand by reading other posts that this is a very important and popular scene. I saw it bringing no preconceived notions to the scene, but after the cast had sang the lyrics and performed the choreography over and over again, I started thinking,""When will this be over?"" Then the scene with the main characters was so short in this segment, it was like, what was the big build up for? It is too bad they couldn't have gotten Ridley Scott to direct this. He seems to be able to pull off a spectacular production and also do character and story development.As for the actors, I think they did a great job. I watched this mainly because I wanted to see Gerard Butler. He obviously was not a trained singer, but he did sing on key, and I thought he did OK. There were some good symbolic things in the movie. I got the significance of the monkey music box in that it belonged to the phantom, but I did not understand why Raoul would want it for Christine, since I would have thought that he would be happy to forget everything about the ""Phantom"" This had the makings of a good romantic movie, it was just the length and many things that I considered disjointed kept me from enjoying it as much as I wanted to. I may watch it again sometime, as I know a person always notices stuff they missed the first time.",The Phantom of the Opera

Both are excellent in their own right. After seeing the movie (Twice Now!), I have to say that the movie is better than the stage play.Reason: In the movie, you don't need binoculars to see the action, you can hear all the words without sitting in the orchestra (where the instruments overshadow the voices), and the performances are moving, especially Gerard Butler as the Phantom.Gerard Butler turns in his best performance that I've seen so far, and I already admired his work.

1184,poissonbleu2,I'll never really like any other music again,10,21 December 2004,"I absolutely loved this film. It was stunning. The music was incredibly powerful and all I can think is that I will never be able to put on a CD and enjoy it in the same way.I thought the sets were great because they were so full of colour and the part at the beginning was incredible. It was really quite a sad story and I know I'm not the only person who was in tears or at least almost. Andrew Lloyd-Webber's work has been made into something fantastic but one of the people I went with had already seen it in the theatre and said that it was much better that way. I think the thing that really struck me was the music which I mentioned above. It was so powerful and moving and just blew my mind. Joel Schumacher has done a really good job of it. I did think it lasted quite a long time but it didn't really bother me. I could stayed there for much longer. I don't think the Phantom's face was that drastic. And I really can't understand why he hid away that much. I would have thought that with the fuss everyone was making, he was going to look truly gruesome but really I can't understand what was so repulsive about it.It was very well written and eventually all came together. I also think Minnie Driver did a very good job of Carlotta, making her stand out, which you wouldn't expect from quite a minimal character.I'm not sure I would recommend this film to everyone; my friend got quite bored and only really sat up during the action scenes, even though they were quite small and didn't really last for that long.

Granted, it may have been because it was a movie & the fact that my rear-end fell asleep about 2 hours into it - but I don't think I would have been any less disappointed if I'd seen it on stage.Not one of Lloyd Webber's greater endeavors.",The Phantom of the Opera
1186,phantomphreak85,"If you didn't like it, read this before posting you're uninformed comments",9,8 January 2005,"---Spoilers--- I have seen this production twice on Broadway, and I will admit, I was extremely skeptical when I heard it would be a stage production. I was pleasantly surprised when I finally worked up the courage to see the film. First of all, I thought the casting was superb. Gerard Butler, while no Michael Crawford, played an unforgettable role, despite the less than perfect voice. Emmy Rossum blew my mind. She was absolutely perfect in this role. Many people have criticized the fact that she was constantly in a dreamy detached state. For anyone who understands the plot, that is precisely who she is supposed to be. She is a girl who is completely mystified by this Phantom and surrenders to him completely. I thought Patrick Wilson was an excellent Raoul as well. He did not have the best voice in the world, but made up for it with his facial expressions throughout the finale. He plays the part, appropriately, a somewhat emasculated man who finds it inside himself to do whatever it takes to win the heart of the girl he loves. Carlotta and Maddam Giry were both portrayed beautifully as well.On to the set and costumes. Both were amazing. I have heard some criticism about them being overdone. I do believe that French Opera in this time period was indeed overdone. The sets were appropriately extravagant, as were the costumes. To be honest, I thought Christine's costumes were sometimes too plain.As for the cinematography, I thought Webber and Schumacher did an excellent job bringing this to the screen. At first I was extremely disappointed that they changed the chandelier, but after seeing it a second time, I understand and accept the change. For those of you complaining because the love triangle was never fully resolved...that's the point. Christine is not a truly down-to-earth girl and would never have been able to truly decide had it not been for the murders and other such naughtiness.As for criticisms, I have only a few. Gerard Butler, while he played the role well, was too good looking to be the Phantom, and the disfigurement on his face was not nearly shocking or horrifying enough. Although I am one of few who realized that the white mask was not the only bit of disguise he wore, that perfectly slicked back hair was indeed, a bit too perfect. I thought the little bit of electric guitar at the end of the title song was grossly inappropriate and unnecessary.Overall, I was extremely impressed.",The Phantom of the Opera

If you are a fan of musicals, if you are a fan of the artistic side of movie-making, or if you are a fan of the melodrama, you should hasten to your nearest cinema to experience this...

However, I couldn't understand the plot since most of it was told through music the singing was so dismal that I couldn't understand what they were saying and lost interest quickly.

Yet as the film began to role I thought that the movie couldn't get any better. In the beginning, after the auction when the chandelier is being lifted, they are returning to the past and the music starts to boom, I sat, literally, with my mouth open in awe. The music was so exciting and breath taking. The theme in the scene I mentioned almost had a techno feel to it but one could tell that there were no such instruments. To add to the music was the voices. Gerard Butler's, the Phantom, voice indeed helped him earn the title 'Angel of Music' as is bestowed upon him by Christine, Emmy Rossum's character. His acting was nothing shy of excellent. Rossum was indeed brilliant when it came to both acting and singing. The whole cast showed wonderful talent.My last thought to leave is that I sat with my friend and she leaned over to me and told me she couldn't decide who to side with the Phantom or Raoul(Patrick Wilson), Christine's love.

It has great acting, singing, amazing special effects and is still the story that I loved as a stage musical. I think as an audience that we expect something other-worldly and perfect when we see a movie version of a play and the movie is always going to be somewhat different and the singing is always going to sound much different than it did in real life when you last saw it all put together. If you don't like it, fine, but give it a rest. It's a well-done movie that can be enjoyed on a surface level for those who are unfamiliar with Phantom and that has some neat takes on songs and scenes that wouldn't be possible in a stage version (i.e. how the Phantom displays his obsession with Christine, etc.). It just won't be and shouldn't be a replica of Sarah B and Michael C.As a side-note I thought that the singing was excellent and that G Butler did a great job--not a disappointing one!",The Phantom of the Opera

The film is beautiful to look at, there's no doubt about that and none of the actors are terrible, but as considering it is a musical, neither the Phantom, nor Christine sing as well as they should be able to. Emmy Rossum has a pleasant voice to listen to, but sometimes it sounds a little weak, although it is in tune. Gerard Butler is the weakest singer. When he tries to sing quietly, his voice is weak, and sometimes he feels the need to growl out the songs. Patrick Wilson as Raoul is good and Minnie Driver is the best part about the film, along with the two theatre owners.Worth seeing if you like musicals, just don't expect too much from the singing, although the film itself is good.

1194,ab126,Absolutely breathtaking!,10,30 December 2004,"I just recently left the theater, and I must admit- I still feel giddy from this movie!! Before seeing the film, I had heard lots of different types of reviews, therefore I knew that I would have to go in with a truly open mind to be able to exit with a review that was my own... thankfully, I think I succeeded! I absolutely adored this movie! I will not say that the production was perfect, however, I must say that in my opinion, it was extremely close.Since this movie came out, I have heard many negative reviews for Gerard Butler, the Phantom of the Opera. However, I must say, he was undoubtedly my favorite! Although Gerard Butler does not have the best singing voice, I believe he fully makes up for his musical performance with his acting/presence. (His singing is not bad, its just simply not operatic or as powerful as Patrick Wilson's or Emmy Rossum's.) However, I do not believe that this makes his musical performance entirely negative... Michael Crawford was much the same was as the original Phantom on Broadway... he wasn't the best singer, but his acting made him sensational. Gerard Butler had an amazingly commanding presence in this film, and I believe that the presence is almost entirely what makes the Phantom great. His acting was sensational, and Gerard Butler just embodies an unknowing raw sexuality that makes the Phantom even more intriguing and mysterious.Emmy Rossum is beautiful, and also turns in a fantastic performance. Her singing is very nice, however, I was somewhat disappointed with her lip syncing... in one song, she went for a high B and barely cracked her lips. Unfortunately, this mismatch somewhat takes away from the magic of her musical numbers.Patrick Wilson also was a wonderful Raoul. Many people wished for this part to be taken on Josh Groban, however, I think it was perfect the way it was. Josh Groban is a sensational singer (I am a huge fan), however, the part of Raoul is also supposed to have a challenging, tough presence... Patrick Wilson is built like a brick house... Josh Groban is...well... not.) On top of structure and presence, Wilson also has a wonderful voice which rounds out the principle trio.Overall, viewers truly need to go into this movie with an open mind. If they try to compare it completely to the stage version or ""Phantom"" by Susan Kay, they will leave disappointed- this movie is in a class of its own, and was absolutely wonderful!

1195,juleshale,Not recommended for anyone who's seen the stage production.,5,1 June 2005,"10 years ago, when Phantom was playing at the Opera House in Manchester, I was lucky enough to see the production, once with my now husband and once with the college where I was studying music. The stage production was absolutely inspiring and having seen the promotional material for the film, I was eagerly anticipating its release. The opening sequence, though a bit creepy, set the scene for quite an extravaganza, the big-budget was immediately apparent through the beautiful sets and costumes which set absolutely the right tone for the film. However, the problems started when the singing began in earnest. The best way I can describe it is 'flat', I don't mean in terms of being out of tune, (though more on that later), more in reference to the lack of emotion, excitement and drama. One example is the scene where Firmin, Andre, Raoul, Carlotta and Madame Giry have all received notes from the Phantom. This is a particularly comic moment and had been my favourite from the stage production, unfortunately it is totally lost in the film due to expressionless, bland performances from the principal characters. Besides this over all lack-lustre feel, there were some pretty uneven individual performances. Notably Emmy Rossum, playing Christine whose voice was too thin and reedy to give a convincing Christine, sorry but Emmy should have stayed in the chorus line. Also Gerard Butler as the Phantom made so many school-boy errors with his annunciation and pitch I spent half the film wincing and having flash backs to my voice coach yelling about diphthongs! I suspect, though I will stand corrected, that the cast was made principally of actors who had received some vocal training, rather than vice-versa. There is no way they could do justice to this music, it is just too ambitious a project for amateurs. On the positive side, the big set pieces such as 'Masquerade' were expertly executed by the larger cast, who I suspect had far more vocal training and experience than any of the the leads. If you have not seen the stage production and you have no musical training, you will probably really enjoy this film. Despite everything I have said above there are some good performances, particularly Miranda Richardson, Mini Driver and quite surprisingly Jennifer Ellison, whose unassuming voice suits the role of Meg, the chorus girl. The reason I have only given this film 5/10 is because it didn't live up to expectation. They overcame all the problems associated with transferring a stage production onto film, but let it all down by using second-rate musicians. I hope I will be able to see it performed on stage again, I feel the need to have my faith in Andrew Lloyd Webber restored!",The Phantom of the Opera

1198,pagemail,stage greatness becomes movie junk,1,25 January 2005,"After all this time, what a disappointment! Look, the stage show was schlock, but it was inspired, magnificent schlock. It won its vast, world-wide audience fairly: by giving value for money, with gusto. On screen, however, it's all reduced to an evening soap-opera episode about how breaking up is hard to do among the young, beautiful, and sexy.The show only works if Christine really does confuse the Phantom with the guardian spirit of her father (as written into the lyrics), so that the Phantom, an older man desperate for his last chance at human love and companionship, can cleverly use her slightly perverse daddy-longing to his own advantage. The Director, Joel Schumacher, has been quoted as having thought that her ""naivete"" only made sense if she were a teenager, so all the principals could be even younger -- and played by ""beautiful, sexy, young actors"". So suddenly we're in the O.C. among the pretty-and-vacuous set, but with the decor (gilt, red velvet, acres of brocade and candlelight) of a 19th century bordello.Moreover, there was apparently fear that if the Phantom were too disfigured, Christine's attraction to him wouldn't be credible. Gerald Butler's face under the mask just looks as if he's been in a bar fight with his right profile, which he then treated with too long under the sunlamp. But Christine is in fact attracted to the Phantom by his musical brilliance and the fact that he is an echo, in her mind, of her father -- he's not supposed to be a cute stud with a sunburn and a bad temper, he's supposed to be a deformed criminal genius! His murderous behavior only makes dramatic sense in the context of a terrible (and extensive) life of persecution because of his horrible looks. Reduce his affliction to mere irritation, and suddenly a story that lives or dies on its psychological depths becomes mere superficial melodrama, and incoherent melodrama at that.Finally, the stage version was fantastically effective because of real, live, physical actors throwing themselves into this Gothic extravaganza with enough devotion and commitment to force it into greatness; and because the stunts (involving fire, and explosions, and real, athletic risks) were live and took place in a shared space -- the theater itself; and because the combination of the actors' skills and the genius of Director Harold Prince combined to give us a spectacle in which the actors' bodies (and the way they used the stage- space) became the eloquent, expressive complement to the vigorous gestures and energy of the music.In this movie, the soundtrack is weirdly dulled and blurred. The impact of physical motion, tension, and gesture is lost to endless chopping and cutting and vast close-ups of actors whose faces are, alas, not expressive at all: Christine looks dumbstruck all the time, Raoul's face has all the character of a kitchen cabinet door, and the poor Phantom has only part of his fact to act with anyway. Those faces are no substitute for the fluid interplay of expressive bodies in stage space: I think it would have taken a director of Prince's talents to have found some way of translating the enormous physicality of the live theater to something equally forceful on-screen; and on the evidence, Joel Schumacher is no Harold Prince.This movie is a watered-down, flattened-out, jangled-up travesty of a great show, not worth the ticket price unless you know for certain that you will never ever get to see the show in one of its persistent venues (New York, London -- where else?). Even so, if I were you I'd go listen to the OCR instead, or a tape of any of the versions of the stage show from around the world. You'll get a better idea from that of the huge punch the show packed from that than from any number of viewings of this gilded bore of a movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1199,jrivera76,"Great material, wrong lead.",7,13 February 2021,"The Phantom of the Opera did many things right, moving the chandelier falling towards the end made sense in that it gave the Phantom a way to escape with Christine. Changes in the wording of songs, or cutting the song length are common place when translating a stage musical to the big screen. So is moving the song placement. On the stage some songs are placed to allow for set changes or costume changes; this, of course, is not needed in a movie and the song can be moved to where it might fit better. Also moving songs can make for better story telling. In the stage version of West Side Story, as I remember, ""Officer Krupkie"" was sung right after the gang fight, while it instead was replaced with ""Cool"", and ""Officer Krupkie"" was moved to before the fight which made for a much better transition. All the song changes can be forgiven, even the falling of the chandelier.But the lead role of the Phantom needed a strong singer. Butler is not it. He can sing, but he was just not the right voice for the role. And his makeup didn't hide the fact that Butler is a good looking man. Without the right lead, the character who the movie is named after, the rest can't prop up the musical to the expectations of theater goers.",The Phantom of the Opera
1200,fightclubjack,phantom fans won't be disappointed!!!,10,23 December 2004,"while i can't compare it to the play (which i've seen three times now) the movie was without a doubt a perfect (in my opinion) adaptation (from the stage not the book obviously). and i don't just mean they kept to the script word for word or play by play, but they conveyed the same feelings/emotions. they did add a little extra here and there, but surprisingly i didn't mind at all because those little extra bits only made it better (i.e. the sword fight). its almost as if they were being considerate of the fans for once, because they barely changed anything at all, what they did was go more in depth with the story (i.e. explaining the phantoms origins). I absolutely loved this movie and plan on seeing it again very soon! if you love the stage version you will not be disappointed with the movie!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1201,JustJoe22,Best I've seen and heard yet!!,10,23 December 2004,"Wow!!!! That about sums it up for me. Emmy Rossum has an excellent voice. She was perfect in the role of Christine and her voice is better than the Christine in the original Broadway cast recording!! The rest of the cast was very good as well! I enjoyed the scene when Raoul and Christine were on the roof singing All I ask of you! That was a scene to remember! I hadn't heard anything good about Gerard Butler's voice but he did an exceptional job at the role of Phantom. Maybe not the best voice but hey at least his acting was on! Though some of the musical abilities for the cast were not all there, the movie was as good as the stage production in my book. I definitely will see this one again.",The Phantom of the Opera

I LOVED every second of it, and found myself mouthing the words along to the songs.The costumes were beautiful, and added great contrasts of dark and light in the different scenes. I also LOVED Emmy Rossum's performance. She acted so beautifully, and I immediately fell in love with her singing (my new goal is to sing as well as her =P ), and I was able to understand completely how Emmy Rossum's character, Christine, was drawn so helplessly to the Phantom, because I found myself swooning every time I saw the Phantom on the screen. I loved Gerard Butler's acting immensely, and felt that was he a wonderful Phantom.The only thing that confused me immensely, were the present day scenes, as I was confused who the old man was, and who the old lady was, and what had happened.But, overall, I loved it and can't wait for it to be on DVD!",The Phantom of the Opera

I've seen it also at the theatre, was a little apprehensive about watching the film, but bought my mum it on DVD and we watched it.. and LOVED it :o) But the film is not a direct copy of the theatre production, is its own interpretation of it, by the director, Joel Schumacher and with the help of Andrew Lloyd Webber - complete Genius ! Was amazed to find that they all sang themselves.. fabulous - fantastic ;o) Gerard Butler is gorgeous + marvellous as The Phantom :o) What an amazingly sexy voice, unaware of his talent !! Emmy Rossum is very good too as Christine, a simply stunning voice.. All brilliant! The settings are brilliant and look authentic, if you loved it at the theatre you should definitely give this a look.. Was a little apprehensive at the 'younger' cast, but was in the end the right choice, simply blew you away with their increasing talent. Couldn't have a chosen better actors/actresses, simply fitted the parts, perfectly !Same music as seen in the theatre production, but with a few new ones, but as a whole, is in its own league of filming and production. Could easily watch it over and over again.. which I have done ;o) he he! Definitely worth a watch.. ***** (5 stars)",The Phantom of the Opera
1204,miss5k,"for a movie adaptation, I was very pleased with the result",8,27 December 2004,"As with anything you see first on stage or read first in a book, you will find a laundry list of faults with any movie adaptation. There were several moments that I could have done without...the flashbacks in the black and white, the added backstory of the Phantom's horrible childhood as a freak in a sideshow...didn't appeal to me. However, for those who haven't seen the musical live on stage, these might be helpful in tying together all the pieces of such an amazing story. I personally felt the movie adaptation held much of the grandness, sadness, and joy that the stage version delivers. I felt both anger and pity towards Gerald Butler's version of the Phantom. (and wow, when he has that mask on....re-owww!) Minnie Driver clearly ate up the role of Carlotta, and her prowess for the Italian shrilling we love in that role was really remarkable. I expected something different from Raoul, but can't really put my finger on it...I think the gentleman handled the role well, but someone else could have really nailed it. Madame Giry was well casted and I think many people underestimate that role! Aside from the casting (oh and no, I didn't forget little Lottie, Christine was well played, what a set of pipes that girl has!! I just don't like Christine as a character...never really have...she needs to grow up, let go of the past, move on, and LEAVE THE operahouse...damn, go to Prague or something if someone is stalking you...), the movie left me satisfied. Despite the many comments I have heard about Masquerade being a bloated extravaganza, I LOVED that scene. I think it all comes down to whether you expect Michael Crawford and the chill you get as the chandelier comes crashing down over your head as you sit in the audience, or if you honestly can accept and appreciate the 2 dimensional version you are offered on screen. You can never replicate the feel of live, musical theater...but you can have a lot of fun trying. just my $0.02",The Phantom of the Opera
1205,qeylis,And I hate musicals!,10,24 January 2005,"I hated Moulin Rouge. I can't sit still during any musical re-made for the Big Screen. So when my wife said she wanted to see this movie, I was less than enthusiastic (on the inside, of course I pretended to be very excited in front of her :) I put it off by saying I don't want to drive for an hour to get to the only theater that was playing it in our County. But then it went in to wide release, and was playing in my town, I could avoid it no longer.But something odd happened while we were there... I loved it. This movie was great! Incredible visuals, Great acting, and uh, good singing. Yup, just good singing, and from Gerard Butler I would have to say barely adequate singing, but I hate musicals (on screen) so I didn't go for the singing. I have seen the play once in L.A. and I didn't understand a thing that was happening. But this time I understood everything. This is a great story, done in a great way. I gave it a 10.But here is the weird part. My wife, who loves musicals in any form, hated this movie. Her argument was based entirely on the fact that the leads (Girard, Emmy, and Patrick)were not the best singers, and Girard (the Phantom no less) could barely sing at all. I could not debate her on this point. So, if your going to the theater to see a great movie, this will fit the bill. If your going to this movie to see great singing, stay home and watch Moulin Rouge (I hate Moulin Rouge.)",The Phantom of the Opera

I couldn't move from my seat after the movie ended because it was so heart-touching, so inspiring, so passionate, so all-consuming! I sent my husband out to get new tickets.As soon as Emmy Rossum (Christine) began to sing, I was transported into the movie. She truly has the voice, the face, and the presence of an angel; she radiates the innocent heart of the character through every fiber of her being, bringing every note of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music to life. Gerard Butler (Phantom) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) were equal opposites; forceful, protective and sensual in their own unique ways, evoking emotions within me I hadn't felt in years!! This movie is a reminder that to really love is to really live! Minnie Driver, Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow are flawless with their witty dialogue, adding just the right touch of comedic spice to a savory delight! This movie was the perfect marriage of Direction, Cinematography, Costume and Casting. Two and a half hours of pure bliss for the eye and ear!! The genius of Andrew Lloyd Webber shines forth from this work brighter than all of his other creations combined. Want a good story to entertain you - SEE THIS MOVIE!

1207,TheBigHarv,Mediocre at best,3,26 December 2004,"I am a theatre nerd plain and simple I love all things theatre. i watched this Phantom of the opera and there are a few things just plain wrong with it. I will start with what was good; the Orcherstration was stellar the art direction was mind blowingly good. at this point my praises will halt. The phantom of the opera should have a phantom who can sing. period. He was acting up a storm but every time he opened his mouth I died a little. They should have forgone the handsome man in a little mask and went with a genius vocalist like Colm Wilkenson (if you don't know who that is give your head a shake) more on the phantom, how come you can see half his face most of the movie yet when the mask comes off he ear and half of his head is deformed... bad continuity girl, no more cocaine for you.Raoul was pretty... thats about it, I guess he could sing but I certainly had no interest if he lived or died. Christine was pretty... and could sing I guess. but smiling and looking vacant hurts to watch and something tells me it wasn't a choice.I hope RENT is worth watching, Schumacher ruined Batman, and now ruined one of the pinacles of the modern stage. why do they keep letting this moron near culture pieces.at least it had a decent sword fightWorth watching so you can appreciate how good it almost was.",The Phantom of the Opera
1208,nadvisors,Fabulous,10,29 December 2004,"A beautiful love story that runs true to the Broadway play. The Director (Joel Schumacher) fills in some gaps that the play leaves you wondering about... and the words are easier to understand compared to a live play where good sound can vary. Emmy Rossum is incredible. She is able to carry both the wide-eyed innocent girl and saucy vixen elements of her role. An honorable mention to Minnie Driver for her Diva role. Some have written negatively about this film; Trashing the lighting, the actors voices, and no Hollywood enhancement to the story line. From my viewpoint, they missed the point of this love story. It's a definite ""must see"" (and even better on the big screen for those cave scenes)!",The Phantom of the Opera
1209,Twitterpated,An excellent movie that deserves far more credit than it is getting!,10,5 January 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is easily the best film I've seen this year. I am a university student who is double majoring in Theatre & Film plus Cultural Studies, which means I have seen A LOT of films this year. That is why I am so confused by how insulting some critics have been to this film- it is completely unwarranted. If you go into the film thinking it's a horror movie than chances are you will be disappointed, but then it is advertised as a romantic musical, keep that in mind. If you liked the original musical than chances are you will like the movie. There have been some changes but they work to help the musical translate onto the big screen. For those who have not seen the musical, don't let yourselves be fooled by the naysayers, this is a must see movie! I've heard several excellent stage Phantoms and I would rank Gerard Butler's performance just as highly as them. His acting is phenomenal and I personally believe he deserved a Golden Globe nomination (as many of my fellow film students agree). Emmy Rossum is a great discovery as Christine and her chemistry with Butler is remarkable. Patrick Wilson is the perfect Raoul and makes the character more dynamic than any Raoul I've ever seen. The costumes and sets are outstanding, with certain scenes likely to take your breath away. The music is gorgeous and adds to the luscious feel of the production. I advise everyone to see it at least once...chances are you'll want to see it again!",The Phantom of the Opera

1211,aussiefrog,The Phantom a ghost of the original,7,22 July 2005,"I awaited with extreme impatience for the film release of one of the greatest musicals of recent years.In many respects, the film was superior to the stage production, which I saw in Sydney in the very early 90's - mostly due to the availability of special effects, technology and precise placing of shots, whilst a staging demands a continuous flow from scene to scene.The production, sets and costuming were immaculate, the direction ranged from good to the sublime, and of course the music was glorious, beautifully adapted to the immaturity of the Christine's (Emmy Rossum) voice - Sarah Brightman was an experienced, trained classical singer and it would be unfair to expect the same power and richness to be present in Emmy's voice at just 17 years of age. Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was a glorious surprise - who would have suspected that he would have such a voice. It was so very enjoyable to see his character given greater prominence in the film.The major disappointment, and the only item holding the film back form a 10 out of 10, was the unbelievably poor performance by The Phantom (Gerard Butler). Usually a wonderful actor to watch, in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" he was wooden and clumsy - when he's supposed to be seducing Christine into his den of musical delights, he seems rather to be dragging a reluctant student to the headmaster. The tortured soul of the genius Phantom is nowhere to be found, rather we see a spoilt little boy having temper-tantrums when he doesn't get the toys he wants.All of which could have been excusable, if his singing wasn't so absolutely appalling. In this day and age where we have the technical brilliance to change a bad voice to a #1 hit, why was so little attention paid to poor Butler. Beside his apparently complete lack of ability to colour his voice with emotions or dynamics (except ""loud"" or ""soft""), there were far too many occasions when his singing was just plainly flat. It was an excruciating pain to anyone who has truly enjoyed the original music and productions. Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady"" had her singing dubbed, so (even though this was a very expensive [$95 M] independent production) couldn't the same have been done here? Sorry, Messieurs Schumacher & Lloyd-Webber, but your casting here was a horrible flaw that has dragged down the luster of an otherwise exquisitely beautiful production.",The Phantom of the Opera
1212,dorothy-26,The film was absolutely brilliant and all the actors were excellent,10,8 April 2006,"I thought the film was great, and Gerard Butler as the Phantom was excellent. He had a lovely voice and was very believable as the sad man hiding away in the cellar of the opera house. all the cast were excellent in their different parts, but I thought that Patrick Wilson was outstanding and was well matched playing against Gerard Butler. I have watched it a few times since I bought it as I can't get enough of the beautiful singing and the story. I know there have been a lot of comment that the part should have gone to Michael Crawford, and he is an excellent singer and actor,but I think that Andrew LLOyd Webber was right to give the part to Gerard Butler as he was excellent and did Justice to the part of the phantom fantastic.",The Phantom of the Opera

As soon as the overture, that piece of music created by a genius started I was hooked. The costumes and set's is a feast for the eyes, especially the phantom's lair. Carlotta has some particularly wonderful outfits to wear. I personally think the choice of cast is brilliant and all the voices are suited to the roles, as I know them. (I've never seen this on stage but have wanted to for years and know the story.) Gerald Butler makes a wonderful (and sexy) Phantom, and, when his heart breaks after 'All I Ask Of You' you'll feel for him. The only think you have to watch out for is how you view the movie. Remember this is a musical as a movie not just a movie. There are a few moments when it is very clearly a musical and some people may not appreciate that.

And the most beautiful part is that every time I watch this film -and trust me, that's a lot- all these emotions come out again. There are some things that could be better but no one is perfect. :) Some of my friends hate musicals but when they saw this movie they thanked me, and yes, they were crying too!

Very over the top, but thats Carlotta.I cant describle how Brilliant this film is. If you haven't seen it yet...what are you doing sitting at home reading this review? Get out and go see it!

Sometimes I am disappointed, but not this time. I was thoroughly entertained. I enjoyed this movie so much, that I did something I have never done before in my 47 years - I went to see it again on the same day! (I usually have to wait several years before I desire to see most movies again, much to my wife's dismay.) This movie now joins the list of my other movie 'greats' such as The Princess Bride; Ladyhawke; Annie; Gladiator; Lord of the Rings Trilogy; Noises Off; The Passion of The Christ & Chicago, to name just a few I saw more than once.When it comes to operatic singing, I tend to be overly critical. The only person I know who sings better than Sarah Brightman is my daughter, Crystal. I have always been scared by the price of theatre tickets, and the only actual theatre performance I ever went to was Cats, many years ago. I had been introduced to Andrew Lloyd Webber's music while in high school when I bought Jesus Christ Superstar on cassette and proceeded to wear it out. Since that time I have bought most of his work and everything that Sarah Brightman has recorded that I can get my hands on  I was smitten by her voice!So how did this movie version of Phantom of the Opera compare to the recordings I have? Wow! You don't even have to keep your eyes open to enjoy this movie, the beautiful voices, especially Christine's (Emmy Rossum) is so incredible, it can bring tears of overwhelming joy. All of the singers excel here, even the woman who sings Minnie Driver's parts. But you will want to keep your eyes open, because this movie is a feast for the eyes; the opera hall, costumes, makeup, wow!

1219,slvrcharmbrclet,Absolutely Stunning,10,22 January 2005,"From the powerful, haunting music in the opening as the old, black and white Paris Opera House turns back to rich color in the days of Christine Haae, to the rose with that black ribbon tied to it laying on her grave many years later at the end of the film, this music is indulging. The visual effects are simply breath-taking, along with the loud and emotional singing of the lovely voice of the movie's center: Christine. She's naught but a silent dancer in the beginning, but throughout the movie's progression she finds her way on stage singing and with her love, Raol. She also, however, finds herself dripping with distant passion with none other than the Phantom of the Opera. His name is never given, of course, and he's a murderous, yet protagonist character. He haunts the opera house, but thrives for flesh and someone to love him and his distorted face. The emotional ups and downs almost made me cry, which is saying something. Every bit of detail was laced with obvious intricacy and pride. How could someone not be proud of this movie? I'm proud of it... and I had nothing to do with the making of it! I read just yesterday that it received two popcorn tubs out of the honorable four possible.

The vibrant and dramatic costumes were breathtaking,similar to the ones in Moulin Rouge, (another fantastic musical) which takes place in Paris in about the same time period. Except the ""Phantom"" takes place in an Opera house, not a whorehouse. The casting was excellent. Rossum (Christine) was ideal; Butler (Phantom) was truly hot and perfect for the part of the phantom. No matter what people say about his singing voice, how it doesn't fit the part or it's not all that great, well they are just ""ignorant fools!"" as the phantom would say. Butler has an astounding voice that I can't stop hearing inside my head. Wilson (Raoul) isn't my favorite but I have to admit he portrays his character well. His singing goes along with his pretty face. His hair I wasn't to fond of; in all he wasn't all that attractive but the poor guy is being compared Gerard Butler. The songs were brilliant! They stay in your head and that's a good thing. I am astonished that Minnie Driver's song, ""Learn To Be Lonely"" didn't win an Oscar and that she didn't even get to sing it at the Academy Awards!!!

But only after a few minutes, all doubt was erased from my mind. The film has truly everything you need in a movie: action, romance,comedy,drama...and let's not forget singing! Emmy Rossum's voice was superb and the best of the film. Her voice is much more...innocent and younger sounding then Sarah Brightman which obviouslysuits her character. Gerard Butler was fantastic, his performance was much more brutal and raw than Michael Crawford's, this also suited the character. I can admit though that Crawford has a much better voice. Patrick Wilson was great, he had a nice voice and did his best with the little material he received. Minnie Driver stole every scene and is the sole contributer of comedy!

To make matters significantly worse, The Phantom Couldn't Sing!!! Everyone else I could bear, but the Phantom absolutely sucked! The thing that bothered me the most more than anything at all was how badly everyone lip-synced. I mean, they're singing opera- they should be opening their mouths a bit more than a quarter of an inch wide. Then, the costumes were lousy compared to the play. You can notice this especially during the ""masquerade"" scene. The phantom especially comes out in this lame costume that can't even compare to the one he wears in the play. I mean, it's a movie- don't they have any funding?

The cast is a blend of promising younger talent and veteran film actors such as Miranda Richard, Simon Callow, Minnie Driver--who stepped out of the mold to masterfully portray the fiery-tempered Carlotta. I didn't go see this right away because of initial lukewarm reviews. Critics were particularly hard on lead character Gerard Butler, who is Scottish which gives a slight dimension to his voice we may not be used to in the USA. Mr Butler succeeds at portraying the terribly tragic character, not to mention he makes a devastatingly handsome Phantom. Scenes are visually stunningcostumes, set design and purposeful choreography, most notably the Masquerade party stands out --one to rival At the Races in My Fair Lady. The artful costumes and sets are also similar to Emma (1996). This film does justice to the classic novel written by Gaston Leroux, on which the stage and screen stories are set.",The Phantom of the Opera
1225,kb-51,its amazing...period,10,19 February 2005,"I am a major theatre dork and although i had never seen the stage play of this my friends were huge fans of it and told me that Emmy rossum who plays Christine would be amazing and Gerard Butler would be horrible. so i went to see it and it completely blew me away. the scenery and costumes were perfect the music was absolutely beautiful and i was surprised by the performances. Minnie Driver was hilarious as Carlotta. Patrick Wilson though who played Raoul seemed to play it with no facial expressions and seemed to have hardly any emotion most of the time. Emmy rossum was also a bit of a disappointment. there's no arguing how amazing her voice is thats true but people seem to think that when you're in a musical thats all that matters. she is definitely lacking on her emotions in some points and her facial expressions consisted of two. then there was Gerard butler who when i first heard his voice seemed not to have betrayed my friend's statement of him being horrible. but as soon as he actually appeared in the phantom song there was something about him that really drew you in as the movie went on i found myself not really caring so much about the other characters and just waiting for him to come back on. Gerard butler was absolutely amazing and completely blew away my expectations his voice was good but with what he put into it he made it amazing he played it with so much compassion. he made you pity, love and hate him all at the same time i cant even put into words what an amazing actor he is and he deserves A lot more credit then what hes getting it was unbelievable how he wasn't nominated for a golden globe for this role and I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan of him because i had no idea who he was before this and now I'm one of his biggest fans",The Phantom of the Opera

The costumes were beautiful and the choreography fantastic.Being the musical theatre type I was bound to love this film, however I recommend you see it even if you haven't seen a musical before.

I went in to this movie a little biased because I love the Broadway production and I love the Original Cast Soundtrack. I came out of the movie very much impressed. I was mesmerized from the opening scene which is absolutely brilliant to the closing scene which was very touching. The cast was incredible. I was amazed to learn that they all (except Minnie Driver as Carlota, who later does sing the beautiful song in the closing credits) did their own singing. The effects were amazing. The costumes were beautiful. The music perfect! I can't wait to see it again and again. It has made me an even bigger fan of The Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
1228,calyth,"If only they stuck more with the play, and find a much better phantom voice",7,6 July 2005,"If you haven't seen the play before, this movie should provide a good background. Emmy Rossum stood out, even though at the first singing scene it seems that she's out of sync (so most likely she didn't sing the actual thing... it's doubtful any of the actors could). Reason for my complaint is that if you actually owned the Phantom of the Opera with the original London cast, and the included script in the CD cover, you should figure that the Phantom should be a character much more formidable than Raoul. The Opera Ghost should have _NEVER_ lost a sword fight with Raoul, and not even close to having Christine letting him live. Also the singing of the Phantom has too much bass, and not really charming or captivating. The Phantom's singing voice should entrance Christine, it it came across as a bass singing the Phantom's part. Michael Crawford (the original London cast Phantom) has a lot more range. And what's the deal with making the Phantom less magical? For example, sometime between the end of Masquerade, the Graveyard scene and before the Don Juan performance, there should've been a Don Juan rehearsal where the piano seems magically playing the score perfectly, and everyone would somehow magically fall in line and sing their parts very well. Also when the Phantom lasso's Raoul, the end of the rope should hang in midair. The Phantom is all about a scarred, tormented man who seems like a ghost, and sometimes perform things that ""are not fully explained"" as the Auctioneer has commented.Besides these faults, and a minor shifting of the breaking chandelier (which made no sense when the Phantom sang ""there are worse thing than a broken chandelier""), it's a pretty good adaptation. I'm looking forward to watching the real play.",The Phantom of the Opera
1229,chale78,The Phantom of the Opera vs. the critics,10,22 January 2005,"I have read quite a few of the reviews for Phantom and a lot of them started by saying that the critic really wasn't a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber or any of his works. Why then would they waste everyone's time with writing a review that wasn't going to be a good one no matter how good the movie really was?? Personally, I think the Phantom of the Opera was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time, and I think that this movie has received way too much bad publicity from critics who probably wouldn't like any version of the phantom except the 1927 Lon Chaney version anyway. Regardless of who made it. I have seen the silent version of Phantom 4 times and I have to say it was very good as well in a totally different way. (I am an old movie buff up to and including silent films) Too Bad film critics couldn't have a silent era of their own. I rated the movie a 10.

1230,bryonyw,So bad I had tears rolling down my cheeks,2,21 December 2004,"Really, this film is so spectacularly bad that I laughed out loud on several occasions. Christine was like an open-mouthed zombie and the staging (was there any) was so drab and boring. Film is a really exciting medium to use for theatre productions but this one decided to stick stubbornly to the theatre design and was consequently really dull. The singing was not great and the only highlight was Minnie Driver being totally over the top (and quite good). I had seen the trailer for this movie and it looked quite colourful and exciting but was actually a pretty painful experience - I laughed so much my sides hurt. Besides which, any girl who won't get her frock wet to save her lover is not worth a grain of salt!",The Phantom of the Opera
1231,munchylot,Great...Except,5,4 June 2005,"Great set, great songs, great cinematography, great story! The acting wasn't half bad either but... It was missing something. It skipped over a lot of possible character development. For example, the blonde girl (daughter), was mentioned briefly now and then but then would disappear for a while not returning for a long time. At the end of this movie i was singing the songs but really was left, not caring particularly for the fate of the characters. Not to mention the big gaps in the movie! For example, at one point Christine and Raoul are just old friends and flirtatious and then! It's a year later and it turns out their completely in love. Either way everyone was great except the director. There I said it but really dude you had this movie handed over to you on a silver platter and you STILL messed it up. Oh well. Nice try.",The Phantom of the Opera
1232,lotrrox-1,Ah I love the Phantom,10,18 February 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is a wonderful movie/musical, with an awesome cast. Gerard Butler does a wonderful job as Erik (the Phantom), and I personally think he is better than the original Phantom, Michael Crawford. Emmy Rossum has a truly wonderful voice, and I really do think she could be described as an ""Angel of Music"". Carlotta was quite amusing, I liked the scene when she croaked like a toad. Raoul was a good character, although I didn't particularly like his hair... I really like the way they put the music in the scenes, and I thought there was a lot of great acting in this movie. Overall, this is just another movie I am obsessed with and am going to have to see twenty or more times!",The Phantom of the Opera
1233,Bamagirl703,I Loved This Movie,8,3 January 2005,"After reading previous reviews for Phantom of the Opera I really didn't know what to expect. But as I watched this film i fell in love with it. It was the best movie i have seen all year. I don't understand how people can say bad things about Gerard Butler's voice, I mean you won't ever find another Michael Crawford true, but Gerard did a very good job. The way he sung is something different from we have originally heard, but it was fantastic! Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were outstanding also as Christine and her childhood sweetheart Raoul. I recommend this movie for Phantom Fans AND the general public as well. I guarantee that anyone who sees this film, whether they loved it or hated it will walk out of that theater with "" Music of the Night"" or "" All I Ask Of You"" stuck in their head. I give this movie 10/10 stars. Two thumbs way, way up!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1234,madwriterdkb,I was blown away,10,22 December 2004,"I have seen the stage production with Hugh Pantaro (I don't think I was born yet when the original was going on), I'm halfway through the book, and there are many things in this film that could have been easily fine tuned, but I'm still in a daze.I cried a lot during this, and while one of my friends think the Phantom was murdered (figuratively), I've never felt such love and compassion for a character or person before.The opening scene with the chandelier could/should have been longer since it's the best part. Gerald is very haunting and does a beautiful job showing his loneliness. Emmy has a beautiful singing voice and does a great job with Christine. Patrick also has a gorgeous voice and I think he's better in this than he was in Angels in America. Miranda is a perfect choice for Mme Giry, Minnie is hilarious as Carlotta, and while Meg is a bit too busty, she's very good.In order to really love this movie, you need to throw away any knowledge you have of the theater or anything that might appear in the film. It will only make it bad. Shut off the critical part of your brain and absorb what everyone is saying.I wish I could give this an 11, or even a 15. If you don't like theatre or long movies, don't see it. If you can manage to avoid criticising it, see it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1235,bradfordninja,"Nothing new, but still enjoyable",1,22 January 2005,"I saw Phantom last night and enjoyed it, but I don't think it brought anything new to the musical movie genre like Chicago and Moulin Rouge recently have. I felt (like int he opening and the Masquerade scene especially) like it was a pale imitation of two films that have been extremely successful.I was genuinely disappointed with Christene and the Phantom's voices. She looks the part, but she couldn't sing it. I felt like they went for a more contemporary/pop approach with Christene's singing, and I'm sure this is because she is not trained to sing opera. This pop sound works with Moulin Rouge and Chicago because they are very contemporary shows - Phantom is more classical (even though it was written in the 80's) and Cristene's performance is supposed to reflect that period's style of singing (very choral and powerful). I also felt like any time she was supposed to have real vocal power the music would swell and drown her out. The Phantom just shouted when he was supposed to sing loud. Hmm.I felt like they tried to make the show as a whole more conversational and have the music flow in and out of dialouge more naturally, but this isn't how the show is supposed to work. It is a very typical, straight-forward musical and they should accept that and not try to conform to what they think people want to see.I also feel like the two lead's weaker vocals forced the filmmakers to use the chandelier and visual stunts to stimulate climax in scenes, when it should be powerful singing. The show was written for huge voices, and I know there are loads of people out there who could sing it better than the current Christene and Phantom. In a movie like this you hire singer-actors, not actor-singers.I thought Patrick Wilson as Raul was great, and so was Minne Driver. The Costumes and sets were all amazing also. Overall I enjoyed it and I'm glad it was made. I'd give a 7 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1236,compukat57,Incredible,10,23 December 2004,"Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera is the most exciting, intense, emotional movie I have seen in a long time. The live production is amazing in its own right; however, the film explores deeper into the storyline, and in my opinion, displays more emotion. You can really identify with the characters, feel their pain, love, and pity. The superb cast did an amazing job of acting and singing. Yes, singing. An avid musical watcher, I would rate this a 10 on the talent chart. Some have commented that the Phantom is lacking a deep verbose voice, but he makes up for it with intense passion. This is a movie for everyone, and if you are a hopeless romantic, I guarantee you will fall in love with Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
1237,kelia-1,"Emotionally Stirring,Visually Stunning",10,14 January 2006,"***Contains Spoilers***Why this movie did not receive more positive reviews is beyond me.It is one of the most dazzling,mesmerizing movies I have ever seen.Gerard Butler as the Phantom is hypnotic,he shows the Phantom as the tormented genius who nurtures the raw talent of Christine(Emmy Rossen).Butler gives the Phantom the kind of depth required for a movie,and give more of his background as well is explained.The Phantom is disfigured on one side of his face,hence the one-sided mask.Today he would be an ideal candidate for Nip/Tuck and he would have a normal life.Actually given the Phantom's genius he would have a far above average life.Instead he creates a life in the underground sewers of Paris that shows what the world would have gained by his talent. He is Christine's taskmaster and it pays off for her.Truly she would never have half the success that comes to her without him.Butler is intense,edgy,angry,tender and sympathetic as the great tormented man,he is too intelligent for his time and circumstances.Life and people have not treated him well but he goes on creating.Emmy Rossen's Christine follows the Phantom's direction well but then becomes torn between the Phantom and her childhood friend Raoul.Patrick Wilson does well and even adds a bit to the thankless role of Raoul.He is meant to be the classic,dashing hero and while he is not a bad guy one can not help but resent that he is even there,as he gets in the way of the real love story between the Phantom and Christine.No doubt I easily would have gone for the Phantom.Emmy Rossen does well as Christine although she is a bit young for the role.Butler,Wilson and Rossen all deliver stunning vocal performances.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is very good at providing the comic relief.Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry and Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry are the most interesting characters after Gerard Butler's Phantom.It is worth watching-visually it's dazzling and lush and highly detailed but the real triumph is how deeply it reaches the viewer emotionally.I give it 10/10 .",The Phantom of the Opera
1238,suwannee79,Wonderful stage to screen ADAPTATION,10,7 February 2005,"I have capitalized the word ADAPTATION in my review title to emphasize the fact that this is a film interpretation of the stage show - not a direct imitation. People expecting to view an exact stage to screen version of this musical will probably be disappointed. HOWEVER, if you are willing to watch this film with an open mind you will see that it is still the same story with the same wonderful music with only a few modifications. The biggest change was the decision to move the chandelier crash to the end of the film. In my opinion this was a smart move as it wouldn't make sense to have the climax of the story occur in the middle of the film. It works for the stage as it's an amazing end to the first act, it gets everyone excited for the second half of the show. In a movie there is no intermission to separate the chandelier crash from Masquarade so it would be kaboom! chandelier crash wham! Masquarade - there's nowhere to go but down if the story is kept in the original order. Another change is the sword fight sequence which has been added to the graveyard scene. While I think the Phantom shooting fireballs in the movie would have been laughable, it is slightly annoying that here Raoul has the chance to defeat the Phantom but doesn't - only to immediately sing about a plan to capture the Phantom. There was also the choice to speak some lines that were previously sung. I personally don't mind the changes, in some ways I think it makes the meaning of those phrases stand out. In particular Christine and Raoul's part in Masquarade - to me the line ""it's an engagement not a crime"" seems more forceful when spoken.In regards to the actors, Emmy Rossum, while sometimes a little tight vocally, has a clear sweet voice that is fitting for the age of the character which is only 16 years old. While I prefer the strength of Sarah Brightman's voice, her overdone vibrato has always bothered me and in that respect Rossum is a breath of fresh air! Patrick Wilson shows why he was nominated for two Tony Awards, his voice is melodic and beautiful. He also brings strength to a sometimes flimsy character.Gerard Butler is incredible! He has received a lot of harsh criticism for his voice, but he freely admits that he's no Michael Crawford and that they were trying to make a different and darker version of the play. True his voice is rough, but it is fitting for someone who can be murderously insane. If you listen carefully enough you can hear at the start of the movie his voice is softer, kinder, and smoother. As the movie progresses and his character becomes more and more anguished and bitter his voice becomes rougher and matches the Phantom's turmoil, all the way to the end where he finally breaks. His voice may be rough but it fits the character better than a technically perfect voice - who would still sing perfectly while they were filled with rage? Butler's emotional range is huge, and people who say his acting is flat must be missing the fine subtlety he can project with one glance of his tortured gaze, one drop of his head in utter despair. His ability to scream in anger followed immediately by a whispered heart wrenching plea is a painfully beautiful moment to witness. To be able in one moment to sing beautifully clear, and in the next moment allow his voice to crack with sadness or anger is imperfectly perfect. We should be filled with disgust at the Phantom's actions and yet we can't because Gerard Butler is able to show us what we know is really inside the Phantom - a man who murders and seems consumed by hatred, but in truth is simply lonely and yearns to be loved.",The Phantom of the Opera

This is by far the most beautiful and amazing movie I have ever seen. The music is beautiful, performed by a cast of wonderful singers and an amazing orchestra, it's much more powerful than it could ever be on stage. The visuals are unparalleled, and will never be surpassed. The story and music seem to haunt you long after the movie is over. From the breathtaking opening scene (which I don't want to ruin for those who haven't seen it), to the heart-wrenching end, it is pure magic on screen.Whether or not you have seen the stage show, read the book, or know the story, you have to see this movie. The cast and crew did a wonderful job of making a movie version of the stage show that can be equally enjoyed by old 'phans' and newcomers alike.

1240,DELBERT101,What were they thinking?,4,2 May 2005,"It has been a while since I've seen this show on stage, and even then I was a bit disappointed. It probably doesn't help that I've also listened to the original cast recording featuring Sara Brightman and Michael Crawford. As far as being true to the stage adaptation, the movie sits well with me. The sets, costumes and general cinematography is actually above par... and even the orchestrations are gorgeous! Though, when you start to focus on the actual talent, the movie really begins to lag.I know that this is a very demanding show vocally and am impressed at the attempts made by this particular cast. I just don't know what they were thinking when they were casting the parts for the phantom and Christine. Out of the entire cast, these two characters really stood out... With Christine, vocally, she has some really beautiful moments... and then there are other times where either her interpretation of the piece was just all wrong or her style just wasn't there. As far as the phantom, I was utterly disappointed. Through most of the show he sings in straight-tone (no vibrato) and I sometimes feared that he was going to crack when reaching for some of the phantom's wonderfully high notes. I'll give him credit for a couple of scenes that he just nailed, but 75% of the time I wanted to walk away.There's no doubt in my mind that this cast has talent... The supporting roles were wonderful. But Christine and the phantom need to either do some serious work, or find another role more suited for their voice.I am also disappointed with some of the decisions made for the on-screen adaptation. If you have listened to the cast recording, then you know that almost the entire show is set to music with the actors and actresses singing almost every line. However, on the screen... some of the wonderful moments were taken away while the actors spoke the lines over the instrumentation... such scenes would be where Raoul enters Christine's dressing room after a show and says something along the lines of ""Little lotte let her mind wonder..."" There are other such moments in the show that really just lose some of their magic... And I'm not even going to start on the additions that they chose to make turning this show that was beautiful in its original form into some kind of... they just tried to hard it seems in some respects and not hard enough in others...It definitely doesn't stand against other adaptations, like Chicago... and I definitely won't recommend it quite as much as I would the other. Then again, I guess if you haven't heard the original cast and you have no previous knowledge of the original Broadway version, then you might enjoy the show.I'm just sayin', with so much talent out there and with such a good show already... what were they thinking' with casting and plot ideas... Oh well, I guess we can hope for more with the latest adaptation of Dream Girls...",The Phantom of the Opera
1241,Bohemia69,I truly hope that this film will inspire more people to attend an actual Opera,5,23 December 2004,"Yesterday I ventured into West Los Angeles to see this film. Well..... Thank God We had the 1970 Beverly Sills recording of Verdi's opera La Traviata in the car to listen to afterwards as a form of musical therapy. I know This is a film forum, but I feel that it is so absolutely necessary to comment on Weber's score before I go on about the film.If one has ever been to see an Opera, a REAL OPERA, not musical theatre that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up, one cannot help but notice the similarities between certain passages of Weber's music to those in Several Puccini Operas. The most obviously is the direct lifting of the melody from Puccini's opera La Fanciulla del West. The opening lines of the duet ""Quello che tacete"" between characters Dick Johnson and Minnie is used for the song ""Music of the Night."" You will also recognize highlights from Puccini's Gianni Schicci, and Turendot. The huge Masquerade chorus is another example.

1242,danvath-1,"Could have been a little better, but that's saying a lot.",8,25 December 2004,"I have been a fan of the original soundtrack, and the stage production, for several years. I first bought the soundtrack in 1987, and have seen the stage production twice (and will see it a third time this coming summer).I must say that I was first horrified to find that film was being directed by Joel Schumacher, as I've long considered him to be one of the most over-rated directors. I've felt this way for so long that I don't even remember why I dislike him so much. Obviously, that says more about myself than of him.Mr. Schumacher, I apologize for all the bad things I've said about you.The film was by no means perfect, but it was unlikely that anyone could have made it perfect in my mind. My major nitpicks are as follows: Too many of opening lines of songs were spoken instead of sung. (And for some odd reason, the Phantom's command of ""Go now! Go now, and leave me!"" was sung instead of bellowed.) Too much of the backstory was spelled out, instead of left to the audience to learn on their own, or simply left to the imagination. Similarly, the cuts to the elderly Raoul were particularly annoying to me, especially since they only served to show that he and Christine had lived a long and presumably happy life together subsequent to the ""tragic affair"". A happy ending made obvious for the unimaginative.Less annoying, while Gerard Butler's voice itself was adequate, it was not as evocative as I would have liked. While the character could probably have been better cast, it is likely that whomever it was would have paled in comparison to Michael Crawford, in my mind at least. That being said, I feel Mr. Butler's performance as the titular character was (merely) sufficient.Contrarily, Emmy Rossum was perfect for the role of Christine, and I was surprised at how much I liked the character of Raoul in this production. They were both wonderful.Also, the cinematography was simply gorgeous, and the special effects without fault.Other than the quibbles above, I felt that this film was very faithful to the stage production many of us have loved for all these years. Specifically, the three most emotional parts; ""All I Ask of You"", ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", and the climax, were all beautifully done and fully evoked the emotions that they were meant to: tears of joy, sadness, and of tragedy.I will watch this again.",The Phantom of the Opera

The thing about Phantom living all of his life in the Opera House annoyed me most. There was much else in his (long!) life before Christine, and they were all important for the character. And if you have included the torture chamber with mirrors, you must also include Persia! Other thing was the face. The whole POINT of the story, and it was so lame!

I understand why some people would dislike it --as it does not match some small parts of the musical--but that is most of its splendor and appeal.

The singers were, I thought, extremely talented, and Gerard Butler held his own as the title character--especially since he had no previous training! And personally, I thought Emmy Rossum was simply outstanding both dramatically and vocally. I loved the beauty of this film, and it was wonderfully put-together and enormously satisfying.

His hair did however provide some interesting disscussiions :-)It is however Gerard Butler who stands out, his phantom delivers everythingneeded for the role, agony, anger, mystery and passion. although a huge fan of Michael Crawford (who originated the role), I think Gerard is perfect for the role, anyone who is a fan of the stage show should not be disappointed, despitereviews to the contrary.",The Phantom of the Opera
1248,darle12000,i saw it...,10,20 December 2004,and i really enjoyed it I don't know what the British critics saw.The Phantom's disfigurement wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.Gerard's singing on the soundtrack did sound weak but when I heard him singing on film it did sound good.The beginning of the film where the chandelier started to rise did take my breath away and also when the chandelier dropped.Minnie driver was funny and patrick Wilson was really good as Raoul and Emmy Rossum played the part well as Christine you really did feel for her and also Gerard butler as the Phantom had me in tears at the end.Sorry I haven't really said much but I know for sure i will be seeing it again.,The Phantom of the Opera
1249,rofloyd-1,Great movie - Exceedingly well done,10,23 December 2004,"Although not Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum did an outstanding job of bringing Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and lyrics to the screen in a dazzling performance. Emmy Rossum in particular was a perfect fit for the role of Christine. Talented, beautiful and only 18, I'm sure we will be hearing a great deal more from this amazing young lady. The whole cast was way above average and Minnie Driver's Carlotta was excellent. Add to this talent the great staging and special effects, and you have a most enjoyable show. Kudos to the producers and, in particular, to the director, Joel Schumacher for a great accomplishment and a most entertaining and enjoyable movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

I knew this movie may be good, but like wow.The story was well presented from begging right to the very end. The singing and music was excellent. Even people that don't care for Opera would like this move. No doubt this is the best movie version ever done in presenting this great love story.I'm not sure who I liked best, the Phantom or Christine. Both performances were great. This one is well worth seeing again.Definitely Recommended.Burt",The Phantom of the Opera

I thought that this movie is not as good as the show and that the casting of the phantom was bad however the performance of Patrick Wilson as Raoul was very good and he had a great showing. the leading lady was much to be desired all though she had her strong points and was not nearly as poor as the phantom. I think this movie was worth seeing if you are a fan of the show but otherwise don't waste your time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1252,mango-maven,Excellent film!!,7,23 December 2004,"Who would have thought that Joel Schumacher could have directed such an amazing film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera?"" I must admit, I had my serious doubts.I have been a fan of the musical since it first came out, but even I had to admit that the musical was a bit schmaltzy and never really made sense at times. The two things that saved the musical in my opinion were the musical score (even though the ""Overture"" by now has become such a cliché, it still gives chills), and Michael Crawford's amazing acting and singing that was the basis for all future phantoms in the stage productions.I bought the soundtrack to the ""Phantom"" movie, with Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, before watching the movie, and was absolutely outraged. The singing seemed at best amateur. And then I saw photos from the movie.. the phantom was sexy-looking???!! A prospective James Bond was playing the part of the phantom??! But here goes... I saw the movie last night, and it was fantastic. Granted, you have to be one to like musicals since almost everything is sung, and if you don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, this movie will probably not fly for you. But if you are open-minded about these things, and can let yourself get taken in by the opulence of the set and the lush score, you will not be disappointed.There have been changes from stage to screen, for the better in my opinion. While some songs have been taken out, more background (for example on where the phantom came from, on and Christine and Raoul's childhood together) has been put in that makes the storyline a lot more smooth and understandable. Christine and Raoul are younger than in the musical, as they were in the book. Some of the obstacles Raoul goes through in his attempt to catch the phantom are straight from the book as well. There are, though, big differences between the film and the book (for example, the ending), but on the whole I found the original story much more recognizable in this film version than in the musical.But Gerard Butler's interpretation of the phantom was what really stood out for me. I never thought that I would ever fully accept a phantom other than Michael Crawford. But there he was, with a decidedly different take on the phantom, and I dug it. He doesn't have the voice that Crawford has, but he makes it work. Don't be misled by the soundtrack -- when you watch the movie and listen to the music, there is so much expression in his voice and acting that you don't even think about any of the vocal shortcomings. The climactic final showdown in the phantom's lair is absolutely heart-wrenching.I also enjoyed the supporting cast. I bought into the love story between Raoul and Christine, which was not so convincing in the stage musical. Minnie Driver was over the top as the prima donna ""La Carlotta,"" but not annoyingly so (although I could see others disagreeing). Perhaps the real star of the movie, aside from Gerard Butler, is the whole set in general -- the recreation of a Paris Opera house from the late 1800's.See this movie. If you can deal with people singing their dialogue, you will enjoy this one.",The Phantom of the Opera
1253,Selyna39,"A Magnificent Interpretation-A Feast for the Eyes, Heart and Ears",10,10 January 2005,"What a refreshing interpretation of a much adored Musical. ALW's choice for the lead roles has brought about much controversy. But having seen MANY different stage actors portray these parts. I have found this cast to be the most unique. They give us an enriching journey into the hearts of the characters. This film touches your very soul. Each actor, and what they bring to the roles, are extremely talented and I feel ALW (listening to his comments)got everything he always wanted for his incredible creation. Emmy Rossem (Christine)has a sweet,innocent, quality to her voice, just as a 16 yr old ingénue, just starting out, should have. It is soothing and melodic to the ears.(Unlike other actresses portraying this role). Patrick Wilson,(Raoul)What a heavenly vocal choice. I could listen to him sing all day. He brings a very ""Prince Charmingish"" style to this part. The gentle, protective, leading male. Minnie Driver, this lady was the perfect spoiled ""Diva"". I absolutely adored her in this role. Extremely funny and just over the top as it was meant to be. but not to much over the top. And then there's ""The Phantom"", Gerard Butler. I will admit I was a little skeptical of who they were looking at to fill MC shoes. I was upset with some of the rumors. But to my immense elation. Gerard Butler has shot to the top of the list as my favorite Phantom and he will be a tough act to follow. He was absolutely mesmerizing!! I thoroughly enjoyed this totally different interpretation of the Phantom character. I completely understood why ALW chose this man for the part. The powerful sensual,rawness of his voice, both when spoken or sung.The passion in his face. Mr. Butler gave you an open window into ""Eriks"" soul. He gave the Phantom a whole new look and sound. Something I really wanted to see. The rest of the cast was WONDERFUL! The sets lavish. All the singers and dancers were great (especially the gentlemen performing the solo number, as well as in the front line, on the staircase, to the audiences right side during the Masquerade number - He really stood out and was enjoyable to watch. This is a ""Beautiful"" film. Joel Schumacher really out did himself on this one. As always the music stays with you when it's over. And the more times you see it, the more you are mystified and compelled to see it again and again...... Go back to the days when movies swept you away. Don't miss this one!!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1254,HermioneLMS,Chances are you'll like this movie and you won't be too disappointed,9,2 January 2005,"Finally the moment we've all been waiting for the famous Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom of the Opera is 1/10 of the usual Broadway price. YEAH!!! And it is definitely worth it. As you can guess from any production stills the sets and props are perfectly elaborate and lovely. The Paris Opera house is so nice I consider it the best actor in the cast. Not to say the cast isn't good themselves. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was the perfect choice. His voice and acting skills in my opinion made it seem like he really was in love with Miss Rossum.(hmm...) I had high expectations for the role of Christine and Emmy Rossum did a very nice job, she had her weak moments but altogether a commanding performance for an 18 year old actress. Now to Gerard Butler, probably the most controversial of the cast. In my mind everything about him was very Phantom-like except his voice and face. The part of the Phantom (or Erik) was written quite obviously for someone with a very large range especially in a man's higher notes. Mr. Butler clearly did not have the ability to hit all the notes required but at times he was enticing enough.(He still has nothing on Michael Crawford) Also I have a bone to pick with Joel Shumacher's make-up department. The Phantom's disfigurement (which reminded me strongly of mold) completely invalidated Buquet's description of the Phantom to the ballet girls. The other members of the cast were fantastic! Andre, Firmin, Carlotta, and Madam Giry were perfectly cast. The music, as always, has been enchanting and was the icing on the cake of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera.

1255,ecmac-1,All I ask of you is give it a chance,9,1 January 2005,"Great music, great scenery, Great Villain. This movie was my most anticipated movie of the year. It exceeded my expectations. Gerard Butler is gorgeous! For those who compare live theater to a movie, give it a chance. Live Theater is its own unique experience. I saw the Toronto stage production back in 1990, so I had a fresh appreciation for the film version. I cried in 1990 and I cried at the end of this film. I bought the Original Soundtrack CD for the film, which adds to my Toronto & London cast CD's. Each is great on their own. I know it's tough to appreciate musicals since we don't typically break into song (except me) during normal conversation, but you go to a movie to be emotionally touched. It's too bad that some of the vocals didn't match the lip sync on occasion. In the same weekend I saw Ocean's 12 & Meet the Fockers, I am glad that Phantom was the last one I saw.",The Phantom of the Opera
1256,erixgirlie,Phantom love,10,23 December 2004,"I went and saw this movie last night with my best friend as my Christmas present, and was so scared that the movie was going to suck. I have been a huge Phantom fan since I was 9, I have seen all the movies, read every book that has been release, I saw the Broadway production, and own 3 copies of the Phantom of the Opera Original London cast ( With Michael Crawford :: drool :: )because I listen to it so much, and this movie to me, was better the ALL of that rolled into one.If you are a huge Phantom fan or not, you will love this movie. Butler was such an awesome Phantom and looked so good, there wasn't a moment I didn't sigh when he was on the screen.I gave it a 10, only because I couldn't give it a 20! It's a beautiful movie from beginning to end. The acting was unbelievable and and the music was breath taking.I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can buy 2!

1257,bigcheese007,Wow!,10,2 May 2005,"This is certainly the best film I have ever watched and it without a doubt deserved a lot more recognition. This film leaves me wanting more and more of it and I want to watch it over and over again. Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum make the perfect Phantom & Christine and their chemistry makes the story that more believable.I suggest that everyone out there who has never seen the stage performance watches this film as it is, in my opinion, a lot more better than the real deal.You will fall in love with every character, the opera house and just fall into the Phantom's crazy world with his never-ending love.",The Phantom of the Opera
1258,louise_mcb,better than I expected but still not as good as it could have been,7,4 January 2005,"Phantom is my all-time favourite stage-musical; I was 13 the first time I saw it (10 years ago) and have loved it since. Looking at the cast list for the film, I have to admit I thought it would be rubbish but I went to see it out of curiosity and was mildly impressed.I'm torn in my opinion of Gerry Butler as the Phantom. He was too young and too handsome and nowhere near disfigured enough. Although I liked that he was portrayed more a victim than a villain, he could have been a little more menacing and tortured. Having said that I also kind of liked the fact that he was so attractive; he made the character more mesmerising. He did well with the madman/genius/lover combination, it was like watching a split personality. His singing may not have been outstandingly brilliant but it's not as bad as people keep saying, I think he did a fine job for an untrained singer.As for the other two leads, Emmy Rossum can sing but she can't act, and Patrick Wilson can act but he can't sing! Some reviewers have commented on Rossum's range of facial expressions and actually, they're right, she is capable of showing lots of emotions: Surprise - eyes wide open, lips slightly parted. Love - eyes wide open, lips slightly parted. Fear - eyes wide open, lips slightly parted.... I've never been a fan of Raoul's character and although Wilson made him a bit more heroic than usual, I still would choose the tortured, obsessed, loving Phantom over a simpering wuss who was stupid enough to get himself tied to the dungeon gates.I have no complaints about any other actors, they all did a fine job. Andre and Firmin were quite amusing, La Carlotta was hilarious and Meg and Madame Giry were more developed than in the stage version. The cinematography was lovely to look at but for me the whole look was spoiled by the poor lip-synching; a true shame considering they done their own singing anyway (except Minnie Driver) because it then looks like they can't actually sing and had to be dubbed. Ms Rossum's miming was particularly woeful.I wasn't bothered by the moving of the chandelier-dropping scene; what did annoy me was the new-look Masquerade scene. It's one of the best parts of the show and while I absolutely loved the film's choreography, it just didn't look the same in monochrome as it does it vibrant, riotous colour. I was also a bit annoyed with the minor and largely unnecessary changes to some of the lyrics e.g. in Think of Me. The new lines didn't add any new meaning, so why change them at all?Lastly, a few things some other reviewers mentioned... 1. the fact that Raoul had aged more than 'Madame Giry' in the black and white scenes... I thought the lady was supposed to be Meg Giry. Meg and Raoul would have aged similarly, and the older Meg would have looked like Miranda Richardson, she was playing her daughter after all. 2. about Madame Giry taking care of the Phantom when he was growing up in the Opera House. Some said this did not make sense; why would she do it, how could he then complain not to have been treated with compassion, etc? I may have picked her up wrongly but I'm sure Madame said that since the day she rescued him, he had never again known love or compassion, implying that after she hid him, she left him to his own devices and didn't actually look after him. 3. when the Opera House is set on fire, it never actually burns to the ground, which would explain why, years later, the building is still there, but is in a bad state of disrepair inside.In conclusion, good effort but could do better. Had (almost) all the right ingredients but lacked that vital something. I have a niggling feeling, though, that even if some of the bad things had been fixed (better lip-synching, a better Christine, etc) that vital something would still have been missing.",The Phantom of the Opera
1259,lilla_1,Better than expected,9,26 December 2004,"Since the dawn of time I have loved going to the theater and have seen many of Webber's plays including the Phantom of the Opera. When I heard that they had made a film of it, I was scared at best. Who know's how they can ruin such a marvelous play? I took two of my (uneducated) friends to see the film, and I warned them that I would probably rant on the way home.There was no rant. There was very little that I could actually criticize.I was slightly disappointed in the Phantom's voice. After years of listening to Crawford, he wasn't nearly as good. But I really did expect very little else. The portrayal of Raoul was fantastic, and Christine had an amazing voice.I was surprised to see how little was changed in the movie, and very impressed. This movie is the best I have seen all year, and I recommend it to the theater buffs or music lovers. The only reason I gave it nine was because of the Phantom's voice. But that is just a personal thing, he really sounded wonderful.A note to those who have seen the play: Don't worry, the movie will not ruin it for you. It just gives you that wonderful theater buzz that we all need.",The Phantom of the Opera
1260,trumpeteer03,The casting couldn't be worse,5,21 November 2018,"Yikes. The story of the Phantom is dark and weird and gaudy but the music is amazing and this production dropped the ball on that front all around. Gerard Butler is terrible, it's clear he has no previous training, Emmy Rossum is a fine singer but wrong for the roll of Christine. Her voice is too small and unimpressive for an operatic singer. If they were going to dub Carlotta's voice with an amazing soprano, why not the others? OR just cast amazing singers? It's not like there is a shortage of them. The sets are amazing but feel over the top for the rest of the tone of the film. Was very disappointed with this film adaptation. It's too bad we'll likely never get a good one now either.",The Phantom of the Opera
1261,trekkie_not_Trekker,Go watch for the music,7,6 January 2005,"Not because it is a mind-blowing rendition or interpretation of the classic but because of the songs.Emmy Rossum's singing is technically sound. Her acting isn't fantastic but that's no surprise although it can be distracting at times. For eg. when you're acting in such musical productions, although the singing portion has been pre-recorded, actors need to do more than just open their mouth in time with the music. You actually have to sing along. Otherwise, your body language is not in tandem. Like she doesn't heave when she reaches for the high notes. Also, i feel her performances are not mature enough for a production like this. Her singing is good but a bit dead.The director did not do as good a job in showcasing Gerard Butler (The Phantom). He makes him TOO likable which unfortunately spoils the 'dark' factor. He also doesn't come across as being the lead which is a shame cos I would have liked to see more of him. Whilst his voice is probably not the best in the history of actors playing the role, his performance is good enough to make you mitigate that factor.The film is too happy, not dark enough. Minnie Driver is excellent as Carlotta (prob cos she's pretty bitchy herself) and steals the scenes she's in. Wilson (Raoul) is a background pretty boy role (like he was meant to be) and enjoyable overall.The director cuts to scenes too abruptly and the singing transitions is not as smooth as I would have liked. However, being a movie, it holds advantages over the live musical being that special effects is of course better enhanced and dance routines are nothing but superb. However, if you've never watched the original musical, you have to go see it. Cos you'll be a fan after watching the musical but not the film.In the end, what binds the movie together is still Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs. It invokes emotion where the movie fails to do so and will have you humming the tune and replaying the CD when you get home.Last of all, you've got to watch it cos it's one of those movies which will go down in history.",The Phantom of the Opera
1262,oprgost,"Excellent movie, well done Sir Andrew!",10,9 January 2005,"As a ""Deadhead Fan"" of the Phantom of the Opera, having seen the stage production not only in London, Canada and all over the United Staes (103 times so far) I was very anxious when I heard about the movie being made. I had head the soundtrack to the movie and really wasn't to sure about the whole thing. Sounded very amateurish, but after having seen the movie I certainly have changed my opinion. Now, after seeing the movie 5 times so far, I was greatly pleased. On a scale of 1 to 10 it exceeds any scale. The sets, the stars, the singing, the sound have made the movie number one on my lists to see again and again. Can't wait for the DVD.

1263,scordeniro,"Go and see it if you like the show, go and see it if you don't!",10,19 January 2005,"Well, what can I say? After years of Lloyd Webber and Schumacher messing around it finally arrived. It was no disappointment either. Watching stage shows was part of my 'cultural upbringing' (though i'm no toff or anything) if you like, and I fell in love with Phantom from the minute i had seen it. It is very close to my heart and the music is very touching and personal to me, as I'm sure is the case for many people around the world. I was petrified then, to learn that my two favourite mediums were combining once again to create a film, and that Joel Schumacher was directing. This is hardly a man with a blotch-free CV! I feared the worst and felt awful whilst I sat there on opening night, squirming in my seat, watching the opening titles come up. I am now enlightened. They weren't intelligent with the use of the music, perhaps a little corny at points, but the show was always OTT and Schumacher read the way in which to use it brilliantly. Of course the show is nothing without its stars and I think Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice. It was a complete shock to see the girl from Mystic River and The Day After Tomorrow singing with such confidence and sparkling so. I hear that she has been singing for years all around the world and it appears this will only help her on the way to becoming a star. Gerard Butler was so passionate in the pivotal role that although his singing was less grand, he impressed me as much as anyone. Patrick Wilson can really sing and I loved the British supporting cast of Simon Callow, Ciaran Hinds, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver and others. The sets look fantastic, the cast sound fantastic, the music weaves its music as always, and anyone who loves the show should definitely go and see this right now. If, however you have not seen the play, I would recommend you catch the show first as it will not have the instantaneous staying power of say, Moulin Rogue or certainly Chicago. Seeing the show live is the way to become appreciative of it and after that the film will be fantastic to you. Before that, it maybe will not appeal to you as much, I know it wouldn't have to me. I would still take a look to see what is possibly some of the greatest music written in the past 100 years on full show. This has the power to touch and though hasn't been accepted well by the film world, it should be adored by fans of the show and should also create many new fans in its wake. Wonderful Stuff.",The Phantom of the Opera

Gerard Butler's Phantom was flawless, perfect singing and awesome acting, heartbreaking in the final scene. Emmy Rossum, even though she was only sixteen years old during the production of this movie, showed us her talent: a young yet sweet and beautiful voice and an innocent and naive acting that perfectly suited her character. I loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's additional music and I honestly think that Learn To Be Lonely deserved the Academy Award it was nominated for.

When hearing that they were going to make a movie version I was intrigued-not as a fan of the musical, but as a fan of film in general-and translations like these. Wow. Friends and I went to see Phantom at our local Cineplex on New Years eve(in full masquerade attire I might add. <3) and we all agreed-it was wonderful. Immeaditely I resolved to purchase the film soundtrack and keep my eyes open for the Musical when it came to my hometown. It was not the definite word on the subject however. My stepmother, being a native new yorker-has spent quite a lot of time singing on the Broadway stage. She and My uncle both were weaned on the likes of opera, Hammerstien and Webber's work. I took them to my movie theater (Where I work-not that I own) and awaited their reviews with bated breath-it would decide it in the end. And they loved it!Webber himself said, on the movie soundtrack, that the stage play and the movie were ""different animals"" and it's never proved more true. Besides the most obvious changes (You can do more on film then you can on stage) Each actor brought their own...power to the role. Their own version of it. It was like someone had taken the play and adapted it-like someone would adapt a book in a foreign language to English-or Vice Versa. The Words might be different but the Message is still the same.And, in conclusion for those ""puriests""- I urge you to keep the hand at the level of your eyes-and an open mind.

Although I was greatly anticipating this movie I really thought it would lack the passion and emotion of the stage version. I'm glad to say I could not have been more wrong. They moved things around a bit, like the chandlier scene, and they changed a few words here and there. But it works. I think my favorite part was the transition between the auction and when the flash back begins. The colors were wonderful. The music was chilling! Forever more will I be a huge fan of Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. Although Michael Crawford was the original I'm glad he didn't play Le Phantom in the movie.

And I have to say without even one iota of doubt this could be one of the best movies I have ever scene. The look of this movie was stirring. The characters were deep and you felt for them in every way. The Gerard Butler's performance rivals that of the Original Bway casts Michael Crawford. (I'm a huge Michael Crawford fan and I'm leaning towards Butler) Emmy Rossum's Christine was breathtaking to say the very very least. I am amazed to at Joel Schumacher. I was so afraid that the Director of such classics as Batman & Robin and 8mm would turn Phantom into a neon-encrusted snuff film. But to my delight Schumacher has taken one of the greatest musicals of all time and given us one of the Greatest Movie-musicals ever. I applaud Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher.

But even as familiar with the work as I am, this movie floored me. I get it now. The choice that tore her heart. Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera.It was opening night tonight. The theater was full; I sat in the front row of the back section (there are three rows way up close to the screen; I sat in front of the bars in the ""handicap"" section - one of the few pseudo-desirable seats left when I got there.) The sets were marvelous. The cast captivating. And Emmy Rossum's Christine was superb. I never took my eyes off the screen for all 143 minutes, although I must admit to the movie having a slow spot somewhere in the middle. When I got back into my car I turned off the radio so I could decompress from the movie. I don't even remember most of the drive home except the last two miles. I must own this movie.

The music is magical and overpowering.

1270,allstrangeaway,Miserable,1,26 February 2005,"Plagued by irresponsible casting/direction, kitschy art design and stupefying attempts to fill plot holes left by the stage production, this disaster by auteur/amateur Joel Schumacher is simply painful to endure. True, the musical itself is bereft of much substance - it is in fact the burden of the actors to convey any real connection to the story or characters, a responsibility that Gerard Butler is incapable of (nevermind his TEPID ATTEMPT at singing) - but things surely need not have gone so terribly awry. The only hope left is that some lesson was learned by the filmmakers and producers (hmm...yeah I tend to doubt it too). Unfortunately, many scenes have the visual tone of a perfume commercial (are they taking Emily Rossum seriously or are they trying to sell her?), the result being that it is very difficult to engage in the work or story. And though a number of embarrassingly bad decisions went into the production of this Drew, there seems no excuse for such an outrageously miscast lead actor (with the acting ranging from slight menace to apoplectic convulsions - that don't really read as angry as much as simply overacted). Other actors (e.g. Miranda Richardson, etc.) are wasted and their efforts only highlight the sad inadequacies of other cast members.",The Phantom of the Opera
1271,everenee74,If you like the play....,4,21 December 2004,"Don't go see the movie. They've changed it up. Scenes are added, things are out of order etc. Also, with the money they spend on beautiful sets and costumes, you'd think they could find a Phantom who could actually sing the part!Christine is good. Raoul is good, but speaks with an American accent. Accents are everywhere. The lady who plays Madame Cherie has a nice French accent. It would have been nice to have uniform accents instead of Brits here, Americans there.My main problem is that this is shot like a music video. They had audio synch problems and cut away to a super wide shot any time someone hits a big note or holds a note for a long time. I like to see people's lips move when they sing. I don't need to see the decorative statue or other needless cutaways.I will preface this by saying I saw a screener print and perhaps the synch was just off instead of the actual print being that way. Glad I didn't pay for it!",The Phantom of the Opera
1272,asphault_junkie,A horrible rendition of a Broadway great,5,14 December 2007,"I give the movie a five of ten simply on the cinematography. It happens to be really good. As for the rest of it...well...Emmy Rossum is out of her element as Christine, her voice not quite developed enough to pull this role convincingly.Gerard Butler can't sing. That's it. I'm sure he's fine at karaoke like the rest of us, but the rest of us don't have aspirations of Broadway and neither should Leonidas. He's a great Spartan king and a fairly good villain if he doesn't have to sing, but he doesn't have the voice to carry the title part. Colm Wilkinson must be cringing somewhere.Patrick Wilson is the one voice that is actually worth hearing. Though he got stuck with the sappiest of parts in all of musical theatre, he does a good job with what he's got. He has a *great* voice which, despite the critics who apparently know nothing of musical theatre, is the best part of the entire show next to the costumes. If you're going to see this movie, see it for him alone. He really does have a great voice.Minnie Driver is excellent in her lip-synching to someone with actual opera talent (Margaret Preece) but even *I* could cash in that kind of performance.Overall, despite its excellent costumes and scenery, the movie isn't very good. And that's kind of disappointing because I *loved* the stage version when I was a kid. I kind of blame my parents for taking me to see this in Toronto when I was growing up. If it weren't for them and their insistence on our exposure to the arts, I wouldn't have known to expect something better.",The Phantom of the Opera

I am listening to the movie soundtracks as I type. The Actors and Actresses are not only natural at Acting but also at singing. You Have to see this movie. It was so wonderful I cried.

1274,markpeter,"Acceptable, even engrossing in parts, but largely uninspired",5,2 January 2005,"I have read a number of the reviews. Quite obviously, there are a lot of 8-out-of-10s to 10-out-of-10s. I would hasten to say, with all due respect to those who took the time to write small commentaries, that those comments seem to have come more from individuals who view film more as entertainment than film as art.Taking that perspective, Joel Schumacher was the best choice in that his career has been marked by excessive obviousness. He is not a subtle director, nor is he a director of poetry, nor does he really challenge the audience in any kind of visual or intellectual way. Lord Webber found a kindred spirit in Schumacher, one who shares his ideal of schmaltz, mixed with a highly stylized amalgam of grand opera, rock & roll, and buttercup love.One wishes that Schumacher could have scaled back just a little bit, offering a quiet moment or two, for people to actually interact, rather than just appear, together. Mostly, it seems he is working against the conventions of Musical Theatre -- it is a difficult medium to balance right -- rather than exploit its built-in dependencies. In Mr. Schumacher's eyes, if you are going to err, err on the side of excessive opulence -- then, maybe, no one will notice. No need for subtlety if none exists to begin with.The casting. Many have commented on the casting. It is a moot point. The only real question is does it work within the given concept of the film. Making the main characters younger is acceptable. The three principles offer than audience plenty of eye candy, working off common theatrical stereo-types. You know immediately where everyone stands, without even any of them opening their mouths. They are all pretty people -- even the phantom -- whose grotesqueries are toned down, making for a more sensitive portrait.The music. What can you say about that. It's ethereal, timeless, and soaring.The production design. My biggest issue. Where was the Director of Photography on this one? John Mathieson's work has been exemplary in the past -- Gladiator being a career high point. But here, under Schumacher's direction to be sure, he has toned all the color out of the production. Schumacher might has well have shot the entire film in Black & White, so monochromatic is this film. The Ball Masque sequence has an all-enveloping, depressing yellow sheen to the ENTIRE SCENE, effectively destroying the color and pageantry of a very important set piece. WHAT WAS MR SHUCMACHER THINKING? The underground is photographed in a dull blue, outside is mostly gray. There are precious few full color scenes. In my photographer's eye, Schumacher totally missed the boat on this one. With all the other difficulties they had on the set, it is quite obvious that cinematography was relegated to the back of the bus.On a minor note, some of the film-related, thematic concepts seem to have been cobbed from Moulin Rouge, a far superior film in a different kind of way (at least it understood and honored the ghosts of musical theatric). Framing the film is vintage black & white sequences; using Flemenco dancers in the opera and elsewhere about the house; the rooftop musical number; the elephants; even the Eastern influence of the opera within the opera -- all these Moulin Rouge had done first. In fact, aside from the music, which rises above and beyond the dull production surrounding it, making it a far better show than it really is, there is scant originality and minimum passion.Sorry folks.I expected better and wanted more.",The Phantom of the Opera
1275,daddywags214,Phenomenal,8,2 January 2005,"This movie was terrific. I was quite spellbound the entire time. Granted, I am a fan of the stage musical and am quite biased toward the material. But I strongly disagree with many of the negative comments made about this movie. I feel it is my duty to try to offer an alternate view to those criticisms.1) This film is overdone.I say: No, this film is 'done' just right. 'Overdone' suggests that a film takes itself too seriously, uses overly lavish costumes and sets and in general, is quite cheesy. In this case, while extraordinarily lavish, is not at all overdone. It is a period piece, no more sumptuously shot than a film like Amadeus. It is a visual spectacle with few equals. The costumes are terrific; however, the sets are perfect. They augment the feelings that I (and so many others) had seeing the show on stage.2) The music is outdated.I say: I will not argue this too strongly, as it is a matter of opinion. But don't write it off without having heard it. I think it is superb music; beautiful, exciting, involving.3) The voices are bad.I say: I'm a trained singer. I know that the singing is not quite to the level of what one sees on the stage. But all of the characters, in my opinion, did a fine job in this movie. The one character that people tend to dislike the most is the Phantom. Gerard Butler's voice, once again in my humble opinion, was quirky, but likable. That's another decision that can't be made by someone else's review.So see it, I highly recommend it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1276,Shadowcat77,What an experience!!!,10,5 May 2005,"As a lover of musicals particularly those of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, I couldn't wait to see Phantom of the Opera.Upon entering the cinema, I settled down for what turned out to be a fantastic experience. I was familiar with a few of the tracks such as, Phantom of the Opera, Music of the Night and Angel of Music.During a few of the songs, I was able to sit back and close my eyes and let the music wash over me.By far the scene that took my breath away was the opening scene when the chandelier is raised and the theatre is restored to its former glory with the Overture playing.I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera
1277,Theaterdude,Needs more credit,10,4 January 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is the quintessential musical. I have seen the actual stage production three times, each one just as good, if not better, than the last. I almost lost control of myself when word got out about the phantom's theatrical debut.This movie has everything in it. Love, music, action, betrayal. It will touch the heart of even the coldest person out there, and it breaks my heart to see that most people don't seem to care. I fell in love with this production since I first saw it on Broadway. I was always excited to listen to the music. I was able to see it again when it came to my home town of Portland, Oregon the following year, and again in London the year after that. I was anticipating this release more than most people could know.I believe that this musical is under-appreciated for its time. You need to see this movie people!I also think it should have come out widely instead of limited. That makes it almost as hard to see the film than the actual stage production. No wonder people aren't thrilled about it yet!Gerard Butler so far is my favorite Phantom: He has the voice that made my spine shiver and a look that was almost sensual. Emmy Rossum has also been my favorite Christine, she has a voice like an angel and filled the role to its utmost brilliance. This movie deserves a chance from anyone and everyone out there with a love of music.",The Phantom of the Opera
1278,playbyplay,Shouldn't they be able to sing?,4,9 December 2004,"I realize that there will be major changes when a movie is adapted from a stage production, but there are certain things one would expect as a ""given"" in Phantom. You wouldn't eliminate his mask, for instance, or the falling chandelier. Phantom on stage has two things going for it: its special effects and its soaring melodies. On film, where we're used to FX that are truly special, Phantom's are fine, just not spectacular. That leaves the music. C'mon guys, thrill me! Nope, sorry, no can do. Emmy Rossum as Christine is quite lovely and has a very pretty voice, but there is no way anyone would believe her singing would thrill an audience at an opera. Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is okay -- his voice is a nice match for Emmy's, but it's nothing special. Gerald Butler, the Phantom himself, is abysmal! He is able to handle the upper range, but otherwise growls out his notes. Ironically, the best singer in the cast is Minnie Driver, playing Charlotte, the opera singer who (supposedly) is not very good. Of course, her singing was dubbed. If only the others were, too!There are some good things here. They transferred some of the musical interludes into spoken dialogue, which made the story line clearer. We learn more of the Phantom's back story, which definitely helps to flesh out his character. The costumes and scenery are beautiful, the orchestrations lovely.I'm always happy to see a film musical (I loved ""Chicago"") but I really think this one could have been done better. I give it a 4 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera

This film was absolutely INCREDIBLE and blew every expectation I had out of the ball park! I would definitely see this again and again...even if tickets are $10 for a matinée here. If you like musicals, you will absolutely adore The Phantom of the Opera. I really haven't seen a film this well made in a long time. Even if I didn't like the story line (which, of course, I did) the cinematography itself was enough to make me love it. Everything was perfect and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD so I can watch it as much as I want!!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1280,deep-treble,Great adaptation of a musical masterpiece,8,26 January 2006,"I went into watching this film knowing that much would be lost in the transformation from stage play to screen gem. For instance, the virtuosity of the singers. Having expected things like this, I was more able to enjoy it for what it is.The cinematic elements and special effects knocked me off my feet. I was especially pleased with the transformation of the opera house during the initial flashback. This is always something that seems hokey and unrealistic portrayed on stage, but on the screen it added so much more to the overture, which, if the director is not careful, can become uninteresting very easily.Two things kept this film from getting 10 stars from me. 1. The casting. There was only one player whose performance impressed me, and that was Minnie Driver in the role of Carlotta. She is to date the only person I have seen play the role correctly (let alone WELL!), as Carlotta acts like a diva even though she has zero talent. Her performance had me in stitches much of the time, and she stole the show.The casting of Emmy Rossum in the role of Christine was a mistake. Her lack of expression and sub-par vocal technique left much to be desired. I have heard that Katie Holmes was originally considered for the part, but was declined the part because the role demanded more youth. I would have preferred to see her in this role (with a voice double if necessary) over Rossum.Gerard Butler portrayed the Phantom well. I really only had two problems with him in this role, and neither of them are really his fault, but that of the casting director. His vocal technique was not great, but considering the little (if any) vocal training and experience he has had, it was not bad. The second problem is that he is clearly a baritone, while the Phantom demands the voice of a tenor. This creates a problem for Gerry, because given his non-existent singing past, he strains to achieve much of the challenging content.2. The lip sync. One thing I cannot stand is being completely immersed in a movie when suddenly you are reminded that you are watching a movie, that you are not actually there. This happened to me many, many times while watching this film, as much of the dialogue and singing is not properly synchronized.Overall the film is a great adaptation of ALW's stage masterpiece. If you go into watching the movie having seen the musical on stage, I expect that it will improve the movie-watching experience. It did for me, as I had already heard great singing on the stage, which was lacking in the film, and everything that cinematography could add to the film's greatness was used. Bravo!",The Phantom of the Opera
1281,tenecchick2004,Phantom on Film,9,29 December 2004,"I finally saw this movie yesterday and was very pleased with the outcome. However, there were several others in the theater who were commenting on the movie after by comparing it to the London and Broadway production. All I have to say to those kinds of people is: Were you really expecting to see something that would rival Broadway for $7.00-$12.50? In it's own right, the movie was exceptional. I thought that Minnie Driver (even though she didn't sing) was great comic relief. Gerard Butler gave a mesmerizing performance as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum as Christine was amazing. If you are looking for a good musical movie, I would highly recommend Phantom. If you are looking for a Broadway musical, I suggest you go to New York.",The Phantom of the Opera

Now that I have finally seen it I can honestly say the torture was more than worth it. Gerard Butler was amazing. The passion he radiated on the screen was stunning. I truly felt for The Phantom even more than when I saw it on Broadway. This film lets you really get inside of The Phantom's heart and see his joys, his anger, and his pain. Congratulation Gerry!!! Emmy was beautiful, her voice rang out like an angel. The emotions in her singing really let you experience the character's inner needs. The rest of the cast was also great. Minnie Driver was hilarious and her song during the credits was perfect.The cinematography was also stunning. Schumacher captured the raw beauty of a time and culture far different than what we're use to today. The sets were lavish and a perfect fit to the dynamic soundtrack of songs and orchestra numbers provided by Webber.I recommend people to go to this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Don't try to compare Gerard to Michael or Emmy to Sarah. What's the point!!! What matters is that both of them put their everything into the characters and it shows. This film is pure romantic enjoyment down to its last second, which by the way, brought me to tears.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was crying as soon as the overture began! Then, to top it all off, there was Gerard Butler, whom I had never heard of, playing the Phantom, and he took my breath away. I have seen the movie in the theater 12 times and watch the DVD all the time. I was not fortunate enough to have heard any of the music prior to this. I have never heard anything so beautiful.

1284,mandy87,Amazing,9,17 January 2005,"This film was in short, amazing. I saw this film with a cynical relative who was convinced beyond convincing that such a masterpiece of theatre could never successfully be transformed into a piece of celluloid candy, and whilst remaining somewhat reserved through the opening, by the conclusion this same person was totally immersed in the experience that is this film. It does not disappoint fans of the on-stage performance, but rather invites them, as well as new audience members, to delve into its own unique magic.Fantastic performances are given by all, and The Pahntom (Opera Ghost) himself gives the most spectacular performance. Even when held against the romantic Raoul, the elusive Phantom provides a profoundly passionate,entrancing performance which will undoubtedly move any audience member and touch them singularly.Whilst I am a fan of classical films and musicals, i believe that for even those who are not admirers of the musical genre, this film is an unmissable opportunity. Do not wait for it to come out on video. Live the experience on the big screen and immerse your psyche and imagination into the strength and passion of the Phantom of the Opera. Truly, you will find yourself in another realm, one that you wont want to leave.An amazing, cast, an amazing (of course) sound track, amazing performances with strong characterisation, strength, passion.

1292,nick-meredith,First Turkey of Christmas,1,10 December 2004,"The Phantom of the Opera - my vote for 2004's film turkey. Dull badly made, and far far too long.Minnie Driver obviously realized it was a pantomime, Miranda Richardson acted Jennifer Ellison tried her best, but the leads, oh dear.Gerard Butler as the Phantom looked fine, until they took the mask off revealing a prosthetic scar which clearly wasn't there under the mask, and Emmy Rossum managed to act with one 'mouth hanging open' expression which moved from joy to horror to fear by the varied application of occasional glycerine tears. An inflatable doll would have got the character over more movingly.The sound stank, with no attempts at even basic lip synching, songs in different acoustics segueing into each other with the subtlety of a knackered tractor gearbox.If you enjoyed Moulin Rouge and thought this might be similar get out the DVD of Moulin Rouge and watch it again.

He also portrays the character as more passionate and sensitive. I'm glad that Gerry Butler had no evil laugh after committing crimes or insulting Carlotta loudly as in the stage show. The additions to the film version are clever as well. They fill the gaps the stage musical leaves.In addition, you can watch the movie as if watching a 3-D art exhibition from the beginning to the end.

1294,mzimm_3,"Good, not Great",6,26 December 2004,"I am a theater student who has considerable experience in acting, singing,and playwrigting. I went to this film not knowing what to expect. First I must say, the visuals were beautiful. Undoubtedly Beautiful. However, in general I have problems with the writing as much as I do with the acting. I know that the style of the piece is romantic (being that it is based on French romantic novel) but I felt the piece suffered from lack of complexity in the characters. My personal favorite Lloyd Webber musical is Jesus Christ Superstar because I thought he very successfully portrayed characters that we see as cardboard, biblical cutouts as conflicted, vulnerable humans. The Phantom I felt was the most complex character here and even so there wasn't a whole lot of complexity. I think that Raoul is very poorly written character (in spite of the fact that Patrick Wilson is a BRILLIANT actor and the fact that he has a great voice), I also was not a huge fan of Christine (although I thought Emmy Rossum's work was very credible) The first 30 minutes of it seemed almost like a concert to me. THERE WAS NO EMPHASIS ON CONFLICT. I was amazed. Being a fan of Evita and JC Superstar which are rife with conflict in every scene I was shocked to see so little emphasis on conflict early in the film. And hence, a lot of the early songs I felt didn't really add anything to the film. A lot of great musical songs emerge in scenes when characters are overcome with emotion because of their pursuit of some objective. Because there was no clear objective for Christine early on and there wasn't much talk about the Phantom a lot of the songs seemed to me like they were placed there because Lloyd Webber needed filler. Once it got going though, the film was fairly good. The visuals were stunning, and Wilson and Rossum both did well. Gerard Butler, however, I feel should not have been cast. He clearly has no vocal training and being that ""Phantom"" is practically an opera itself, I feel it is a poor choice to cast someone who isn't vocally trained in the role. Let me put it this way. If you are going to cast someone who is not well-known and doesn't have a great resume in this role, there are thousands of good-looking, credible film actors out there who are also vocally trained and could do this role very well. I don't see why they should be denied the opportunity. **And for all you who think his voice sounds very good for someone with no training, it does sound fairly good, but you have to listen carefully. A LOT of that is editing, adding in more re-verb will take your ear's focus off the tone quality**But in summary I would say my main problems are with the film's writing. A lot of it spectacle and there is not a lot of delving into what could be more complex characters.All in All: Good film, beautiful visuals, style over substance 6/10",The Phantom of the Opera

I was pleasantly surprised and have now fallen in love with this film.I was under the impression that the 'Phantom' was a ghost and not a real man, so this made the story even more intriguing and exciting.I thought Emily Rossum's attempt the mime the lyrics to most of her songs fell on deaf ears. It was obvious she was miming, and she wasn't even miming well at that. However, the singing was impeccable on all counts.I really enjoyed this film and will be buying the soundtrack and DVD when it is released. I may even go and see it again at the cinema!

No other movie has been able to control me quite like this Phantom. I saw Mike Crawford on Broadway play Phantom, so my expectations were set on a pretty high level. Let me tell you, those expectations were met, surpassed, and left in the dust. Every person in this movie was cast to perfection. No other person could've played the Phantom quite like Mr. Butler. I must say it is containing several Hollywood fingerprints, but that is to be expected. The stage and the cinema are two completely different modes of entertainment, but Phantom has successfully succeeded on both fronts.

1297,mycarebear9485,spectacular!!,10,23 December 2004,honestly I thought it started out kind of slow. The beginning I thought looked very similar to a Baz Lurhman film. The sets were just so incredibly elaborate though. I was completely blown away. Especially with the graveyard set. I just couldn't believe how beautiful that was. The sword fight was a nice addition too. they did change some things though. Not really a bad thing just different. The chandelier falls in a different scene and they added action to Madam Giry's story about how the phantom came to the opera. I was very much impressed with Emmy Rossum's performance. She totally captured what Christine is really all about. her voice is absolutely beautiful. Madam Giry was just how I thought she should be. I must say that I was very surprised to see Minnie Driver playing Carlotta but I believe she did a magnificent job. She played the bitch very well. Not meaning any disrespect there. I just believe that that word is the only one that best describes Carlotta. Meg was fantastic. How they were able to find someone that looked so much like Miranda Richardson just amazes me. Her screams were not what I thought they should have been though. I thought they needed to be a good bit louder. All in all this movie left me quite entertained and very pleased. I would definitely go see this again and again and again.,The Phantom of the Opera
1298,lucymayjones,My thoughts on the film :D,9,12 December 2004,"I honestly feel this film was amazing. I saw it the day after it was released. The music in the film was wonderful. All the singers were amazing, the actress who played Christine-has an amazing voice. The phantom was played very well, very mysterious. Minnie Driver was brilliant in this film!The costumes and the sets were stunning! There isn't much talking in this film, mainly music and singing. But this works very well as the music is brilliant!I would definitely recommend this film! It has got the whole package, music, romance, some action-something for everyone to enjoy!",The Phantom of the Opera
1299,phantomoto,Don't listen to the critics ! Rossum shines in this beautiful movie. She deserves an Oscar nomination and Driver too.,9,26 December 2004,"I really liked this film. It was breathtaking, amazing and beautiful. I don't understand the critics, but I'm happy that they usually praise Rossum and Driver, they were really great. I couldn't believe that Rossum is just 18 year old, it's unbelievable. She's talented, beautiful and her voice is fantastic. I hope so that she and Driver will get Oscar nominations. The sets, the costumes, the editing,the make up, the cinematography and the new song were great. It would be too big wonder, if the movie got 8 Oscar nominations, although I think so, that it would deserve them. I find this musical adaptation much better than Chicago and my opinion is that Driver acted bigger than Zeta Jones two years ago. I hope that Rossum shall get the Golden GLobe although Bening was brilliant too.",The Phantom of the Opera
1300,zenpickle-1,Faithful Adaptation with Appropriate Tweaks,8,12 December 2004,"My first impression of the film was that it was how I always imagined it would look on screen. I'm glad because so many things could have gone wrong. Having Joel Schumacher (Batman & Robin) direct it was a potential double-edged sword. You needed a flamboyant director like Schumacher or Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) to stage the stylistic dance scenes with all the gaudiness of 19th century Paris. Yet you could run the risk of Schumacher over-indulging in homo-erotic imagery (again, Batman & Robin), which there is only a smidgen of in Phantom (the golden candleboys in ""Masquerade""). The Phantom himself does jump down a lot with a flourish of his cape like Batman. That's enough of the Batman comparisons. The only directing aspect that annoyed me was that it felt that all indoor scenes were shot with a gold-sepia filter and all outdoor scenes under a blue filter.Minnie Driver's Carlotta stole the show. I found Carlotta annoying in the musical, but I wish Driver's version had more screen time. She looked like she had a lot of fun in that role.It was also a good move to use a young cast. The relationships and the characters' backgrounds made more sense. The younger Phantom's romantic connection with Christine felt stronger. It also added to the vibrancy and innocence of the young lovers.**MILD SPOILER ALERT** The movie itself stayed fairly faithful to the stage musical with minor changes to conform a two act play into a feature film. The occasional shots of the old Raoul going to Christine's grave felt disjointed until the end, but they were a nice touch. I also felt the ending was the most surprising and satisfying change in the screen adaptation.This is a movie for fans of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. This is not a movie for Gaston Leroux purists, Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford worshipers, or vocal snobs.",The Phantom of the Opera
1301,goodonetowin,"Poor fools they make me laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha ,ha!",10,13 December 2004,"The film is fantastic! I have seen the stage show three times, once with most of the original cast, including Michael Crawford, and was delighted with the film. You will get what you expect. If you are looking to pick faults you will find them; if you are looking to enjoy the film you will. Sure, The Phantom's not Michael Crawford, that would have been perfect, but he does a good job. Right from the start, with the black and white scene which leads into the chandelier magically bringing the theatre to life, (the use of black and white during the film is well done) to the end where it comes crashing down, I was spellbound. When Raoul sang about the musical box during the auction it was a relief to realize that the film was closely following the show. The journey to The Phantom's lair sent shivers down my spine, wonderful! You don't see Christine singing at first as it is her thoughts you hear (as in the show where the two sets of doubles are used while the leads get in place). The scene in the cemetery is very moving and the 'Past The Point of No Return' duet is very sensual indeed! All the songs are performed well and look great. The chandelier coming down has been moved, but it fits in with the story very well and is spectacular and cleverly done, it falls on the stage as in the show. The ending is the same but has an added black and white part which works well. I didn't read any reviews before seeing the film and am amazed at the negative comments from some reviewers. Too much singing - what did they expect; too garish - come on! Most fans will love it. Not sure about the others, some will get it, some won't. It depends on your attitude I suppose, if you want to enjoy it you will. By the way, I went with my wife to see the film and we took in some soft drinks and a small bag of sweets but never touched either of them. The film held us right from the start and never paused for a moment. It was so intense we just forgot about everything except what was happening on the screen. That's how good it is. We will be going back as soon as we can.",The Phantom of the Opera
1302,carry_on_dreaming,Awe Struck,10,12 December 2004,"This was the most beautifully sad film i have ever seen. It captivated me, drew me into a world of Gothic romance and architecture, where the beautiful are not what they seem and the monster is not as monstrous as he seems. The costumes of amazing colour, the tiny details are accounted for, these are the things that make this film more spectacular than it would be without them. The light and dark aspects are shown in every seen, the phantoms torment is everywhere in the film, the girl torn between a dream and a childhood sweetheart. Of course i won't tell you who she chooses, but i will tell you this is a must see film, not just of 2004/2005 but EVER.There are no words that can ever do such a magnificent film justice, nor a grade that any man or woman can give it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1303,natasha_dutreuilh,A stunning masterpiece for all ages,10,13 December 2004,"I was skeptical about watching this film until I was persuaded by a good friend of mine who adores theatre productions. Being highly critical people we sat down to watch with bated breath. When the famous overture started we knew that this was no ordinary film. The music is written by a sheer genius, the actors are pleasant to look at and posses voices that are out of this world. I adore opera, and this was a nice change from listening to sopranos who tend to warble as it were- their voices in this film are refreshing.When the film ended there was a silence that was deafening- no one even breathed. We were all stunned-this is greater than the most well-loved of all operas- cats. The young actress, Emmy Rossum has done a superb job of the difficult role of Christine, it is a task that requires beauty, talent and most importantly an amazing voice. She fulfils these requirements perfectly, I can honestly say that her voice made the hairs on my neck rise- she has the voice of an angel. Both Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson were incredible, their voices were so different but both so powerful.Yes, the voice's are not perfect, but both men do a damn good job, they add a sexy image to the production. I truly pitied the Phantom, and I cried at the end. These people are not Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman- but what does that matter? what is perfection- RARE. For all the negative comments made- when was the last time you were in the Phantom of the Opera- Cinema or Theatre. I thought that this was stunning, very enjoyable and I'm going to see it again.",The Phantom of the Opera

I wasn't sure if the film would live up to the live musical but it does a fantastic job. The sets are fantastic and the way they use special effects to go from ""present day"" Paris back to when the story takes place is done really well. Emmy Rossum is amazing in the role of Christine, such a joy to listen to, her voice is astounding and perfect for the role. I can't wait to go see the film again. I have the original music on double cd but I'll still be buying the soundtrack on double cd. I actually prefer Emmy Rossum as Christine instead of Sarah Brightman (sorry Sarah), Emmy's voice is more angelic/gentle.",The Phantom of the Opera
1305,mazza75,Simply Brilliant,10,14 December 2004,"This was without a doubt the most emotionally charged and beautiful movie I have ever seen. All the cast were brilliant but I want to single out one in particular, Gerard Butler, he was outstanding and the only person I've ever seen on screen who moved me to tears! The film packs such an emotional punch that people actually clapped when it was over - I've never ever heard people clapping after a film before and then everyone just sat there in silence - it was a remarkable feeling. Its wonderfully shot, Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is as spine tingling on screen as it is on the stage. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and the film takes pride of place as my all time favorite movie. I highly highly recommend anyone who can tolerate/likes/loves/adores musicals to go and see this one. It's a movie that deserves to be viewed, heard and appreciated on the biggest of screens with surround sound!! I'd like to thank the cast, Joel and Andrew for being brave enough to take on the Phantom and the end result is simply brilliant. Well done to you all.",The Phantom of the Opera

The film carries the story of the Phantom as near to the truth as possible and stays very close to the stage version. The characters are great and all of the actors did fantastic jobs!!!!!!!! The Phantom , Christine, and Rauol are done perfectly. I saw it opening day and plan to see it at least 3 more times!!!

1307,Miriador,Disappointing,5,14 December 2004,"I have been a Phantom fan since 1989 when I first saw Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical on stage. Thereafter, I sought anything Phantom-ish I could find - books, movies, the TV miniseries, even comics. So when I heard ALW's musical was being adapted into a film, I was really excited about it. I lucked out and was able to get into an early screening, and I brought along a friend who knew very little about the story. When the film started, we were both dazzled. The special effects were great, and the overture sounded awesome through the loudspeakers. But then the singing started, and it was not as glorious as I hoped it would be. My friend even turned to me and asked, ""Why didn't they get good singers for this film?"" I shrugged and hoped it would get better. I was waiting for the Phantom. And when he vocally made his entrance, I was a little jarred. He didn't have the ""voice of an angel"" that Christine claims he has/is. But I shrugged it off, as I'd heard Gerard Butler's acting was superb. And he was. He really was. But the direction of the two main characters threw me. Christine, who is the virginal chorus girl and the object of the Phantom's affection, turns into a Victoria's Secret model once escorted to the Phantom's lair, and her immediate physical impropriety with the Phantom shocked me (especially since she had just been saying that she thought the Phantom was a spiritual manifestation of her father - eek!). It ruined any sense of the uncertainty of first love that is key (for me) to the Phantom and Christine's relationship (it was also highly out of ""period""), and that was where it all went downhill for me. The pacing also began to drag and I found myself wishing the film would hurry up. The supporting actors seemed to help, but not enough to stem the dreadful sense of mediocrity that pervaded the film. There were too many moments that seemed out of place or stolen from other films (the tango scene was right out of Moulin Rouge), and the ending was disappointingly anti-climatic. I no longer cared for these characters I have loved for 15+ years, and that saddened me immensely.",The Phantom of the Opera
1308,horngyih,"It's a movie, not a stage musical... where's the movie magic?",2,14 December 2004,"I agree with one comment wrote where the movie was ""too stagey"". The only reason why I had gone to watch it was that I got free tickets. I found that the movie makers had just simply moved a stage musical onto the silver screens with nothing added in-between. Where's the movie magic? What's the point of moving a stage musical onto the silver screen if not to add a little more magic that couldn't have been used on stage. The opera house lacked... ambition; mildly interesting. It could have been a lot more grand more pezzaz, for example what Moulin Rouge did. Or more dark and foreboding, Notre Dame like. Or a little of both, remember that the opera house is both beautiful to behold yet carries a little dark secret with it...The phantom's dungeon was a complete let down... Here is where this ""creature of perpetual darkness"" reside and it's almost bright as day?! ""Music of the night"" was presented in the brightest of night... where's the darkness? Not even shadows... It is a dungeon after all isn't it?There are many more that could have been better, the above was just some of my biggest disappointments.",The Phantom of the Opera
1309,valerieb37,i like it!,9,22 December 2004,"the movie, i believe, for the most part was staged well. the characters were good...with the exception of madame giry. although i believe she is a good actress, i don't think that what she was trying to portray was madame giry.i was mildly upset that the chandlier fell at the wrong point of the movie. and i was also mad that a sword fight between Raoul and phantom was added...this was superfluous and i thought it negated any mystery left between these two characters.also, the phantoms accent was fine when speaking, but when he sang it sounded like he had A LOT of trouble pronouncing the word ""the."" his singing ruined his character for me. and personally, i thought having less mask on the phantom was a silly idea because you have so many close ups, there will be no problems emitting emotion. after all, we get the picture in the stage production and you never get to see the close-ups of his face. also, i think the distorted lip which was covered by the stage production mask added a lot to his ""horror."" masquerade was AMAZING. i don't think it could have been done much better. i thought the addition of the flashbacks was very well done. they helped explained a lot, and also kept the audiences attention.i thought the rose with the black ribbon was very effective. i cant remember if this was included in the stage production.overall, very good movie. i will be seeing it again shortly.

1310,zachary-cone,"""C-"" Out of sync lip sync and predictable camera work take away form film",3,14 December 2004,"I have just returned from a sneak peek of the movie. I would rate the movie a c-. The movie is very slow to start. The plot does not really begin until at least a half an hour into the movie. It is understandable that they would lip sing for the movie, but it should be done professionally as not to distract you form the movie when the signing and mouths do not line up. The camera work for the movie is extremely predictable. I knew exactly where the camera was going to go next. This took a lot of the excitement for me out of the film. Also I had a problem with the sets. There were times when the sets looked like those from a musical and other times when they looked like ones one would expect in a movie. I would think they would pick one style they were going for and stick with it. I would recommend this movie for people who like classic movie musicals and who do not focus on the camera work, but on an emotional plot and nice music. I do not recommend this movie for those who want to be entertained by a good movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1311,leighchristine,Beautiful,10,15 December 2004,"This is a truly beautiful movie. The sets, costumes, everything about how it looks - nothing was left unattended to - it's just gorgeous. I was fortunate to be able to see it at a preview screening and am now looking forward to seeing it again after it opens on December 22.The acting is good, with Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver leading the way. The singing is good - I think Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson (he has a lovely voice) sound beautiful together. Her voice is not as strong a soprano as Sarah Brightman, and she is singing it a little lower (I think), but she is just beautiful in the role. I thought Gerard Butler was good to all right. To be fair, whenever I have seen the show on the stage (four times - once on Broadway, twice in San Francisco during its record run there, and once on tour), I always had a few minutes of adjustment to the fact that it wasn't Michael Crawford I was hearing (I wore out my London cast recording a long time ago), so that had to happen here as well, but I don't think it happened quite as successfully as it did with any of the other actors I've seen in the role. He's not bad, not by miles, but I didn't feel as affected by the Phantom's plight as wanted to be. Patrick Wilson was quite the surprise for me - the only place I'd seen him before was in ""Angels in America"" in a role that couldn't be more different from Raoul, but I thought he was a wonderful Raoul. I read a critic's review that said his accent was flat - well the accents are not consistent - Wilson and Rossum are American - most of the rest are British, or Scottish in the case of Butler, and as far as I can tell only Miranda Richardson was affecting a French accent. None of that bothered me, though. And whatever accent Minnie is using (Italian or Spanish) - it works - she is a hoot. The film shows a little more background for the characters than the stage show does, and travels back and forth between the time period when the story opens and the flashback to the time period where most of the story occurs throughout the movie, and I think that works to make the narrative a little more cohesive. The ending that is used in the stage version is here, but then there is one scene more that is the end of the film. I liked the use of black and white for the present day scenes and it is particularly effective in the last scene.I will be interested to hear what people think who have never seen the show on the stage, but for those who have and loved it - not to worry - it has been transferred well.",The Phantom of the Opera
1312,kimkendall007,Absolutely fantastic!,10,15 December 2004,"Having been a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production for many years, I was a little worried that the film would deviate too much from it. However, I needn't have worried. The film was excellently produced and the labyrinth scenes very impressive. The film makers really did the Phantom justice, portraying his vulnerable and lonely sides just as much as those we have come to traditionally associate with him. Gerard Butler was magnificent as the Phantom and showed us equally how he could be menacing and also vulnerable and ultimately, a devastated man.I will definitely be going to see this again!",The Phantom of the Opera
1313,Almost_Infamous,it gave me chills,10,4 January 2005,"I've been a fan for at least ten years and this movie was amazing. I sang along with the songs and got chills from some of the scenes. Yes, it got slow at times but most movies do. Unlike most movies, however, this one made up for the slow parts. The group I viewed the movie with included someone who was totally unfamiliar with the play and she still loved the movie. The decision to cast a relatively low profile actress as Christine, in my opinion, was a marvelous move. Casting someone with more ""star power"" would have detracted from the fantasy. My main complaint was the falling chandelier. It was placed towards the end of the movie, and while it worked well there, one can't get the full effect without actually seeing it fall in person. In short: While it isn't an exact copy of the play, I definitely recommend this!",The Phantom of the Opera
1314,rcekim,It's finally here!,9,15 December 2004,"Overall, pretty amazing! Would rate it an A-. Having seen the stage version four times and listened to the music for 18 years, I was still overwhelmed. This movie is a spectacular treat for the eyes and ears. The opening transformation of the b&w 1919 derelict opera house to its former 1870's reds and golds sends chills when accompanied by the rumbling cords of Lloyd Webber's theater organ. The new ending scene captures the undying devotion of Raoul and the Phantom for the same woman. PROs: 1. The music, the music, the musicHowever, Gerard Butler's weakness in the Phantom's premiere numbers (Phantom of the Opera, Music of the Night) is an obvious disappointment to fans. He's no Michael Crawford, but the rest of Butler's performance is good. Emmy Rossum is a perfect Christine and the balance of the cast is right on. 2. Staging, costumes and makeup are superb. You are provided with a great period theatrical sense both from behind the curtain and from the Parisian audience. Open gas lights, literal board walks in the flys, Carlotta's 'over the top' hair and pink gown in Don Juan, etc. The Masquerade is now a dramatic black and white (costumes and makeup, not film) with gold lighting vs. the rainbow colors of the stage version. 3. The camera affords the opportunity to make a more intimate story. Close ups allow you the feel the strong hypnotic influence the Phantom has over Christine. While the cutting between color and b&w has been done successfully before, its use through out this film adds to the storytelling by creating another dimension not available on the stage. The addition of the grave yard sword fight and relocation of the falling chandelier feel right and natural. The Phantom's underground lake abode is more mystical (akin to Merlin's cave) than haunting. CON: 1. The age problem. It is made clear that Madame Giry had saved, sheltered and nurtured the Phantom from when they were both young (her age 14 and his 9?). This questions the casting of Gerard Butler as a 'young' Phantom. If Madame Giry is now the ballet mistress (age 45?) and has her own daughter, Meg, in the ballet cast, then the Phantom should be 40ish. Meg and Christine appear to be the same age as do the Raoul and the Phantom.I can't wait to see it again!!!

1315,blankmusicjunk,Tin Voices & Shiny Trinkets,1,15 December 2004,"I do not hate Andrew Lloyd Weber, but I hated this film. Lord, how I hated this film. Do you know the agonizing sound of sharp fingernails screeching across a dry chalkboard? That's how much I hated this film. It's very shiny. The sets are colorful. However, the acting is flat, and the singing is very, VERY weak. With a multi-million dollar budget, there is NO excuse for casting actors in the three leading roles who cannot sing OR act. Combining these weak performers with a desperately extravagant film is like saying that a basset hound is a brain surgeon just because he has a scalpel in his paw. Just being cute isn't enough to do the job right.One more detail: As the Phantom began to appear more and more in the film, the audience I was viewing with began to laugh at him more and more. I took that to be a very bad sign, unless Joel Schumacher is trying to branch out into musical comedy. If so, he really should have had a different ad campaign. Or perhaps just directed a different movie. Or a better one.",The Phantom of the Opera
1316,raprice69-1,Phantastic!,10,16 December 2004,"I went to see the Phantom not knowing what to expect really. I am a fan of the Lloyd Webber musical, but was unsure whether the magic of the stage show could be translated onto the big screen. What I saw was a film with excellent cinematography and cast to perfection. I have heard criticism of the quality of the two leading cast members EM and GB, but for me, Chritine was enchanting and the Phantom an excellent blend of obsessive lust and manic madness. My only criticism: the opening sequence (with the chandelier) is so breathtaking that the rest of the film has no chance of living up to it. If you're a fan of the show, go and see it. If you're a fan of the musical genre, go and see it. If you're neither of these, go and see it anyway - unless you don't like a film where there aren't any car chases and people getting shot. 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
1317,srbender,"Well, at least Minnie Driver was good",3,16 December 2004,"Any time a musical is adapted to film from a successful stage production, it is simultaneously feared and anticipated. Such has been the case with The Phantom of the Opera. Given the recent successful transfers of Chicago and Hedwig and the Angry Inch from stage to screen, and the seeming rebirth of the movie musical, it figures that the second longest running Broadway show would be adapted into a film that very well my kill the recent renters of the celluloid musical.There are myriad problems with this embarrassing film, so we'll just start at the top and work down. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) is wrong for the role, plain and simple. He has neither the vocal ability nor the soulful heartache the role requires. And if he's lived under the Opera House for so long, why does the unmasked side of face have so much color? Isn't this the one time a pasty complexion would be acceptable? And then there's Christine, acted beautifully by Emmy Rossum, but with a singing voice so light, that had she even tried to take on an operatic lead in those days, she'd be booed off the stage. She's like a prettier Charlotte Church, and like Ms Church, her voice may be great in a few years, like after she finishes puberty, but for the moment is merely adequate.Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, and Simon Callow all turn in credible performances, and Minnie Driver (whose singing is dubbed) really steals the show as Carlotta, the resident diva. Her mugging and outrageous mood swings provide the most engaging moments of the film, which is problematic when you consider how minor her character is.As for the adaptation, it appears that Joel Schumacher has run out of originality, aping iconic imagery not from the stage Phantom, but from Moulin Rouge and the recent film of Chicago. Andrew Lloyd Webber's score sounds even more redundant and uninspired with a stunning physical production to distract. This also makes the holes in the story and the underdevelopment of the characters even more painfully evident than on stage. At least on stage, Hal Prince took a mediocre score and book and turned them into a spectacular experience by using stage magic, and for it's time, cutting edge technology. Every effect that seemed remarkable on stage is undermined by the fact that it isn't so amazing on film.Hopefully, this one will sneak by and not bring the movie musical revival back to it's grave.",The Phantom of the Opera

I found the costumes very good they had such a vast area to cover and they have succeeded! I particularly liked at the end with the climax. The music throughout changed your mood which is key when seeing a film such as this therefore very successful.

Even if you don't care for the music, the movie itself is a spectacular sight. The camera's plays on light and dark to complement the theme of the movie is wonderful, the costumes are lavish, and the sets are beautifully constructed, especially the labyrinth scenes.I was shocked at the talent of the cast, especially Gerard Butler, who really dabbled between the villain and tragic hero figures.

1321,zainyartist7,"Joel Scumacher, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?",2,15 April 2005,"I was so excited about this movie, having read the book and seen the musical. But I was utterly horrified when I saw this. One of my favorite musicals of all time turned into some weird popified version with bad acting. Number one: Emmy Rossum cannot act. All she seems to do is close her eyes, sigh, look all pretty, cry, and beg to be saved. Her voice was also too high for the part. Number two: Gerard Butler cannot sing! I was in shock as he sang ""The Music of the Night"" and as he's about to sing the last note of the movie I covered my ears, it was so horrible. Number three: Carlotta's character was ruined. Her voice, which was originally pretty only a little over the top, was turned into a super over the top, terrible thing. And what happened to that little cat-fight between Christine and Carlotta?So many of the parts that were supposed to be sung were spoken, which made them loose all power. The costumes were OK, but they seemed to show more of the actresses than some of us would have liked to have seen. Quite possibly the only thing that saved the movie was the sets, although they changed the location of a lot of things. It's not supposed to be the Opera Populaire, it's the Paris Opera House. And what happened to the underground lake??? The Phantom also wasn't ugly enough, he's supposed to be terribly deformed. They were super lazy with the make-up, the second time I was looking for it. Look at his right eye, is it drooping or disfigured? No! Seriously, what happened to the sad, lonely, musical genius? He was so amazing, you could really feel for him and understand his pain. In this, it's like Hey just come step through a mirror and ride in a boat with me! Then we'll sing and stand around turning each other on.Joel Schumacher took a totally wonderful and beautiful musical and turned it into one of the worst films I have ever seen. It hurts to see something that was so wonderful totally destroyed. I was crying at the end but not about the story.",The Phantom of the Opera
1322,dhuskinson,The Stage musical finally comes to the screen,10,24 January 2005,"As an avid fan of the musical I awaited the film release and boy was the wait worth it. The opening alone sets the scene in a way that couldn't have been done on stage, the changes from black and white to colour as the chandelier rises is superb. The story has been slightly rearranged for the film but actually makes better sense than the stage for it, I mean we discover who and why the phantom is where he is and also why Raoul buys the musical box, and in the process discover that the phantom somehow survives, the director has done a marvellous job in conjunction with ALW. All I can say is don't miss it especially if you are a fan of the musical, it should win Oscars but it wont, so when they say the best film is you know it should be Phantom.",The Phantom of the Opera

1324,willpattonsbitch10,Gerard is the best,10,19 December 2004,"I have recently seen this marvelous movie and would like to comment it. I liked everything on it but unfortunately for me I had to see in Spanish because in the place where I live in they translate all the English spoken films, so I didn't have the chance to see this epic classical musical in its original version. I would like to have seen it in English because Gerard Butler has a very beautiful voice, moreover, I love his Scottish accent, it sounds so sweet that the first time I bought a DVD of Gerard, I heard his voice which made me fall in love with him. Moreover, after watching the movie I bought the sound track of this film and I found that Gerard can sing very well. He surprised me very much. His character is really sad and made him adore the Phantom because he was ignored by everybody, even since he was a child he was seen as a monster due to his disfigured face. What a tragedy! This made me love him, specially in the last part of the film, where he took Christine to the darkest part of the Opera House. Although it could seem that the Phantom was a crazy man, in my opinion he was totally in love with Christine and was not capable of attacking her. He just wanted the best for his platonic love. I wanted her to have escaped with the Phantom instead with Raoul, who seemed to be just a little boy with no experience. Christine was really nice and should have left Raoul for the Phantom, who was much better and with a real good heart. Despite of having the appearance of an ugly man, the Phantom had a gold heart. The performances are excellent although in the Spanish version it is a complete disaster. I would have preferred to see the film in English with the beautiful Scottish accent of Gerard. I also found this film very romantic and I hope it wins many awards in the next Oscar edition. In conclusion, it is a very recommendable movie for all those who like music and movies.",The Phantom of the Opera
1325,wildmanta,Overall (and thats all that counts) this was a HIT!!!!,8,19 December 2004,"I'm a huge fan of the musical Phantom of the Opera and feel that, after seeing the stage show twice in London, once on Broadway and once in Toronto that I am equipped enough to offer a fair and balanced review of the movie production. I don't see how people who are unfamiliar with the history of the Phantom story can post such rigid reviews (I've even read the unbelievably boring Gaston Leroux book) and not even know the ins and outs of the story. Anyhoo, I am at peace with the overall choice of the cast. Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds are hilarious as the comic relief characters of Firmin and Andre and even more so, they are actually um-annoying for once due to their limited screen time (for anyone who has seen the musical, Lloyd Webber cut the amount of ""Notes"" numbers there were...good thing he did or I would have gone mad and maybe cut the chandelier myself). I never have been a big fan of Carlotta, but Minnie Driver's performance was astounding and commendable. So what if she didn't sing the role herself...Carlotta's screeching first soprano voice is hard for any trained singer to handle. Her Italian accents are hilarious and she is a star to watch. Her scenes kept me smirking and giggling. Kudos to Carlotta!!! And now we come to the principles. I'll go ahead and admit my prejudices against Raoul. I offer no apologies in calling him ""a wimp and a wuss"" and sitting in the theaters for the stage show, I've almost wished the Phantom would have strangled HIM and not that fat guy. I just hate Raoul the character, but Patrick Wilson (of ""Angels in America"") really brought out the best in the character and made me reconsider my opinion of Christine's gentle-but-whiny beau. He has a wonderful voice and it reaches its full potential in ""All I Ask of You"". Some people haven't liked the extra footage of the sword fight between the Phantom and Raoul in the graveyard scene, but I enjoyed it: it really made Raoul more of a fighter and not just some push-over. Alright, now I'm going to get a little negative but if you've really read this far, you must care enough about my opinion to endure a few criticisms about our star of the show. Emmy Rossum should not have been cast. There. I said it. First off, she's way too young to be Christine. The book had the role at 24 years, and Sarah Brightman (the original West End Christine) was in her late twenties. Emmy is only 18 which I think that Christine's role deserves a bit more maturity, though Emmy is a good actress. I can't say anything against Emmy's voice, because I think its commendable and personally, far better sounding than Sarah Brightman's nasally, whiny air-pipes but that doesn't really serve as an automatic whammy for casting. I was disappointed that Joel Schumacher put such a neurotic emphasis on beating down the ages to make this movie more appealing for young people. Emmy just kind of stood out like a sore thumb and didn't bring Christine to life but just kind of floated between two gorgeous men emotionless and pathetically. And now on the the star of the show, Gerard Butler as the Phantom of the Opera. Yes, this is Butler's first major headliner film. Yes, he doesn't have musical theater training. His deep, baritone voice sends chills down my spine and my girlie hormones where out of control when he sang ""Music of the Night"" and by the time we got to ""The Point of No Return"" I felt like just ripping my bra off. A lot of reviewers are bitching because he's too young (34 in real life, I believe) and the Phantom is technically supposed to be like in the 50s or 60s (Michael Crawford, the original Phantom god, was 42) but this is one exception I will make in Joel Schumacher's quest for the casting fountain of youth. I think that by making his age similar to Raoul's, it creates more of the scenario that the Phantom is just a man, scarred by his past, who is hopelessly in love but confused in how to express it. I actually tried making sense of the whole ""angel of music"" bit and how (I'm left to infer) the Phantom is like a fatherly mentor...I have studied the book and find no age details for the Phantom, nor any description of him being some kind of incarnation of her father, and Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't go into detail in the stage script (which I own a copy of) so I'm left to deem it acceptable for the Phantom to be young and hot. After all, his face may be scarred, but he has one sexy bod. The whole thing about the shrinking mask is amusing but not harmful to the story. In the early movie versions, the mask covered the whole face like Zorro's. In the musical, it splits right down the Phantom's face. In this movie, it covers his right cheekbone and eye, that's about it. Anyone who complains about that ruining the portrayal of the Phantom needs to quit sucking their thumb and grow up. Gerard Butler's performance of the Phantom really brings out the sensitive, confused lover and not some tyrannical hunchback-of-Notre-Dame character. While Gerard's other movie credits have been a bit dull, I would recommend the 2001 USA film ""Attila"". Hey, if he can make the Scourge of God into a humble, sympathetic character, why not the Phantom? Kudos to the casting of Gerard Butler and yeah, he's not Michael Crawford...but who is? I think he does an excellent job. Overall, I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and right up there with the highly acclaimed musical itself. Andrew Lloyd Webber has done it again!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1326,VIVIENP,absolutely brilliant,10,20 December 2004,"i cant understand anyone not enjoying this film. it has all the magic of the stage version, but with fabulous special effects and sets, that couldn't have been reproduced on the stage. i don't think the character of the phantom suffered any by being gorgeous. it made you more sympathetic towards him he had a fabulous voice, and the set pieces between him and Christine were superb. even Minnie driver was great as the diva . the only slightly weak link was Jennifer Ellison, who is not a great actress. she was passable though. the whole thing was breathtaking, and there was not a sound in the cinema from start to finish, which is always a good indication that a film is going down well. i would highly recommend this to anyone.",The Phantom of the Opera
1327,rejxu,Simply excellent,10,20 December 2004,"Compete with Moulin Rouge while trashing Chicago, The Phantom of the Opera is an incredible Musical. The romantic twists keeps you on through the whole film. Simply a film no one should miss. In my opinion this is the best film of 2004, and surely one of the best films I ever saw. Who likes the opera of the Phantom of the Opera will surely by magnified with the songs played in this film. Just can't lose to watch this magnificent production. The best part of the film in my opinion was when the phantom cruised Kristina in the place where he used to live.

1328,camille_cheshire,a good watch,9,20 December 2004,"As a teenager, yet to see the stage version , i found this a brilliant film to watch, Gerard Butler delivers a performance to make us feel sorry for the phantom and see his pitiful self throughout the show.the strong vocal talents of Butler delivers a powerful performance. the same could be said for Emmy Rossum who plays Christine, however her completely dry acting skills really does let her character down. Patrick Wilsons performance is also quite appalling and shows know acting talent at all.as for Jennifer Ellison, although she has a voice suitable for a pop career she was far beyond her co-stars in this opera.however , Minnie driver (although granted the singing voice was not her own) gave a funny, light hearted performance as Carlotta. as always Miranda Richardson shone though and far beyond her fellow cast members with her exceptional delivery of the mysterious Madame Giry.its difficult to make a stage film fit the silver screen but somehow , it just about works, from people around me i hear that it is a bit behind the stage version, but of swirled be . we are looking at audience participation cinema",The Phantom of the Opera

If you will never see this play, the movie MIGHT be worth it.I'm not a huge fan of Andrew Lloyd Weber, but the theatrics and audience involvement in Phantom are a work of beauty on stage. I'll admit, that the first time you really hear the phantom theme, it's very cheeseball. . .and for some reason Joel Schumacher decided not to expound on this at all.This movie had great potential, if someone were to re-conceptualize it. If someone were to take a few liberties with this story and actually adapt it for the screen (musical or not) it could have been something great.I laughed the first time I saw the phantom. And, I laughed pretty much each time thereafter. The guy can't sing. . .I don't know how he got cast as a lead. Plus, he looks goofy.You know, I take my initial advice back. If you never intend to see the play, you should still avoid this movie at all costs. . .don't ruin it for yourself.",The Phantom of the Opera
1330,wonderserena,"If you hate musicals, read me",1,21 December 2004,"Well a friend of mine desperately wanted to go the sneak of Phantom of the Opera, one of the QUEEREST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! Oh it was rough, but marginally better then Alexander. What a surprise that it was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes where if you have any form of a gay kiss in your movie, you will be nominated. Actually there wasn't a gay kiss in Phantom of the Opera, just a bunch of pounces prancing around. I actually expected Madonna to pop out at one point and start singing, ""Come on Vogue- let your body dance to the music."" My friend is also annoyed at me because I keep referring to his favorite song in the movie as the- 'You don't bring me flowers anymore' song because it sounded exactly like that song. The movie would have been much cooler if Neil Diamond played the Phantom. Neil even has the wardrobe, that sparkly shirt from the final concert scene in the Jazz Singer would have fit in nicely in any scene in this hunk of celluloid and would have brought a level of class in that this film was lacking. I mean it did kind of have that 7pm show in Branson, MI feel but it did need a little something extra, like Neil Diamond.Did I mention my complete and utter hatred of Joel Schumacher? I don't believe in hell, but I revise this opinion when it comes to that hack. Oh, it is a crime against humanity to see what he did to Batman, it actually hurt the part of my soul that's only been touched by the Benji movies. That's how deep Schumacher has hurt me. Schumacher has done nothing to repair the 8MM/St. Elmo's Fire/Flatliners/Batman & Robin damage that he has afflicted with Phantom of the Opera. Phantom didn't cause any further damage. I'll walk away without nightmares unlike Batman & Robin. Yet again I feel like it was lacking something, I don't know, something like interesting characters and a interesting plot. Also the population at large should really ask itself- 'Do we need another Andrew Lloyd Weber anything?' Hasn't Cats taught us anything?",The Phantom of the Opera

There is something for everyone, with comedy moments a lot of romance, suspense and drama.The film gives a whole new depth to the story and the special effects are very clever without being over the top.Joel Schumacer has done a fantastic job of bringing this Famous musical to the big screen without losing any of the magic associated with it.

I went with a hardcore theater Phantom lover and all he could talk about was how horrible the singing was and how much better he could have directed it! His comment was only people that have not seen the stage play will like it! He may be correct but so far to say my last date with him! I think for an adaptation it was OK, no Chicago that's for sure as far as the cast although Christine had a pretty voice the singing did not stir my emotions nor did I have sadness for the Phantom character. There was a chemistry of passion missing from the singing to me (it was memorized by the performers but not felt by them as far as acting) that kept me from the number one goal in all movies and theater productions, temporarily suspension from disbelief.Sometimes people are good singer and not so good actors, sometimes it is vice versa. Sometimes they are neither. With all the talent in the world I think they could have done more with the acting singing than just the film content of the visuals. My two cents.

Some parts were a little cheesy (mainly the portions in ""present time""), but overall it was thrilling. ""Music of the Night"" was deliciously erotic... and Gerard Butler as Erik was both sensual and grotesque.

The acting as well as singing was impressive and I found Minnie Driver gave the performance of her career. The sets, costuming, cinematography, and choreography were very well done. The classic filming in the black and white of the 1920 scenes was brilliant and distinguished the two periods from one another. I found it could not really compare to the other musicals we've seen in the last few years. One because, Moulin Rouge, one of my all time favorites was completely original, and Chicago was excellent, but a completely different musical style.

I've ordered the soundtrack as I think in most cases it is better than the stage version I already have. And I too would have liked more volumn from the theater's speakers. Loved almost every aspect of the film, wasn't sure how I was going to like the ""flashback"" idea, but it did tie everything together.

The actors' voices hold up surprisingly well compared to the stage (although I don't think anyone could ever upstage Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman).

Why turn a great stage play into a 3rd rate movie. I did not see any of the subtle meaning in the movie that is in the play. Even the owners of the opera were just clowns. Where is the phantoms famous laugh? I keep thinking of Zorro when he moved his cape. Speaking of Zorro, no wonder Antonio backed out of this after reading this version. The scene where he came out as Don Jaun or rather was suppose to come out as Don Jaun instead he comes out as The Phantom. Guess what? Nooo body knew it was really the phantom.

Granted he had Webber's absolute approval and the core elements of the stage production were intact, and actually enhanced on film. What lacks on stage--subtle nuances as facial expressions and tears--comes through stunningly on film. I cannot say enough about the cast. Emmy Rossum--absolutely perfect; I think I enjoyed her more than Sarah Brightman. Patrick Wilson--emotionally connected to Raul. Gerard Butler--he's no Michael Crawford, and that is a GOOD thing.

I am a huge fan of the play and have seen it a number of times and I thought that the movie was everything that it should be and more. The only problem I had with it was what looks to be a common problem amongst fans of the play and movie. The Masquarade line change. To our friends that are here. Granted it had to be changed because the chandelier was not broken when they did the number but you could have thought of something a little better Mr. Webber. I loved the cast Gerad Butler gave the best performance of Phantom that I have seen since Crawford did it. I feel that this is something that the fans of the play will treasure forever. When it hits DVD I will be able to watch Phantom whenever I want. I hope that this and other movies such as Chicago Evita and Moulin Rouge start up the movie musical scene again. Here hoping for Les Mes and Miss Siagon to hit the screen soon. And Mr Webber I can now safely forgive you for making Jesus Christ Superstar.,The Phantom of the Opera

We especially liked the parts that explained, in further detail, how the Phantom came to be at the opera house as well as the flashbacks from older Raoul. Emmy Rossum is incredible and Patrick Wilson, as Raoul, gave the best and most sympathetic impression that we have seen to date. Many times, Raoul comes off as a distraction to the love between the Phantom and Christine. Here, it was equal. Gerard Butler was not as strong as I would like him to be, but was not a major distraction. All in all, the long awaited movie rendition of this wonderful show is fantastic!

Having been a nearly obsessive fan of the musical since 1986, I was expecting the worst.

I would have walked out if it wasn't sub zero and pouring with rain. But the Cinematography in the film was absolutely amazing, and it made the most boring scenes almost bearable, the cinematographer and his crew must be pretty annoyed that they had done such a good job and the director of the film had done such a bad job. It has to be so annoying for the camera crew knowing that the film will be so bad.

The acting, the dancing, the singing, the scenery, the costumes and the music...will surely make you watch the movie again and again and again. I haven't seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage so I didn't know the story, but the film explains it very well...but we all know that when working on a movie you could play and create as much as you want, because there is no live audience. Reading reviews, I have come across many who said, that the acting and sometimes the singing wasn't very promising..well to be honest, I do have to say that I AGREE. Joel Schumacher's Christine, seems a very talented woman but I see her as a very young Christine, too young. I would have maybe put Rachel Weiz as Christine..but we have to know if she can sing or not. Raul..hmmm...quite a handsome,strong and a man full of love..his performance...well..yes,I enjoyed it. The Phantom...ohhh...this was my favorite performance, but I still couldn't see the jealousy he had for Raul..I think I would have put a James Caviziel as the Phantom. But these are just my thoughts about the acting and how I would change the performers. One of my other ideas about the choosing of the cast, would be a sort of survey..we all know that there are many actors on stage who play and sing the parts like no one else..so the people who have seen many different performances could vote for the best Phantom, the best Christine and the best Raul. This is of course one of my ideas. People who read this review and who haven't seen the movie yet..I suggest you do!

If you look at the end when Christine returns, it seems ( as small a moment as it is) that there was a type of hope in the eyes of the Phantom. Then when she places the ring in his hand, his heart is just ripped out of his chest and put in a grinder. ( to state it mildly). There was one other thing about the end that I thought was a nice touch. After she gave him the ring, it looked almost as if Christine wanted to stay with Erik.

She didn't have that overly opera feel to it, I really enjoyed it. Patrick Wilson was, I think, the best performer in the cast. He had a great voice. Gerard Butler played an EXCELLENT phantom and for me to say that is a lot. I enjoyed Micheal Crawfords version equally as much as Butler's. The actress who played Meg was absolutely wonderful and Madame Giry was also cast wonderfully. I disagree with the previous review in saying it looked to much like a filmed version of the stage show. A lot of it was supposed to take place in the opera house, so a lot of it did. I think it was very appropriate and when there were outdoor scenes, they DID look like they were outdoors and not staged. They were also appropriate.

I have seen the musical when it tours and I thought the movie did the musical justice. I thought Gerard made a wonderful Phantom, so full of anger and hurt. Emmy has a beautiful voice and she played the role innocently. Patrick was wonderful as well. I've never seen anything that he has done before but I think I would like to now. I'm so glad that I got the chance to see this film. The scenes and sets were beautiful. The orchestrations were amazing. It takes a lot to get me to cry at movies but Phantom did it in a heartbeat. There is nothing that I could say that was bad about this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

It was an emotional experience, for each of us (myself, wife, 5 kids). The music was passionate, and the story line touched our souls.This movie was an EXACT interpretation of the play on Broadway. No expense was spared in making sure that the movie was the duplicate. The acting was stellar, the music perfect, the voices were lovely; the scenery stunning. For anyone who loved the play - see this movie as often as you can, and buy the DVD the day it comes out.This movie is far beyond anything I have ever experienced before. I cried and cried at the end; just like I did at the play. What an emotional experience this movie is! Incredible.",The Phantom of the Opera
1352,98007312,"Overall, it was amazing",9,23 December 2004,"I, along with one of my best friends, had been waiting for this movie for an incredibly long time. We were so anxious that we saw the first show on the first day. The sets and cinematography were absolutely amazing. I have read the book and listened to the original soundtrack over and over again and can distinctly remember the wonderful tones of Michael Crawford's voice. However, when Gerard Butler began to sing the part of the phantom, I felt like he did no justice to the role. I couldn't feel the emotion nor could I really enjoy the part of my favorite character. Something was off, the timing maybe, but it was something I could just not get over. By the end, with the song ""Point of No Return,"" I thought his emotion and singing improved greatly from his rendition of ""The Music of the Night."" Emmy Rossum was phenomenal for how young she is. I'm glad they had a young girl play the part of Christine because it really showed well how she's trying to mature and she can take one path, the phantom's, or another with Raoul. Some might find it extravagant, lengthy and overdone but if not for that it wouldn't have half the effect that it does. Overall, the casting as well was great for every part. Butler's voice was lacking I felt but his face and costuming fit well. Driver was hilarious as the Italian diva, Carlotta, and Madame Giry played a wonderfully mysterious role. The movie is amazing if you can get past the less than perfect portrayal of the phantom's ""angelic"" voice.",The Phantom of the Opera
1353,getreel89,The best movie I've ever seen!,10,23 December 2004,"This is quite possibly the Best movie I have ever seen! The singing is phenomenal and the acting is nearly flawless. Patrick Wilson is amazing as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is inspiring as Christine. Minnie Driver, who I love always, was hilarious as Colotta. This movie is a great adaptation of the play. The songs have been running through my head since I saw the movie. The choreography was stupendous as well, especially in Masquerade. Every dancer was perfectly in step. Personally, my favorite song was All I Ask of You, simply because I already love that song and Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson did it so perfectly. I cried twice during the movie, once in the cemetery scene, and once when the Phantom was listening to the monkey music box play. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I don't know what you're waiting for, but you need to get to the theaters right now and go see it. You will Love it!",The Phantom of the Opera
1354,sweetangelady,Awesome movie..not to be missed!!,10,23 December 2004,"This movie blew me away. The Music was amazing, Andrew Lloyd Webber's finest work. Even if you have seen the musical on stage, it will still thrill you and take your breath away. The music sent shivers down my spine the entire movie, it will carry you on a emotional journey with the characters. Emily Rossum and Gerard Butler were wonderful. Gerard Butler was astonishing as the Phantom, the embodiment of a tragic romantic villain.Word of warning however, if you have heard Michael Crawford sing the Phantom songs, you might be a tad disappointed, but in the end you will still love the voice of the Angel of Music.

1355,queenie_monster2,Just saw it...WOW!!,9,23 December 2004,"Well I had my doubts going into the theater since I have seen the show on stage in London. I thought the singing might not be up to snuff or that the direction would be questionable. Boy was I wrong!! Emmy Rossum was fantastic. She sang very well, the best of the three leads. She was great!! When I first heard the Phantom singing, I was dreading the rest of the movie. Then Music of the Night came and my apprehension was gone. Butler did a good job, but some notes came out too raspy and guttural, not smooth and tender. As for Wilson, he was adequate in the Count's limited role. The rest of the movie: sets, costumes, the music were all excellent. Had a little quibble about the ""rearranging"" of certain plot points but I won't give it away. Very well done movie!! (Even though I think Michael Crawford as the Phantom would have made this a smash :)) You'll definitely be needing a Kleenex at the end!",The Phantom of the Opera
1356,rfsahae,Almost Perfect,9,23 December 2004,"Better than the stage show for the clarity of lyrics, motivations, close up shots of reactions and marvelous special effects. Well cast, characters believable. Unbelievable sets, detail, makeup, costumes. I'm expecting to see this movie nominated for an Oscar in that field. The quasi opening scene where the chandelier rises and we go back in time is one of the nicest special effects sequences I have ever seen. Very true to the original musical. Only one complaint, and it is a small one. I was disappointed in the power and clarity of the Phantom's singing. The remainder of the voices were definitely up to the task. Supporting cast, Meg Giry, Diva Carlotta, very good.",The Phantom of the Opera

I've read some reviews that weren't that great, and I totally disagree with them. I can't wait to go see it again! I've seen the play several times and always came away not really understanding the whole story. The movie goes deeper into the characters and explains a little about why the Phantom is the way he is, and how he came to be living under the opera house. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie, and I believe the others in the theater (a full house) felt the same way. I highly recommend this movie as well as the soundtrack (which I've had for over a month). Can't wait for the DVD!",The Phantom of the Opera

For those of us who loved the stage play I must state that the movie is at least as good if not better than the play. It answers some of the questions we all had "" How did the phantom get in the opera house in the first place. Why is he so disfigured. and what happened to Raul and Christine?""All are answered in this versionThe music is fantastic as one would expect and Ms. Driver is wonderfulPS I have just read all the reviews shown on this site and have one question"" What movie did they see"" It certainly wasn't the same one I sawI thought the film was great!

1359,katedavis,Do Not Miss this Holiday Season!,9,23 December 2004,"I absolutely LOVED Joel Schumacher's rendition of the classic, ""Phantom of the Opera""! The cinematography was undeniably some of the best I've ever seen, and of course it is coupled with a historically unparalleled score and plot.I thought Gerard Butler did a great job in bringing some ""humanness"" to the Phantom, and made a sympathetic case for him. Musically he was a bit weaker, I thought, but overall very good.Emmy Rossum does well as Christine Daae, bringing both an innocence and an incredible voice to a role that had a lot to live up to.Patrick Wilson plays dreamy Raoul - a true hero's hero if there ever was one.And of course Minnie Driver is a true spoiled diva as Carlotta. Along with a stellar support cast, this is one movie that earns my vote for Oscar notoriety! The only question in my mind is HOW MANY?! If you don't have a chance to see it for the holidays, it would make a great girlfriend's night out to offset those post-Christmas blues.",The Phantom of the Opera
1360,elikapekakanale,Disappointment,1,24 December 2004,"Anyone who liked the original production will find this hard to take! As someone who has enjoyed the musical I was skeptical about the switch from stage to screen but I gave it a try hoping the transition would be smooth but it was NOT. My main fear was that they would change too much and they did: for the worse! ALW only agreed to this to get more money-as did Joel Schumacher (who tried way too hard to be classy yet still maintained his standard over-the-top-ness.) The singing was substandard as I'd expected (clearly no one had been in POTO). Worse is that the characters have been turned into clichés (psycho guy, naive girl) via bad acting and unnecessarily added dialogue. Example: because of diva Paris Hilton's Tinkerbell, Carlotta suddenly has a little dog(?)

1361,gillannelliott,The critics don't know what there on about,10,24 December 2004,"Have the critics of this piece even seen the west-end production ? it's suppose to be Noisy ! If you want a namby-pamby insipid film, don't go to see it - if you on the other hand want passion, music, goosebumps (not to mention an insight to the theatrical production for those who have not seen it) GO NOW ! AND BOOK TICKETS ! Really it was just splendid, and for those devotees of the original production i'd say it is 90% faithful to it - yes the chandelier fall has been changed but believe me it makes sense. With the devastating effect it has on the opera house there would be no second half of the movie had remained at the end of act 1. I know Butler in not Michael Crawford but it's done now and we have to live with it, what he lacks in singing ability is more than compensated for in the passion of his performance. He is possibly far too good looking to be the phantom but hey, it makes you like him EVEN MORE ! I am counting the hours till this comes out on DVD, and in the meantime trying to talk my husband into taking me to see it again. Its like having the best seat in the house (front centre stalls incidentally) without the crick in the neck !",The Phantom of the Opera
1362,nels-1,exquisite,10,24 December 2004,The adaptation of the world renowned musical Phantom of the Opera is exquisite. The story has been tweaked with in order to better suit the movie rather than the stage. In addition some story lines are enhanced to show deeper emotions and background to many of the characters. The sets help draw you into the story and set much of the mood. The Music for fans of Broadway is as good as anyone could possibly want. The Acting is exquisite. Emmy Rossum plays Christine the best I have ever seen it played and at the age of only 18. She definitely deserves the nomination for the golden globes and hopefully the academy awards. The only regret is that Michael Crawford does not play the role of phantom. Instead Gerard Butler does his best but seems to handsome and young to be the phantom explained through the back story in the movie. Being that Christine is so young I understand that the phantom only needed to be twice the age but I do believe that a better choice could have been made. The rest of the cast is awesome and the ability and voice of Emmy Rossum more than make up for this one fault.,The Phantom of the Opera
1363,cleverktty,Truly Amazing- A Masterpiece,10,24 December 2004,"I have seen the play five times now and I was extremely skeptical about the movie. I was proved wrong, this move is 10 stars, truly amazing, a wonderful piece of art work. There is no words other then amazing! What Schumacher has created is a timeless masterpiece by taking this classical opera and brining it to the big screen. Its truly magical and exhilarating. Eye opening with a fresh face on the masterpiece. I was surprised on the age level that showed up, it was kids my age in their early twenties or younger. A new generation has begun to love what has stolen the hearts and minds of so many others. This is one movie that I will have to see over and over and over again and when it comes to DVD it will be purchased and cherished for all time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1364,tzumwalde,Loved It,10,24 December 2004,"I have never seen the play but I had listened to the music from it and read books on the play. So when the movie came out I just had to see it. I personally enjoyed it. I must admit it's pretty much a woman's movie. Lots of Romance and all. I took my husband , son, daughter to see it along with her boyfriend. The men at first complained about it being a musical and there were even some men in the audience who had fallen asleep during the performance. Kinda comical! But the women in the audience loved it. Most were crying at the end. I asked the men in my group what they thought and they admitted they liked it. I thought they were just saying that cause we were there. But afterward at home I found my husband listening to the music from the play and my daughter's boyfriend exclaimed he really liked the Phantom's theme music.I guess the beginning of the movie really stuck in his mind when the theater came to life and the music was pounding away. So I would say to those who are contemplating seeing it. It's almost like seeing the play with singing and few said words. It's emotional and goes straight to the heart. May be too corny for some. But I love romance! DO NOT expect it to be exactly like the play with the same actors in it. Thats just silly. One thing for sure is the actor who plays the Phantom in the movie is much more Macho then the play actor. If you love musicals you will love this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1365,arts817,terrible singing,3,24 December 2004,"As a classically trained singer, I was appalled when I heard that they cast a 17 year old in the role of Christine. Even for someone with an unusually mature voice, it would be extremely difficult to sing that part. However, I went in with an open mind. It was so bad I almost left. The visually stunning actors and sets couldn't save it at all. Christine was OK on the bottom, but on top she was breathy and unsupported and frail. Phantom was god awful and Raoul sounded like a backstreet boy. I think they changed the key in several placed also, but I'm not sure. When will Hollywood realize there are pretty people who can sing AND act all over New York?!!? I've seen the stage show twice, and I was definitely very disappointed in the movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

The music is FANTASTIC and although Emmy Rossums acting may be a little wooden at time her voice is amazing and well rivals Sarah Brightman! As for Gerard Butler...he is the most gorgeous phantom and personally had I been Christine I would have chosen him over Raoul!!! Anyway, if you love music, you love a great Gothic love story and you love cinematography this fulfils it all! Andrew Lloyd Webbers music is captivating, emotional and dramatic and the cast of this film do a superb job of the vocals.

Boy were we let down. Gerard Butler is awful and his singing is just not up to scratch to be a professional singer. His acting was also not up to sniff and that deformity made me laugh rather than cry. Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine, was no better. Her singing was too high pitched and a bit on the weak side than most, and her acting was very wooden and closely resembled that of a brain dead zombie. Patrick Wilson was perhaps the only gorgeous and talented one of the bunch and I must say he was the only reason why we didn't leave early, however that hair of his looked awfully tacky.I loved the audiences reaction. One woman next to us said ""This film reminds me of a Jackson Pollock painting.. its pure throw up. Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber must be off his rocker to have made this film"". Another person near us said ""Why is the Phantom wearing such a tacky mask?!"" and once we left the theater not one person that was there was crying. Many left without even a comment!

I loved the cinematography and the costume design. the scenery is so lush and beautiful it was worth the price of admission. expect Oscar noms for best costume design, cinematography etc. perhaps a nom for best picture. some scenes seemed to drag on a bit, but the spectacular settings and ultimate climaxes with the chandelier falling and phantom's own demise. a wonderful, escapist film. highly recommended. 3 out of four stars. art in Texas",The Phantom of the Opera
1369,dho-mitchell,The Movie,10,24 December 2004,"This was a spectacular movie, a surprise, since Joel Schumacher's complete failure with the forth movie of the Batman franchise.This was a wheel planned out and almost true motion picture recreation with some needed and foolish alterations. The main being the placement and execution of the chandelier scene.The cast was a unique, yet fitting group of performers with the precise talent that can easily place them as if they had been preforming the musical for years.The only problem, that both Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber both over looked were the Physical characteristics of the Phantom and of the Opera House itself, particularly the sub-levels.The Phantom (Eric) is suppose to have a complete facial and body deformity of with the face of the person has no nose and appears as if he has been dead for months.The lake under the The Paris Opera House was an glass lake, made of a glass that is stronger than anything of its time.Other then these constantly over looked facts and the background alteration for the Phantom the presentation of the movie hides these things from all, but those whom have no knowledge of this information, and gives a stunning , and better performance of its musical inspiration.",The Phantom of the Opera
1370,ricciofam,Heartbreakingly Beautiful,10,24 December 2004,"This movie grabs you by all your senses, from the opening to the ending. The characters, the score, the location, the theater. The story. The voices, the costumes, the use of color. I saw this last night, and I'm still processing what I was privileged to experience. Emmy is perfect as Christine. Her voice is amazing, and she is beautiful. What a talent! She captures Christine's innocence and vulnerability and strength. Gerard Butler as the Phantom, quite frankly, undid me emotionally. I wanted to run to him and be kind to him and let him know he was worth the love of a young beautiful woman. That he was indeed, a genius. That his physical appearance was nowhere near as bad as he thought it was. And well, if Christine is too stupidly in love with Raoul to want the Phantom, I'd be very happy to show him just how sexy and beautiful he truly is. (Did you see him in the red suit at the masquerade?)Or where his shirt is open revealing his beautiful masculine chest? I'd slip off that mask and anything else he's wearing any day of the week! He's never enjoyed the pleasures of the flesh? I have an idea to fix that problem ;) Sure, he comes off as being some kind of sadistic, controlling madman. But hey, give the poor guy a break. How well do any of you think you'd be functioning given the same traumatic childhood from hell that he went through? I say, the Phantom, specifically Gerard Butler, is my new fantasy man.

1371,frank741,Great Movie,10,24 December 2004,"Having seen the Broadway version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" 17 times, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The sets, costumes and singing were all first rate. I left the theater with the same great feeling as I do when I see the play. I think the best performer was Emmy Rossum. Her acting and singing were outstanding. She truly deserves an Oscar nod for this role. Raoul...the actor was last seen as Col. Travis in ""The Alamo""... was also superb. The phantom was also excellent, although his singing was not as good as Michael Crawford or many of the other phantoms I've seen on Broadway. Nonetheless his acting was great.

I saw the original musical in Toronto several years back and this is a marvelous adaptation of it. Other than a few changes in lyrics(the entire 3rd verse from the title theme is cut,a few lines that are normally sung are spoken)and one major event shift(the falling chandelier occurs near the end instead of halfway through as in the stage production)it is still absolutely breathtaking.A local reviewer here in Detroit gave it a 2 out of 4 star rating.I'd like to know what he was smoking,this is a 4 star,21 gun salute,1st round one punch knockout of a film.I can't wait for this to hit DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
1373,SimplySakka,"Beautiful and moving, a cinematographic delight!",9,24 December 2004,"This was our favorite musical when my husband and I were dating, and when courting me, he would often sing ""All I Ask of You"" to me. So of course, when that scene between Raoul and Christine came up, I was in tears. I was really delighted by the production, honestly. The critics panned it, for the most part, but were honest in saying that the people who loved the musical will most likely love the film... And yes, we did.I loved the cinematography, how they opened with black and white, and then made the theater come to life with color and restoration as the opening credits rolled. I found that Patrick Wilson's portrayal of Raoul was solid, even though his emotional performance was less than passionate, save for the scene when he dissolves into tears when the Phantom abducts Christine during ""The Point of No Return"" which, in my mind, redeemed him. I liked Wilson from the HBO miniseries ""Angels in America"" but in Phantom, he gives an altogether different performance, one which I applaud. Emmy Rossum, a soap veteran and from ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was phenomenal as Christine. She was perfectly innocent, unbelievably talented as a soprano, and very pretty in an unconventional way. ) Miranda Richardson, in my mind, is the quintessential Madame Giry. Of course, I love her most as the spurned wife of Jeremy Irons's character in Damage. She is appearing in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as the animagus reporter Rita Skeeter, and I can't wait to see how she handles that role.The critics furiously panned Minnie Driver's Carlotta, but I thought she was very right for the role. Of course, the singing voice was not hers (though Minnie DOES sing, just not opera), but her strutting and eye-rolling and megalomania was pure Driver at her id-best. I enjoyed it, and I think the critics are being far too hard on her. I found Jennifer Ellison very dry as Meg Giry, and Victor McGuire's Piangi was equally unimpressive. But the theater owners, Firmin and Andre, were played solidly by Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow. Callow many of us remember from Amadeus as Mozart's friend Papageno who encouraged him to write ""The Magic Flute."" He is another ""Angels in America"" alum, and I thought he was quite appropriate as the circumspect Andre.Okay. Now on to Gerard Butler. Butler delighted me beyond belief in Timeline as the romantic Scotsman Andre Marek, who ended up rescuing the French Lady Claire and then chose to stay with her in the middle ages rather than return to the present day. I remember thinking at the time that his performance was solid, and his personality was quite agreeable. I wondered what else he'd been in, or what roles were upcoming for him. Little did I know he would play my beloved Phantom.My boss's wife saw the film earlier this week, and admitted that she was disappointed in the Phantom's performance. She said that Christine and Raoul were wondrous, but she found the Phantom not quite par--until the end. So I admittedly went into the theater this afternoon expecting this, that the Phantom would not quite be what I'd hoped for, but then again, I am not my boss's wife, even though I do respect her opinions. She is a much more active patron in the arts, and quite an accomplished soprano herself.As I watched him appear, seducing Christine into his underground lair, and all of that... I was critical of how un-MichaelCrawford-like he was, though I was aware of how closed-minded I was being, and I dismissed that... I noted that his rendition of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was not to my liking, though his ""Angel of Music"" was quite beautiful and redeeming. As the movie continued, I noted that he did just as good a job as anyone else in the role could have, and though I knew it wasn't appropriate, I wondered if a ""kinder, gentler"" Phantom could have been cast. Realizing that Butler had played that role in Timeline, and he was adapting to the ""mad bloodthirsty genius waxing romantic,"" I then sanctioned him as the best Phantom for the role, as it stood.He romanced Christine perfectly. He was emotional when he needed to be, strong and cruel at times, and truly embodied what Lloyd Webber wanted to portray.That said, I then completely gave myself over to the film, and as Christine placed the famous kiss upon the Phantom in a desperate attempt to save her lover, I burst into tears and I could feel them rolling down my face as I struggled not to sob openly in the theater. I don't think it'd have mattered, there were women boo-hooing right in the seats behind me... It was so moving, particularly the scene where Christine gives the engagement ring back to him, and tears roll down his face as he sings, ""Christine I *love* you..."" My God, but if I didn't bawl. I found myself unable to contain myself even through the credits, and as we left the theater, the cold drops were still rolling down my cheeks.Utterly beautiful. Utterly moving.

1375,bayareaazngrl,"Good, almost great...**spoilers included**",8,25 December 2004,"I've seen the San Francisco Curran version a few times and have seen my share of modern and classic musicals. My expectations of the movie were relatively low, assuming that Michael Crawford and Sara Brightman were not performing.I really did miss Crawford's voice, but I think that Emmy/Christine did a formidable job - she did nothing to detract from the original Christine and her appearance was lovely if not striking. I felt as if only the Phantom's/Butler's voice lacked the necessary power for his part - and in part only b/c I have had the pleasure of hearing better (Crawford). I thought also that Minnie Driver would ruin the movie when I saw her, but she did OK too...The influence of Joel Schumacher was very obvious - in the sweeping, over the top (but immediately impactful and exciting) beginning, and the constant T and A of all of the characters including Christine, was somewhat distracting. Was it really necessary to see her garters, and 6 inches of cleavage at every opportunity?? I guess you have to do something to get the signature of Joel Schumacher and to get husbands and boyfriends all over the world to stay awake! However, it was perhaps fitting for the Phantom of the Opera and for a drama set in Paris, France to be overly as sexual and grandiose as this film.There were a few awkward moments, that kind of took away from the 'fantasy' and 'dreamlike' quality that I've experienced in stage versions, but overall, the smallness of a theater, a superior soundsystem, and the constant visual stimulation (far better than any stage version) was worth it. Some of the sets seemed a little out of place with the overblown smoke and candles set upon moving arms.... but overall the costumes, jewelry and casting was right on. Overall I'd give it a B+ for a person familiar with Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. I was very impressed after the opening scene of black and white to color -- and was pleased that the story was able to come full circle and provide closure. In that way, a good, almost great movie was saved from being disjointed and disappointing cinema.If it were to win awards, I would hope it would be for set and costume design. I felt the cinematography was weak at times..... focus could have been better and made the story more engrossing. Definitely a movie for a romantic.",The Phantom of the Opera

The set designs were out of this world. If this movie and cast do not receive nominations for multiple Academy Awards, I would be extremely surprised.

1377,aargenteus,Excellent movie.,10,25 December 2004,"I am a huge phan of the musical, and I loved the movie as well. The plot made a lot more sense to me in the movie. Emmy Rossum's voice is not quite at the level of Sarah Brightman's but then again, she is significantly younger. All the same, I believe that she does very well in the role of Christine Daae. Gerard Butler is an amazing phantom, and my favorite parts of the movie were when he was there. I especially enjoyed ""The Point Of No Return"" scene. The tension was very nearly tangible, and I was sitting there thinking, ""Dang....forget Raoul. I'm going with the phantom...."" I was so near tears in the end of the movie that my friend handed me a tissue!",The Phantom of the Opera
1378,broadwayactress17,Oscar Worthy,10,25 December 2004,"I have been entirely consumed by the Phantom of the Opera history, book, and though I haven't seen it yet, the musical. I wish to play Christine in the musical, and so I was very wary of the whole movie idea.Please do not treat this like another I-saw-the-light- review. Because if that is what you think, then please do not read further. I am here to tell you that all my doubts of this movie where subdued, at least most. But I'll get to that later.When the movie started out, I felt compelled to scream for more volume. It was exhilarating, but could have been better in the sound department, (I suppose this may vary in different theaters), and then the movie came. I was enchanted by the spectacle, though I was a little confused about why Carlotta's voice was supposed to be inferior to Christine's, because with all due respect, hers was no show stopper, and the music was just what completed the whole thing. Emmy Rossum to her credit was good at the acting, but I felt pained to hear her sing Think of Me, and high notes. I felt that for the part of a brilliant angelic voice, she failed to deliver. Also, I thought her emotion showed through only when acting. Patrick Wilson was good, but like others I felt that his hair and sometimes slouching position where a distraction. And now for Gerard Butler. I posted at several websites that I despised his singing, and that he would crash the whole movie. But though his voice was slow to get at the beginning, he quickly caught on to the true glory of the phantom, and his acting was truly touching. He was so moving toward the end, I felt I was going to cry.Despite some singing efforts and technical goofs, plus the fact that Minnie Driver might have been used more, The Phantom of The Opera would be completely robbed of it's right if it didn't win best picture at the Oscars. Can't they hear the music of the night?",The Phantom of the Opera

I would have preferred a staged version with trained singers and a faster paced story line...would not see it again nor recommend it!if you have any good reason as to why I should change my opinion please let me know.I sing in A professional Opera Troop and I am very out spoken about my likes and dislikes so bring it on.",The Phantom of the Opera
1380,cruey3,Just like the Broadway version -- only worse,3,26 December 2004,"OK, I must confess: I've never really been a fan of ""Phantom of the Opera."" I have, however, seen the show twice (once in Los Angeles, once in San Francisco) and though it was several years ago, I enjoyed myself -- after all, with Davis Gaines as the Phantom and Dale Kriestien as Christine, how could I not? But I'm a hardcore musical theater fan and to me, seeing a show is like eating a pizza: even when it's kind of bad, it's still really good. Unfortunately, the lack of a phenomenal cast -- and perhaps the lack of an intermission -- in this three-hour replica of the show that redefined musical theater made me wish I could be at home with a pepperoni pie by my side.What made the Broadway show such a success (it's currently the second-longest-running show in Broadway history, just behind ""Cats,"" which opened several years earlier) was its enormity: falling chandeliers, a boat on a misty lake, several hundred candles. But what's grandiose on a stage is just ho-hum on the screen -- especially if it's been done before. The show that ruled the world does not translate well into film, which is perhaps the fault of it being a ""rock opera."" A few jarring lines in the beginning, followed by endless singing would be tolerable, though -- if the actors could sing. Emmy Rossum, though a wonderful actress and easy on the eyes, isn't quite believable as an opera virtuoso -- until you hear the breathy warbling of Gerard Butler as the Phantom, her mentor. At best, his voice is a cross between Michael Crawford on a bad day and Antonio Bandares on an even worse day. At worst -- well, it can't get much worse than that, now, can it.Soon after singing a few bars, it becomes quite evident why he thinks she's a star -- he's tone deaf. To her credit, though, it's not all her fault: Rossum has undertaken the daunting task of filling the shoes of Sarah Brightman, perhaps the most famous Christine Daae of them all, and there's just no comparison. The highlight of the movie is Patrick Wilson as Raoul, perhaps the only one in the lot who has the voice to fit the role. Minnie Driver as Carlotta also invokes a few smiles and has the best singing voice of all -- and she's not even singing (the woman can sing, but isn't classically trained. Bravo to her for knowing her limits.) I've read that Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted to make this movie since the stage version came out. The reason he didn't was so people paying big bucks at the theater wouldn't get upset when people are getting to see the same thing cheaper. And therein the problem lies: Rather than make the movie different enough so people could see both, he just waited 16 years, perhaps hoping people have forgotten. Way to go, Webber. I'll concede that for nostalgia's sake, seeing the movie is fun (more than half the audience was crooning along, perhaps even singing the harmony -- think sing-a-long ""Sound of Music,"" but dreary). But unlike the recent film version of ""Chicago,"" and even ""Evita"" from a few years ago, ""Phantom"" fails to provide what the audience is looking and waiting for: something new. If you've seen the stage production, I suggest you don't bother seeing the movie -- the inadequate talent and dearth of creativity will make you wish you had instead used your money to buy a pizza.",The Phantom of the Opera
1381,Jjpslp1122,Incredible!,10,25 December 2004,"Being familiar with the original play, I walked in skeptical that it could possibly live up to the theatrical version. But I walked out wanting to walk right back in. I loved it sooo much! From the opening scene in black and white, to the 1870 color fade it, this was the most incredible film I've ever seen. This means a lot coming from me, as I consider myself quite the movie connoisseur. Each of the performances given was spectacular, and left me breathless. The screen ""Christine"" was perfect for the role, both innocent and strong. ""The Phantom"" was captivating, and every second on the screen, like Christine, I was unable to take my eyes off him.I would recommend this movie to any musical lover, especially anyone who has seen the theater version of this play. If you think it won't live up to the theater experience, don't worry...it will. You'll walk away like I did...wanting to go back for more. I'm certain I'll see this movie again in the theater, and as soon as the stores open tomorrow, I'm going out and buying the soundtrack. A line from the movie truly sums up the way I feel, ""The Phantom of the Opera is there, inside my mind.""",The Phantom of the Opera
1382,brendan-sheppard,Wow! What a Film!,10,26 December 2004,"This wonderfully directed film has to become part of true cinema history. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, what a performance, what a movie and the fact that it draws from elements of the sequel phantom of Manhattan has to be admired. The direction is extremely well polished the performances of all the cast superb, i cannot think of a bad word to say, so for me it was the highlight of 2004. The story was not only true to the west end stage play, but actually improved upon it. It seemed that a lot of effort went in to carefully restructure the plot from the stage play for example the chandelier which crashes down upon the audience in the stage play is at the climax to the first act, but here it is the catalyst for the ultimate destruction of the opera house at the end of the film, some of the lyrics were carefully changed as well but this only en-chances the movie. It's eerie black and white feel at the beginning helps give the creepy mysterious edge and of course a lot of questions being asked about how Christine died are carefully tied up in the sequel mentioned earlier - i loved it so much that I'm off to see it again, there was not a dry eye in the house first time!excellent! 10/10",The Phantom of the Opera
1383,picklegreenbird,A Triumph!,9,26 December 2004,"Absolute eye candy all the way around! Sets, cast, costumes all superb. A unique adaption of the stage production contains enough variation to engage a viewer who has seen/heard the original version trillions of times...I especially loved Gerard Butler's Phantom (I have to say, even better than Michael Crawford!). I actually preferred this more emotional, less articulated vocal--it brought a lot more empathy and humanity to the character. Emmy Rossum was also truly delightful. I am always pleased to see Miranda Richardson, though her character and the added plot summary turned out to be my one disappointment (a little too summarily ""neat and tidy""). A little Minnie Driver goes a long way for me, but Carlotta had some amusing moments. Saw it yesterday, and want to go back today just to see the Point Of No Return again...Yum!

1384,dusty1959,disappointed,5,26 December 2004,"I have to say I was disappointed in the movie Phantom. Most of it was excellent. The scenery was incredible. The actress who played Christine was perfect and the actor who played Raoul was handsome and had a great voice. The music moves my soul, it has since I first heard it but I was sad to see an angry Phantom who produced no pity for him from me. He sang angrily and not at all like it seemed to me an anguished and tormented Phantom would be. Sorry, Andrew. You should have gotten Michael Crawford. He was the only one to really be the phantom in this movie. Without spoiling the movie for anyone else, there was another element I thought unnecessary. I waited a long time for this movie and I was bitterly disappointed by it. I hope this meets your criteria.",The Phantom of the Opera
1385,jenny_sl_,"Why, oh why?",2,26 December 2004,"This movie is, because of the operas' superfluous content, and for that matter, pretty much every scenes' superfluous content, what I would like to call fuzzy.I would like to have it remade. I would like remade so that the essential and the genius parts fit in to three hours of passion and good opera, instead of bad, boring opera without meaning. For example, a scene at a graveyard, which is absolutely stunning when written by Gaston Leroux, perfect for a Grand opera, is made into a boring, slow, and long-winded opera.I guess what I really miss in this movie would be a bite. It's a story of such potential. But, by missing the chance to show us how the Phantom manipulates the whole opera by his genius ""magic"", the chance of showing us how he whispers in ears, though he is nowhere to be seen, the creators have ruined it. And even more important; they miss the chance to show us how the Phantom manipulates Christine, and how vicomte the Chagny and Christines passion for each other is threatened by her passion for music. There is no chemistry between any of the people in this film, because we never get to see how this chemistry develop.I regret the day that this grand story was spoiled.",The Phantom of the Opera

1387,dancermep14,"Not bad, but could have been better",7,26 December 2004,"I have seen the stage production about 15 times, and that is what I compare the movie to. My biggest complaint is with the Phantom. His range was not the same as in the original, so ""music of the night"" had to be taken down a key or two to compensate. Even then, I felt that he had to strain a little to get to some of the higher notes. His accent came through a lot and I found it distracting. He also had a very harsh sounding voice. This was fine for some of the songs, but I don't think it was good for parts like right after ""all I ask of you"" when he is supposed to be very saddened by listening to Christine and Raoul sing a love song to one another. I don't think he had enough contrast between the voice of anger and sadness. Also (this is not his fault) I thought that his face was not horrific enough. I figured with a huge movie production they would do great things to make him look hideous, but the stage production had a much more graphic make-up job.The costumes in ""Masquerade"" were rather a disappointment compared to the stage costumes, including Phantom's. I miss the color and creativeness in them. There were parts I though unnecessary such as people mooning others and the graveyard scene with the sword fight. It added nothing to the plot. Christine had a lot of skin showing during the gondola ride that I am sure was added for the sex appeal that it seems all movies must have nowadays.The special effects were wonderful with the restoration of the opera house. I greatly enjoyed watching that. Christine had a beautiful voice, as did Raoul. Overall, most things were kept the same as the play. I just don't see why a lot of little things were changed though. I do not feel that the alterations added to the movie. The biggest change I would wish to see would be a different actor in the role for Phantom. He is the main character and must be able to give a performance of a lifetime to get the part. I know there are people who can give better performances because I have seen then live on stage. But even with these flaws, the movie was still enjoyable enough for me to see it a second time and is definitely worth seeing especially if you are a Phantom fan.",The Phantom of the Opera

Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable but, although the performances were excellent and the scenery and costumes were wonderful, the music was dreadful (every song seemed the same except for ""masquerade"") the writing managed to excise almost every element of suspense from the original screen play of 1943, the pace of the ""action"" (if it can be called that) was excruciatingly slow burdened as it was by the music. The best parts were the black & white ""flash-forwards"" which were about the only attempts to make sense of what, in any other film, would be called ""the plot"". I certainly hope the stage version was better or I will have to consign the aforementioned acquaintance to my ""idiots"" list.

I have seen Phantom 3 times on stage and this movie is over the top!! I think part of the reason I liked it better was because it tells you more of the story behind the Phantom himself. It shows how he was abused.....the words in the movie were also clearer than in the stage show. I would definitely see this again and again...and connot wait until it comes out on DVD!!

The chemistry between Christine and the Phantom and Christine and Raoul was great. The songs still brought out a lot of feelings. They sent shivers through me and brought tears to my eyes. Maybe the movie stayed true to the stage version because Andrew Lloyd Webber was involved in it. It is nice to see the consistency through it.

The only negative comment I have is that the music was so loud during certain parts of the movie that it was actually painful. I had to cover my ears during the very best parts of the film and was paying attention to the pain in my ears rather than what was happening on the screen. The camera loves the face of Emmy Rossum. It glides over the curves of her face like a lover, and through the lens you actually feel as if you are seeing her through the eyes of the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is truly breathtakingly beautiful.

To have brought this wonderful stage play to the screen in such glorious detail takes a professional filmmaker of the highest calibre. Schumacher is that man. The entire cast is outstanding, the photography is a feast for the eyes and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music remains mesmerizing, all brought to the screen under the sure hand of Joel Schumacher, who should receive an Oscar nomination as Best Director.

1396,arb006,"Phantom - 1, Les Miz - 0",10,27 December 2004,"Preface - I am not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, although I do appreciate some of his work. I have seen both Phantom and Les Miz on stage several times, and consider the stage version of Phantom to be unworthy of the popular status it has attained, while Les Miz is grossly under-appreciated.That being said, the recent film versions of each of these is exactly opposite: Les Miz the Movie, while an entertaining piece unto itself, is a pale imitation of the stage experience; while the movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's the Phantom of the Opera is a magnificent, moving and enveloping work that lures you from your theater seat into the fantasy that the filmmakers have masterfully created. The film medium allows editing to present the story in a clear and relevant manner that is impossible on the stage, cutting out theatrical filler and leaving only story elements. The restrained use of parallel time lines helps to heighten interest, and serves to develop characters as the stage cannot. Film also allows for the best best performances of an appealing cast to be assembled into a mosaic of nearly-overwhelming perfection - this is one of the best-cast movies I have ever seen. Though all of the cast provided outstanding performances, Emmy Rossum (Christine Daae) is, well, beyond my ability to describe. Her singing is flawless, effortless and appealing. Her acting is invisible, she is Christine Daae. Her appearance is human yet ethereal, romantic but not syrupy, appealing but not erotic, beautiful but not unrealistically perfect.The movie does what the stage musical can never do, and does it to perfection.

The big screen actors and actresses were attractive, entertaining and thrilling. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is not only attractive, but believable. The movie helps instill pity in the viewer by delving a little deeper in his past. Emmy Rossum, as Christine, is simply amazing. Not only is she beautiful and mesmerizing, but incredibly talented. The screen version has only one or two small perks not possible on stage and sticks close to the original plot. Would definitely rate this one a ten.

My husband also had a ""Highlights"" CD, so we were meant to be together; Read and reread Susan Kay's excellent novel ""Phantom"" that offered fascinating depth and richness to all of Leroux's characters and those from the stage musical; Bided my time throughout many news bits stating that ""Phantom"" was going to be offered as a movie via Lloyd Webber's people and sat through both the Terry Polo miniseries (kind of good) and the Jill Schoelen (semi-horrible) movie (both from the eighties); Just saw the 2004 film today and was transported back to girly giddiness all over again. It was so wonderful, that I got all crinkly up my spine; Rossum as Christine was superb, Butler as the Phantom was heartrending; Driver as Carlotta was hysterical and Wilson as Raoul was a yummy visual and vocal treat. The film had all the mystery and loveliness of the stage play with richer characterizations and, what I missed from the cheap seats at the theatre, all of the wonderful facial expressions to accompany each musical number.

The scenes and the singing are great! (We went directly to the store and bought the CD after the movie.) The passion and the music draw you in. You need to experience it in the theater. There was an ovation after the movie was over, something you don't see anymore. It was good to have lesser known actors in the movie so people would not be fixed on the performers themselves and could concentrate on all that is happening. Their outstanding voices and acting make the missing Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford go away very quickly.

Then it occurred to me that the weighting curve just throws out the 1's and the 10's then averages the rest. This ""weighting"" clearly hurts the score for a movie like this that has such a huge preponderance of folks who LOVED it and gave it a 10. With the 1's and the 10's in the scoring the actual rating is 9.2 - instead of 7.1. this doesn't seem to be a very fair rating system.Anyway. I have seen Phantom eight times on stage in 5 locations throughout the world and this film presentation beat them all.

I went to see the movie with moderate expectation and came away with great enjoyment. The cast is excellent and the magnificent scenes got my attention right away. There is no over-acting, which is common when there are superstars in a movie. To be picky, I would probably make the ""phantom"" a little more scary.Comparing to the opera, the movie loses some, but gives a little more in other aspects, like those beautiful French buildings and structures. The music is familiar, which is good to some, and might not be so good to others. Some might feel too much of the same thing. Judging by the average age of the audience (40+) in the theater that day, that was not a problem. I was almost too young (40s). My 10-year old daughter was probably the youngest. I can see that this movie attracts an older crowd. Many went to see the movie because they remembered the story and the tune. It is a shame that some young people are not even aware of the movie.I would recommend parents and grandparents taking their grandchildren to see this movie. It is a great breakaway from today's many senseless movies. If you can spend money to watch ""The Fockers,"" you can spend money watching this great, wholesome movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1405,maltese12,masterpiece,10,28 December 2004,"Particularly for those who will never have the chance to see the Broadway show, this movie is a must see. The music alone is worth going for, maybe many times. The variations from the play are improvements. This is a tale of seduction, the almost irresistible appeal of 'the dark side'; evil, whatever, and I would also interpret it as the struggle between reality and fantasy (or the seduction of religion or other fanciful ideas). That so many commenters wonder why she 'chooses' (does she really-in her heart, or is she just pragmatic?) the Vicomte Raoul is indeed revealing. I think word of mouth will trump any negative critics' reviews. Let's not let high expectations interfere too often with good results.",The Phantom of the Opera
1406,horvatc,A Must See!!!!,10,28 December 2004,"Having never seen the stage production and not really knowing much of the story prior to seeing this film, I have to say that I loved this movie. I believe the casting for this film was brilliant - all the characters are beautifully portrayed. This story is timeless and anyone will be able to identify with the story on some level. I believe that this movie should win all the awards it is nominated for. I wanted to see the stage production and figured if I saw the movie it would curb that desire however that is not the case. Now that I have seen this movie, I want to see the stage production even more. If you see this movie, you will want to get the soundtrack - it is awesome as well.",The Phantom of the Opera

Emmy Rossum's Christine Daae sent chills up my spine, much like the stage version...amazing costumes and special effects, especially the chandelier and burning of the opera house. i wish everyone who has ever seen the stage version, even those who haven't, would see this amazing movie and make their own opinions, because you can't always trust one critics opinion of the film. Ebert and Roeper split, the new york post gave it one star, but you can always look to golden globe nominations...best motion picture(musical or comedy),best actress(musical or comedy), best original song(motion picture)... may not be very many, but the nominations are there!see for yourself...an excellent performance, an excellent adaptation.",The Phantom of the Opera

The Movie Production holds up to all tests - casting, musical and stage performances, film direction, and set designs. If your heart is moved by the music or the storyline, you will shed tears of joy at the results of this emotional extravaganza! The drama plays out across sets that will capture your eyes and create a believable backdrop for the wonderful acting, while the soaring sounds of the soundtrack will keep your heartstrings taut with anticipation of the next great climax. The action rolls onward and the acting will keep you on the edge of your seat. The costumes mimic stage productions of the musical - they're over the top for make-up, dress, and hair design, attributes that accent the history in stage performance.",The Phantom of the Opera

It was composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber who pay every custes of this film. The actors Emma Button was very good because she sing very good like the Sarah Brigtman as Barbara Streisand.

Not to say that it was better than the play... no, it wasn't.... But they did an awesome job imnsho (in my not so humble opinion).I saw the play 8x, and loved it every time. I would have loved to see Michael Crawford as Phantom in the movie but that is the only complaint I have.I am going to take my daughter to see it tomorrow. We got to see it in the dome!

1412,xxmufcake,Dazzling!,10,28 December 2004,"I was so impressed with this production of ""Phantom"". I was fortunate enough to take a trip to New York City a year or so ago, and even more fortunate to get tickets to see the Broadway production of the musical. When I left the Majestic theater that night, I thought for sure that what I had just seen was the epitome of all musicals. I was proved wrong.This movie was as good if not better in some ways than the live Broadway production. There are some things that you just cannot do on the stage. Being on a movie set allowed the producers/directors to do so much that they would not have been able to do otherwise, such as the fantastic special effects. I could find no flaw in the casting what-so-ever, especially with Ms. Rossum. The cast made it appear as if they were carrying on a normal conversation instead of singing high level opera, with sopranos belting it at over three octaves above ""middle c"".I especially loved the beginning part, at the auction, when Lot 666 (the chandelier) is revealed and rises up to the top of the Opera House, with gusts of wind blowing away the dust and cobwebs, adding a bit of Technicolor to the picture. Those are just things that you cannot do in a live performance. But as the movie ended at the site of Cristine Daae's grave and the screen slowly blacked out, nobody in the entire theater made a single sound. We all sat in stunned silence and soaked it all in.Thank you- Liz Miller",The Phantom of the Opera

I had to make three attempts to get into this movie because it was invariably packed. The third time, I made sure to show up an hour early. Gerard Butler is simply brilliant; his passion is palpable, his voice is beautiful, and his acting is Oscar worthy. It is only appropriate that Gerard should be the focus of the movie; he is, after all, playing the title character. His performance is absolutely hypnotic, and he lends the role a sensuality and mystique that transcend previous portrayals of ""the phantom."" Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson also give impeccable performances, and their angelic voices are a perfect complement for Gerard's haunting vocals. The entire cast, in fact, was inspired, as was the cinematography, costuming, direction, etc. Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece is brought to scintillating life, and the enthusiastic reception by my fellow theater-goers was the undeniable proof. In short, this is truly one of the very best films of the year.",The Phantom of the Opera
1414,pinkangel841,"Not too impressed. See the actual show, not the movie!",2,28 December 2004,"Okay. I saw this movie today with my two friends. We three have been basically obsessed with Phantom since we saw it when it came through Baltimore. 1. Don't get me wrong I thought the special effects were great. Gorgeous costumes, make-up, SET! (absolutely breathtaking) 2.The chorus/ minor characters were great!!! The lady who played Meg Giry looked as if she was about 18-20.. but she sang as if she was 10-12. Her mother was very good, however. 3. I was utterly and completely let down by the singers. The lady that played Christine had no power what-so-ever behind her upper register. The phantom.. he was SO HOT! but... he was no singing angel of music. And Raoul... he is handsome.. but not the best singer either. This is SUCH a Hollywood thing to do... to go ALL out on special effects.. and then let us down on the singers! I don't get why they have to do that. I no longer cared for these characters that I absolutely love!! The man that played the Phantom... he was nothing compared to Gary Mauer. Mauer was AMAZING! He had a power that just sucked you into his music, to make you feel as if he was singing only to you. The man in the movie could barely even muster up a vibrato! 4. The orchestra for this movie was very very strong. The music (minus singing) was beautiful. I find myself lost in its score many times when I listen to my Phantom cd. 5. Did Andrew Lloyd Webber have anything to say about who was picked for the leads? He must be pulling his hair out over these actors just massacring his music. I agree with those who say it was a bad choice to speak lines that are sung in the show. It seemed somewhat cheesy having Raoul and Christine saying lines that rhymed... But it is a good way to cover up not being able to sing it. It just drove me up a wall how poppish and unsupported the leads' singing was. 6. I did like, however, how they elaborated more on the characters. They did take the ending from the book. But the phantom disappears... he wouldn't have gone to leave the rose at her grave. I just.. was REALLY let down by this. I LOVE the show, but the movie was a dud.",The Phantom of the Opera

You will not regret seeing it and yes the phantom is very sensual, brooding, mysterious, sexual, masculine...where was i again oh is it getting hot in here???? Personally a job well done in the singing department even thought they are not vocalist.

They were just shocked.. they kept saying that they have never ever expected the movie to be this great. Please I insist that everybody must go and see this movie, this true art!

Ah if they could have only done this 20 years ago when Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman could still have done their respective parts! The male voices are not up to the music. Neither male leads are better than summer stock or dinner theater level. Gerard Butler butchered the ""Phantom"" and is too young to be thought of as a lifelong tutor for Rossum. Patrick Wilson looked as if he'd sat through every Ethan Hawke / Lucas Haas vehicle in order to form his characterization. Emmy Roussum playing Christine is wonderful and Minnie Driver as Carlotta is astonishing with her operatic talent (albeit caricature of such).The set design and decoration was breathtaking, tho some bordered on a Harlequin Romance cover (particularly the diva's dressing room!).Some of the ""holes"" in the stage play plot are filled in (background that helps one understand the story better).All in all, I'm not sorry to have gone, as a fan of the music.

I feel in love with the music and as soon as the Movie came out I was there last night. I held my breath more than one time listening to the music in surround sound and it gave me goosebumps more than one time and made me realize what an amazing production the movie was. I feel in love with the Phantom even though he is the one your supposed to hate. I loved the Cristine character, she has an amazing presence and a magical voice. I am more than likely going to see this movie again while still in the theaters and will be one of the very first to own the DVD when it comes on sale.I can only imagine that the Real Phantom on Stage was Electric, Magical and Breathtaking, but the Movie is just as Magical, Enchanting and a Rush to all the senses.",The Phantom of the Opera

It is in many ways even better than the play. Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Weber have truly made an incredible film! It is a rich production. The cast is great!

I have not yet seen the stage performance of Phantom yet but now i plan to. It was incredible whether you are in to musicals or musical theater or not. I recommend ANYONE and EVERYONE to go and see the talent that pours out of the screen. Emmy Rossum is AMAZING and to think she is ONLY 18. The other actors as well are astounding. I am not a HUGE fan of musicals in general but certain ones hold a lot for me and this is certainly one of them now. I left the theater only being able to say one thing: WOW!!!! I hope others will come out with the same reaction. The actors singing and acting talent was outstanding.

The only thing that I noticed was that you could tell they weren't singing. Just lip syncing to their voices, but that wasn't a problem because thats typical for a movie musical. The music alone gave me shivers. I suggest to see it in the movies and don't wait to rent it. You'll be missing a great experience....

It is hard to fathom (pun intended) the negativism by some but there seems to be agendas at work. Ah, the Batman franchise! It died two-thirds through the first movie. Get over it! Same old campy music as the stage play? The stage play is timeless, is still enjoyed by millions and has made ALW very wealthy. Some lip-syncing issues? Close your eyes and enjoy the music! Other deriding comments (too many candles) are laughable and approach silliness. Don't let these keep you from enjoying this movie.The opening is dramatic and the intensity remains throughout with splashes of comical moments. The stage settings and costumes were great and the casting of relatively newcomers was welcomed. ALW intent was to bring the popular stage musical to the big screen and this has been accomplished.

1425,Peliza,Phantom of the Opera through the eyes of a stage show devotee,9,29 December 2004,"I have seen Phantom of the Opera on stage several times and I have just about memorized every word of the soundtrack with the original cast. Needless to say I was very wary and critical of seeing the movie especially after I saw snippets on The View and HBO on the movie. My first impression of the previews is that Gerard Butler's singing stinks! I am such a huge fan of Michael Crawford, no one I have seen have come close.After I saw the film, I have to say that I was rendered speechless. I am quite impressed by Gerard Butler's performance (as in acting, not singing). His portrayal of the Phantom made me feel how Michael Crawford's singing does. It worked! Emmy Rossum is sensational! She rivals Sarah Brightman with her range and tender delivery of the songs which many stage Christines have difficulty to emulate.Patrick Wilson is effective as Raoul but I didn't quite feel the chemistry between him and Emmy Rossum worked as well as it did with her scenes with the Phantom.This is the best part....the singing is NOT distracting. As a fan of musicals, it cracks me up when they just start singing in the middle of a conversation but you don't notice it in this movie musical. It does not detract or take away from the story.Changes in the storyline were hardly noticeable to anyone but the big Phantom Phans (such as myself).Warning: If you see it, the songs and scenes will likely stay in your memory for days, maybe even weeks, on end but it's well worth seeing again!",The Phantom of the Opera

I went with my family over the vacation, and boy, they loved it as much as I did. I never went to many Broadway shows, but because of this movie, I feel really excited to go see more shows on that most famous street. It makes anyone feel like they are actually at the Broadway show. Some parts were a little ""off"", but otherwise it was a good movie. I enjoyed the singing by the main actors, such as The Phantom and Christine. There wasn't any part of the movie where it got boring. I think the movement between the stage and the acting was pretty well coordinated. Everyone should see this movie. Some day, I hope to meet Emmy Rossum.",The Phantom of the Opera

The previews showed some of the least exquisite parts so if you were even remotely intrigued by the previews you should get down to the theater now! I was very impressed that the whole cast sang their own roles and none of the music was dubbed over by some singer who was not in the movie. Every actor and actress greatly deserved the role they were cast and much attention to detail was very noticeable.

But poor old Joel can't take all the blame. Unlike his Batman 'movie,' where the ship went down with the captain, the cast proceeded to turn the canons inward on their own hull during this romp. Unlike in ""Phonebooth,"" where the extreme talent of the cast significantly overshadowed the misguided director, the self-perpetuating circle of ineptitude had nowhere to go but down. The performances were not the worst I've heard, except for Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, but they were not exceptional by any means. Perhaps the fact that the prerecorded vocals were not always lined up properly with the visual negatively skewed any semblance of a decent moment that may have slipped through the director's grasp.

The main theme (the overture) was astounding and made me hold my breath every time i heard it. In places i nearly cried, in places i laughed- mainly at Carlotta. i also thought that Jennifer Ellison made a good film debut!

The 1919 scenes done in early film style was genius. Then changing to color for the 1870's material brought us to where we needed to be.Now I know other readers will get bent out of shape over an old topic. But Gerard, who acted very well giving the Phantom the multi-dimensions he needed, has trouble carrying a tune in a bucket. For crying out loud it's a musical.

I have been doing musical theater since I was 5 years old and I am very critical of these movie musicals that Hollywood continues to attempt to make. I didn't like Chicago too much.. and the idea of Rent going to the big screen scares me..However, I found Phantom of the Opera to be nothing less than breath-taking. I believe the visuals and the way it was filmed were really effective in making me feel I was watching the stage production itself.I thought that the three mains did very well. Emmy had quite some standards to hold up to playing Christine. And considering there's only one Sarah Brightman, I'd say she did pretty darn good. She was good at pulling off the innocent, confused, 16 year old (which is how the part is supposed to be played). Raoul was well sung I think and since there isn't much you can do with that role other than be in love Christine, I'd say his acting wasn't bad either. Now, to my favorite character, the Phantom. I found Gerard's portrayal to be incredible. I totally loved him. His acting and passion when he sang made me melt in my seat and his singing, while not the best portrayal I've heard of the role, was absolutely compensated for. Much like Rossum, he had quite some standards to live up to, so I say, well sung Gerard, you gorgeous phantom you :).Yea, so, that's my opinion, from someone who knows their musical theater. Overall, I'd give it a 9, but I'm gonna rate it as 10 because I love the show and so its overall rating gets a good boost. Its worth the 9.50 at the theater. Go see it!",The Phantom of the Opera

It is one of my favorite Broadway shows and I was not sure a movie director could do it justice. However, the movie was everything I could have hoped for and more! Emmy Rossum's 'Christine' was PERFECT and while Gerard Butler has a very different voice than the original, Michael Crawford, his gritty baritone brought a new element to the character, making him seem less like the ""Angel of Music"" and more like a Phantom. I was delightfully surprised by Patrick Wilson's portrayal of Raoul, who knew he had such a beautiful voice! I had never really cared for that that character before this wonderful movie.

The acting was brilliant, the singing slightly off in a few scenes but all in all pretty great. The only thing I had issues with was the delay of dropping the chandelier. Butler was amazing as the phantom, his portrayal was perfect. Rossum was a very believable angel and Driver soared as the Diva. I noted changes made to the songs and lyrics but they were not enough to change the film. I do believe this movie is one of the best. I cried, i laughed i felt for the characters as i did in the play. After seeing it I yearned to listen to my Phantom CD's.

Disappointed does not begin to describe my feelings. The voices of the stars were undistinguished and the dubbing was horrible, the lip sync obviously off in many areas. The whole picture was too dark, lacking the use of light to enhance the story, as it was used in the stage production. The show-stopping number ""Music of the Night"" was painful to anyone who has seen the Canadian production and heard the remarkable Colm Wilkinson perform his magic.

The music is haunting and the sets lush and sumptuous.Comparisons with Michael Crawford are not necessary-rising Scottish star Butler brings a new rawness and edge to the Phantom as he desperately tries to woo Christine with his music.Emmy Rossum's wide-eyed naivety does grate a bit as the film goes on but she has a beautiful voice and good chemistry with her two would-be suitors. Patrick Wilson as Raoul plays the epitome of the romantic hero, but it is Butler who really shines in a role which will hopefully give him more recognition as a serious actor.Although some die-hard Phantom fans are not too keen on the movie, I would certainly recommend its viewing as it stands alone as a captivating and mesmerising film.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was also shocked to learn that Emmy Rossum is only 18 and has a voice like that. Her performance was so incredible that I had to go out immediately and buy the newer soundtrack...when I already have the first one from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway version.

A whole campaign was launched to prevent the film from being made. Luckily that campaign failed, because Schumacher (who, in my opinion, is a very average director) and Andrew Lloyd Webber made one Hell of a film.Christine Daaé has been getting singing lessons from a mysterious teacher, the Phantom, who she's never seen in person. When La Carlotta, the diva of the Opera Populaire, quits because of all the 'accidents' happening in opera, Christine gets her chance to perform and is soon to become the new diva. Her childhood sweetheart Raoul, the Victome de Chagny and patron of the Opera Populaire, recognizes her and falls in love with her all over again. Raoul wasn't in The Phantom's plans, so he decides to reveal himself to her. Now Christine has to choose; her teacher who has given her everything or the man she hasn't stopped loving since childhood.The Phantom is wonderfully portrayed by Gerard Butler, who has never sung in his entire life. In just a few months he learned to sing and I even prefer his voice over the more classical opera voices Phantoms had on stage. He growls and hisses, while he enchants his prey, making her see things the way he wants her to see them. The Phantom in this movie is much more 'human' than in the play. In the play you keep wondering if it is a man or a ghost, in this movie it's obvious he's a man. A man with an obsession, which will soon take unhealthy proportions. Just an example: during the cemetery scene, The Phantom in the play shoots fireballs at Raoul, in the movie, he is has a sword fight with him. Now many people are complaining that it takes a lot of magic away from the Phantom-character, and to some level I agree. But while shooting fireballs on stage may look really awesome, in the movie it would be nothing more than just another special effect. I personally think Lloyd Webber made an excellent choice by having the Phantom more realistic and less magical. Emmy Rossum, who was only turning 17 during the shoot, has an incredible voice. She has been singing as a chorus girl in over 20 operas, alongside Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo, just to name two. The rest of the cast also triumph in their rolls. Cirian Hines and Simon Callow are perfectly casted as the two new managers and give the movie, together with Minnie Driver as La Carlotta, its humor. The costumes, lighting and use of color are also fantastic.Give this movie a try. I'll know for sure that the songs will stay in your head for days and you'll come back for more. Now and then a movie pops up that will influence your life, the way you feel when you go to work and doing your daily things. Well, the Music of the Night has me for about ten months now. And it will only be getting worse when I go to London this fall to see the stage play. Yes, I love this movie. If you can look past the small technical errors and minor plot holes (damn you, Schumacher), you will find the ultimate Gothic romance.",The Phantom of the Opera
1438,041227,Phantastic,10,2 February 2005,"I started replacing Fs with PHs after seeing this... This is the best movie I've seen so far this year (2004-2005). I love the voices of Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson. Just don't compare it with the stage production and you will love it! This is absolutely great you must go and see it and your mind will be filled with the music in the film. Some of you know have seen the stage production thinks that Gerard's singing is not good enough. But then, you should really notice his wonderful acting and emotions (and do remember to bring your tissue paper). The musical score is amazing, of course. I'm not a big phan of Minnie Driver but I think her Carlotta is impressive in the movie. In one word, this movie is Phabulous!",The Phantom of the Opera
1439,beauspa,Perfection,10,31 December 2004,"Having listened to the original cast album with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman countless times, having seen the musical staged in London and New York, I was both excited and a bit wary about seeing the movie version of this musical. It had me hooked from the very beginning. The cast, the orchestration, the costumes, the entire production is beautiful and faithful to the original. Emmy Rossum is incredible - beautiful looks, beautiful voice, and a very good actress. I saw a performance of the stage musical in New York just this past Sunday and was disappointed in how the Christine and Raoul in that performance rushed through All I ask of you. Rossum and Patrick Wilson certainly did not disappoint in the movie - their duet was absolute perfection. Wilson is wonderful as Raoul. Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson and the two new opera house managers are also very good. My one moment of hesitation while viewing this film was Gerard Butler's first singing moments as the Phantom. My initial reaction was that they had made a huge mistake in casting, especially after just hearing the Phantom sung on stage by an actor with operatic training. This misgiving was quickly overcome, however, as Butler quickly made the role his own and gave a very compelling and sympathetic portrayal of a character who has some pretty serious flaws. I can't wait to see this movie again and there aren't many I can say that about.",The Phantom of the Opera
1440,windowarchitect,I Take My Comment Back,10,29 January 2005,"After seeing the movies for a second time, I must reverse myself on my bad review of Gerard Butler. He was very effective in the roll and his singing was quite good. I have seen the musical on Broadway eight times and have listened to the music so many times that I failed to realize that in a movie, voices take on a different quality. His acting was compelling. I never thought they could take something as wonderful as the stage production and make such a wonderful film from it. The sets were beautiful and the cinematography was superb from the opening scene to the final frame. The audience in the theater was quiet and focused with many remaining to watch the credits and listen to Andrew Lloyd Weber's masterpiece. If you've seen the stage musical, do not make the mistake I made the first time I saw it. Don't compare.",The Phantom of the Opera
1441,fat_fluffy_bunnies,One of the best films of all time!,10,31 December 2004,"The Phantom of the opera is a spectacular film! The setting's are fabulous and beautifully designed,the costumes are amazing.The opening of the overture was breath taking, i felt like getting up and singing! Emmy Rossum plays an excellent Christine, her voice is superb and suits the part very well but i think Gerard Butler does it for me,he looks very fit and hansom,they should of had him playing Raoul he put so much emotion and thought into the character,he really played the part well .His singing and looks sent a shiver down my spine,when he does that mysterious look through his mask makes me want to grab him!Espeacially when he sings'pass the point of no return' i wish it was me he was singing to! He got right into the roll of the phantom and made a magnificent performance and deserves an award for it! Before i watched the film i haven't seen any phantom of the opera performances so this was my first time seeing the production and boy! i was impressed i can see why its so popular. Its a great idea to have it on the big screen for people who cant afford to go to the theatre, I've seen the film three times now and I'm still not bored by it, i have also brought the soundtrack which is great to unwind to. I recommend this film to anyone who loves romance and musicals.",The Phantom of the Opera
1442,MOB5,the best,10,31 December 2004,"I loved this play and the way it was adapted to the screen. It was played out without extra embellishmentusually thrown in when changing a stage play to the screen. It was more like a play than a movie. The music was perfection. Someone made the comment it should have been updated but to those of us, due to where we live rarely get to see a great play its wonderful to see a classic shown as it should b shown. I took my 16 year old granddaughter with me and she was in awe she had new sen anything like it, we live more than an hours drive from the theater and see talked about it all the way home. Way to go Joel. Thanks for not making a modern version. I was surprised to see the theater full.

1443,shhhhhhmoo,What I thought,10,31 December 2004,"The Phantom Of The Opera was an extremely good movie. I saw the play 6 years ago but i have liked it ever since. My friends call me the toughest critic and i have to say that Butler did a very good job for his first musical and for having about 2 lessons. Emmy did great too. What i din't like was dancing in the masquerade was a bit too.. blah. It didn't look like a ball. They were standing on the stairs waving their fans around. That's about it.Some people are so weird though. Just because the word opera is in the title of the movie, the automatically think that it's a dumb movie. it makes me so mad! they are missing out on a great movie. If you have to, persuade your girl-friends to go because the Phantom and Raoul are hot and your guy-friends by saying there is some killing in it. I give this movie a 5/5.""There is a fine line between genius and madness.""",The Phantom of the Opera

The movie moved slowly. By the time Christine reached the graveyard, I was counting the amount of songs left.Plus the fact that the chandelier didn't fall at the right time!All in all it was a weak movie and very long.

It is perfect, to me. a movie to go on the world's all time greatest movies list. It is a shame that some people will not go to see this movie because they don't appreciate this type of art. Those people have no clue as to what they are missing out on! For those who saw it live in a theater and think that there is now way it could be any better, it can. the movie shows the detail that could not be portrayed live, like the rose for example, and in the cemetery,wow.

1447,Mohat,See the movie more than once...it's worth it.,8,18 January 2005,"I've read all the ""reviews"" by the various media folks and didn't care too much for them. I've seen the movie several times now, looking at different things each time. I think it's well done for the length. The sets are wonderful, from the Opera House to the Phantom's lair, (with those ""Atlas"" figures holding up the foundation and the candles everywhere). The characters, as much as possible in the time given, fill in some of the details about the story/characters, sometimes with a bit a swash buckle...but that's okay. Mr. Butler's version of the Phantom is rather refreshing, he's less the evil, bloated monster of some of the other movie versions, and more like a real man. OK, so he doesn't hit all the notes right on the dot, but there is a nice richness to his voice that gets it right in the crucial spots. Minnie Driver...what a delight. She provided a comic relief that made her scenes great to see. Mr. Wilson's performance added some depth to his character that even some of the stage productions don't exploit to the full. And the music as a whole...always lovely. Alas, not enough time to comment on everything. My recommendation: if you didn't like it the first time...go see it again. You just might be won over.",The Phantom of the Opera
1448,kreag,wicked flick!,10,1 January 2005,"The sets are beautiful and the costumes are amazing!!! I loved Gerard Butler, he's super hot as Phantom! The singing can get a bit old but all in all it's a great flick if you're a musical and eye candy fan. I think that updating the script and switching it up helped make the experience better if you're seen the stage version. I did wish there was a bit more of a creep factor with the Phantom. He is a dark creature and that could have been explored on a deeper level. Minnie Driver is wicked funny as the Diva and should get awards attention for the role I think. I look forward to purchasing this one on DVD! The soundtrack is fun if you enjoy listening to musical's on disc.",The Phantom of the Opera
1449,danfowler0731,Better than expected...,8,29 January 2005,"Wow. The movie was much better than I expected, and I expected a good movie to begin with. Having read all the critics who said ""Don't bother"" and all the moviegoers who said ""See it,"" I frankly expected a movie that would rank about 5 on a scale of 10. This is one case where I'm very happy to be wrong.There were some jarring moments for purists. The back story of the Phantom was one of those. A Phantom who looked not 5 years older than Christine was another. (Ok, he was her Angel of Music when she was a mere child. She's now grown. Shouldn't he be a *good* bit older?) With the mask, the Phantom was more handsome than Christine's other love interest. Without it, one wonders why he didn't come clean with Christine years ago. He was certainly not the hideous creature that we might expect from the original story or earlier movie adaptations.All that out of the way, the score was amazing. No more synthesizer! The singing was well-done and carried the story forward. The casting was adequate and I thought Butler actually acquitted himself well, given the reservations listed above. Costumes? Set? Simply amazing.""Phantom"" was always an *event* and I worried that the movie would somehow lose that feel. It didn't. It carries the moviegoer through the range of emotions almost as well as the theater experience.In short? Ignore the critics. Decide for yourself.

1450,tshortster99,Shallow and Poisoning to the Ears,3,19 August 2013,"If you've ever seen the play and plan to watch it in hopes that it will be just as good, then save your time and money. The movie took a story with depth and meaning and turned it into a shallow story that simply pleased the eye, but lacked any real depth.To begin with, the singing was absolutely awful! They only picked the actors/actresses because they looked the parts (with the exception of Gerard Butler of course, who could not look or sing the part), but it would have worked just as well with any of the Broadway actors/actresses. The Phantom is supposed to have a voice like an angel, but then can just as easily have an evil and fear-inciting voice. Gerard Butler, however, could only ever sound evil and even then his raspy voice didn't quite do it the way Michael Crawford's did. And then there's Christine: Emily Rossum would've had a good voice for Christine, but she rarely put any emotion into her singing. There were some times where she put beautiful emotion into her voice, and I could feel her fear, her joy, or her confusion, but those times were few and far between. The only main characters' voices I think suited were Carlotta's, Monsieur Firmin's, and Monsieur Andre's. Next, the way the plot was carried out was uninspiring. The Phantom of the Opera is a man whose face is distorted to the point that he was exiled from people's sight. A young girl named Christine Daae is found and tutored by the Phantom but she never has any loving feelings for him beyond that of maybe a dear friend. When the Phantom chases away the opera house's soprano, Christine is given her role in the next opera. She then receives nearly instant fame and is recognized by her childhood sweetheart, Raoul, who is now serving as the opera house's patron. Their love rises again when they meet, and the Phantom fears that their love may chase Christine away from him. He then works to bring Christine closer to him and Raoul farther away, but in the process, they become closer than ever. In the end, the Phantom proclaims his love to Christine, but then lets her go. At least that's how the play was. The movie, however, carried it out slightly differently. The first time Christine goes with the Phantom, they have very passionate encounters during the Music of the Night, and then the next day. It then creates a love triangle between Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom. Christine wasn't even supposed to be sexually attracted to the Phantom, but they made the Phantom such a pretty boy in this one, that now she is. So basically you get the main picture, they turned a deep meaningful play into a shallow and sexy movie.They tried to fit the songs from the play into the movie at weird intervals, and they just turned out to be slipped in at awkward times making scenes with a lot of promise into cheesy replays of High School Musical. During the scenes of the play, the main characters were supposed to be moving around and showing lots of emotion. Instead, they stood there looking a little confused and never walked around or even so much as turned their heads.The only good parts in the movie were when they stopped trying to be exactly like the play and added scenes without the singing. It was in those scenes where the actors stepped back into their comfort zone and really came alive.All-in-all, however, I spent most of the movie on my iPod, because I couldn't bear to watch it. If you watched the movie because you couldn't afford to see a live showing, you can watch the 25th anniversary showing on Netflix, and I absolutely love it. I hope reading this will save you the horror of watching this film.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was a little worried because he has such a thick Scottish accent and i wasn't sure how he was going to hide it, but he did very well. I loved this film and plan on seeing it many more times. I waited for this film to come out for over a year and am very happy to see that i was not disappointed! you can't help but love it! Andrew Lloyd Webber is a fantastic man with a wonderful talent.

1452,theblondeone07,Amazing movie!!!!!!,10,1 January 2005,"I was already a huge fan of the actual play that I wasn't sure if this movie could live up to the play. As soon as it started though I knew for a fact that it would be able to do just that. Now don't ask me which one I like best because there are certain things about each one that I like better then the other. The thing I like about the play is that it is live so it makes you seem like you are involved in the whole story but in the movie the great thing is that with film you are so much more able to see and tell the emotions of the actors better. Joel Schumacher did a fantastic job with this!! I have actually gone to see it 3 times over only about 1 week. That is how much I enjoyed it. Emmy Rossum does an amazing job as Christine! Her voice is just perfect. Patrick Wilson also made Raoul seem much less sissy in this movie then in the play. I also think that he was quite handsome as Raoul. Gerard Butler playing the phantom was so magical and amazing!! I have read many things about people saying that he can't sing but I think that he did an amazing job and that his voice was perfect for the part!! All I got to say is that even if you have never seen the play before go see this movie! It is well worth the time and money!! Also once you see it or even before, go out and buy the soundtrack because the music in the movie is so beautiful that you will want to listen to it all the time!! Trust me I know.

The music, acting, and effects were beyond belief! Sure there were added scenes that were not exhibited on stage but who cares?! I am not familiar with the novel upon which the story is based but be assured I shall remedy that at the earliest opportunity as I suspect that additional material in the movie came directly from the book. I especially liked the way Carlotta was portrayed - from the stage production, you get the idea that she has defined the word ""diva"" and this is reinforced in the movie. Minnie Driver did a fantastic job in a role that is engineered to incite insult from the audience but she did so in a way that still managed to endear me to her. This movie was probably a large risk for the studio as studios simply do not make movies like this anymore. When the movie hits full release on January 21, I believe we will see a great deal more turnout for it and I'm likely to see it again then as well! This is a must see for anyone who loves the Phantom!",The Phantom of the Opera

They made it look as if they were in love.Patrick Wilson was very charming and he has a wonderful voice but when it comes to how cute he was he is nothing compared to Gerard! :)Overall this movie was wonderful i actually watched it 13 times which shows how good it is because i am really picky when it comes to movies!,The Phantom of the Opera

The acting was just fantastic (although at times a little more expression on Christines face would have been better). You couldn't help but love the Phantom, Chritsine was beautiful, but Minnie Driver stole the show as Carlotta. What I loved most about the movie, though, was the musical score. They have stuck to Andrew Lloyd Webberss score in a brilliant way and they all sung like angels, but you will have to see the movie to truly understand that. There was so much atmosphere created by the music that found its way into your very soul. I strongly recommend it to EVERYONE, but do be careful if you do not like the amount of singing it inevitably contains. Bad reviews have come from those that criticize it purely for being a musical.

I absolutely loved the play so when I saw this movie, I was expecting less than the play. The play is obviously unbeatable. But, this movie was much more that I expected. There was more added to the movie and they were good additions that made the story flow very well. The detail was very helpful for those who weren't an obsessive fan of the play.

It was an excellent viewing and Christine's voice fit the part. With being so familiar with the various songs it was truly refreshing to here them all again. Tears throughout the whole picture. Mr Butlers part was intense for the physical aspect of the Phantom but I thought he slightly missed a little in his voice for the performances.

I have the original London cast of it on CD, and have seen in person once. A lot of the reviews I've read have been that the singing wasn't perfect, or that the acting wasn't sublime, or that it was overdone or trite. One thing I've realized with this musical is that every person brings their own flavor to it. Each cast does it differently. But it's the story, for me, that I love, and that surpasses any kind of visuals or acting. I say to go into this with an open mind. They keep to the original Webber songs and script fairly well. I found it delightful and moving. If you're not a fan of Webber, the Phantom story, or musicals, you probably won't like this, but why would you even go if you didn't?

Minnie Driver played a great and funny Carlotta, but I was also kind of surprised that she wasn't singing herself.

Gerard Butler played the Phantom very well, however I did enjoy Minnie Driver's performance as La Carlotta. She gave the character more dimension than I could have imagined. Three Golden Globe nominations isn't nearly enough, however we'll leave that up to O.G. to say otherwise. From Lon Cheney's version of Phantom to Robert Englund, the worse one I've seen was Claude Rains and the offshoot B-rated Phantoms.

Lloyd Webber's musicals are arguably the best ever and it's usually a pleasure to see them on the big screen; but never to be compared with the on stage versions.I have seen ""stage"" Phantom three times, did my Music Lit. term paper on it and have read the book. I am currently a drama and music teacher and enjoyed this movie adaptation.Traditionally, screen adaptations of stage shows (as do books to movies) have an additional song(s), lines or what have you. The additions and changes in this particular movie stay true to the ""original"" Phantom musical. There are some lines that are spoken in the movie but were originally sung, some additional lyrics, and orchestrations; none of these ""stand out"" (if you will) or change the intended mood.I do think that Gerald's (The Phantom) voice does not bring out the phantom's character to my liking but none the less, does a very good, commendable job. The rest of the casting is nothing less than wonderful.One part about this specific movie going experience is that the audience is there to see a show.

It lifted me, captured my spirit, and transported me into that eternal realm that only inspired artistic creations can.Minnie Driver was outstanding in her part. I did not see or realize that her singing was dubbed, she did such an outstanding job of lip-sincing. She is by far the hi-lite in the area of acting. A true master, and I hope she gets an Oscar nomination for her talents in this project.Of course, I love Sarah Brightman, so it is difficult to have her replaced. Emmy did a fabulous job, though. Gerard Butler is a fantastic Phantom, though. I would love to have a soundtrack with Sarah and Gerard!!! But, the film was mesmorizing, and unforgettable. I recommend it to all.

The more I see of his portrayal, the more I am saddened by the life of the character that he brings to life so well. ""Thank you"" to all involved in his casting - this role needed an actor such as he.I am also pleased that the maniacal aspect of the character of ""The Phantom"" was down-played and replaced by pathos. The written character and the character as acted by Mr Butler evoke this pathos exceptionally well.This movie (and the musical from which it derives) speak to the heart.Well done - cast, composer, writer/s, director, producer/s and all of the others who brought ""The Phantom of the Opera"" to the big screen in 2004.",The Phantom of the Opera

I didn't think it would be bad, I just have never seen the play so I had no idea what it was going to be about. Well, I'm VERY glad I went because it was AMAZING! The singing and acting were wonderful. It was so good I went and saw it again two days later with my sister. I read that the critics said it was boring. They were so wrong! The whole movie is full of excitement and will leave you in awe when it's over. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're into this kind of movie or not(I have never liked musicals). I would easily rate this movie 10/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1466,isabelle-k,Oh dear...,5,3 January 2005,"I first saw the musical as an extremely impressionable 15 year old and spent a considerable number of months (the better part of the year), feeling all a sorry for the character of the Phantom (I even read the Susan Kay ""novelisation"" and the Gaston Leroux original grand guignol novel). I can understand how Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman could never reprise their original performances given our culture's worship of all that is youthful, vigorous and dewy so I entered the cinema to see this film with a forgiving mindset...Things that I liked.. the beginning was terrific as it recaptured the brilliance of the opening of the musical and expanded on that (the CGI/Titanic-esquire revival of the Opera Garnier was brilliant). Minnie Driver's comic relief Carlotta (funnier and hammier than in the stage production) and the first half of Gerald Butler's phantom. I've not listened to the original score for more than a decade so though Mr Crawford's dulcet tones are forever worn out somewhere in the back of my auditory cortex, I really didn't think that Mr Butler did *that* bad a job .. in the first half of the film (and he really did look a sight better in the silk waistcoat and cape and mask ...)Things that I didn't like - silly, silly things like the ""masks of gold, (something) of puce"" being sung my MONOCHROMATIC-ally dressed revelers in ""Masquearade"". What happened to Christine dancing with sinister phantom characters? Where was the masquerade turbaned monkey? Why was the Phantom's ""Red Death"" costume reduced to something ""scary-lite"" (as Dr Evil would say)..Here are the other quibbles that just made a touchingly ridiculously melodrama on stage into a plainly ridiculous film, (IMO): - the cemetery scene with Christine seeking out her father's guidance.. her poor, penniless violinist father, mind you who's somehow managed to snap up the snazziest crypt in the cemetery (perhaps his royalties came through after he died and ..) - Christine's ""secret engagement ring"" hung in FULL view of all and sundry courtesy of her dress - Christine and Raoul's American accents, the Phantom's (albeit very slight) Scottish one and Madame Giry's east of the Seine accents just plain annoyed me - Raoul's Hanson family doo-mwop hairdo was likewise annoying - the awfulness of the Phantom's evil cackling in the second half; awful as in corny, smirk-inducing melodrama thanks to something which works when the actor is high up in the ""heavens"" of the theatre and NOT when he is in an extreme close-upI won't even mention the ""unreveal"" that isn't really that revealing.All in all, the film succeeded in reminding me how much I enjoyed the theatrical production and how much better suited for the theatre some forms of art are. It is easy to sit back and criticize rather than create nevertheless, I feel that Andrew Lloyd-Webber lost the opportunity of capturing what made his original musical such a success by collaborating with Joel Schumacher into order to to turn his already simplified original characters into such obvious black and white caricatures. I was in tears after seeing the stage and this cinematic version, respectively .. tears of sadness at the pathos of the Phantom's existence when I left the theatre and regrettably, tears of laughter at the ridiculous melodrama and characterisations when I left the cinema.People who've not seen the musical will obviously get far more out of the film than I have but I'd recommend people who loved the musical to leave at the bit when the chandelier is meant (but doesn't) fall.",The Phantom of the Opera
1467,Matthewsavage69,Fantastic,10,3 January 2005,The beauty and soul of the stage production has been delicately captured in the big screen version by the talented Schumacher. Great fears of whether or not anything could be done to improve or even remotely compare to the Michael Crawford stage version have been removed. The film compliments and arguably even adds more feeling and meaning to the stage version. The scenes are cleverly filmed and the songs remain true to the original with perhaps a few necessary modifications. The set looks fantastic (the chandelier alone is exquisite) and the fact that the chandelier disaster of act one does not appear until act two actually is of little consequence. Everybody should go and see this film it is superb!,The Phantom of the Opera
1468,licejo87,WOW!!! Goosebumps!!,9,3 January 2005,"I knew the story from my childhood because my father is a huge fan of musicals. (witch he passed on to me) when I heard The phantom of the opera was on the cinemas, my father and I went. And I'm so glad I did. I just sat there in Aaaaaaw!!! I had goosebumps on my arms and I just wanted to see it one more time when it was over. The best movie I have seen in a long time. I will recommend it to everyone. Even tough you do not really like musicals, I'm sure you will love this one. The heartbreaking love, the breathtaking music and the unbelievable tragedy is so well done and planned. Two and a half hour felt like only 30 minutes. It was so great! <3<3<3<3<3",The Phantom of the Opera
1469,LadyLecter,Not Michael Crawford but still really good,9,3 January 2005,"This written piece only contains spoilers if you haven't seen the musical itself. I was one of those who said, ""no Phantom movie without Michael Crawford"". I went to see the original version of the movie (not the dubbed German one), and was very pleased to find a well done movie with excellent actors. The singing is defiantly not as good as these are actors not singers but they are still doing well. My favorite bit of the movie is probably right after the auction when the real musical starts. The effects that moment were great. The opera house was beautifully done, and the movie provided enough theatrical atmosphere in the cinema that people refrained from talking and making noises while eating popcorn etc. Gerard Butler as the Phantom was a tad too handsome (even with the mask taken off), and with his shirt half open it was almost a relief that he didn't sing that well. Young Christine possessed enough youthful charm as well as charisma to make her actions very believable. Raoul was the rich friendly man one expects but as most Raouls do he is IMHO boring in his looks and actions when compared to the dashing Phantom. All in all a great musical, that can even be watched by those who root for Michael Crawford but are willing to get surprised.",The Phantom of the Opera
1470,bns26,An original take on a Broadway favorite,8,3 January 2005,"This is not the same Phantom that so many know and love-- but it is nonetheless lovable. The film version is necessarily very different from the stage production; not in the lines -- almost all of the dialog and lyrics were Broadway verbatim -- but in the framing and presentation of those lines. Everything just seems a lot...closer.For example, close-up shots are taken for granted by film watchers, but they are a treat in 'Phantom' because obviously in the stage version, the audience members are always at a fixed distance from the performers. These closeups immediately gave the film a tangible sense of intimacy and emotion in a way not possible on the stage. Special effects in the movie were well-done and artistic, tasteful, and never overbearing. A very few lyrical lines have been converted to normal speech in the movie, but this actually improves the transitions from action and talking to music and singing. There aren't any awkward places where the performers suddenly burst into song. The Phantom's lust for Christine is also particularly evident in the film, but in a sexy sorta way. Another aspect well-done.The singing is probably the single largest problem in the movie. Specifically, Gerard Butler's singing. I don't mean to compare him to anybody else, because that's not fair-- I just objectively don't think he's got the kind of singing ability suited to THE Phantom. I don't think he's got the range or the cold, piercing tone. But, he did do a decent job, and I won't dwell on this one trespass too long; nor should anyone else.A good, original movie in its own right. I give it 8/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1471,reds_fan2002,wow,10,3 January 2005,"I'm a fourteen year old from Nebraska who loves singing. After seeing this movie i was in heaven. The singing was wonderful, the orchestra incredible, and the acting was some of the best i've ever seen. My high school choir does a musical every year and I'm putting this one on the list. After seeing this movie i went straight out and on the way home bought the CD, which is also incredible. When i heard the first BIG chord from the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" shivers ran up my back, back down, and back up again. I was that thrilled. When the critics say its bad singing or the movies bad, write 'em back and tell Screw you. for anyone who is contemplating going should go and see it anyway. I saw it with my grandparents. My Grandpa hates musicals but agreed to go along. When we left he was singing the words right along with me. All in all, holy crap. 12/10.

The set designs, costumes, and characters maintained an immortal beauty that is rarely seen in today's films. I could not believe my ears. The music lifted my heart into the magic of the Phantom of the Opera. I am almost speechless, because there are no words from me that could possibly explain how magnificently it was. There were times of laughter, tears, joy, love, and of fear. Needless to say, the film was not given the chance to receive such criticism from audiences, because many did not see it. Some reasons were because many had seen other versions of it. I assure you of one thing: this film is not like the rest, it is the best.If you love romance, the classics, and know the true meaning of a good film, then I suggest you, and anyone you know, go straight to the theater to view the exquisite motion picture.

I can't tell enough people how much I loved it! Andrew Lloyd Webber did an amazing job once again, and his cast was outstanding! Everyone but Minnie Driver sang their own parts, and did great. Gerard Butler is stunning as The Phantom, with an amazing voice that captures the every emotion you will feel as you watch from your seat. Emmy Rossum is also fabulous, as she portrays the lovely Christine. Take my advice, The Phantom Of The Opera is a must see.

1474,attorneydummy,loved it!,10,3 January 2005,"Absolutely loved this movie! I'd seen the Broadway production three times, so I was geared for the worst. To my surprise, it was more like having a $9 front row seat, with the added benefit of multiple views that only movie cameras can provide. Sure, I prefer Michael Crawford's singing as the Phantom to Gerard Butler's, but Butler was pretty hot (with mask and hair, of course)! He was certainly the sexiest Phantom I've seen, and I got more a sense of the Phantom's passion, frustration and sadness with Butler in the movie than I did with the on stage production. Raoul was not as he is in the play; the movie Raoul was blonder with inexplicably long hair, but he won me over as well. The actress playing Christine was neither a great beauty nor a great actress, but in the whole of the movie that didn't really matter to me either. It was beautifully photographed, and I didn't notice any out of sync singing the two times I saw it. The music was beautiful, as it is in the stage production. Highly recommend it to Phantom fans.",The Phantom of the Opera

1477,pbereznak,Best Movie Ever,10,10 February 2005,"I have seen this movie 4 times. It is the best movie I have ever seen. I have the special addition soundtrack and play nothing else but that in my car. I have read as many reviews as I can. I find it strange that the critics don't like this movie but the public sure does. The critics say, ""the phantom isn't scary enough or disfigured enough"". These are obvious not romantics or just men in general. THe whole idea of having a phantom that looks like Gerard Butler is you want Christine to be a little confused on who to choose. You want her to be conflicted. Otherwise how stupid that would be. And boring. Every time I leave the theatre women are crying and when you talk to them they all have seen it more than twice. My 13 daughter cries every time as well.I've also heard some reviews say that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were so good at singing, they couldn't be replaced. Let me tell you, I am so glad I didn't listen to them before I saw the movie because I may have not been interested to see it. Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were horrible singing the songs. MC sounded to stage like and Sarah no emotion. That is what I like about Emmy, Gerard and Patrick. They are young and appreciate the importance of the roles they were given and the emotions for the role through the songs and their singing show when you listen to them.All I have to say is YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1478,riotgrrl54-1,Great scenery doesn't make up for Bad casting.,3,3 January 2005,"I went to see this with my sister, full of hype about it. I had never seen Phantom of the Opera on stage, but I had heard someone doing the duet at an open mic once and was entranced. But the film was grandly disappointing. The scenery and imagery was beautiful, their set designer and cinematographists deserve awards. Also, the costumes were spectacular, the Phantom's mask appearing so sinister. The problem with this movie was the casting. Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson do an excellent job, and Gerard Butler was passable in the role of the Phantom. But besides these, the rest of the cast fails, and the movie suffers as a result. The leads could barely sing! Granted, they can sing a far cry better than I can, BUT. The people who I heard sing at open mic did a far better job. Aren't these movie stars supposed to be the top quality? No, whoever did the casting for this movie needs to move into a different career.",The Phantom of the Opera
1479,ray-306,"Phantom, a glorious, gluttonous banquet",10,3 January 2005,"Phantom, a gluttonous banquet It's a lush, gluttonous banquet for the eyes and the ears. It's what the cinema experience should be all about. Big screen crammed with spectacular sets and gorgeous, costumed people. Birds-eye camera tracking and swooping like a bat in a cavern. Full, rich, multi-dimensional sound with bass organ notes that make the theatre tremble. Singing, dancing, crushing romance, fantasy scenes between nightmare and dream. Yes, Phantom of the Opera helps you remember what the magic of movies looked like. No poky little kitchen-and-drawing room drama. No miserly two-character conversation followed by a Steadycam operator. This is big glorious cinema - in fact, cinema as opera. Alas, because of the dictates of modern tastes, we don't get any real singers in this production, just beautiful actors who sing quite nicely. The only truly operatic voice belongs to Minnie Driver's Carlotta and that is dubbed by a real opera singer who of course we never see. Gerard Butler makes a handsomely devilish Phantom who will bowl over the matinée mums. His baritone strains particularly in the higher register, but has the miracles of modern sound engineering to help smooth over the cracks. Emily Rossum makes a virginal Christine, but her singing though sweet would never bring a Paris audience to its feet. The surprise was Patrick Wilson, the awfully pretty Raoul, who displayed a surprisingly good light tenor. Of course everyone will say they miss Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford - but alas their time has passed. However the music is Andrew Lloyd-Webber with all stops out and it's magnificent. After nearly 20 years we know most of the songs by heart, and some extras have been thrown in for leavening. The music roars and whispers, flows and gushes, shamelessly plays the heartstrings like you're an instrument in the orchestra. All the tricks learned from centuries of composing genius are well used here. The romantic melodies like Puccini (one of the better-known musical phrases in this work is straight out of Puccini's La Fanciulla dell West. Is it a ""quote"", a ""steal"" or ""an accident""? I have never seen an explanation. But it is, after all, just a phrase.). The grandeur of a Verdi (even a sword fight now), the leitmotifs of a Wagner; Lloyd-Webber deliberately constructed an opera here. Of course opera is notoriously difficult to film. The plots are too simplistic and trite - this is why the ""serious"" film critics hate Lloyd-Webber's work, they are looking for Bergman or Truffaut but in opera there are no deep, multi-layered plots. All the emotion and complexity is woven into the music - they are looking into the wrong place. When I first saw the musical 14 years ago, they had spent several million dollars making our local Princess Theatre look like a grand 19th Century opera house. I'm glad to see they made the film set even more lavish. So you doubt that miles of underground corridors, lakes and caverns would go unnoticed beneath a public building, either to security or at least the plumbers? Or that a grand organ booming away in the middle of the night under the pavement of the Rue de Lyon might not be heard? Ah get away with you, this is opera, since when did logic have anything to do with it?Which is exactly the point: hang your New York Times-trained critical analysis in the cloak room before you go in. Forget about minimalism and subtlety and watercolour delicacy - this is an over-the-top Jacques-Louis David and Versailles Palace experience. Walk in - preferably with someone you love (or you want to) and just surrender to the overwhelming romanticism of it all. Ray Beatty Melbourne Australia ray@ebeatty.com",The Phantom of the Opera

I think it was amazingly done. Beautifully filmed..the costumes were everything I could have imagined...I was shocked particularly by the performance of Gerard Butler (you may remember him as Attila in the History Chanel Movie) He played the Phantom...

In regards to time, if it were Raul he would not have been that much older, that is of course, unless my eyes were wrong, and the gap between past and present was more than twenty / thirty years. In any sense, It's not the phantom, because of,... well, you know, and none else had seen the monkey dealie, except for Christine's ""mother""'s daughter.

I think the biggest difference between the play and the movie for me is that with the movie, you feel like you're right there. Up front and personal - so to speak.

I didn't really know who to root for. I kind of turn into Christine when because I also get hypnotized by the Phantom. I was glad to see all the added parts to make the story flow better and explain the past as well. Some of the things are pretty scarce in the musical and I had to read the book to understand the whole ordeal with her father and other things as well. I was very nervous about this movie because I was scared it wouldn't live up to the musical but it definitely did. It was hard to get used to some of the changes after seeing the musical so many times but it was great. The visualization was so much better and the signing was fantastic. I thought Gerard Butler did excellent although Michael Crawford is by far the best Phantom. I have loved Phantom of the Opera since I was five years old and secretly wished I could have played Emmy Rossum's part. It was because of Phantom that I started singing and am happy that I did. For some I could see how this movie might bore them but one has to understand that this a musical that does not have elaborate dancing and much movement. A person has to appreciate the music, the story and come with an open mind but it was fabulous. Andrew Lloyd Webber, you did a spectacular job.

1485,melora98,Like a dream,10,4 January 2005,"I've always been a fan of ALW's ""Phantom"" and was thrilled to learn it would be made for the big screen. Live performances will always be wonderful, but here we get to not only see faces and expressions, but also play with scenery and background more than can be done on a stage production. And as my husband (who, as a man, tends to have trouble hearing the multiple dialogs when everyone is singing at once) can attest, it was easier to understand the words, too.Gerard Butler as the Phantom was absolutely breathtaking; his acting is flawless, and I was drawn immediately to his beauty, and the dream of his voice. If that was indeed Butler's voice on the soundtrack, the man is very, very talented. The voice was like velvet, smooth and haunting, and yet just enough of the ""rock star"" rough element to be truly seductive. His eyes conveyed his emotions with absolute purity, drawing us in to see the Phantom in all his complexity; a genius, a madman, a passionate and lonely creature. You pity him, and love him, and are inevitably seduced by him, just as is Christine.Emmy Rossum as Christine is also perfectly cast. She portrays Christine's softness, earnestness, and pity with perfection. Her voice is sweet and her eyes are pleading. And Patrick Wilson as the beautiful but ultimately vacant Raoul was brilliantly cast; no need for good acting here, just a pretty voice and pretty face. And I can't NOT say something about Minnie Driver as Carlotta; what a wonderful performance! She was Carlotta to the extreme, hilariously diva-ish, with a voice to make you wince and laugh.Fans of the stage show will probably get more out of this version of Phantom than those who have never seen it. One must be prepared and understand that it *is* a musical, and while this film version has spoken lines, it is still mostly sung dialog. My husband admits that he tends to not really listen to the words of the songs, and therefore he misses half of the dialog of the story. People who don't like musicals will probably not get too much out of this performance. However, people who ""get it"" are likely to writhe with glee, as I did upon viewing it.Three words can describe this movie best:Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.",The Phantom of the Opera

I was prepared to be disappointed with the movie but instead was very surprised and highly pleased. My wife shed a few tears during the movie which she didn't do during the London stage version. The words to the songs were MUCH clearer in the film than they were on stage which I really enjoyed. I thought Emmy Rossum did a fantastic job as Christine. Her singing was excellent and her facial expressions and acting perfectly reflected a innocent, confused, conflicted and love struck teen. She deserves the Golden Globe nomination and hopefully will be recognized with an Oscar nomination too. I thought Raoul was perfectly cast with an excellent voice, good looks and good acting. I wasn't as impressed with the Phantom but my criticisms are minor. The mask was different but I didn't mind. I enjoyed the back stage views of the opera house. I liked the black and white sequences that gave more detail about the auction at the beginning and what happened with Christine and Raoul after they escaped the Phantom. Many of the criticisms I've read of the movie have been unjustified, IMHO. I thought it was an excellent movie of an excellent stage musical. They are different and yet the same.

1489,evilredhead1212,Simply amazing,10,4 January 2005,"There's a lot of trash talk about Gerard Butler and his role as the Phantom. I personally thought he was just the person that was needed for the role. He's got the power to seduce Christine with his music, yet he has the ability to show extreme darkness and hatred. Many say his singing isn't as good as it needed to be. I thought it was breath taking, especially considering that Mr. Butler hasn't had any training for the movie. I am in love with the song ""Music of the Night."" You can feel all the emotions in his voice and almost see the expressions on his face. You can HEAR him performing, which is wonderful! His acting is superior as well. The scene where he's sitting in front of the monkey music box, singing ""Masquerade"" to himself, I broke down and cried. The scene where Christine kisses him, I wanted to jump and shout for joy! I don't know what to think of when she gives the ring back to him. It's sad, b/c it's symbolizing that she won't be staying with him, but then again, it's almost like she's giving him something to remember her by. I think she really had to think about who to stay with. They were both very different men. She was romantically in love with Roaul, but the Phantom gave her the thing that brought her to Roaul. Their relationship is more seductive and deeper I think than her and Roaul's relationship b/c they've known each other for so long, even though they have just met.

A few misses here and there, but who cares, you were all amazed and all when you got out of the cinema. And thats why you go to the cinema, to get an experience. Or at least that is why I go.

1491,moviestar_nat,Loved it...,10,18 January 2005,"Hey people, You have to see this movie. This is one of the best films out this year and needs to be voted for and at least needs an Oscar nomination for it... The best part was when The Phamton took Christine through the mirror and down the hall, to his under ground layer. Between the two actors it seemed very much like they were meant for each other. It was sexy, romantic, and had a Gothic feeling to it, and the actors had a lot of chemistry between them i loved it... The thing that really confused me was that, at the very start i didn't know who the old man was in the wheelchair... I think that this film will live in the hearts of people who really love those romantic musicals...",The Phantom of the Opera
1492,xobrownsugar04x,Simply Amazing!,10,6 January 2005,"Oh My Gosh!! I saw this movie on Sunday, and today is Thursday-the songs have been playing in my head endlessly! Superb acting, minus the often dumb, gaping looks of Christine when in the presence of the Phantom. All the actors sang incredibly, and Gerry Butler's raw voice added more humanity and passion to the Phantom. I saw it with my cousin, and we were drooling all over the seats whenever Butler appeared! If I don't see this movie again, buy the soundtrack, and buy the DVD I don't know what I'll do! The scenery and costumes were excellent, and the special effects gave me chills! The best moment in the whole film, if I may say, is the point when the chandelier is brought back to life, and the faded Opera House reclaims its glory through color and the spine-tingling Phantom theme. Patrick was an excellent Raoul, though slightly boyish and wet, Emmy's voice was phenomenal, spectacular and she's totally bound to do great things with those pipes but that's all I can really say. Her acting could have been better-but hey, he's the PHANTOM! Gerry was fantastic, and brought me to tears at the end when Christine and Raoul leave him behind and he sings a verse of Masquerade. Fabulous. He's utterly delicious, yet he didn't horrify me when his face was revealed. He was too sexy!! (Though I'm not complaining- an utterly gruesome Phantom would've made me cringe.)""All I Ask of You"" brought me to tears! ""Masquerade"" sent me straight into a dream- but there was that one robot-like masquerader man who did some strange, bizarre moves. He was kinda random... ""Think of Me"" was sweet and Emmy sang like an angel! The one thing I disliked was the seemingly endless scene (and song) when Christine visits her father's grave. That simply bored me, though (I'll say it again) she is extremely talented! ""Past the Point of No Return"" sent my female-teenager-hormones on a ride! I was completely mesmerized by Gerry in that scene...completely mesmerized! Other people have noted that, since the actors licensed, their mouth movements did not match up perfectly. I'll go see it again and look for that! On the whole, I'll be seeing this (and hearing it in my head) for a long time!",The Phantom of the Opera
1493,jinny-chung,Surprisingly amazing.,10,5 January 2005,"For nearly half of my life have I hummed the title song on a daily basis. That is exactly why I was so apprehensive upon discovering that they were going to make a movie based on the musical -- I didn't want Hollywood to... well, I didn't want Hollywood to Hollywoodize it! Also, I wasn't so crazy about Joel Schumacher coming on board as the director (I'm a huge fan of the first two 'Batman's and was very disappointed about the last two).When I logged on IMDb a few months ago to find out who was playing which character, I was indifferent: I didn't know any of these people. Who's Gerard Butler? Who's Emmy Rossum? Who's Patrick Wilson? I knew Minnie Driver and began to question whether or not she could sing the very demanding part that is Carlotta.My apprehension only intensified.But then the movie finally came out. And I was amazed. There were certain changes made for the film, but they were acceptable, and I completely understand why they made them (i.e., the Red Death costume, the masked dancers in 'Masquerade'). The movie was visually stunning, as many critics have been saying -- and they're completely right in saying this.But, yes, there were some things that irritated me. I didn't like the way some of the lines were delivered (at first, the lines that are meant to be sung but were spoken for the film annoyed me greatly, but I understood over time why they did this). I also found myself uncomfortable during 'I Remember / Stranger than You Dreamt It' because of the camera angles and the editing -- I felt that scene should have been done a bit differently.However, the acting was excellent. The critics have been praising Emmy Rossum for her rendition of Christine Daae, and I agree whole-heartedly. But these same critics have been bad-mouthing Gerard Butler -- this is where I do not agree. Sure, Gerard Butler doesn't have the voice Michael Crawford does -- but this is a good thing. The Phantom in this movie is supposed to be very sexy, and with a near-falsetto voice, the filmmakers would not have been able to achieve this vision. Gerard Butler's voice was perfect for this interpretation, although at times, his Scottish accent seeps through the very little spoken dialog in the film. Luckily, it isn't that noticeable, because his delivery, whether through song or speech, is awesome.Butler shows off his range of ability through this character. In the past, he wasn't given much to work with (i.e., 'Dracula', 'Timeline'), but with this particular film, he is able to show moviegoers that not only can he be the quintessential broody, sexy male character, but also the sensitive sap, the hopeless romantic, and -- well, and the 'pitiful creature of darkness', for lack of a better word. His last scene in the film is, in my opinion, heartbreaking. He was, in a word, brilliant in this role.Emmy Rossum -- I don't even have to touch on her. Some may complain that she does not show enough emotion, that she just looks confused and dazed. I can only say that this is not true. There are moments in which she looks this way because the character is indeed confused/dazed, and in other scenes, she is, when appropriate, pleasantly surprised, in awe, frightened, enamored, and angry. During the climax, she clearly shows her feelings of betrayal when she delivers the line, ""The tears I might have shed for your dark fate / Grow cold and turn to tears of hate"".Patrick Wilson. This is the actor I had the most problems with, but only because of the one line Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber threw in there for only God knows why. He has a fantastic voice and is a good actor, but he does not stand out. It is good to keep in mind that he did do his own stunts, however.As for the direction, I must say that I was very happy with Joel Schumacher when I left the theater. I would be the biggest, fattest liar if I were to say that he disappointed me with this film. His vision made sense to me, and he succeeded in bringing it to life. When Christine sees the Phantom for the first time, she is led through his mirror and to his lair. This visuals in the beginning of this scene were somewhat blurry and had a certain golden glow to it to create a dream-like state. I don't see how this scene could have been done any other way.So, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film, but I must warn you -- if you do not like musicals (let alone, this particular musical) or if you, for some reason, hate Andrew Lloyd Webber, or if you hate phantoms, don't watch this movie. Otherwise, go and you will be pleasantly surprised. You might even find yourself seeing it again.",The Phantom of the Opera
1494,anzacdave,Almost perfect,8,5 January 2005,"I thought this was an excellent rendition of the stage play (I'm biased, I loved it). My only negative comment would be that I thought the actor who played the Phantom wasn't up to it vocally. I also thought that the black and white theme of the masquerade ball, while interesting, detracted somewhat from the sumptuousness of the film (just a bit to sterile, really).Other than that, the remaining cast where great (minie driver stands out as an over-the-top diva) and the sets were stunning.I took my wife along to this one (she's a big Gilbert and Sulivan fan and I thought she'd be into it.) Alas, she hated it, so there you go, this one's not for everyone.",The Phantom of the Opera
1495,willpeet,My feelings on The Phantom,10,5 January 2005,"The Broadway musical has been re-made for the screen and I love it. But then I am biased there. Although I have never been a great fan of Andrew Lloyd Weber, I feel that he has created something that is more hauntingly moving than anything before it. Here he has taken the original novel and brought out the love-triangle, between Christine, Raoul and the phantom, to be the plot for this version of the story. I feel this will be his greatest accomplishment ever. I saw the Broadway version at the Bob Carr auditorium in Orlando. Fla. and was ""haunted"" by the story and the music for days. The story was always in my mind and I couldn't stop singing the score to myself. I just saw the movie and although there were some fallbacks I found it to be just as great. Basically the movie was able to use effects that are impossible on the stage. The basic disadvantage was the undying need of the camera to zoom in upon the actors. I don't need to see faces up close. In the end it takes away from everything when you have seen the production on the stage. Maybe I'm being anal??? I feel that Gerald Butler did a fair job as the phantom. He has a great voice but it didn't quite work for me. However I must admit that I may have allowed myself to fall into the trap we all do at times, in which we get to love one artist playing a role to the point that we have a hard time connecting with another. Well, I will go. Before I go, however, I recommend that you see the screen production of this musical. I think you will enjoy it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1496,pkc1,Mesmerizing but flawed - Chix dig it but men don't understand it!,9,5 January 2005,"I truly loved this movie. I will OWN it on DVD so I can drool over Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom. The man is an underrated chameleon who drew you in and made you feel the pain of the character. After this, I am a fan of Gerard Butler for life. I am looking forward to watching him mature and expand as an actor.Now as to the singing: I own the original sound track and have loved Micheal Crawford's vocalrendition as the Phantom for years. Rossum does a great job (infinitely better than Brightman's ugly habit of swallowing her vocals) as does Wilson as Raoul. Butler is no MC, but then, MC is definitely NOT Butler either. Butler's voice is acceptable, not great. I got the impression that is was just barely acceptable for the 35 yr old Butler to play lover to a 17 year old Rossum, but it would have been obscene if the 62 yr old Crawford to do this and less likely to draw in the hordes of appreciative female fans who love to identify with the Phantom's pain and kick Christine for choosing the wrong man. Butler is very easy on the eyes and gives ""Tall Dark and Handsomely erotic"" leading man role a new high for the usually wimpy Hollywood hunks.Emmy Rossum is a lovely beauty that can sing beautifully, and even tho the story calls for her to be young, you get a real feel that the two principle characters were intimidated by the fact that she is jail bate and he is over 30. Gerard Butler treated Christine's character with kid gloves instead of the desperate unrequited lover. This(and very poor staging) is possibly what deadened what should have been the most erotic and passionate duet of the entire movie: Point of No Return. Why on earth they had the Phantom and Christine staged to move away from each other and up stairs during this passionate seduction of voices is beyond me. The director should have been kicked off the set and replaced with someone who understands physical touch and body language as a subtle dialogue. Sheesh.Next, the make up director should be fired. They obviously never heard of follow through checks and it showed. Several times the masks on the Phantom should have revealed the deformity, but didn't. Phantom's hair suddenly changed color in the end. There were times when Christine had make up on in one part of the scene and didn't in others. There was no consistency!I was disappointed that they didn't expand on the original Phantom story and give more back story and dialogue, but I guess ALW decided that if it wasn't broke don't fix it. :sigh:Lastly, the music is incredible. While some of the singing isn't as good as the original Play, it still has the power to draw you in and seduce you. Every woman walked out of that movie with tears in her eyes and half in love with the Phantom. Every male walked out of the theatre scratching his head and wondering what the heck his date saw in it! The two sixteen year old girls with me are eager to see the movie again and plotting on how they can get posters of the two hotties in the movie (Butler and Wilson). The women in front of me were sobbing uncontrollably while their dates looked at them as if they'd lost their minds.",The Phantom of the Opera
1497,danandshea,Another kind of Phantom Experience,7,5 January 2005,"As I sat in the theater I felt the chills coming like I so often felt during the 12 times I had seen the stage performance of Phantom. Which was really either setting myself up for a huge disappointment or some other unexpected emotion as no movie is ever how you anticipate it's going to be. The first 30 minutes with the Auction Scene etc..I was VERY VERY happy with. I was pleasantly surprised by Raul. He was unlike any Raul I had ever seen,.. but it was okay,..He was great! But then the Phantom came. They had made some subtle changes during the movie,.. and I found myself wishing that one of them had been his introduction into the movie. It was anti climatic. Then his raspy voice came over the speakers and really threw me for a loop. But in the spirit of the ""Phantom"" I remember having to ""Get Used"" to ever new Phantom as all of the stage productions I have seen always had different performers and one of the things you had to deal with was new voices. No one was going to be Michael Crawford. And so having a good look at him,.. it was definitely a blessing for the movie that Gerard is so darn HOTT! But I found myself staring at him throughout thinking about who I would have cast instead of him had it been up to me. Which by the second hour was also good because I had something else to do. It was getting a bit long. The cemetery scene the sword fight should have been cut down a bit,...and there were some other sequences that were long winded as well. But all in all I was made happy again and the movie would redeem itself each time Minnie Driver had a scene,.. Emme sang or Raul graced the big silver screen. But then there was the TRAVESTY. The relationship between Madam Giry and Eric/Phantom. Made me sick from within. WHY WHY WHY did they do it? Had the writers been watching that episode of Little House on the Prarie with the ""Wild boy"" in the traveling circus? What provoked them to do this? WHY? They took all of the Phantoms ""Magic"" away and made him Human,.. they gave him a purpose and a cause,..when before all we needed to know was that Christine was his reason,.. and his Muse....What was there before,...the things you remember,..are still there and if you hold on tightly it just might tide you over until the next stage production comes to town. My suggestion to you would be to go with someone who has seen it already,.. so they can yank you out into the lobby during those certain portions,...that take the magic away. It's like watching a movie about the magic of Christmas and Santa,.. and then on the way home your parents telling you there's no such thing. It just took the wind right out of my sail. Don't go expecting the theater. Go,..expecting to see another persons rendition. I still say,.. ""Go,..see it""... after all,..""True Phantom Phans"" want to be a part of anything Phantom. This is just another kind of Phantom experience.",The Phantom of the Opera
1498,tmo-9,ehh,5,7 January 2005,"That's what I have to say about the movie. I am an actress and huge musical theatre buff. I am not a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but Phantom is my favorite of his works. This was a bug disappointment in the wave of movie musicals.The costumes and sets were amazing. Stunning really. It saved the movie in my mind.The cast was weak in many areas. Most obvious is Butler as The Phantom. Although I feel he tried very hard to embody the role, I think he really fell short. I cringed at points watching his performance. His voice was weak and untrained. At times this can be a virtue, but this just didn't work for Phantom, which is solely based on operetta.Christine was a very nice Christine. She really captivated me, but it wasn't her singing that got me, it was her emotion behind the character. Great job on her part.Overall, it was just ehh. I wouldn't buy it on DVD, which is saying a lot. I love musicals. Theatre is my life. This just doesn't cut it for me.",The Phantom of the Opera
1499,beardc,Agonizing,3,11 January 2005,"The costumes were beautiful; that is the best I can say for it. The film was so over-the-top that it came off as silly. I couldn't refrain from giggling at places that were supposed to be serious! The Phantom was horribly miscast; he was not credible and couldn't sing! Christine sang well, but could only conjure up about 2 facial expressions; the most prevalent was the ""deer in the headlights"" look with her mouth aghast. The lack of chemistry between the principles made the pace seem even slower than it already was. It seemed to last an eternity... half-way through, my date & I were both checking our watches. What an agonizing evening!",The Phantom of the Opera
1500,Italian_drama_grl12,Awesome movie,9,6 January 2005,"The movie is absolutely superb. The costumes and the sets are extremely extravagant, as befits the show itself. The movie, unlike the play, doesn't get caught up in the spectacle of itself, and the special effects are well performed. The movie also answers questions that the play leaves unanswered, explaining how the Phantom came to be at the Paris Operahouse and going more in depth into Madame Giry's role in the affair. Also, it takes a different angle than the play, taking the magic out of the Phantom's stunts- making him more man-like and less of a magical figure. The music and the singing are absolutely amazing, they certainly do justice to Andrew Lloyd Webber's magnificent score.",The Phantom of the Opera

He plays the part with so much passion and intensity that you can't help but fall in love with him! Emmy Rossum is a light in the dark!

1502,avalon21,Some critics are not true Phantom fans!,10,6 January 2005,"I recently went to see The Phantom of the Opera on the big screen and I have to say that overall, the film was amazing! I had the opportunity to see The Phantom of the Opera about 14 years ago when it was playing at the Pantages Theatre in Toronto. Even though I was young back then, I thought the musical was the BEST I had ever seen! I must have listened the soundtrack literally hundreds of times. I was thrilled to hear that it was coming to the big screen as I only had the one opportunity to see it live.Given that I am quite familiar with the lines (after listening to the soundtrack so obsessively), I did detect some subtle differences in the movie version but thankfully these few differences didn't take away from the overall experience. The actor/singers chosen to play the various lead roles were excellent. I am a fan of Colm Wilkinson(Canadian cast) so at first I was a little disappointed with whom they chose to sing in the movie version. I felt his abilities were a little weak but in the end, he sorta grew on me and he does have one thing over Mr. Wilkinson - he's QUITE hot! The reason I wanted to write this review is to make an honest complaint about the reviewer on the AMC theater website who was rather unkind about his/her comments on this fantastic film. I honestly believe that people who want to see this film should not listen to the reviewer's commentary. True, the film is a MUSICAL... and it's not for everyone. Those of us who appreciate MUSICALS and have seen it live will agree that the movie version was simply stellar! Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher HAVE done the story justice both on Broadway and on the big screen. You have to be a fan to give it an adequate review. End of story. Those of you who haven't seen the Phantom of the Opera and appreciate musicals... go see the film and be prepared to be dazzled!

But I was spellbound from the early moments of the film because of the great casting of Christine, the Phantom and Raoul.Their voices and acting abilities were perfect for the roles and you could have heard a pin drop in the theatre which is testament to the film's greatness. Somehow bringing this to life on the big screen could only have worked if this story of love and overcoming despair was portrayed with a sense of reality which one could somehow overlook when being caught up in the magnitude of the stage production .

1506,xxmarsters_depp_grant_butlerxx,a very fair and un-biased review of 'phantom'.,10,8 January 2005,"-phantom of the opera was a great movie and a great re-production of the play on Broadway. i may only be 14 but i definitely know my theatre/arts.-gerard butler, who has done a great job as the phantom, could have been a bit better in my opinion, especially with his vocal singing. he did play out his emotions and passion into the songs but at some points missed the vocal marks tremendously. it is his first attempt into the singing industry so its understandable and tolerable for his minor mistakes. he did all in all, play the phantom wonderfully, not to mention -gorgeously and straight up damn sexy- .-emmy rossum, a beautiful young Hollywood actress, who surprisingly, sang Cristine's songs to her best ability. maybe if she were older and her voice matured more, it would have had the sound of a much more bolder, experienced singer, but i can't complain that emmy wasn't wonderful in the movie, and she definitely wasn't bad.-the costumes, make-up and the light mix of comedy to relieve us of the drama/angst was a wonderful blend. full of vivid details, and colors, and especially, especially- the masquerade ball was done to perfection.-all in all, this movie was a great film to see for any person, any age. it's exciting, heartbreaking, and done beautifully. the movie is based very closely to the original, but with slight new additions, making it in my opinion, to it's better. some of the music was composed to a slightly newer age but still leaving us with the feel of a classical rendition of the original 'phantom'.i would highly recommend this film.",The Phantom of the Opera

An amazing film for musical lovers like me! I really enjoyed the Masquerade, the choreography was fantastic. Raoul is so hot, I must say... Hes also a fantastic actor. Christine was also gorgeous! My favourite songs were All I ask of you, Think of Me, Music of the Night, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. The actors I hadn't seen before- they all were very good. I think Its great that they have made a film out of It, as the show only comes to New Zealand very rarely.

1509,maharet44,Film adaptation of the ever-popular musical.,3,8 January 2005,"The major, and admittedly perhaps inevitable, difficulty this film faces (and to which it unfortunately succumbs) is that what appears impressive on stage becomes overdone and hokey on screen. The chandelier scene alone benefits from the advantages of film; ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" chokes on mist, and ""All I Ask of You"" absurdly leaves us with the Phantom, Batman-esquire, astride a gargoyle. Part of the fun of The Phantom of the Opera is precisely that it is over-dramatic, but with weak voices and a too-literal rendering of the stage experience, that energy becomes a liability in the film. It is not a matter of its success or failure in relation to the stage version of the musical; the film provides enough eye-rolling moments entirely on its own merits to render any comparison-based criticism unnecessary.Gerard Butler virtually curdles Webber's music as he scoops at the vast majority of his notes and visibly braces himself painfully for each note requiring even a bit of extra exertion. Emmy Rossum has a pretty voice and gives an adequate film performance, excepting Christine's operatic portions. Minnie Driver is delightful, and Patrick Wilson is inoffensive, if bland. While the Phantom's makeup is pitifully inconsistent in general, it is quite appropriate in its featured scenes at the movie's end.This film, sadly, is neither seriously successful nor such a glorious failure that it becomes a thrillingly campy romp.",The Phantom of the Opera
1510,bellamarek,Wonderful!,10,8 January 2005,"Gerard Butler as the phantom, was ""in a word, SUBLIME""! Very passionate and I don't care what the naysayers have to say about his ""sexing"" up the phantom's image. While it may turn off the die-hard Michael Crawford fans, it will attract the masses. At the end of the movies, people who weren't familiar with Gerard Butler stayed to read the credits to find out who the masked man was. I truly hope he is the next James Bond! I've seen the ALWPOTO five times..and counting!! If you can get past the fact that almost everything is 'sung' which some people have a problem with, the passion of the movie comes through. While there is no 'opera' quality singing, it's still very thoroughly entertaining. I don't see why Emmy Rossum deserves an Oscar nomination for it though. She sang beautifully, but pretty much spent the entire moving with her mouth open and chest heaving at the Phantom (as many ladies in the movie theater did as well). The first 45 minutes especially the last half hour of the movie was most definitely worth any 'dry' spots there may have been. :) I recommend it as long as you're not trying to compare it to the stage version.

Wonderful film, for people of different ages and tastes.When you know that it has Andrew Lloyd Webber's music in it, you can't be wrong. Good acting, wonderful camera work, sets and all this. The four-minute-lasting scene where He takes Daae to the dungeon is one of the most stunning parts of the film, in my opinion. It looks repelling and dangerous but the music sounds like a protection. Strong dramatic characters, just like in ancient Greek drama but perhaps even deeper.This is a story about sorrow and about our life which we lead. The characters are references to reality and the film appears to contain symbols in every detail of every set, and every word of every actor.Definitely worth seeing.

I was particularly fascinated by the masquerade scene when men were in tux and women in gowns and Venetian-style masks. That just put me in the *right* mood.The love story was mysterious and illogical. How could the most outstanding soprano fall in love with a violent man with a scarred face? Could it be the power of music? It was surprising, intriguing, and heart-breaking.Room for improvement: Although Phantom was marvelous, it would be more dramatic if his face had sharper edge and were more shadowy. Also Phantom should not be so tall. A height about 5'10"" and a more slim figure would be perfect.",The Phantom of the Opera
1514,foshoichiro,one word....AMAZING,10,9 January 2005,"This movie was phenomenal....going into the movie people have to expect it to not be as high of quality as the musical...however i still think the singing was awesome.....the girl who played Christine has had tons of training and sounded amazing...the phantom gave me chills....you have to think about it...Nicole Kidmen and Euwan McGregor sang in Mulun Rouge, which one picture of the year, and best song at the academy awards...and there singing was VERY VERY good and could easily be compared to the voices of those in the opera....i never found myself bored during the movie, and i went into it not knowing it was going to be completely singing.....the music was played at the perfect parts, and the scene when the Phantom take Christine to his ""lair"" for the first time is Spectacular...Plus i also have the movie soundtrack and LOVE it....i went with 4 people to the movie who all have different tastes and they all loved it as well...just shows how well it was put together to be able to entertain and amaze different types of movie goers",The Phantom of the Opera
1515,jd-miller,Phantom of the Opera (2004),9,9 January 2005,I am not going to say too much except if you have seen and enjoyed the stage version you should love this. It is as close to the theatre production as a film can be with even some of the choreography being recognisable. In the UK some of the movie critics were less than happy with the film but I feel that any criticism has to be based on the fact that it is the film version of a stage musical and not a stand alone movie. Whilst I thought that the casting of the Phantom himself left a bit to be desired the other roles were very well cast and the spirit of the stage production was captured extremely well. I have seen it twice and cannot wait for the DVD to arrive!!,The Phantom of the Opera
1516,halfbloodme,"Great film, just a few issues.",8,14 January 2005,"I enjoyed the film very much, the acting was excellent and I was reminded of why I love the stage show. However, just a few things - the atmosphere in the grave yard was lacking the scene is meant to be in the dead of night - not broad daylight. Also what was a horse doing in the catacombs? I mean how did it get down there in the first place? There wasn't one in the stage show and there isn't in the book as far as I remember. I mean I could be wrong but I don't think that I am. And lastly - the opening music could have done with being a little more base intense to create the mood for the film. It's the main thing that grips you when watching the stage show.Other than that though I really did enjoy it and would definitely watch it again.",The Phantom of the Opera
1517,that_one_girl88,Absolutely Beautiful,10,9 January 2005,"I am not generally a fan of musicals, but I will freely admit that I absolutely loved this. This was a fabulous movie. The acting is wonderful and the music is drool-worthy to say the least. (The songs have been stuck in my head for 2 weeks now and I'm still not sick of them. :D) Gerard Butler couldn't be more perfect for the role of the phantom. He has a very classic and awesome quality about him that is irresistible. The photography is fantastic, the costumes and sets are breathtaking. I could go on all day, but I'll spare you. :) It is simply well made and well performed. I was very, very, very, impressed. 10/10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1518,joplinscat119,Fantastic version of stage production!,10,10 January 2005,"I am a huge fan of the musical and have seen it over 7 times, though I must admit I was rather uneasy about the idea of a movie, however, I was very pleasantly surpassed at the breathtaking scenery, perfect music, and erotic take on the greatest musical of all time.Emmy Rossum gives a beautiful, sexy, and powerful performance as Christine Daae, not to mention her gorgeous singing voice that grips you from the very first note. Gerard Butler plays the masked Phantom very well, bringing the role a sexy edge never grasped by Michael Crawford and all stage Phantoms after. Patrick Wilson brings some emotion to the traditionally boring Rouel through his smooth voice. the rest of the cast does a wonderful job and, especially the dancers in the Masquerade scene, it's spectacular.The feeling and vibrancy of the film is very different from the stage version, but in a good way. The scenery is done greatly in reds, golds, yellows, and oranges, much different from the blues and blacks used throughout the stage show. The color works well though, it gives it a sexier, more passionate feel.In all, I'd have to give this movie a 10/10, it left nothing to be desired...except to be able to see it again!",The Phantom of the Opera
1519,empressnyx,Great movie of the musical.,8,10 January 2005,"All in all, it was a wonderful film. It kept with the musical 95%. Most of the actors were perfect for their parts and the acting was good all the way around. They went into a bit more detail on the history of the Phantom, something I always wished they would do in the show. It has my vote to go and see it on the big screen. I will probably go see it again, and will definitely own it when it comes out on DVD. There were some things that I need to gripe about though...Down falls: The dubbing. There were some very obvious sections in the movie where I couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrible dubbing.The Phantom. His acting was good. His voice was good, but didn't really fit the genré of the show; it wasn't a ""theatrical voice."" Plus the phantom was too young. His character is supposed to be in his late 40's and our actor was definitely no more than early - mid 30's.Carlotta. What was up with her accent? I know she is supposed to be the epitome of diva/drama queen, but I couldn't tell what country she wanted to be from. Many of her lines were delivered in a very ""Valley Girl"" tone of voice. Her singing voice was perfect for the part though.",The Phantom of the Opera
1520,maroonbells3,Phantom of the Opera exceeded my expectations,10,10 January 2005,"I don't care what the critics say, this was an excellent movie. If you understand the story- then the movie brings it all to life. I think all of the actors did a fabulous job. I was moved by all of the Phantom's feelings and ended up kind of falling in love with the guy myself. Emmy did a wonderful job with her singing and acting. The chemistry during certain moments between Christine and the Phantom felt so real that it made those particular moments captivating. Despite what I have read from the critics I think Gerald Butler did an excellent job with his singing, his voice was so intoxicating...I have watched the musical 8 times in my lifetime and will buy the DVD. Beautifully done.",The Phantom of the Opera
1521,kristi_ann2003,Mixed feelings,7,10 January 2005,"When I made the decision to see this movie, I was incredibly nervous. I'm a huge fan of all things Broadway, and I was just positive that it had been butchered. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think that the film will ever be able to top the shear awesomeness of a stage show, but Phantom passed the test. Granted, Emmy could use a bit more training, and Gerard is not the best I've ever heard, it was still a moving picture. And while I've said that Emmy could use more training,to take a difficult piece like ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" and making it sound even remotely pleasing to the ear is no small feat. Kudos to Emmy in that regard. On a 5 star scale, I gave Phantom a 2.75.",The Phantom of the Opera
1522,egilbert-1,A disappointment to a music major,7,11 January 2005,"Having heard the original Broadway cast recordings multiple times since my youth and having studied music since the age of eight, The Phantom of the Opera was a bit of a let down. Emmy Rossum, young as she was when taking on the role of Christine Daae, contributed wide eyes, a gigantic smile, and rather weak and wavering vocals, albeit on the flat side. Her acting can be described as flat as well, or a simple mediocre. The part of Raol was played rather blandly, but Gaston Leroux did portray his character as a Dudley Doright anyway, so perhaps that can be excused. The Phantom's singing was horrendous, unbelievable, and incredibly forced, but I'm not sure if the actor was a singer to begin with. I did find some solace in his acting though, and the scenery and camera work were enough to entice me to see this movie again. If you care (or know much about) singing/music/acting, perhaps you should rent this when it comes out on DVD, if not, you're sure to love it. See it for the sake of seeing one of the greatest shows put on the big screen, for the costumes, for the lighting, and the scenery, but don't have high expectations for vocal work or acting.",The Phantom of the Opera
1523,shazeroon,Genius pure genius,10,28 June 2005,"Well what can I say. I love this musical, had wanted to see it for a long time and when I finally did it was amazing. The film did not disappoint. It looks and sounds amazing and the casting was spot on! This film evokes all emotions, tears, laughter, sadness.This is my favourite film of all time!!!Anyone who loves musicals should love this. I am so glad that I can now watch it whenever I please.Minnie Driver as Carlotta provides the majority of the humour. Her timing and accent are amazing and this film truly opened my eyes to her.As for the voices, Gerard Butler has a perfect voice for the Phantom. Full of emotion and bitterness. Emmy is wonderful as Christine (dare I say I prefer her to Sarah Brightman, sorry). Patrick Wilson plays a fantastic Raoul and has a lovely voice.Anyway, don't listen to me, watch it!Just don't watch is you dislike musicals. This film is not for you",The Phantom of the Opera
1524,ange_dans_lenfer,A disfigured genius turned mad by his love for a young soprano,10,11 January 2005,"My friend and I drove up to Lansing to go see this movie and it was well worth it. I have not seen the stage production, but this has inspired me to do so. I have never been so enthralled with a movie like this. When the chandelier raises and the first phrases of the famous theme blared I had chills. I think that Gerard Butler was extremely moving as the Phantom and I was shocked at his vocal talent. In my opinion deserves at least and Oscar nomination. Emmy Rossum was also very strong in the role as the influential Christine. Her voice was stunning and she held her own for being so young. I think that all lovers of the this stage production and those like me who are thinking about seeing the movie without having gone to the play will be pleasantly surprised and amazed.",The Phantom of the Opera
1525,tiggergirl22,I loved this movie!!,10,11 January 2005,"OK I realize most people are going to say that I'm to young to fully understand and appreciate this movie, but I saw it when I was 17, on stage and I fell in love with it. Read the books have a copy of the original casting Cd. and while people like to rip this movie to shreds, I loved it! I've seen it twice so far, planning on seeing it again, and I just can't get enough of this movie. Gerard is an excellent phantom, and it's unfair for people to compare him to the original. No one will ever be like our be loved Michael Crawford, Gerard did his best and lived up to even my high expectations. You really can't compare the stage play to the movie - yes this is arguable- but I don't think you can because you are are working with an entirely different way of staging and film is so different from stage. I thought Patrick Wilson was wonderful as Raoul although not what I had pictured, he still did an excellent job. And our Christine, miss Emmy Rossum, I thought she too did an admirable job.I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It made me cry actually very sad.",The Phantom of the Opera

1528,Luciusbear,Unbelievable,10,22 February 2005,"This movie is amazing, if you don't think so, then you don't deserve the culture around you. Although it doesn't follow the play it is an unbelievable movie that is well casted and beautifully done. The music is amazing and I can imagine few other actors that could be cast in the place of everyone in the movie. The minute this movie comes out to DVD I'm going to buy it, and more than likely the soundtrack will be mine soon. If you enjoy well cultured, well acted, beautiful sets and amazing music, then watch this movie. It's one of the movies that you don't want to miss. I enjoy the music from this better then from the Ontario production.",The Phantom of the Opera

I listen to it constantly at work (much to the chagrin of my boss who doesn't seem to understand ""wait..this is my favorite part""). I never saw the play so I can't comment on how close to the original it is. But I know this. Once you see this movie it sticks with you. I find myself humming a tune or thinking of a scene (especially with Gerard Butler) while driving around town. Let me say this....the scene during ""The Point of No Return"" gives me goose bumps. Of course I'm not sure if its because of the chemistry between the 2 actors or me just wishing I was the actress. This movie appeals to all ages. I have seen it with friends and family both male and female ranging in age from 12 to 57 and they all loved it. I certainly hope this movie wins some awards....it deserves it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1530,itchygoomy,Brava Brava Bravissima!!!,10,12 January 2005,"In 1989 I was fortunate to see the stage production and was speechless after living this experience. During the following years rumors flew about the production of a motion picture. Then when Evita was released I kept my eye out for Phantom, especially when the lead would be played by Antonio Banderas. Then to my surprise I caught a trailer around Christmas time. All I can say is ""Antonio who?"" What a superb job Gerard Butler did!! I have seen it twice and it hasn't even been nationally released yet. The motion picture is every bit as thrilling and awe-inspiring as the stage production. Emmy Rossum's voice is angelic and fits the character beautifully. And Minnie Driver's Carlotta was HYSTERICAL!!! If you love musicals and heartbreaking romance, then I would definitely see this movie. BRAVO Mr. Butler, Ms. Rossum and Sir Andrew. I WILL be seeing this again and again and again....",The Phantom of the Opera
1531,theatrdrk,"i thought that this was a wonderful representation of the stage production, and I think that Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice!",10,12 January 2005,"first of all, i would like to say that Andrew Loyd Webber is absolutely a genius. i was eight years old when i first saw the stage production of this show at the Kennedy center in Washington D.C. although i did not completely comprehend the overall success of this show, i was astounded by the music in this production. I have seen it several times since, and have enjoyed it thoroughly each time. When the movie previews were first released, i was not so sure about making such a wonderful show into a movie. If done however, i knew that exact precision was necessary for the movies success. well, i think that this was certainly achieved by each and every character in the movie. i would especially like to congratulate Emmy Rossum on her wonderful work done in this movie. she has an incredibly powerful yet not over-powering voice which she has incredible control over. in conclusion, i would have to saw that this was an AWESOME movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1532,MCTtenor1,Vocal Analysis,10,12 January 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is one of the most vocally amazing and demanding roles ever written for the Broadway stage. The movie sought, under the supervision of Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, the best talent, vocally, that was available for the show. Only one character in the entire cast does not do her own singing in the show, and she performs the original song written by Lloyd Webber for the credits (a talented singer, just not an opera singer). Young Emmy Rossum has an amazingly promising voice. Having just turned 18 after the production of the movie, she tackles one of the most demanding soprano roles existing outside the grand opera repertoire. Previously un-trained Gerard Butler amazed me as the Phantom. The passion in his voice more than compensates for the lack of training earlier in his life. His voice has a pleasant tone and Butler uses fabulous technique in both the vocal production and breath control, making his tenor seem effortless. As a classical tenor myself, I know how difficult his songs are, and he truly does them justice. Patrick Wilson is a Broadway star; no more need be said other than he has a rich Broadway tenor voice that would melt any woman's heart; it's easy to see why Christine falls for this ""handsome young nobleman."" The rest of the cast is equally impressive and the movie is a truly brilliant feast. Anyone who enjoys gorgeous music will enjoy this film.",The Phantom of the Opera
1533,nsync_lover55,Stage to film at it's finest,10,13 January 2005,"When I saw the previews for this movie, I could barely contain myself. I myself have performed many of the pieces from this wonderful masterpiece and was delighted to see it come to life. Though, I honestly only had a crude understanding of what the entire musical was about. After waiting almost two months to see it, my mother, grandmother and I found a not-so-local theatre playing it. When the movie started, I was immediately entranced. As the movie went on, I continued to be more drawn in and felt shivers go down my spine more than once. I don't think I've ever seen a film that captivated me more than this one. The music, the cinematography, the colors, the characters...everything...was perfect. I have cried at movies before, but I cried in a different way to this one...not only of sadness, but of genuine hurt and sympathy. It was amazing. My mom described it as ""powerful"" and I think that describes it well. I will most definitely be seeing this film again...maybe several more times before it leaves theatres. I am not one to get emotionally attached to movies very often, but this is one of the exceptions. I can't wait until I can find the soundtrack to this film. ""Masquerade"" and ""Music of the Night"" have been playing in my mind for days! I most definitely recommend this film to EVERYONE!",The Phantom of the Opera
1534,casselina,The fantastic Phantom of the Opera,10,13 January 2005,"I would just like to say that this a fantastic adaptation of the original ; and I assume this is in part due to the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber was very involved. Personally I thought Christine was fantastic. Emmy Rossum embodied the way I liked to think of Christine. Her voice was clear and youthful, and although some parts were better than others I thought her performance vocally was extremely impressive and that she was stunning. And she was only 17 while filming. Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul, had a devastating voice.He was smooth, sincere, heroic and almost clumsy when trying to save Christine.He was quite awesome, and vocally I think had the best performance. As for Gerard Butler (who is a hunk!) , he was phenomenal. At the beginning I wasn't sure if I liked his voice, but grew to love it. It wasn't because he had an accent, it was because he sang in more of a belted, almost pop-like style. However it worked well to contrast him to Raoul and in his solos. You love the Phantom.He was a phenomenal phantom, what else can i say. I loved him and liked their decisions with his character. Other small roles were given the chance to shine as well. Minnie Driver was a scene stealer and hilarious as Carlotta, while Jennifer Ellison was memorable as Meg. All in all, most changes are minor and make the movie work better. These changed make the whole plot more understandable, especially for the movie-goer who is unfamiliar with the play. The sets are beautiful,the costumes amazing and the lighting quite efficient because you don't notice it except that it aids in changing the mood. The music was beautiful. It surrounds you in the theater.Personally I thought it was the best screening of a musical I have ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is a must see in theaters, for sure. I loved it. Period. Go see it now. :)",The Phantom of the Opera
1535,tlancaster-1,Breathtaking! Heartbreaking! Addictive!,10,16 February 2005,"Gerry Butler is a sexy, commanding, seductive, mesmerizing Phantom. His voice is so strong and full of emotion, that you forgive him the few quirks (accent) that sneak in from time to time. Can you imagine the bravery required to take this project on when you've had no professional vocal training and a very heavy Scottish accent? Take it on he did - and what an amazing result! He portrays the Phantom as an angry, lonely, lost soul. Emmy Rossum was absolutely beautiful - in looks and lyrics! She was a perfect 'young girl coming of age' - the perfect role for her! Patrick Wilson was amazing. He made Raoul a little more likable that other renditions. His voice is so pure and hypnotic, he is simply an awesome actor - a Perfect Prince Charming! The supporting cast was sheer perfection - Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson - everyone! The music is addictive! Once you start listening to the soundtrack, you'll be seduced into listening to it over and over again!

I have seen the play several times and know the words to every song by heart. I was kinda worried that it would be ruined and didn't want to hold my expectations too high, but I was very impressed with viewing it. As soon as it started, I was mezmerized and forgot where I was. The music and the movie pulled me. I became every character, I was there. I liked he flashbacks and how the movie began with a photograph and ended with one. The flashback and forth reminded me of ""Titanic"". The film effects and placement of characters were beautiful. One thing about Carlotta, I feel that the actress should look a little older, and it seemed like her accent changed from French to Latin street talk -- I was a little confused on which she was suppose to be.",The Phantom of the Opera
1537,eclampitt,Sumptuous movie that all can enjoy,10,13 January 2005,"Having seen the stage production twice in NYC and twice when the national tour came to town, I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie. Our whole family, ages 13 - 47, went and were mesmerized. Emmy Rossum truly seemed like an ""ingenue"". It was interesting to see the techniques that were used to show us her perhaps somewhat naive perception of the Phantom. The movie Phantom, as portrayed by Gerard Butler, was a tortured soul who didn't know how to get along in a society that rejected him. The stage Phantom always seemed more maniacal to me, whereas here he is rejected and resentful. I enjoyed his emotional singing that gave weight to his words. Patrick Wilson did a fine job as Rauol, although I kept hoping his face would ""light up"" with love for Christine more. The only slight drawback to me is that in a movie they have to choose what to focus on for a camera angle, and sometimes I would have liked to see a particular person's reaction and they were showing something else. The downfall of movie over stage. And yet, some of the shots were outstanding, such as the rooftop scene. Loved it!",The Phantom of the Opera

I think that this movie brings the play to life like most fans of the Phantom have wanted for a long time. The movie makes you feel like you are there in the movie. I think that the cast was very well chose. Emmy Rossum played Christine Daae as good as any other women has played Christine if not better.

1539,jcbeeson,All-in-all an A,9,14 January 2005,"And the only reason I don't give it an A+? Gerard Butler and The Phantom.The *speaking* character to a new level, one the audience could get a firmer grasp on than in the stage production, but does that help or hinder? We get more back story and a little post story intermittently through the movie, and we get a more concrete vision of how The Phantom became disfigured. The problem, though, is that all that development takes away from the mystique, and the back story we *are* given led me to not feel so sorry for The Phantom. This of course led to me not being so torn a the end, which was always part of the emotional magic. Plus, Raoul is more likable, so the dilemma is even less prominent.The *singing* character left a bad taste in my mouth. There had to be a better choice than Gerard Butler. As a movie actor, he didn't have the chops. His fortissimo voice was painfully forceful, and his pianissimos were unsupported and airy - WHEN HE GOT THE VOCAL CORDS TO VIBRATE! Plus, there is the issue of his un-Phantominess. Yes, he is a good looking guy, but the makeup artist did a good job of fixing that, when you get to see the scars. The menacing full masks make him more daunting, but the iconic half mask is plain and covers the scar so that he looks like a pretty boy at a Halloween party. Both for the illusion of deformity and for the sake of setting itself apart A LITTLE BIT, they should have kept the whole mask for the entirety of the film.BUT (and a large but at that!) The entire cast besides Gerard more than made up for the opinions I had about the title character. Christine was a perfect match for Emmy Rossum, and there was a nice chemistry between her and Patrick Wilson.My only non-Phantom bone to pick: needed more people dancing in the Masquerade scene.Tear.",The Phantom of the Opera

It allows for a much deeper insight into the characters. All the cast were amazing from the scene stealing Minnie Driver to the soulful performance of Gerard Butler, he had me in tears! and I don't normally cry at movies.

I went to the movie hoping that it would stay true to the musical, which I had high hopes that it would since Mr. Lloyd Webber co-wrote the screenplay, and I was not disappointed. There are a few minor changes in the plot and the sequence of events within the storyline, but I felt that these changes only enhanced the movie and made it better.Gerard Butler does a phenomenal job as The Phantom and Emmy Rossum is amazing as Christine. She reminds me very much of Sarah Brightman with the way that she sings with what appears to be very little effort.

I'm one of the few in this country that like to be updated about the rest of the world... so I knew who Andrew Lloyd Webber was. The POTO stage musical has never come to my country so I had no idea of the plot of POTO. I just knew that it was something awesome that had brought a lot of people together. So when I entered the movie theater... I had no idea of what I was about to see... When the movie began, I thought to myself ""Oh my god... a black and white movie! Please kill me now!"". But when the chandelier rose and the colors came... I felt chills up my spine. I then knew that I was about to see something genius! The sets and costumes were stunning. The actors were BRILLIANT and could really sing (no matter what they say about Gerard Butler... I think he can really sing!!). The music made your soul leave your body and go higher. Just one thing I didn't like about the movie... La Carlotta. I mean... I think it was a little to much. She made the audience laugh so much that they later didn't pay attention to the dramatic parts of the movie! In the end I cried sooooo much! And I'm like the kind of person who never NEVER cries!! It touched me deeply! I left the theater with a sense of shock, stun, wonder, sadness, EVERYTHING at once! And I couldn't take ""The Phantom of the Opera"" song off my mind. Then a few days later I saw it a second time... It's weird how my idiot friends didn't want to see it! They are just some brain-less idiots who prefer silly comedies like ""Scary Movie"" (atention: I liked Scary Movie... but it's not the only thing I like to see... like my friends) I tried to convince them so hard... and they just said that they would rather spend that money on a new pair of down-waist jeans. When I finally convinced ONE of my friends to see the movie, I went to see it with her (for the 3rd time) . (otherwise she would have never seen it) When the movie was over she was struggling not to cry and told me that it was a beautiful movie! I LOOOOOOOOVE the movie! It is just genius! I could just see it over and over and over again!",The Phantom of the Opera
1544,greatopenings,Emotionally touching beyond belief...,10,16 January 2005,"I am a live theater person...I have enjoyed productions in L.A., New York and London. You MUST experience this on the big screen. The music and voices are heavenly, the cinematography, costumes and acting are superb. What an escape during these difficult times. It is art and culture at it's finest. This is what the big screen was created for... What touched me most was the reaction of my 13 year old daughter... Gerard Butler became the Phantom , in every way possible, believable and lovable, his performance showed a depth and wisdom way beyond his age. He touched her deeply, inspiring such overwhelming feelings of caring. Truly developing a relationship with the character. One can only hope that this movie will inspire investors and producers to give us more of the same. Of course, Christine and Raoul were devine as well, equally talented, believable and such incredible songbirds.(Oscars for their vocal coaches please.) We LOVED this movie so much. Fell in love with it really. Thank you Andrew Lloyd Webber and friends.",The Phantom of the Opera

But the movie is so mesmerizing, wonderful, unforgettable - I haven't been affected by a movie like this in a long time. The production is haunting and beautiful. The casting was perfect! I can't say enough about this movie. Gerard Butler is the perfect blend of mysterious and intriguing, with the sexy, beautiful voice to go along with it all. Emmy Rossum is the perfect ingénue and Minnie Driver is hilarious as the diva from He... The costumes, sets, cinematography, direction were awesome and I can see Academy Awards written all over this project.

I've sat through the classics such as Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof, just inspired from start to finish. Phantom has definitely topped them all- From the moment the reel began, this movie almost stopped me from breathing, I was that caught up in it. The power and magnitude of the sound behind it blew me away. It makes you feel as if you're a part of the action, being the one swooned by Gerard Butler.In my opinion, this is by far one of the best movies I've seen, atop the list with the Titanic smash and Pearl Harbor. I saw this movie 3 times, and though movie prices are skyrocketing, I plan to experience the chills at least once more.",The Phantom of the Opera
1547,akatz-1,"Joel Schumacher, Peter Jackson, and Redemption",8,16 January 2005,"Prior to the filming of The Frighteners (and even including it, in the opinion of the author), Peter Jackson was considered to be a sub-par, B-Movie director, directing works such as ""Meet the Feebles"", ""Bad Taste"", and ""Heavenly Creatures"" - all poor works with weak cinematography and ridiculous plot lines, ignoring all Elements of Drama, saving Spectacle. However, a certain conglomeration of mistakes educated Mr. Jackson in the important technical aspects of filmcraft, aspects that separate poorly executed films with good intentions (i.e. ""Meet the Feebles"") from truly inspirational and quality films. These mistakes, staging, filmographic, and literary, become necessary for directors with weak educations and lack of experience. However, an ultimate benefit comes to the director from these embarrassments; it turns them into genius filmmakers. A parallel can be drawn between Peter Jackson and Joel Schumacher, in this sense. Schumacher's ""blockbuster"" movies, most notably ""Batman & Robin"" reek of weakness, containing few truly significant moments, and, in the case of ""Batman & Robin"", have great intentions of making profound statements about masculinity that are dismissed because of poor execution. This in mind, the author believes that ""Phantom of the Opera"" should be considered to be Schumacher's ""Frighteners"". Though ""Phantom"" has acting weaknesses and a noticeably low-voiced Phantom, the cinematography and design are superb. Costume design and visual design coordinates well to show the duality of the Phantom and Raoul. In addition, the sound design inspires in one's mind an empty opera house, or cave where there are lurking, death-obsessed spirits. Though some would credit the actual sound and costume and visual designers for this beauty, the coordination of those arts into a single, coherent structure is the responsibility of the director, and, through this responsibility, Joel Schumacher performs beautifully.",The Phantom of the Opera

1549,jennfsc,Still singing the songs...,10,16 January 2005,"I just saw this movie tonight and I still have the songs playing in my head. I have seen Phantom in New York at the Majestic Theatre and also in Tampa just recently. As I don't want to compare the stage musical to the screen musical, as you can do more in a movie than on a stage, I think it was absolutely wonderful! I have been listening to the music from this show for many years and I always forget how captivating it truly is. I loved that they updated the songs with the full orchestra and there were times when the characters were singing that you wanted them to take you with them. I thought Butler was almost too handsome to be the Phantom. He did an outstanding job and contrary to what I've read on a few other reviews, I think his lower voice was perfect for the role. I'm sorry, but when you think of scary people, you could imagine them having a deep voice. Emmy Rossum was a beautiful Christine and as I know many thought she was too young to assume this role, I think she was perfect. Christine is really supposed to be young and emotional anyway, and she did it very well. I'm happy they got away from the nasally, airy sound of Sarah Brightman. Shocking how a 17-year-old with no vocal training can have more substance in her voice than a mature woman for which the role of Christine was probably written. Patrick Wilson's voice was mesmerizing and really gave the role of Raoul some ""umph"". Minnie Driver as Carlotta was a bit surprising because just sitting down thinking of a casting list for this musical, I would have never in my wildest dreams have thought of her as the diva. I was very happy to hear that she decided not to do her own singing voice and actually gave trained vocalists some credit by saying that opera is not something you can just pick up and learn how to do in a few months. As a vocal major in college, I very much appreciated her giving classical singers some credit there. I thought Jennifer Ellison, who played Meg, was a great actress, but her singing voice sounded like one of my elementary students. I thought she was supposed to be about 20, not 8. Natasha Richardson was wonderful as the Madame Giry and I loved that accent! I have read in a few other reviews about her being the only actress that used a french accent, and I kind of wondered about that myself. I found myself feeling very sorry for the Phantom at the end and can actually admit that I cried when Christine gave him the ring back. I know she had to have loved him in a special sort of way. I mean, he had been with her since she first came to the opera house. I think her love for him was more like how a daughter loves her father. I mean, if you really thinking about it...Madame Giry and the Phantom were probably about the same age, according to the movie since she helped him escape from the traveling freak show and Meg, who is probably about the same age as Christine, is Madame Giry's daughter. So, that would make the Phantom about 20 years older than Christine. Anyway, I know how it ends since I have seen it before, but I can't help myself thinking that maybe they'll change it and she'll end up with the Phantom. Oh, well. It was a absolutely superb performance and I will definitely be going again to see it!",The Phantom of the Opera
1550,emrtravel2003,Brava!,9,16 January 2005,"Wonderfully done film version of the Broadway musical. I've seen the musical in NYC several times, read the book and seen this film several times. The film corresponds with the musical except in only a few instances and both the musical and film versions correspond faithfully to the book, with only slight differences, a few additional characters and the timing of the chandelier incident. In every instance where I've seen the film in several venues, audiences have packed the theatre and applauded or sat quietly afterward.Leroux always meant for his Phantom of the Opera to be a rewrite of the Beauty and the Beast tale. It was not meant to be a horror story but a touching tale of love and redemption.Another writer says the only thing he found wanting was that there were a few times when the ""illusion"" of the actors singing was broken. No illusion! Andrew Lloyd Webber only agreed to the film version if the actors could sing their own parts. A couple of times the editing is off slightly, but the actors are all singing their own parts and that is obvious if you watch closely.Loved it. Everyone I know who's seen it has loved it. Ignore the critics and go to see this film.",The Phantom of the Opera
1551,taloniusrs,A fresh take on a classic masterpiece,10,16 January 2005,"This is an outstanding movie. It's great that today's youth is being given the opportunity to enjoy Andrew Lloyd Weber's masterpiece Phantom of the Opera. I have never seen the original Broadway production but I did see the movie with someone who did. She noted that many parts were added and that songs were changed... but not necessarily in a bad way. Just be sure that if you have seen and/or heard the original Phantom of the Opera that you set aside what you remember from it and approach this film with a fresh mind set. Clearly the singers are different but different isn't bad. The Phantom's voice is pleasantly deep without any of that piercing falsetto from the original and Christine's character is superb in both her acting and singing. It truly is a marvelous work and I would definitely see it a third time (yes, I've seen it twice already at nearly $9 a pop!) Trust me, you'll love this rendition of The Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
1552,gary-501,Excellent transition from stage to film,10,17 January 2005,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point.I have seen the stage production with my partner 3 times (San Francisco, San Diego and last year (2004) in Salt Lake City). He has seen the stage production many more times that me.So, with that history, we went to the see big screen version tonight having no idea what to expect. I hadn't read any reviews previously. All I can say is that it is excellent. The movie did everything to me (shivers, tears etc) that the live version has done and then some. I think the casting was perfect, the sets and camera work superb, and Schumachers' skill in taking advantage of using film to portray what Webber couldn't do on stage was just wonderful. It filled in so many areas left to the imagination. Although I had a pretty clear understanding of the story (albeit rather simple), you leave the movie theater with no doubt in your mind about what's going on.Looking forward to seeing it again on the big screen and owning the DVD.10/10",The Phantom of the Opera

The singing throughout the movie was OK. Minnie Driver's part was just OK. It could have been played by most anyone. I did wonder if Minnie did her own singing...if she did, that part of her performance was impressive. This is the first time I have seen the Phantom. Having no idea what to expect, I did end up enjoying it and would recommend it. They did a good job making people feel empathy for the Phantom. The people I went to see the movie with enjoyed it as well. Antonio as The Phantom would have been good...however, I am glad the film wasn't stacked with big names just to get attention like say Oceans Eleven.",The Phantom of the Opera
1554,newmold,10 stars from us!,10,18 January 2005,"Just saw Phantom of the Opera this weekend and have to say we loved it! My wife wants to go again with our grown daughters and I can't wait for the DVD. It's as good as the play (we've seen the play twice) and better in some respects as it explains some of scenes that needed some clarification. The acting was terrific including Gerard Butler who played the Phantom. As much as we like Michael Crawford, I'm not so sure Michael could have played the Phantom in this movie version because his age today would not have worked.We both enjoyed Minnie Driver in her role, she is such a versatile actress! We couldn't wait to get home and watch her again in one of our favorite movies, ""Return to me"". I read today that the beautiful Emmy Rossom who played Christine is only 18, what a talent!The music is so good from the play it would have been hard to improve upon but they did. The photography was beautifully shot and the old Opera House was a masterpiece in detail that almost distracts from the story if you let it. The costumes and choreography are as good as any from years gone by. The scene when Christine is first given her chance to replace Carlotta just takes your breath away. 10 Stars from us. It's everything that makes going to the movies enjoyable, and that's entertainment! Considering what else is being offered in the theaters today, this is by far the best thing going and judging by the large size of a Saturday afternoon audience, I'm not alone in this opinion.",The Phantom of the Opera
1555,sean_coldplay,An aesthetic masterpiece,10,17 January 2005,"Being a fan of the original, I was a bit speculative of going to see it on the big screen. In my past experience of seeing stage to screen adaptations, the result has either been fantastic (as in this, and in Chicago), or unnecessary, as in Hello Dolly, or even (shock horror) The Sound of Music, the latter of which was, while beautifully set, merely only a success based upon the current success of the musical at the time. It was, in a word, a cult, and still remains.Luckily though, this result was a success. The theatre was mind blowing in its beauty and aesthetics, and was quite similar in its look to the grand French theatres of the age. However, a good looking film is not enough in itself to become a great film.It was also, thankfully terrificly cast, and cast with a group of relatively new actors. While we had some experience with the extremely charismatic Minnie Driver, who easily, despite her small part had fantastic screen presence, and accurately depicted the part of Carlotta, who indisputably is the original Diva.Experience was also had with Simon Callow, a fantastic British actor who never fails to impress. Although sadly, we did not really get enough of his acting ability in his rather unexciting role.New to the big screen, however, was the star, Emily Rossum. She was an accurate depiction of the virgin star who is naive enough to succumb to the evil phantom's spell.Which leads on to the real star of the show. Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom was incredible. He was able to contrast the Phantom's two sided personality, that of the overly-protective and obsessed megalomaniac, and that of the caring, and heartbroken lamb. While feeling bitter hate for the character, you could not help but feel for him and this would have been Lloyd Webber's main intention in originally writing the script.The main reason that this gets only an 8, however, is simply because, despite its splendour, this really is a stage production, and does not have the atmosphere and excitement of the original show. While the performances are excellent, and it looks terrific, it misses this atmosphere, and those that have enjoyed the picture should really go down the West End to see exactly what I mean.",The Phantom of the Opera
1556,myname-43,"Awesome, awesome movie",10,17 January 2005,"This movie totally knocked my socks off. I had never seen the stage production, and wasn't familiar with the plot or anything. But my friend saw it and he was just like, ""You HAVE to see this movie."" And he was right - as soon as we left the theatre, we were both plotting ways to get the rest of our friends to come. (Btw, he saw it five times in a week - slightly obsessed.) If you haven't seen it yet, turn off your computer right now and go. I mean it.I agree vehemently with all the wonderful things everyone's already said about Phantom, and I'm not going to bother repeating them all again now. But there's one thing - everyone keeps saying Gerard Butler can't sing. I disagree. Not to put anyone down, but I heard the Michael Crawford version of Music of the Night yesterday, and I liked Butler's rendition much better. His voice is powerful and deep and dark and sexy and altogether, I thought, more appropriate for the character. And he sings with such INTENSITY and FEELING. True, he is pushing it on some of the really high notes, but he more than makes up for it the other 99% of the time. And sometimes it's better that way - for example, in the All I Ask of You reprise, he's all weak and shaky, but he's crying, so it makes it totally authentic. The Phantom is such a complex character, with such emotional depth, and Butler gets all of that across. He said on TV that he was limited in the acting because of the mask, so he had to convey everything through his voice. He succeeds. Phenomenally.",The Phantom of the Opera
1557,limabean2010,This is the best movie ever,10,23 January 2005,"This is a wonderful movie!!! I saw the play a few years ago and the story is more detailed in the movie, also the characters fit better. I would suggest if you plan to go see the play and the movie, watch the play first then watch the movie because in the movie there is more detail and you won't enjoy the play's beauty as much because it lacks the detail that the movie has, not to take away from the play though. Christine is wonderful and has a very sweet voice in the movie and in the play she has a stronger voice. The phantom, I think, has too much of an opratic voice in the play. In the movie he has a very manly voice. When you see him without his mask at first it is hideous! But a you stare at him you see the beauty and handsomeness of the phantom! If you aren't touched by the story you have no heart. I think it is the best movie in the theaters and on video. I am going to buy it the second it comes out!

I have seen Phantom on Broadway numerous times, saw the movie a couple of times and never tire of its magnificent score. As far as the cast, all I could say is I think Sarah Brightman has the most beautiful voice on the planet and is my favorite diva yet think that Emmy Rossum was terrific.

No movie has ever made me nauseous, but I had to look away from this. Seriously, the Blair Witch Project had better shots. It's like the strapped a camera to a monkey, lit the monkey on fire and kicked him down a stairwell. Also there are plot holes you could fly the moon through. I'm willing to let those go for the sake of the story, but if this was not based on a famous musical, it would never have seen the light of day.I guess it's worth a rent if you're a fan, but it's not worth ticket price.",The Phantom of the Opera

1563,buck-77,Fans of Broadway on Film will LOVE this!,7,18 January 2005,"Audiences compiling collections of favorite plays on film to retain some of the great theatre experiences in ""West Side Story"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"", and ""Chicago"" will now have ""PHANTOM"" at last! But unless you have a 72"" plasma screen, see it in a movie theater!!I dismissed the film critics of this film because, ironically, they all noted the same criticisms lauded by theatre critics when the play first debuted.....and then continued for over a decade and still continues, solidifying the belief that what people don't like in the play will not be improved in the movie, and what people loved will be enhanced, with the obvious absence of the energy a live performance presents.While I am one of those people that LIKE ""Stage Adaptations"" (it should be a whole designation in itself, like ""Documentary"" and ""Comedy""), I have never been a huge fan of the play,""Phantom."" Accordingly, I loved the film, not crazy about the story, but straddling the fence, I found this an enjoyable movie that had some slow parts.Many films attempt the feat of adapting plays-Broadway Musical Plays- for the screen, but only a few have effectively captured the essence of the PLAY, which is in itself defeatist to movies...generally. Why put ""Oklahoma"" on a stylized set when the whole glorious, open state is there to be filmed? So while having characters' conversations suddenly break out in song for no good reason in the play is great, doing so in a film narrative is sometimes difficult for audiences, exceptions given to most Disney movies.Films are not to blame, for they are a visual medium that are expected to expand through the obvious limitations of a live stage set with a limited budget. And don't blame the play...it was written to deliver a wonderful entertainment on a live stage set with a limited budget. So that leaves the audience.If you like Broadway musicals, this is a great film that retains the play's theatrical roots, and gloriously expounds on the famous over-the-top sets and effects that helped revive live theatre. Visually this movie is a stunner. You have to admire the scenes dressed with a stylized set worthy of an Art Direction Academy Award, and Schumacher's flamboyant style which does them justice! The lighting, sound, and visual effects all give the film-goer a great night at the theatre.Unfortunately, if you do NOT like Broadway musicals, the movie also retains the melodramatic acting, repetitive score and length that also is the nature of the play.Minnie Driver is wonderfully comedic if you understand what she's saying, especially in the ""Prima Dona"" number. And Rossum is a surprising singing talent, at least to those who only know her as a dead girl (Mystic River), and as a frigid damsel-in-distress (Day After Tomorrow), like myself. Regardless of this film, her performance will catapult her...at the very least onto the New York stage.No one will be frightened from this film, although some effectively eerie scenes remind us the Phantom is SUPPOPSED to be a scary story. But, again, this is foremost MUSICAL THEATRE, and thus a love story, so the mask just accents the chiseled features of the most handsome Phantom who must have found the world's best tailor somewhere in the Parisian sewer system.This is one of those wonderful films for theatre fans who want to gift wrap their evening at a live performance up and watch it anytime. I will put the DVD right between ""How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" and ""The King and I.""Now, if ""The Producers"" can accomplish something similar next year.....",The Phantom of the Opera

The only flaw I can find in the entire film is the manner in which the altered the ending. The movie's ending, I think, lacked some of the emotional power that was so essential to success of the musical. But taking a perfect ending and replacing it with what is still an outstanding ending doesn't make this a flop, it just makes it a 9 instead of a 10 in my book.

I loved both performances. I bought the sound track and wore it out. The music is hauntingly beautiful and never ceases to thrill me and send shivers all through me. I new I was going to like the film version simply because of Andrew Loyd Webber's music. I had no idea that I would fall in love with it. I am mesmerized by it. I can not say enough about this film. I have seen it 5 times and plan to see it many more. My friends think I am crazy, but I say that it is no different than listening to your favorite CD over and over again. Well with the exception of having the pleasure of seeing the characters of this love story come to life before your eyes. The performances were excellent, the singing wonderful, and the cast was perfect. The scenes between Christine and the Phantom were powerful,emotional and filled with a sensuous tension that left me breathless. Christine was sweet and beautiful and the way she became mesmerized by the phantom was captivating. The Phantom was beyond handsome. His strong voice, his emotional eyes and his exquisite body language had me melting in my seat. Raul's voice was beautiful and he was dashing and wonderful. The end scenes were so powerful and filled with such believable emotion that tears just streamed down my face. I enjoy it more each time I see it. In order to enjoy this movie you need to willing to become emotionally involved with the characters. You can't just sit back and wait to be entertained. You need to feel what they are feeling and listen carefully to every word they sing. If you truly understand the story and are romantic at heart you should enjoy this movie. Bravo to all the cast and crew.",The Phantom of the Opera
1568,esperanza-3,disappointing,6,16 April 2005,"I went into the phantom with fairly high expectations. All of my friends who had seen it, save one, raved about it. I should have listened to the one (who is one of the most talented and critical musicians I know). Gerard Butler played a pop star phantom and was a poor choice. His range was not sufficient nor his voice powerful enough to adequately portray this character. He looked like he was working the whole time and every time he sang I just wanted him to stop. Emmy Rossum was beautiful on screen and for the most part beautiful vocally. Think of Me was very disappointing, though. Her high notes lacked support and body (she didn't open her mouth) and she was just under the pitch. Her performance improved (thankfully) as the movie continued. The man portraying Raoul had a gorgeous voice. But he was American. What the world? That was my only problem with him. =]Minnie Driver was fabulous but I was disappointed that she didn't actually sing. The rest of the cast was pretty fabulous too. The set and costumes were breath-takingly beautiful. This movie could have been absolutely amazing if they had just cast a phantom who could sing the part, made Rossum support her high notes and gave Raoul an accent. Oh yeah, and if they fixed the dubbing so the words always matched their mouths. The moral of the story is this: if you are not critical of vocal music ever, go see this movie. Heck, pay money to go see this movie, because you will love it. You will sit back in your seat, sigh and say ""That... was amazing."" But, if you know music and critique every performance you have ever sat through, do not pay money for this. By all means, watch it if you are so inclined but do it for free, because you will want that money back in your pocket by the end and you will want Gerard Butler to give it to you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1569,paking,Absolutely breathtaking,10,19 January 2005,"This movie was a true feast for the senses!! The Phantom is so hot! The music invokes such emotion. Emily Rossum is absolutely gorgeous. She was the perfect choice to follow Sarah Brightman in this role. The costumes were fabulous and Minnie Driver portrayed the perfect Diva. Did I mention that the Phantom was too hot!! If I was Christine, I would have chosen him over Raoul definitely! Don't get me wrong Raoul was very good looking himself but lacked the pure animal magnetism of the Phantom.When the movie ended no one in the theater (and it was sold out) moved. Everyone stayed until the credits were run.This movie is a must see.",The Phantom of the Opera
1570,PatMcCraw,"Great Movie--even boyfriends, husbands like it",10,19 January 2005,"I had to drag my husband to Phantom and he grumbled the whole way. At the end, he was glad he went. The movie is extremely well filmed and directed. Of course, the costumes and songs made the whole thing. The movie poses the question what is beauty and what is ugly and perhaps do all people contain elements of both in their personalities and actions. What I particularly liked about the movie was variety of talent exhibited by all of the singer. Andrew Lloyd Webber used a full symphony orchestra to back up the singers and this attention to detail infuses the movie with a richness and depth not found in any other type of movie today. It's great to hear a real orchestra as opposed to electronic-generated background noise.",The Phantom of the Opera
1571,agurketid,Stunnig...,9,20 January 2005,"I didn't thought I would like the movie, when I went to the cinema to see it with my girlfriend (she suggested that we should see it, and I just said yes).The first twenty minutes I was thinking: this is going to be a very long, hard time sitting in here. But as the movie played, It was getting better and better. Suddenly the music starts... It was surprisingly good - VERY good. From uninteresting it has gone to one of the best movies, I've ever seen. You really can't compare it to other movies like LOTR, or Band of Brothers (which are also among my favorites). This movie is special in it's own way, I guess you know what I mean.This film sure is worth the money and the time. The music is just that good. Maybe the story is too classic - I don't know... All around a VERY good movie.My vote: 9/10",The Phantom of the Opera
1572,dmruszczyk-1,Man of a Thousand Faces,10,20 January 2005,"It is only fitting that Gerard Butler don the mantle of Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera. Butler is an excellent actor who looks and acts different in every film he has ever been in. From Dracula 2000, to Attila the Hun, to Reign of Fire, to Timeline, to Lara Croft 2. If you did not know he was in the film, you would not recognize him. Butler is truly, a man of a thousand faces!There is, however, one thing that can still identify him, and that is his sexiness !!!!(Even in person when he is no longer the brooding film character, but a laughing, joking regular guy.)Though only a rock singer, Butler was cast as the Phantom over Michael Crawford, Antonio Banderas, and Hugh Jackman, because of his persona. Gerard Butler's rugged handsomeness, and extreme sensuality just jumps off the screen. He has that quality that transcends the flimsy medium of film, and engages the viewer, and makes the women in the audience swoon.See the film, and you will know what I mean.",The Phantom of the Opera
1573,ashleyfarrier,No words can explain how awesome it truly is!,10,20 January 2005,Absolute amazing! Down to the last stitch sown on the costumes. I have seen it twice now and plan on a third time. The colors and dramatic production puts this movie at number one! The music and octaves are amazing. I loved every second of it and there are few movies that move me the way this one did. If you have not seen it you should every scene is played so precise and there is absolutely nothing that I can even think of the would not give this movie a ten. As a musician my self I just can not stop thinking of some of the notes and vibrato they use. simply amazing. I would rate this they greatest movie ever. I have seen many Boardway production and this tops them all.,The Phantom of the Opera

And in my mind, all the expectations have been exceeded. I think that this movie perfectly displays the passionate and sensual love that characterizes the dark mysterious Phantom, and the inexorable pull that Christine feels when she encounters him. In the movie, you get to see more of the Phantom's sensitive side and you feel pity for him, whereas, in the play he was shown as more of a murdering psychopath. The movie, if anything, gave more depth and insight into a great story. So in the words of Raoul, ""Bravo!""If you liked the movie, then I recommend that you see the play also. It is a totally different experience, and having seen it makes me appreciate how hard it was to make a movie out of one of the most beloved plays of all time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1575,roythehobbs,Enjoyment,10,20 January 2005,"the movie is a bit long and I am not fond of dialogue that is sung but that said, it is a magnificent feast for the eyes and ears and though I am a fan of M Crawford and Brightman, the leads are superb singers and actors and even those who opposed the initial casting will come away moved by the performances and the ever brilliant music. Minnie Driver does an excellent job on the closing credit song too. One almost wishes the Phantom well, despite his madness. The supporting cast has familiar faces that we are not used to seeing in song but they handle it well. The sets are superb and capture the flavor of fin de siecle Paris, there are times when one can tell a background is painted, but they are painted intensely and only add to the atmosphere.",The Phantom of the Opera
1576,treborim,"Just Saw ""Phantom""",10,21 January 2005,"I had the opportunity to see ""Phantom"" last night, and considering I have been waiting over 15 years for it to come to the screen, I absolutely loved it. There was, however, one thing I thought should have been better: the character of the Phantom. I expected him to be much older; not ""old"", but just ""older"". That, and I felt that the actor's voice was a bit too ""rock n' roll"" at times. Otherwise, an awesome movie.BTW...how old is Christine supposed to be? Watching the movie I noted that the setting is 1919, with the majority of the film as a flashback to 1870. At the end, on her tombstone, it states that she died in 1917. If she was, say 20 years old (in 1870), that would make her roughly 68 at her death (1917); however, Raoul looked MUCH older than that! So what the deal? Feel free to respond back personally, as not to waste other's time... Thanks!",The Phantom of the Opera
1577,matt-knott-1,Truly Fantastic,10,21 January 2005,"I saw this movie luckily before seeing all the terrible press reviews for it! And I'm glad I did because none of them are true, this move is one of the best I have seen in a long time and perfectly transfers the show to the cinema as well as adding the silver screen flare not achievable in the theatre.The music is fantastic and the screenplay does the original justice. Even brookie babe Jennifer Ellison puts in a good performance (and unnerving English accent). If you like the show go and see this film, if you liked Moulin Rouge (which is the only other musical film I can think of) go and see it. A truly unique film which hopefully will stay that way, hopefully they won't do Les Miserables",The Phantom of the Opera
1578,kjana-2,Great movie,10,21 January 2005,"I would say this is one of the BIG stories (and one of the evergreens -i can imagine there will be a movie on the phantom dated 2060). and also i am pretty sure that it is something that anyone can relate to. Not that everybody lives a life full of art and excitement like the characters of this piece. But - deciding between a lover that is an ugly genius and someone rich but boring is pretty common i think. ALso the fight between an obvious outsider and a ""nice"" chap is quite an everyday thing. Also the scenes were shot i a breathtaking manner: i am usually making cynical comments about movies but this was just too good a work to say no.",The Phantom of the Opera
1579,hmero,It is Awesome,10,21 January 2005,This movie is absolutely my favorite movie of all time... I have seen the Broadway performance and i think that they are almost the same(quality wise). I think that Gerard Butler is the perfect person to play the phantom. Just think... Andrew Lloyd Webber hand picked him. Himself... If he didn't like the way that Gerard B.(the phantom) was singing don't you think that he would have done something else. Well thats all i have to say I give it a ten Go and see it It is awesome. Emmy Rossum who plays Christine has the most melodious voice i have ever heard. Her facial expressions are so entrancing. Minnie DRiver who plays Carlotta is so good at playing the worst opera singer in history!!!!,The Phantom of the Opera
1580,cutie_trumpeter_54,Awesome movie!,10,21 January 2005,"I had gone to see the actual Phantom of the Opera live when it was playing in my town. I was amazed and completely awed by the real thing...So when i heard there would be a movie coming out, I was sort of skeptical, wondering if it would be as excellent as it was on stage. I thought for sure that the movie would contain much more dialog than I would like, and that it wouldn't be at all like the play. Well, when i saw the movie, I was proved wrong. It is so amazing and layed out so well, that it was almost BETTER than the play itself. The songs in the movie are just as good in the movie as they are in the play, and they occur just as much, if more. The actors are brilliant singers and they play their roles perfectly. In the movie, much more is also explained. you can do soo much more on screen than you can in a play, and this aspect of the movie I think is what made it almost as good as the live play. The music is also phenomenal and I was blown away by the feeling it could portray. If you have NOT seen this movie, you must. It is such a compelling story of love, that it left me in tears at some points. This is a must see, nothing more to say. Excellent, brilliant, and awe filled. please go see it!",The Phantom of the Opera
1581,lfty42,"In a word, dazzling!",10,23 January 2005,"This film is simply magnificent. For all those who worry that the movie will do disservice to the stage production, stop fretting. The film follows the live production very closely; having seen Phantom on stage twice, I know. Also, all of the actors do a fine job--yes, even Gerard Butler. Emmy Rossum's voice may not be as mature as Sara Brightman's, but it is still clear and pure. I was very impressed with the first half of the film, but I was anxiously waiting for ""Masquerade"" which opens the second act; I knew if the director Schumacher could pull this off, he had hit the mark. The production number was absolutely marvelously done! Finally, at the conclusion everyone in the audience applauded--they were so moved and didn't know what else to do with that emotion. So, they applauded, even though it was a film and not a live performance.",The Phantom of the Opera
1582,countolaf13-1,I'm pretty impressed considering that I'm only thirteen.,10,21 January 2005,"I saw the film and immediately I can say that I loved it. I appreciated the fact that it was not opera but just opera-ish. The music was entirely beautiful. Since I have not seen the stage version which I'm sure is fantastic I have had a fresh outlook on the story. The only thing that vexes me is that it didn't explain the gap between 1870 to 1919 it just went to the fact that Christine was dead and that she wanted the monkey music-box. But in any case, this film excites me to see the play and to read the original book. Gerard Butler {the Phantom} was phenomenal. His voice and character distantly reminded me of Jack Skeleton, the character from The Nightmare Before Christmas.",The Phantom of the Opera
1583,thenewgirl14,Actors,8,22 January 2005,"I went and saw it last night, not being fortunate enough to be in one of the ""select cities"" in which it opened in December. I have to say that the costumes especially, along with the sets were really quite amazing but considering the amount of money that was spent on them, why shouldn't they be? I was skeptical of Emmy Rossum as Christine even though I knew she knows how to sing...but she won me over because she is just so innocent, she fit the part well. Minnie Driver was excellent as la Carlotta, Patrick Wilson was a decent Raoul, nothing outstanding really about him...Gerard Butler as the Phantom struck me as an odd choice, but he was really quite convincing even if his voice wasn't as fabulous as it should have been. Overall the movie gave good credit to the book and especially the musical, but they did have help from Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, so it isn't surprising.",The Phantom of the Opera

It is the best movie I have ever seen and doubt I will see another one like this ever. I have seen the play and thought the movie would not compare but boy was I mistaken. This movie is perfect, absolutely perfect. Ladies, bring your tissues and men as well. There was a macho man next to me and even he was crying! The performances were superb, the scenery was incredible, the music, well, sheer genius, and that Gerard Butler, well, you could just feel his pain. I loved every single thing about this movie, it was sheer perfection. If you never see a movie in your life again, see this one!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1585,thebladethatwasbroken,POTO is gorgeous......go see it!!,10,22 January 2005,"When The Phantom of the Opera first came out, all I heard about it was almost all negative feedback from the critics, and it put me off. I had no desire to see it, until my friends dragged me to a theater. Now that I've seen it myself, I wonder if the critics and I saw the same movie. When it comes to The Phantom of the Opera, I admit I am a newbie, never having seen any of the plays or previous movies. When I saw this movie, I was blown away. The first thing that grabs your attention is the visuals. Right from the beginning, you are drawn into the story with the gorgeous operahouse- a piece of art itself. Joel Schumacher makes sure that your eyes get plenty more visual candy throughout the movie as you go from the elaborate costumes to the Phantom's lair, to the various nooks and crannies of the operahouse. Then, the actors. They did a phenomial job in conveying the emotion that their characters felt. Emmy Rossum is a beautiful Christine with a beautiful voice to match. She is wonderful in her interactions with the other characters. Patrick Wilson as Rauol was good, he played his role as well as he could, seeing that his character is not very deep. But he does have a lovely voice. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is amazing. Some mention that his voice isn't as good as former Phantoms, but I feel that he brings his acting to his singing. His voice is very Phantom-like, and you can feel the anger, compassion, or love flowing through it. His Phantom is not as evil as before, so you can sympathize with him more, plus he is also more handsome than previous Phantoms, and as a girl, I really have no problem with that. ;) The supporting cast is fantastic and really brings the movie together. So overall, I loved it and highly recommend it to you. My advice- Unless you dislike musicals, ignore the critics and go see it for yourself, especially on big screen where you can get a sense of the majesty of this film. That's all I ask of you.....",The Phantom of the Opera

It really is the best movie, let alone musical, I have ever seen. I have never seen previous Phantom of the Opera movies or shows considering I am only 14, but I now have a sudden spark of enthusiasm to see all of the previous installments.

1587,dragoncommandr,The Phantom of The Opera,10,9 April 2005,"Since I saw the Phantom of the Opera as a boy in my city's performing arts center, I couldn't get enough of it. I own five different copies of the soundtrack and had been dying a little bit each day that the performance did not exist in a format that I could watch anytime I wanted. When I checked the IMDb last November and discovered that finally my greatest desire would soon become reality I cried.Still I was uneasy. I have seen movie versions of musicals and famous plays, and though most have been very good, some were absolutely horrible. So sitting down in the theater I was very anxious that it would be a disappointment.What happened however was that when the lights on the 'stage' came up I burst applause. It was everything that I dreamed it would be. The only downfall that I saw was with Emma Rossum. She is absolutely gorgeous, her singing superb. Her lip syncing, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It was plain every time that she sang that she was lip syncing, and badly. She simple didn't use her body while she was doing it.Otherwise this movie is a show of spectacle and enormous musical numbers. It truly is Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best and grandest. A 10 for sure!",The Phantom of the Opera
1588,tishlatrini,"I liked the fact that it was so full of subtle details and yet managed to be blatantly obvious. ""The Phantom of the Opera is here...""",8,22 January 2005,"Perhaps my biggest beef with this film was the voice of the main actress. She has a fantastic voice, but it was not designed to sing the range that was required of her. Besides that, the voices were beautiful. Also, I had an argument over the nationality of Carlotta, who is Spanish according to the book, but is Italian in the film. I suppose that doesn't matter, though. This film has the talent of putting very subtle hints throughout the movie that it would behoove the attentive observer to watch for. Yet at the same time, it contains theme music announcing the arrival of the actors. It was well put together. In all, I liked this movie and highly recommend it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1589,jcatali,Doesn't measure up,3,22 January 2005,"Why did Andrew Lloyd Webber ruin his masterpiece? Several selections were omitted and key events changed (the chandelier no longer falls at the end of Act I). Several of the lines are now spoken instead of sung (this gets really corny) and some of the costumes are changed i.e. the Phantom's costume during the masquerade scene. All in all the cast was dreadful. The Phantom was one of the worst I ever heard and Raul was more of a whinny child than a hero, he had no power in his voice or commanding stage presence. Christine was passable and gave an excellent rendition of ""Wishing You Were Here Again."" Actually the best cast was Minnie Driver as Carlotta here attitude had ""Prima Donna"" written all over it. And lastly what was up with the midget? See the stage performance and skip this one I was hoping that this would have been a dry run and then they would actually shoot a movie version that is truer to the stage version than this piece of garbage.",The Phantom of the Opera

I'm like many who have seen the film and rooted for the Phantom.. he captured my heart. I have the images of the movie embedded in my mind and I find myself humming the music hours after the movie ended. I will definitely recommend this movie to all my friends and will buy the DVD and soundtrack.

1591,GRACIELAD973,Gerard Butler and the movie deserves to win the Oscar..,10,23 January 2005,"Almost everybody enjoys a love story where there is a happy ending or not. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (Schumacher's version)is a beautiful but heartbreaking love story that is more based on the relationship with the Phantom and Christine. The film is refreshing, tasteful, and romantic because of the ""no physical sex"" among the characters. Instead the film does erotically lead us to the imagination especially between the Phantom and Christine. Remember, this a film version not a stage play. So please don't compare Gerard with Michael Crawford. Mr. Butler is the Phantom in this film.It's about time the movie calls for a vigorously handsome, breathtaking, and a mesmerizing phantom like Gerard Butler to shine on the screen rather than a monstrous, terrifying creature from the original version. He is the right age to play the role and old enough to be the father-figure type for Christine (Emma). I agree that Gerard's performance calls for more acting than singing. For a talented actor who never took any vocal lessons to me is a natural-gifted singer. Does he deserve to win an Oscar? Absolutely!!! Gerard, if you are reading this, I hope you sing live at the Oscar and give the audience the greatest performance of a lifetime. Good Luck!",The Phantom of the Opera

The movie has such depth and rich details, making it is worthy of spending the time and money to see it five times. Please spare me any more negative comments about Gerard Butler's performance! I have seen the play in New York and in a regional theater. Of all performances I have seen, Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom is the finest, most sensitive, and most provocative. His singing is full of emotion, making his character believable and powerful. I would like to see Gerard Butler get some recognition for his performance, because he lifts the character of the Phantom far beyond what it has been in the past. He was perfect for the role, and his acting and singing should be recognized as one of the best performances on the screen this year! Emmy would not have been as great as she was without the performance provided by Gerard Butler. I want to thank Gerard Butler for taking me out of the everyday details of living into a world of ""music of the night.""

I was completely blown away by this film. The costuming was nothing short of breathtaking and the scenery was mesmerizing. Gerard Butler's performance was absolute genius and I thought his vocals were haunting and soaring. Emmy Rossum looked like an Angel and what a voice from such a petite young lady. Patrick Wilson was dashing and commanded attention. He captivated me in ""That's All I Ask of You"" Minnie Driver was such a diva as La Carlotta. I can honestly say this is quite possibly the best film I have ever watched. The intoxicating music and the incredible chemistry between Christine and The Phantom left me speechless.

Emmy Rossum is, well, just captivating in this performance and her singing is beautiful. Gerard Butler is a different phantom; not as strong of a singer but actually adding some believability to the role. He was a bit inconsistent, moving at times but maybe a bit flat others. Minnie Driver was excellent as was most of the rest of the cast. This was a great job in capturing the essence of the play.

The scenes were staged well, actors dressed appropriately for their time, and the scenery was beautiful. The parts were well-played, and the singing was phenomenal. I found the beginning of the movie to be interesting in the way they slowly brought color to the chandelier. It was extremely creative. The only part I found to be unnecessary was at the point where Christine is walking through the cemetery towards her father's grave. It takes quite a bit of time for her to get there, and you keep wondering which one is his and when they're going to reach it. Also, the grave was far too large for a man who died a poor violinist. However, it was an excellent portrayal of the original story. Overall, I would give it a 2 thumbs up and rate it as a must-see movie if you haven't already.",The Phantom of the Opera
1598,imik28,A true horror of a movie....,2,23 January 2005,"All right. The costumes were good. For the most part.That's the only nice thing I can say about this overstuffed, placid version of Lloyd Webber's wonderful stage play. It's a terrible adaptation of the Broadway musical...if I were Lloyd Webber, I'd want to buy a mask and live under the Majestic theatre in shame. The point of a musical is to make you weep the music's so great...this music made me weep, but for a WHOLE different reason. Come on, Christine's supposed to be lured by a raspy-voiced, Zorro wanna-be who can't even hit his notes on tune? Rod Stewart has a better voice than this Phantom..whatever happened to Michael Crawford? And Emmy, while pretty, is only pretty...her voice is thin and grating...who knows how she got in the Met? And Raoul is flat...and needs a serious haircut. Look, this movie could have been beautiful, one of the best ever.As it is, wait 'till it's on the pre-viewed rack for $5. Then enjoy the costumes.",The Phantom of the Opera
1599,gingersnappy,I don't understand the high IMDb rating on this film,4,30 November 2005,"Singing is something that requires effort, and not just a series of lip movements. Even world class singers like Sarah Brightman have to occasionally pause, take deep breaths, contort her face, her mouth... What I see in the movie is a catastrophic disconnect between the visual and the audio.The cast's singing is beautiful, and expressive - I mean, audio wise. The way the characters are singing visually, is not. If only their facial expressions can match the expressions in their singing voices... And when the camera is behind a singing character, I can't help but notice that the character isn't actually singing. He/She doesn't take breaths! I kinda feel that it might have been better if the cast were to sing (and be recorded directly) on the set. The audio might not be as good, but at least, the singing and acting will be more ""in-tune"". Of course, the fatal mistake comes when the lips and audio go out of synchronization.The singing is fantastic (though I am not going down the narrow road of comparing Rossum with Brightman), but it also destroys my entire experience throughout this movie. Because I am not just hearing, I am watching as well. The director certainly shows his weaknesses in the genre, overlooking its essence. What a shame! Singing apart, cinematography artistry is lacking as well. While the opera scenes (done rather well) mimic the richness of those in Moulin Rouge, the rest of the scenes are dull. Some of the long views, e.g. when Raoul was galloping to the cemetery, feels like it is trying to be minimalistic, but not quite there. I like the cemetery scene with Christine, it being one of the most emotional scenes, but the set feels a little too spacious. In general, the non-opera scenes seem to suffer from a rather empty-feeling set and poor usage of the wide-screen space. Maybe it's all in the camera angles.Taking about the camera, the camera cuts are annoying - too much, too frequent.The movie might have been better off as an audio book. I guess it is okay but not mind-blowing, all withstanding. And it certainly does not belong to the same class as Moulin Rouge! Rather disappointed at the IMDb rating.",The Phantom of the Opera

If your like me who goes into a movie to sit back and relax for 2 hours, and appreciates how much hard work has gone into it then definitely see it- its sublime. If your someone that likes to pick at every little thing of a movie- just don't even bother, because of coarse your going to find something wrong with it, one way or another.Absolutely loved gerard butler as phantom- don't get what everyone is talking about. I have been listening to the soundtrack and the original- comparing different parts, and to be honest, much prefer gerry butlers voice- he sounds so angry, its awesome. give it a chance...its not meant to be a carbon copy of the play....enjoy it for the awesome storyline that we all love...thats what makes me love the phantom of the opera...not who plays who, or how good the costumes are etc....",The Phantom of the Opera

I'm from Paris, France and I work just a few steps ahead from The Opera's House......I have seen the movie twice and I really think it is a must to be seen movie....I saw the musical twice in London and i was longing to see the adaptation for cinema.....others films always shows the phantom as a monster......which is not the case in the musical....! Anyway, critics in France are horrible about this movie and i can't help thinking they are all stupid.....Gerard Butler IS THE PHANTOM, he brings so much intensity, so much ""sexual"" feelings and emotions....you can't help falling in love with the phantom! songs performances were great as well!

I don't mean that I don't like POTO, but I have only seen the play once and my seats were so bad I really couldn't see what was happening. I have always liked the songs, but never really SEEN the story unfold as it did on the big screen. It is truly mesmerizing! The music, actors, set, everything is FANTASTIC.When the movie was over, everyone in the theater cheered and clapped.It is an awesome experience.I may go see it again this weekend and I NEVER do that.I can't wait until it comes on DVD.It is really a shame that it didn't get nominated for Best Picture. I think this possibly the best movie I have ever seen.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 15!!! :)",The Phantom of the Opera
1603,gwt99,Phantom Film is Phantastic,10,24 January 2005,"I have recently seen the film and needless to say, it was wonderful. Andrew Lloyd Webber's casting of the main characters was true to his genius vision. I have seen the stage play several times and I applaud Mr. Webber and Mr. Shumaker for their transformation to the big screen. The film version provides so much more than the stage play ever could. I was a little disappointed in the costuming for the Masquerade scene. Although it was done wonderfully, I would have enjoyed more spectacular colors in the costumes. The way the film ended, though different from the play was perfect. It provided a closure that the play does not. I have been to a lot of movies in my life, but I have never seen the audience applaud at the end as they did for Phantom. I give this film 10/10, two thumbs, up.",The Phantom of the Opera
1604,rshort,From a Guy Who Would Typically Hate This Type of Movie,8,24 January 2005,"I go to the movies for humor, special effects, science fiction, and with my kids. My wife went to Phantom with her mother and frankly I was glad they went without me. I figured it was artsy fartsy and/or a romance and I just wasn't interested.My wife convinced me to go with her.As soon as the flashback begins (from 1919 Paris to 1870 Paris) viewers are blown away with a riveting story. I won't include the story details as most people know this one.There is also breathtaking visual imagery, and most of all, amazing music and vocals. I've seen my share of stage musicals, including Phantom, and was skeptical as to how things would shake out on film. I was mesmorized by an amazingly talented cast and musicians.The film takes the stage version and adds to it with some additional music and images that you could never produce on a stage.Even the non-art movie goers like me will enjoy the rivalry between the Phantom and the female lead's (Christine) other love interest. One of many high points for the action seekers is a great sword fight scene between the rivals.I feel that the film is a wonderful compliment to the stage show. It is an absolute must see for any Phantom fans. I recommend it to anyone with a passion for musicals.For those with a more macho taste, it's a great date movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1605,Blondechick236,The Phantom of the Opera is incredible!,10,24 January 2005,"I am 13 years old and have been going to many Broadways and operas since I was about two years old. The Phantom of the Opera has always been one of my favorites, and this movie did not at all disappoint me. The Phantom and Raul were extremely well cast and I don't think they could have casted a more perfect Christine. A few parts in the movie were spoken instead of sung, which seems to me like a good idea. The movie stayed true to the actual script that is used for the stage production. My advice to people, especially teenagers, who go to see this movie, is to go in with an open mind. It is unlike anything you will ever see and yes, most of it is sung. But, the music is incredibly powerful and if you are at all like me, you will cry and get chill bumps. Lots of them. I saw the movie twice two days ago and I am still absolutely AMAZED at what I saw, and I think my mother is about to go mad because I won't stop singing the songs from the movie. I hope that this review has been helpful!",The Phantom of the Opera
1606,Lazylady51979,Truly Moving and Wonderflul Film!,10,26 January 2005,"I studied the Phantom in junior high during my music class. I became obsessed with the opera, and it has been (and will continue to be) my dream to see it on Broadway or even in Chicago. When I heard that it was going to be on film, I was so excited I could hardly wait. It frustrated me that it came to ""select cities"" on December 22nd, as I wasn't in one of them. So I finally got to see it this past weekend (it opened Jan 22nd nation-wide). Although the film was 2 1/2 hours, it certainly did NOT feel like it. It was so moving, I cannot even count the number of time I got chills. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Phantom of the Opera, or even anyone who loves a tragic love story. I cannot wait to see it again, and will do so if no this weekend then definitely the next. All I can say is ""BRING ON THE DVD""!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1607,purpleshammrock,Excellent movie and have seen it twice!,10,24 January 2005,"I have never watched the musical play of the Phantom of the Opera nor have I read the book, but after seeing this movie, I simply love it. The singing was all wonderful and the Phantom played by Gerard Butler is simply amazing! I was astonished to find out that he had never had any singing lessons and to be able to sing all the songs with such feelings and emotions was a very rare talent. Of course, lots of people keep comparing his singing to Michael Crawford, and therefore said the singing is not that great. I think this is not fair to Gerard because the man has never trained nor had performed in any other musical plays as Michael. So with this in mind and to not keep comparing between two different things, I'm sure those who watch this movie will enjoy it a lot. I know, I did and I even bought the soundtrack that I've been listening to so many times, I lost count. My most favorite song from this soundtrack is ""All I ask of you (reprise)"", because here you can hear the phantom (Gerard) sing with such feelings/emotions and if you listen closely you can hear him crying as he sings this song. With that being said, I have listen to the musical play from the 2 disc CDs of the original cast of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, and I have to say that the movie is exactly like the play capturing all the main points so I don't see why some people said the movie is not like the musical play. Overall, I think the movie was very good (much better than the musical play) and nicely done. So if you haven't seen it, I urge you to go see, it will be worth your time and don't listen/read the bad reviews. Let yourself be the judge of that.",The Phantom of the Opera
1608,marisagalvez,Beautiful from the Beginning..,10,25 January 2005,"I went to see this movie just yesterday and the music is still haunting me. I was truly impressed with the sweeping cinematography from the very beginning with the stage candles lighting one by one. I felt that unlike the play, every sequence was covered with every detail the imagination wished could be seen. I was very interested in how the direction was going to take place in the ""Masquerade"" scene. It was completely overwhelming emotionally when choreography, elaborate costumes, rich colors and music spilled onto my lap. Absolute perfection that I felt the play could not fulfill. In the movie the camera is your eyes directing you to exact instances of visual perfection that the play gives you all at once. The richest of men in the ball room and the underground maids and servants are all apart of the scene. For those who are fans of Minnie Driver, you will absolutely love her role as La Carlotta. She is comical and bitchy all at once, but a prima dona I loved. Gerard Butler was of all the phantoms I have seen, by far my favorite. I am so glad to see a movie where the expected people to play the characters where not there. Finally a film with fresh faces and talent that we all know is out there waiting for a chance. He was overly handsome, but in the sense that he was mysterious, the way I would expect Erik to be. And then all at once he is stripped of his good looks and charm, when his true face is shown. His good looks is what I believe makes the most sense, because like the Masquerade song he is hiding his,""face so the world will never find you."" One thing I wished that Andrew Lloyd Webber I felt should have eluded to was more background on the story. He explains some of the phantoms early life but not in the way others have continuously written about him. Like his travels first to Italy, Turkey and then France as an architect that helped build the Paris Opera House behind the scenes. All in all though, I definitely recommend this movie, even if it is only to add to your human capital of all around knowledge. Those who cannot afford the truly expensive tickets to a real Broadway theatrical, should go and see this movie because it remains true to the play, but even better. Plus the ticket is much cheaper than that of the play. Then you can say you have seen the play.",The Phantom of the Opera
1609,silvermedea,Can this be called a musical?,3,26 June 2005,"Not even the lavish sets and costumes can make up for what the singers did to this lovely musical. Christine's sometimes-strong, usually wobbly voice would have been banned from any self-respecting opera house. Carlotta is no prima donna by any stretch of the imagination. Madame Giry is thin and flat--no wonder her part was reduced--and the Phantom, the great Angel of Music, seems incapable of managing vibrato. Instead of drawing out his notes, he ends them with an unpleasant rasp.Not only are the voices bad (this is a musical!) but the acting leaves much to be desired. The actors were stuck with dialogue that could have been written by middle-schoolers, but a great actor could have brought some life to his character despite that. Christine, clearly chosen for her pretty face, has three expressions: stoned, melodramatically frightened, and adoring. Stoned wins most of the time. Every time her boyfriend, Raul, speaks, it seems like his next line should be, ""Ya wanna stop at McDonalds or hit the beach?""The directing isn't very good either. Some of the sung words in the original musical are spoken, causing a strange, stilted effect, and some of the best parts are simply edited out. There is no such thing as subtlety--when Christine drops a rose the Phantom gave her, the camera focuses on it for several seconds to make sure that we have grasped its significance. And which part of the graveyard scene is stranger: the mist conveniently rising from the ground, or the fact that Christine, despite her bare head and cleavage, does not appear to be cold?",The Phantom of the Opera
1610,kirafilippova,The Phantom Of The Opera - the movie of the year,10,25 January 2005,"This is the very best movie I have seen lately. Although I haven't seen the musical yet (and I'm really ashamed of it), I've been to this movie two times now. It's marvelous, gorgeous and absolutely terrific. I'm looking forward to buying the DVD, but I guess it won't have the same feeling as in the cinema. I have to say that Gerard Butler made his role unforgettable, he played it with such emotion that neither my mother nor I could help falling for this men. Emmy Rossum's voice made it even a greater hit for me. The cast, the music and of course the acting couldn't be better, Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber made just the right decision in choosing the actors. If I could watch this movie ten times a day, I would do so. A huge applause! Excellent! Bravo!",The Phantom of the Opera
1611,hyde0825,It stinks!!!,3,25 January 2005,"I saw this show on stage and the movie does it no justice!!! With the exception of Minnie Driver (who I was pleasantly surprised by), the singing was awful!!!! No one's voice was powerful (or on key) enough to show the beauty of the songs. The girl who plays Christine needs some acting and voice lessons. I don't know where she was 'classiclly' trained but her teacher needs to retire! The Phantom is supposed to be a little bit older of a man not a cute young guy! I wish they had Antonio Banderas play the Phantom. He proved in Evita that he sang great! In the play, the Phantom was a much more sympathetic character than he was in the movie. I don't know about the Phantom being born a gypsy sideshow freak. I always thought the Phantom was either in a fire or burned by acid. The screenplay was beautiful and the plot follows the show pretty well, but the singing sucks so bad it overpowers the rest of the movie. I do NOT recommend this to any musician, singer or general Phantom fan. You will be disappointed!",The Phantom of the Opera

The voices of each artist reached down deep and pulled you into the movie. The dance scenes were also very well done, lots of gusto and the costumes were fantastic. I was surprised to see familiar faces from more serious works of art doing musicals. Minnie Driver was her usual best, though she did steal some of the scenes, she is a strong personality.

My daughter and I have seen it twice now, and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack from the original cast. Her boyfriend came with us to the first viewing, and he had seen the original musical and mentioned how much he appreciated how closely it followed the musical. My only qualm about the movie is that there are parts where the Phantom's voice is not as rich as I believe that it should be; however, I believe his passion in the role does compensate for this slight blemish. Christine's voice is SO beautiful. The sweetness of her voice and her angelic looks are an awesome combination. Go see it again and again and again!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1615,taylors_mommy,Terrible!,1,8 July 2005,"Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start. In the Paris Opera House at the auction Raoul purchases the music box. He sings. He's SUPPOSED to sing... ""A collector's piece, indeed. Every detail exactly as she said. She often spoke of you, my friend; your velvet lining and your figurine of lead. Will you still play when all the rest of us are dead?"" In the screen version the description of the music box was left out. I understand why - you can see it in the film the way you could never see it from the stage. However, while the music box is a prominent prop it should not have been displayed in the movie as much as it was. Leaving that line whilst omitting some of the close shots would have illustrated its importance more subtly.That wasn't the only odd change to the libretto. After Christine sings ""Think of Me"" (which was vocally altered to compensate for Emmy Rossum's lack of range) and she's alone a ghostly voice is supposed to sing, ""Bravi, bravi, bravissimi."" This was chaged to, ""Brava, brava, bravissimi."" Yeah, um, why? There was no technical need for the change and it runined the alliteration of the line.Now, on to the major changes.Carlotta. WTF? Minnie Driver? Yes, Carlotta is supposed to come off and slightly ridiculous, but she IS NOT the comic relief of the show - Andre and Firmin are. She was a complete farce.Christine. I don't care how ""young and sexy"" Joel Schumacher wanted his cast, Christine SHOULD NOT be 16 years old. Especially not when the Phantom is 35 years old! Emmy Rossum has a good voice, I won't deny her that, but at 16 her voice is simply not mature enough to pull off the vocal strain of being Christine. Not to mention that she has the personality and talent of a rock.The Chandelier. Oh. My. God. The most memorable event from the musical. You ask even the most clueless person about Phantom and they can tell you there's a falling chandelier. The end of the first act approached... ""All I Ask of You"" was sung (and rushed) and I waited. Nothing happened. The second act began and because the chandelier DID NOT fall one of the most prolific lines from ""Why So Silent"" was cut. The Phantom utters the warning, ""I advise you to comply, my instructions should be clear. Remember there are worse things than a shattered chandelier."" This, of course, warns of the deaths of Boquet, and Piangi. Unfortunately, since they chose to move the fall of the chandelier to the freaking middle of ""Point of No Return"" the deaths of both were complete overshadowed! Not to mention that with Carlotta acting like a moron you almost want to laugh when her lover is killed! In short - it was crap. A travesty. Yes, the sets and costumes were beautiful. I guess I shouldn't have expected much more from former costume designer turned director Schumacher. After all, what more could the man who nippled the bat-suit really have to offer.",The Phantom of the Opera
1616,sgwhiting,Early negative reviews were misleading,10,27 January 2005,"Our family originally saw the play with Michael Crawford many years ago. It was a wonderful, memorable experience. The family planned to see it when we were together for Christmas, but with such poor reviews decided we didn't want to ruin our memories. Now that the kids have all returned with their families to their homes, we risked going to see it by ourselves. What an excellent movie. Yes, the Phantom is different than M. Crawford - he seems more sinister, his voice more raw. A better depiction in my opinion. Dale Christen's(?)voice in the play was fabulous, but Emmy Rossum made a more convincing ingénue and her voice, although not as strong, was beautiful. The enhanced role of the Diva with Minnie Driver added comedy and additional enjoyment over the play. We missed the fun of viewing it with our family, maybe I will finally learn to ignore the ""paid (paid by who?), professional"" reviewers who forgot long ago how to sit back, enjoy a movie, and let a majestic film touch their souls. The only thing that spoiled the movie while watching it was continually wishing the family could have, once again, seen it together.",The Phantom of the Opera

Prior to viewing the film, I had never seen Phantom nor did I know anything about the story line, however I had heard the sound track, and I knew I was in for something special. Emmy Rossum (Christine) had a gorgeous voice. It was sooo pure and beautiful. The other main characters did incredibly well also, but the heart of the show was the Phantom (Gerard Butler). I have heard the soundtrack from the Broadway production and I think that Butler portrayed the Phantom (at least in voice) far better (and that is saying something). His voice was wonderful and powerful, yet it had a raspy quality that embodied the phantom very well. All in all, I intend on seeing the film several more times before it leaves theaters, and it has encouraged me to find my way to New York to see the stage performance.

Great music, perfect cast and just a great story all around; When Schumacher decided to make the Phantom a younger man, this was the key to creating a love story for the centuries. I have seen this movie 4 times because to get its full effect you have to see it on the big screen, or a plasma TV with one great sound system. But, I will purchase the DVD. I did not really know who Gerard and Emmy were but found the pair totally enchanting; singing was meaningful and sensual. I can't even imagine what the critics were thinking. Not the stage play, grant you, but Schumacher did things on the screen that could not have been done on stage. Everyone should see this movie (especially all the women).",The Phantom of the Opera

In particular, the leads (Christine & the Phantom) were a little lacking. Also, the lip synching was a bit distracting, though understandably necessary for the medium (and for more than just Minnie Driver).Special effects were very well done. Things that were absolutely amazing on the stage were nearly always as well done in the film. And there were huge numbers of scenes that simply lent themselves to the silver screen more than the stage.All in all, well thought out, well directed, well produced.

The sadness was heartwrenching, and though it has been two weeks since I viewed it, I still feel as though in the movie. There is no way to describe the elation one feels when Christine is finally released to her lover, the fear when she is taken, and the sadness when she mourns her father. The costumes were amazing. The makeup was done so well, it was easy to believe the people of that time looked that way. Even slight details, like snow sticking to Christine's lashes at the cemetery were well accounted for.

1623,vanessatament,Not a Joel Schumacher fan,3,28 January 2005,"I did not care for this movie. I believe that the actors, under the guide of a good director, are probably quite capable. However, as has usually been my experience with Mr. Schumacher, the actors are left to pose and be beautiful for his composition. I admit disappointment that the actors were so boring. With the exception of Ms. Driver, who was delightfully comedic, I had a difficult time sitting through the film. Notice that the lovely Christine rarely moves her face. Emmy Rossum has been wonderful in other films, particularly in MYSTIC RIVER, under the tutelage of Clint Eastwood. Why was she so dreadful in this one? And Gerard Butler was clearly trying to make something of his character. But the editing left little of any relationship with anybody. As for the singing, the voice used for Ms. Driver was excellent. Ms. Rossum clearly has talent but was uneven and Mr. Butler needs to rest his voice lest he develop nodes. Patrick Wilson, who apparently has massive credits, including Broadway, did not shine. He probably could have. I do not intend to be nasty. I think the actors deserved a better director. The end credit song is not up to Mr. Webber's normal standard. But, I assume the studio and record company wanted an easy sell to the CD buyers. As a final disappointment, the fabulous Miranda Richardson was a yawn...and she has never been one before. Bravo, Mr. Schumacher.",The Phantom of the Opera

Go figure i listen to rap but don't judge me by that. I have seen the Phantom 3 times live and grew up listening to Andrew Loyde Webbers music. Then i saw this movie on opening night. I didn't know what to expect, what i got was so unsuspected, i walked in thinking this movie wont be that bad and it would probably come close to the magnificent play... When the movie was over i was in amazement! IT WAS BETTER! Sure nothing beats the play live the feeling u get in the theater. This movie however covers a little more about the Phantom and the way he came to be the phantom, but what i admired was the coverage of the story they introduce in the beginning of the play. We follow Raoul in black and white as he buys the monkey playing the symbols, as the movie progresses we follow a side story of Raoul on his way to (not gonna spoil it)But all in all i've always wanted a better conclusion then what the play offered. I got that conclusion. Gerard Butler gives a particularly anguishing and sympathetic performance as The Phantom. Emmy Rossum a very sexy Christine has such a voice that we forget about Sarah Brightman, who was at one point suppose to be Christine for the movie. The bottom line is, it is a on the edge of your seat excitement from beginning to end a must see and when it's all over it won't be.... for The Phantom Of The Opera will stay there inside your mind and the music of the night will never fade away!

You don't get the same feelings that you get when you see it on stage, but I still loved it anyways. Andrew Lloyd Webber is probably so pleased that he got to do all the special effects that you can't do on stage. The chandelier falling was done incredibly wonderful, I was in awe.

1628,hlcraig,A very dazzling display of music and design,10,29 January 2005,"I love this adaptation of the musical ""Phantom of the Opera"" although I have never seen the on stage production, many of my fellow moviegoers who had said the movie held very true to the musical. I am very grateful to the people responsible for making such a wonderful musical production available to us everyday people who either can't make it, or don't have the money to get out to Broadway. To anyone who loves ""Phantom of the Opera"" the musical, or is just interested in the storyline I encourage you to check this movie out. I'm no film critic but I give this movie a 10, and two thumbs way up! I really hope that this movie will encourage more young people to get out and experience the thrill and magic that is a musical movie. In the future I hope that even more musicals can be put in a movie context that will shape the story and guide the viewers without losing any of it's musical charm which is what the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera has accomplished.",The Phantom of the Opera
1629,markatew,Wow!!!,10,30 January 2005,"Amazing adaptation of the stage play, which I have seen 6 times and absolutely loved. I didn't think a screen adaptation would work as well as the play, but this was wonderful. Gerard Butler made the part his own and thank heavens didn't come across as a Michael Crawford (who, frankly, was always too old for the part) wannabe. All the criticism about Mr. Butlers voice is missing the point. His voice was perfectly suited to the way he developed the part. Visually stunning and emotionally charged. If I had one complaint it would be.... can't anyone find a pair of scissors and cut Raoul's hair? The movie clarifies some of the finer points of the plot that may be missed on stage.",The Phantom of the Opera
1630,jadams-18,Enjoyable!,7,30 January 2005,"I admit being a fan of Phantom of the Opera. The fact is, the music is moving -- tremendously exciting at times, and achingly poignant at others. This production is wonderful, especially the sets and costumers, which do a lot for the overall ambiance. The story is very clearly developed in this film version, and the flashbacks are effective.Vocally, Emily Rossum is the best singer in the cast. She is worth the price of admission alone! The weakest vocally is Gerard Butler, who sometimes almost shouts his solos, but by the end, I thought he had done a good job in the role. I liked him better once his disfigurement was revealed. Sometimes the transitions in the music are a bit choppy, but I enjoyed this movie far more than the rather negative critical reviews would have led me to expect.",The Phantom of the Opera
1631,danvir,Fantastic,10,30 January 2005,"There are few movies that I see more than once while still in the theater. This movie is one of those few movies that I have seen multiple times! The imagery, the costume design, the musical score, and the acting - stupendous! I loved the chemistry between the cast members, you couldn't have asked for a better cast! My favorite though has to be Gerard Butler! I would have wanted to get lost in the catacombs of Paris with him! Best Song: The Phantom of the Opera Saddest Moment: The Phantom sitting in front of the monkey music box singing ""masqureade""The special edition CD is excellent as well, it has a mini-book with still-photos from the set.

But I have one question - was the man in the wheelchair supposed to be Raul? I found this to be very unclear and cannot remember it from when I last saw the play.The only comment I have is that I would have liked the Phantom to have a little stronger voice. And I also agree with the person who commented on his mask. It should have been longer, because when the mask came off his entire side of his face was disfigured. The mask only covered half of this side.Thanks for your help with my question.If my email address doesn't show - its hgb0514@comcast.net",The Phantom of the Opera
1633,ldellorusso,Stunningly the best!!,10,30 January 2005,"My parents raised me on Andrew Llyod Webber's music, and Phantom was by far my favorite. When I heard they were making this movie, I was so excited, and was not disappointed by it. I've see the movie twice so far, and can't wait to go back for the third time. Emmy Rossum was amazing and provided a fresh new face for Christine. Patrick Wilson made an excellent Raoul, and Minnie Driver really made Carlotta a fun character. However, my favorite character had to be Gerald Butler's Phantom. Although his voice could had been more professionally trained, I thought it was perfect for this part. He made the Phantom sexy, entrancing and dark, while giving him a sensitive side too. If you have not seen this movie you must, must, must see it. It is AMAZING and does the stage production justice. You will have the haunting music stuck in your head for weeks afterwords, but this movie is so worth it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1634,stanfuger,Phantom Casting Decisions are superb,10,30 January 2005,"I saw Phantom last night and was completely enthralled by this version. I am particularly impressed with the choice of young Emmy Rossum as ""Christine."" She is an extraordinary singing talent whose career will, I am certain, match the heights that her wonderful soprano voice can reach! I was surprised to find that she was only sixteen years of age when she filmed this movie. She is an example of true talent in an age in which electronic enhancements are regularly practiced in popular music. The dubbing of her voice could have been a bit better however. I imagine this had something to do with the difficulty of Christine's musical part. Had she been singing as hard on camera as she undoubtedly was during the music taping, the picture might not have been as impressive. So, I can put up with the slightly unbelievable dubbing to have the wonderful music that she produced.I was also extremely impressed both the acting and singing performance of Gerard Butler. These two make as perfect a team as any who have ever played the parts. This film will be a classic and is one that I eagerly look to add to my DVD Collection as soon as possible.",The Phantom of the Opera
1635,FuLaSpirit,Phenomenal,10,30 January 2005,"An absolute MUST SEE! The Phantom of the Opera is without a doubt my favourite musical movie, if not my favourite movie right now! I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's not just a movie about opera, it's Andrew Lloyd Webber's adaptation that gives musical life to the famous novel with passion, deception, separation, love, anger, madness,...Whether you like musicals or not, this movie is extraordinary! I believe if you liked Chicago, you will receive this movie as highly if not as a more remarkable film about just as remarkable of a musical. The cinematography and the music are both breathtaking, and the colors of the film are beautiful, making for a fantastically POWERFUL film. What a great love story,...You'll never be the same...",The Phantom of the Opera

Last Saturday we dragged both her husband and my boyfriend to the ""Phantom of the Opera""! It was everything that I've always believed it should be and more! How did these two genius's read my mind? The music full and haunting, along with the ultimate cast! I looked over and my boyfriend was so into the movie that his eyes we're wide open! Mental high-five to my friend as her husband was showing the same amazement! I'm not saying that neither of them appreciate this type of music...but no one has made it more exciting, sexy and just plain romantic! The scenes were in a word, ""breathtaking""! I thoroughly enjoyed the total experience! P.S. I can't wait to see it again!! We will be contacting all of our friends about this one!! I'm very certain that when it comes out on DVD I will be one of the first to own it, as my friend and I ran out to by the special edition CD's that night, but see it on the ""BIG SCREEN""... there's just no substitute! Awesome!!! Sincerely, Michelle",The Phantom of the Opera

As an amateur singer, from a family of professional singers and musicians, would I be disappointed? I am happy to report the first aria brought tears to my eyes. My family sat watching and listening, enraptured. The sheer beauty of the voices in this movie is beyond my ability to describe. Come expecting to cry for the beauty of it, the pain of it, and at last, the proof of unconditional love. We had a great movie experience.This is an exceptional story, with great photography, wonderful continuity, and performances that I will always remember. The sets, the costumes, the faces, the whole package, made my family plan to return to the theatre many times, while we wait to buy the DVD.Come prepared to fall in love with, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" movie.Thank you, Mr. Weber.",The Phantom of the Opera

""Phantom of The Opera is a great movie to watch! I rate this movie a ten!this also based on the opera house in Paris,France.The year is 1905,and an auction is taking place on the stage of the Opéra De Paris to clear away certain articles from the theatre's vaults. The auctioneer produces a giant chandelier which once hung from the ceiling of the opera house. He tells perspective buyers of the chandelier's connection tale of the Phantom of the Opéra which had intrigues Parisian theatregoers almost half a century ago. As the reassembled chandelier is lit, the overture begins, and the light rises slowly to the ceiling. When it reaches its former home in the center of the house,we are transported to the year 1861.

I saw the Broadway production twice, and the movie version doesn't disappoint! Of course, the music is fabulous. The actors are beautiful, and if the singing isn't quite to operatic standards, who cares?? The sets are wonderful, and add so much to the overall atmosphere.

I love the phantom Gerard Butler. HE really did a great job I think of portraying the Phantom. thumbs up! The actor who plays Rauol has a very good voice but he's not my favorite character. Anyways I think this movie is a 10! WONDERFUL! Its my personal favorite. I think girls and women would like it more than men though because it is a little uh ""girly"" you could say. but I'm a girl and I LOVE IT! TOTALLY WATCH IT!

1641,littlegirlymess,The movie was just as good as the Broadway production,10,1 February 2005,"I think that the movie was very close to the actual Broadway production, and i loved both of them. But the movie made the story a little bit more understandable, in the sense that i knew what was going on. In the play i was so amazed at the sets and costumes i didn't pay too much attention to the actual story, but i did understand what was going on. The movie and the Broadway production were both extremely well performed, it was like you could connect with the characters, i loved it and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good music and loves a good romance story. They really don't make movies like this anymore, its hard to find a good movie with a good plot and great music to back it all up with. Enjoy!! :)",The Phantom of the Opera

Well if you think about Christine is a young 16 year old girl, and Emmy was 17 when they filmed this and Sarh was 24 when she did the musical, so Emmy did a better job of not only showing Christine is young but also her voice is better because you can tell from her voice that she is young, and Sarah's singing voice sounds like a woman in her 20's. No offense to Sarah Brightman or her fans.Emmy is just younger which makes the character of Christine better.",The Phantom of the Opera
1643,lilbitiny,Phantom's mask,10,1 February 2005,"I personally thought 'The Phantom of the Opera' was beautifully made, with amazing scenery and costumes, not to mention singing. To answer many questions about the phantoms mask, how he wore a mask during the 'point of no return' scene and a few others that only covered his eyes and part of his nose, yet without showing any visible deformities, if you watched closely during the 'Point of no return' scene, you could see the mask covered a large portion of The Phantom's face with part that was the same colour as his skin, covered his hair as well, that is why his hair went from black to that odd shade of gray. Argue about this answer if you want, i'm 99% sure that this is why. But think what you like. ~Lilbitiny",The Phantom of the Opera
1644,garilicious,No more lip-syncing! But overall a great movie!,7,1 February 2005,"First, let me say that this was a GREAT movie, and that I'm going to see it as many times as I can before it leaves our theater. But. . .the small details were horrible. The dubbing all the way through was so bad I couldn't even watch their mouths. I had to stare at their eyes the entire time. It was hugely obvious that the actors were not really singing. In fact, in some parts I have my doubts that they were even listening to a prerecorded voice! Please, anyone who is making a musical movie, take a page out of Baz Luhrmann's book. In Moulin Rouge, the actors sang every song live that they could. The music in that movie matches perfectly with the lips. Even in music videos, the artists sing along with the prerecorded track. It didn't look like the actors in Phantom were singing, they were just lip-syncing, and it was obvious. A few other complaints: the voices didn't live up to the legacy of this musical, especially not those of the main characters, and the acting wasn't that great in many places. But overall, despite its problems, this movie managed to be amazing, whether it was through the special effects, the good acting, or the fabulous costume and makeup. I suggest that everyone go and see it. . .just watch their eyes when they sing.",The Phantom of the Opera
1645,luvlysingr,Best Musical Of The Year,9,3 February 2005,"I went to this movie out of pure luck, and I was happy I got the opportunity to go. My sister wanted to go, and I had wanted to go, so we just went to a 10 o'clock showing, and it was AWESOME! I really want to see it again! I would give it the Best musical of the year, along with Best Drama and Romance. I liked the cast of characters no matter what anyone else says, they did great selecting Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson. They had amazing chemistry and it really added to the romance of the film, and also the conflict. I'll have to say Gerard was an amazingly attractive phantom, and he really showed he's moods and character by his voice (WELL DONE!). Emmy Rossum was a good selection, her age is not a setback as some would say, it is true a 17 year old can be mature, and professional (I KNOW I AM 17 myself). She did beautifully except I wish the director would have had her actual sing on ""Think Of Me"" so that it actually looked like she was really singing. Her lips were not in sync very well on that particular song, her mouth could not of been open that small when singing opera. That and the problem with the Phantom's Mask was the only other technical difficulties and are the only reason I give it a 9. The costumes, lighting, and especially when the Opera came alive was amazing. I loved that. It really makes you feel like your in it, and not just watching it. A powerful story that no one can forget. I loved it, and anyone who is into Phantom Of The Opera will too, and will have the songs stuck in your head for DAYS! I loved Raoul, Phantoms', and Christines' voices, and I cried at the most emotion throbbing parts...I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE PHANTOM!",The Phantom of the Opera
1646,slatorre-2,The Phantom of the opera was just amazing and wonderful,10,2 February 2005,"I've just seen the movie and I was completely amazed¡¡¡ is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, the acting of Gerard Butler is simply amazing, he looks more than sexy and handsome dressed like the phantom, he made me fall in love with him and I guess all the female audience was really attracted by him, he looks much more handsome and attractive than Raoul and he made us feel all that he was the real victim and not the bad guy, I guess this movie contains all necessary issues to be one of the bests of the year, the outfits and the dancing and the acting and the singing was really wonderful, I didn't know that Emmy Rossum could sing like that and that was a nice surprise, I recommend this movie and give it a ten/ten, it's a work of art, you cant miss it, it's great. Congratulations to Mr. Gerard Butler, he should really consider to comb his hair like the phantom, he looks very handsome and sexy with black hair and his acting and singing was from a very professional.",The Phantom of the Opera

We have seen it twice on stage so I was anxious to compare. We were blown away with all the wonderful sets and costumes as well as the acting. The singing was wonderful even though perhaps not up to Broadway par. We loved everyone's portrayal. We wanted to walk right back into the theater and watch it again as soon as it was over. There were a few changes in the movie vs. the play, but we liked that as well, as it kept things interesting. The only thing we HATED about it was during one of the scenes a man drops his drawers for a classic ""mooning"". This was completely irrelevant to the script, and a total distraction as well as an embarrassment for my young children and many others in the theater. We think of the Phantom of the Opera as too classy as to resort to something like that. Every other person we know that has seen it feels the same way about this scene. I hope the editors will do the right thing and remove this nasty offense before this comes to video. Otherwise everything else was great!",The Phantom of the Opera

I saw it last weekend and rushed out to by the soundtrack immediately! I have not stopped listening to it since. I saw the stage show when I was a little girl, and remember thinking that I had seen something special, but not until I saw it on the big screen did I realize what a breathtaking experience it is! As preoccupied by this PhAnomenon as I am, I can't seem to find anyone or read any reviews that come even close to realizing what a magical journey it really is. This is very discouraging. To all of those people that think that the casting of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum was wrong.......all I can say is their performances still make me want to cry even after listening to the soundtrack over 50 times! I can't wait to go see it again, and I am even recruiting my boyfriend, who HATES musicals. It has to be impossible to see this movie and not feel every single note and emotion!

1649,eggleton47,Phantom of the Opera,10,3 February 2005,This movie was a delightful remake to the older version which did not have the outstanding music to create a wonderful movie experience.

All the performers were excellent and did a A+ job in this film it brought so many emotions to the surface that I will make this one of my number one top buys when released on DVD. This was such a beautiful movie I laughed I cried I felt every second of the movie as it was happening I am so astonished and am impressed with how this movie turned out I didn't think it was going to be this awesome and I would be very upset if I did not catch it on the big screen you must see it in the theatres to appreciate it.

I went with expectations and with trepidation as Phantom is without a doubt my favorite state play. I was not disappointed. Ms. Rossum is very, very good as Chtristine. Her voice falls a little short of Sara Brightman's, but then whose doesn't. This is more than adequately compensated for by her superb acting skills. Mr. Butler also presents a good acting performance, but alas, his voice will never challenge Michael Crawford. Ms. Richardson gives the best rendition of her role that I have seen. Ms. Driver as Carlotta leaves nothing to be desired. Probably the best rendition of Masquerade.

I have never seen the play but I don't think people should compare the movie to the play. I went and bought the soundtrack today and have been listening to it all day while I clean my house. I think Gerald Butler makes a GREAT phantom. He sure made me wish I was Christine(lol). I saw him in the movie Timeline and could not believe it was him as the phantom. The music is so beautiful and I would rather see that movie or hear that music than most of the trash thats on TV or at the movies. Just my opinion folks.. A+ for me.

For a week straight I re-watched my favorite parts, goose-bumps forming as the Phantom sang to Cristine and as she sand back. Beautifully written and directed, not to mention the great cast. Outstanding performance by Emmie Rossum, a true beauty with much talent hidden inside. The love seen on screen shocks the system, creating the perfect feeling of yearning and ache as you get further and further into the film. Watching this film, I realized that I love the hypnotic way that the Phantom lures Cristine away from her childhood sweetheart and puts her under the spell of nighttime so that he may have her to himself. The passion I saw on screen was more than anything I could have ever imagined.",The Phantom of the Opera
1655,rennotasil,Fantastic,9,4 February 2005,"Holy crap! Who knew that Gerard Butler could sing like that? I enjoyed this. I was especially impressed with the fact that Emmy Rossum is only 19 years old, so she was probably 17 when this was made. From my drama days in high school, I remember a lot of aspiring performers with an eye on Broadway, but most of them sounded (and acted) more like Carlotta than Christine.My one criticism is that Andrew Lloyd Webber's version of the Phantom has always been too attractive. In this case, if I were Christine, I would have dumped Raoul on his butt for this absolutely gorgeous version of Erik. Sure, he's mad as a hatter, but nobody's perfect! And talk about attentive . . .Some critics have pointed out the differences between the stage production and the movie as if they were flaws.

The last thing I said to her before the movie started was, ""I hope I'm not disappointed."" The reason I said this to her was that I fell hopelessly in love with the original soundtrack. I have it on a double cassette, starring the wonderful Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. I felt that since I already had known perfection, that the movie version might be weak. From the first scene to the last, I sat, tense and enthralled. The casting was perfect, the costumes and scenery divine. The music, mesmerizing. I was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen in, I can't remember how long. It fleshed out the story line, answered questions that I had and left me wanting more. Gerard was excellent in both voice and acting and I can't wait to see him in other venues. The rest of the cast were very, very good, a joy to watch and a wonder that we rarely get to see such talent. This movie had it all; mystery, old world charm, passion, humor, suspense, action, and something we just don't see much of anymore, grandeur.

I loved her! There was not a single performer in this movie that I did not like. Perfect casting! There isn't much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said.I will tell you - nobody in our silly little town ever applauds after a film and when Phantom ended....the audience applauded!!!

1658,jjln,ALW Phantom of the Opera-surpassed expectations in depth and breadth,10,5 February 2005,"I have been a POTO fan since 1989 when I saw the stage production and wore out my first cd.This is not a rehash of the stage production but a deeply moving experience through a different medium, yet one that stayed true to the music.The deep emotional base of Gerard Butler's performance stayed with me for days. I have gone to see a movie twice in theaters only one time in the past but I have now seen Phantom 4 times and it impacts me more each time.The thing that always comes to mind when I read the ""critics"" comments (besides wondering if they actually saw it!) is the way that Mozart was treated by his contemporaries. It seems that the contemporaries of his day were like too many today - incapable of recognizing greatness but rather looking for silly superficial frills with no substance.The movie is a whole experience if you open yourself up to it. Emmy Rossum is really a young girl and sings like an extraordinarily talented young girl, not a 30+ year old. Raoul is real viable character as portrayed by Patrick Wilson. Minnie Driver is a hoot as Carlotta.The cinematography is superb.The haunting music feeds the soul with its beauty.The story is a fantasy but it is also an allegory of growth, strength, love of many kinds, courage to love and courage to let go, compassion and passion, and above all, complex human relationships.",The Phantom of the Opera

The cinematography, the music, the story were all captivating from beginning to end.I listened to the original soundtrack with Michael Crawford and Sara Brightman and the soundtrack from the movie to compare the singers and their version. I actually liked the new version better. The movie and the new soundtrack is right for this time and era. It allows younger people to appreciate the finer music.",The Phantom of the Opera

I saw the Broadway stage version for the first time 4 days ago and enjoyed it but felt it was a little on the ""cheesey"" side of things. I went to see the movie simply out of a sense of duty to my younger self -- with no hope of it being anything more than a kitchy romp.It was phenomenal. It was simply phenomenal. Beautiful and lush and well constructed. I mean, it's not an existential masterpiece, but it is visually cake and the singing is pretty good and it's nice to have the vastness of the cinema (I found the staged play rather confined).

1661,sunstamp,Visual Masterpiece,10,5 February 2005,"The costumes were amazing, the scenes were riveting, and their voices were amazing.Very rarely have I desired to see a musical, and even more rarely have I been so impressed by one. I left the theatre contemplating buying another ticket and seeing the next show. I was rooting for the phantom the whole time and I couldn't wait to see another scene with him in it. Some of the songs were longer than expected but overall I was quite touched by the lyrics and the emotion that backed them.This is a must-see for anyone who has a taste for the finer arts such as theatre and song.",The Phantom of the Opera

This is the first time I have seen the movie, but it will not be my last. I just couldn't get enough of it. I loved it. I have seen the Opera 3 times. I love the live opera, but this movie explains a lot that is lost in the live show. I can't wait to go and see it again and again. I have several friends who want to go so I won't have trouble finding someone to accompany me. I was pleasantly surprised that my husband also enjoyed the movie. I told him he could go to one of the other shows, but chose to come with me. I am also hoping that this movie will come out on DVD. I look forward to that already. If you haven't seen this movie, please do you will not be sorry that you went. Well worth it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1663,JerseyGirl06,Excellent movie......and a question,10,5 February 2005,"I thought this was an awesome movie. I have not seen the Broadway performance nor did I know the total storyline, but it was great. The characters and singing were phenomenal.I understood the movie, but there was one part that I was confused at. When Roule went down to rescue Christine at the end of the movie, Meg's mother kept telling him to keep his hand at the level of his eyes. This was mentioned a couple of times, but nothing seemed to come of it. I believe the Phantom said something about it as he tied him to the gate. Was there something else that happened related to this that I might have missed? Or did I not understand what happened? Thanx in advance if you know.",The Phantom of the Opera
1664,squirrelgirl16,Wow!!!,10,5 February 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie! I went to see it twice already! It is just so powerful and intense that I think everyone should definitely go and see it. I even made my musical hating boyfriend go and he said it was a really good movie. Go see it. It is definitely an experience in itself. The voices in it are incredibly powerful and the storyline is impossible to draw yourself away from. It is perfectly enticing. I had goosebumps throughout the entire thing, especially when Christine was the main vocalist. There is no way (especially if you have ever been in a band or choir) that the incredible vocals and instruments won't effect you. It was definitely a tear jerker at points, but it had everything. There were many moments of comedy, love, lust and even a sword fight for all those ""tough guys"" out there. Definitely go see it. In theater if possible. It is worth it.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have never seen or read anything about The Phantom of the Opera, but the movie has inspired me to read the book and see the Opera. I can't believe how perfectly put together this movie was. Be prepared to use your feelings in this movie. I can not wait to see it again. The music was so awesomely put together together. I can not help but want to sing along to the songs, but I find that my voice is not sufficient. Anywayz, the movie always kept me on my toes, wondering what was going to happen next. Which is pretty hard to do for me. The movie appealed to my inner heart and made me think what I would do in those situations. Also, the movie shows how cruel people can be and showed me somethings about my own life that I should work on. The cast couldn't have been better for this play. Minnie Driver did a perfect job on her character and Emmy couldn't have been picked better for the role of Christine.",The Phantom of the Opera
1666,spanky78154,Some Surprises - Some Disappointments,9,5 February 2005,"Given that I don't expect theater sound to come anywhere close to what I'm used to hearing (even at home) - the theater cranked up the bass far too much. With that in mind - I thought the movie was excellent overall, and compared favorably with the various live productions I've enjoyed over the years (both on and off Broadway). The story line is (by now) familiar - so not much of a surprise there. PERFORMANCE SURPRISES: 1) Patrick Wilson - best Raul performance I've yet seen; 2) Minnie Driver - this beautiful actress consistently amazes me with her versatility (pleasantly surprising vocal performance, and nailed the accent); and 3) Emmy Rossum - WHAT TALENT! No - she is not Sarah Brightman, but then who is. By far the best Christine since Ms. Brightman - and an almost unbelievable performance from one who is so young. PERFORMANCE DISAPPOINTMENTS: 1) Gerald Butler - I'm sure that Mr. Butler is a talented performer in his own right, but he was possibly the worst Phantom I've seen. Maybe I expected another Michael Crawford - I can't really say, but I was disappointed by this ""Phantom's"" performance. PRODUCTION DISAPPOINTMENT: length of the movie. I feel the story was lacking in detail due to the brevity of this movie. OVERALL: Excellent! I don't buy many DVD's (only those I would enjoy watching more than once), and I do plan on purchasing this DVD when it becomes available.",The Phantom of the Opera

The music is beautiful, the singing is amazing, the acting is superb, and the whole story is captivating. I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen. Even though i knew what was going to happen in the end, I felt like I didn't! It is now one of my favorite movies!if you don't like opera, i would not advise you to see this, as there is constant singing throughout the whole movie. But, I am not a fan of this type of music myself, but the singing is so clear and wonderful, that it has become one of my favorite parts of the movie! So, if you can at least STAND opera, then I would advise you to see it because it is spectacular!Why can't there be more movies like these!?",The Phantom of the Opera

That haunting but spectacular music gives an unbelievable feeling. My favorite character would have to have been Raoul(Patrick Wilson). His voice was superb. He was truly convincing and moving to watch. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler also gave magnificent performances.Even though i thought the phantoms voice was a bit poor in places, his emotion in his songs came across really well so it didn't really matter. Emmy was just beautiful. Although i have heard the music before i have never seen the stage show, it was just such an amazing experience.You must see it!!",The Phantom of the Opera

I have to say that at the end of each viewing the audience sat in SILENCE with no one leaving their seats or talking for several minutes. That is how it affects you. The music haunts me waking and sleeping it is so moving. My 14 year old daughter said, ""Mom, do you ever listen to music and it just makes you want to cry, not because of the words, but just from the way it sounds?"" I couldn't have said it better. It was an experience I will never forget. My husband and I both agree this should get an Academy Award.

Now that I have seen it at the movies, I will tell everyone that I know that they should go see it if they haven't already. It well be a movie that I will go get right away when it comes out for sure and also I will have to get the sound track to it since the music was so well done.

I always hear about the Phantom of the Opera & decided to see what the fuss was about. In a word...WOW!!! La Carlotta was a nasty piece of work - a great credit to the acting skills by Minnie Driver - I wanted to smack La Carlotta lol.I felt sorrow for what The Phantom had endured as a child, felt the love between Raol & Christine and fear from Madame Giry for how Erik will retaliate.Like I said, I'm far from being fan of opera but these songs stick in my head & I find myself singing along.One of the greatest stories for all time.",The Phantom of the Opera
1672,zjohnsonj,"I hope the stage production is shorter, and more tightly produced...",6,7 February 2005,"I am a ""Phantom"" virgin, and have never seen the stage production, so I hope that my impression of this piece AS PURELY A WORK OF FILM will help to provide a critical point of view amongst all the praise.There is no doubt - absolutely stunning sets, costumes, cinematography and lighting.A common flaw in productions of well-known works is the inability to cut material, for fear of offending fans of the work. Add to that a producer who's promoting his own work, and what you have is this current version of ""Phantom"" ~ overlong, undefined, and static.What happened? The concept of film is to tell a story visually, and yet I was left with the impression that this film never succeeded in finally letting go of its ""staged"" roots to embrace its new medium. Great sweeping camera angles and unbelievable (literally) sets were mixed with the likes of the awful ""Masquerade"" blocking and choreography (Busby Berkely needed here), and laughable first cemetery scene of a heroine wandering back and forth across the same set (where WAS she going?).I sensed a film trying to do ""Moulin Rouge"" and yet never brave enough to go all the way, hence the final result is confusing mix of styles.Not being familiar with the music, I walked out of the tearer with the impression that the score consisted of about five songs, period. Everything ran together musically, although beautifully, into a blur. But I sure did remember the songs that WERE used, since they were drummed into my head, over and over and over.Great singing and matching of voices, but not the Phantom's. What (again) happened here? This man was miscast. He had a great lower register, but his higher, more ""expressive"" range was raspy and strained. This was a real distraction at critical moments of the film. His small stature also weakened group scenes (""Masquerade""); sorely lacking here was a physical dominance needed to convey a sense of command,fear and power.I did spot a few ""sample flaws"", both in ""Masquerade""; a folding table in the corner of the lobby, and the shaking window glass as the dancers pass by (c'mon, the building's made of marble and stone)...And too long. My present to the producer would be a copy of ""Film 101"", and a pair of scissors.",The Phantom of the Opera
1673,inmarofu,Great picture!!!,10,25 February 2005,"The new movie of The phantom of the opera is a fantastic movie. I saw it a few days a go, but I really wanted to see it since I heard about it, because I simply love the history. The actors have chemistry, but the movie doesn't show that, it only gives us songs, I know perfectly that this is originally a musical, the songs are fine, I love ""learn to be lonely"" and ""masquerade"", but the thing is that the actors are singing almost all the time and they doesn't lead us to their very true emotions. I understand that the actors brings us to their emotions through the words of the songs, but I was hopping that the movie would let the actors do their thing, I mean give them the freedom to interpret the role successfully, and let us see that they are being the person. In another hand, the photography is awesome, it has a beautiful sparkle that makes you just love the movie. I think that this motion picture could be done better than it is, I liked in this way, but would be better with a new few things.",The Phantom of the Opera
1674,nphull,Theatrical Take on a Stage Production,9,7 February 2005,"I have read a lot of negative review on this site and others that compare this movie to the original stage production, specifically the 1986 version. While I have never seen the original London cast, especially being 14 years old and in another country, I have listened to the CD tracks several times over and have fallen in love with the story and sound.In my opinion, the Movie does not disappoint. It is true that Gerard Butler cannot sing to the level of Michael Crawford, but in truth most people can't so that is not a fair comparison. Emmy Rossum toned down her operatic background enough to lend a more modern sound to her pieces as Christine and Raoul's voice was a near perfect match. The background music and cinematography lend to a full experience of sound and sight that you cannot get from a Stage performance.Considering most people cannot get to a stage to see this wonderful live performance, the movie does an excellent job of bringing the show to the screen. If you are die hard fan of the 1986 performance and sound, you will probably be very disappointed. This movie takes the story on a different turn, at least in reference to the Phantom himself.Still- the music is excellent, and visually it surpassed my expectations. I will see it at least once more in the Theatre before purchasing on DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
1675,Kyala6,I believe we're missing something,2,7 February 2005,"First off, we're missing the magic of this wonderful opera. And by magic I mean the fireballs the phantom is supposed to fling at Raul during their graveyard altercation. It appears the director was misinformed as to how that scene was supposed to play out. The last I checked there is no sword fight in Phantom of the Opera. I'm sure a quick run to the opera house to see how it is supposed to go could have helped, but I'm also quite sure those big-shot directors just don't have time for such trivial things when they have movies to make.Another thing missing, why yes, a song does seem to be missing parts of it. The second time our singers receive some notes (after the phantom has given us his play, ""Don Juan Triumphant"")who, according to Carlotta, is at fault? We never find out because it cuts to a loving scene with Christine and Raul and leaves out the part where Carlotta accuses her of being behind the whole ordeal. And then after the graveyard scene we are missing the rehearsal to, ""Don Juan,"" where Piangi cannot seem to get it quite right, so the phantom steps in and makes the singers move almost like his puppets. Basically, they cut this scene because in it, the Phantom would have had to have some sort of ""power"" over the singers, and the movie has in every way attempted to remove this ability from him. (hence the fireballs mentioned above)They have also seen fit to remove so much of the singing during the songs that it pains me to listen. ""Sing my angel of music! Sing for me!"" Apparently, Christine (and everyone else) wasn't listening. Also, our dear phantom goes crazy mad over the removal of his mask, yet at the end of the movie, when he is trying to get Christine and Raul to leave, he can't seem to bring that anger back. You would think he would be more angry now that she is leaving him for good, than he was because she removed his mask. Apparently he is more concerned about his looks than his love.(Though I'm pretty sure that's not the case in the opera.)Overall, if you enjoy the opera, and love real stars like Sarah Brightman, and Michael Crawford, then chances are you will dislike this as much as I do. The butchering of the songs alone brings a tear to my eye.I give it two stars because someone who has not seen the opera, will probably get enjoyment out of, what will be, yet another movie for them this year. To everyone else, do yourself a favor and get tickets to see the Broadway cast. You'll thank me later.",The Phantom of the Opera
1676,robeekay,Magnificent,10,10 February 2005,"Finally, the Phantom phenomenon has come to the screen as an opulent and romantic version of the stage musical. Small changes to the screenplay and characters have tightened the action and improved the impact of the story. The cast is uniformly excellent. Gerard Butler is a handsome, sexy, manly, compelling Phantom-what a great choice! As he sings, whispers, growls and occasionally bellows his way through the score, he brings the maximum in passion and pathos to the character. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are also excellent. The role of Raoul is difficult to keep from being dull, but the combination of Wilson's intense sincerity, plus a good old fashioned sword fight keep the hero from becoming a prig. Carlotta's role is much improved by Minnie Driver's over-the-top performance. One of the starring roles in the stage show is the chandelier's. Repositioning that moment for the crash was perfect for the emotional climax of the movie. I have returned to see this movie four times--something I NEVER do--and the Phantom is still ""there inside my mind.""",The Phantom of the Opera

I find this film to be more enchanting then any other film I have seen this year! There are still some things I frown upon. On scene particular is the fight scene in the cemetery which doesn't fit into the beautiful flow of the movie it had up till then. Although that scene I didn't care for there are elements in the film I greatly appreciated. Such as the sets that are used for the Opera House that is amazing beyond compare as well as the many different customs used throughout the film. The acting and music, of course, brings the plot to life in a way it hasn't been done before. The main element in the film is the various emotions expressed through the actors and the music.

I have seen the musical play 6 times but feel that the movie is so much better and undeniably fabulous. I was especially impressed with Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom. He was mesmerizing and I was intrigued and beguiled by his singing and acting. I think he did a wonderful and different portrayal of the phantom but one that suited this Christine. Yes, he was sexy but that's what they wanted to portray in this film, more of the love story than the horror aspect. I think Gerry will be around for a long time and should go far in his career.

I thought it was absolutely breathtaking and outstanding. Just watching the scene when the chandelier was raised brought me to tears! I have never cried so much for a movie in my life! All of the actors were amazing, they could not have selected a better cast. Emmy Rossum was beautiful and I must say extremely talented, her performance of Think of Me brings me to tears every time I hear it. My absolute favorite, I have to say, is of course Gerard Butler. He was so gorgeous in this movie, I fell in love with him! Lots of people say they didn't like his voice and that it wasn't right for the part, but I have to say this. If you were to put a stage trained voice like Michael Crawford in the part (and we know Gerry isn't stage trained of course), the professionalism of the voice would have ruined the emotion that needed to be portrayed. I think Gerry has a beautiful voice, and he conveyed so much emotion, that even you notice as the movie goes on that his voice becomes even better, and what an amazing performance he did in his portrayal of the Phantom. (He deserves an Oscar!!!) I bought the soundtrack right after seeing the movie for the first time, and I have listened to it millions of times, and NEVER get tired of it. Congratulations to the cast, Joel Schumacher, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, you all have made an Oscar worthy movie in my opinion, and this will forever be my favorite movie of all time.",The Phantom of the Opera

1684,Edymnion,"No, its not Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, its BETTER.",10,12 February 2005,"I know a lot of the fans are going to hate me for this, but tough.Emmy Rossum is a young girl, with a beautiful yet not-quite-there-yet voice. Which is what Christine is supposed to be, a young choir girl. She's not supposed to be the perfect opera singer, she's supposed to be someone with boundless potential that hasn't quite reached it yet. As such, Rossum played the role perfectly. She sings like an angel, but doesn't have that overly disciplined tone to her singing.And whats really going to have people hating me, but for an on-screen performance, Butler was just hands down the better Phantom compared to Crawford. Butler's voice is deeper, and it lends a much more appropriate darkness to the part. He also injects so much more emotion into his songs that Crawford ever did. Some people slight him, unfairly IMO, for his voice cracking there at the end. For me, that made him all the better. the Phantom is supposed to be in a state of extreme mental strain, where he's on the razor's edge between sanity and loosing it entirely, and then falls off of it. The cracks here and there really help portray that far better than Crawford's high pitched rendition did.Overall, Butler made for a darker, fuller, sexier Phantom than Crawford, and Rossum made the better naive young girl than Brightman. I've seen people saying they liked Rossum better, but wished Crawford had been cast as the Phantom. Yes, because we all know how well it would have gone over to have a 61 year old man groping a 17 year old on screen. Yeah...Phantom of the Opera is an all-time classic production. And this is the all time greatest portrayal of it on the silver screen, hands down. Crawford was better on stage, but Butler owns the screen.",The Phantom of the Opera

Which is too bad, really, because I otherwise thought he was a wonderful actor. I also noticed that his disfigurement seemed to move about a bit until the end, when it covered the whole side of his face.I agree with whoever said the lip synching was a bit off, too. I wondered who sang and who didn't and was surprised to find out Minnie Driver (who is very amusing in this role, btw), was the only one who didn't.I've never seen the stage version so I wasn't prejudiced by that.

The music is by far more beautiful than many things my ears have been graced with during my lifetime. A true work of art! I will never be able to get enough of it! I believe this film to be one of humanity and love. The phantom sought love from others. If he had received the love that he needed when he was a boy instead of being shown as an object in a cage, he would not have acted the way he did. The phantom was by far the most identifiable character because he was the most human. I felt I could relate with him the most. He was one that ""secretly yearns for heavensecretly dreams of beauty,"" and longs for acceptance and love. He is the true hero because he was the only character in the movie who faced the real struggles of life. One could not help but pity him and wish to tell him that he would be loved and accepted by them. I really wanted to tell him that everything was alright because there are those out there that would love him. I believe that because of this mysterious and very human character, the story was more interesting and intriguing. After having watched this movie, I was left wrought with emotion. An awe-inspiring masterpiece this film was, indeed. Humanity and personal flaws are what make for the most relatable characters and the most awesome stories.

After listening to it many, many times, and wearing out the LP, I was happy when it was available on a tape, and after I wore that out, I was thrilled to have it on a CD. By this time, I was certain I knew every word to every part of the music, but wanted so badly to see it performed on stage. Finally I was able to do so, and paid the hefty price of a ticket to see it at Toronto's Pantages Theatre, where I cried through most of it, just due to sheer excitement. (A couple of years later, I was able to get back for a second chance!) I loved the stage play, but of course, the sad part is that you can't just watch it when you want to. I wanted somebody to make a movie. Well, somebody did... Mr. Shumaker did the most incredible job, and I was absolutely as enthralled at the movie as I was the first time I sat in the Pantages Theatre! Everything about it was wonderful, and I am now patiently (not!) waiting for the day the announcement is made of when it will be available on DVD, so I can truly watch it whenever I want!! If you haven't seen it yet, GO!!",The Phantom of the Opera

Boy, were we wrong...",10,15 February 2005,"This was the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Before I saw 'Grease' I absolutely hated musicals. Now, I don't know how I'd live without them. Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine, was amazing. I had never seen the stage version, but I don't think I need to. The young actress was unbelievable, gaining her reputation by staring in low-budget television projects and ending up on the big screen. When I saw 'The Day After Tomorrow' I didn't think she was good enough for the role of this film...I was wrong. The music was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off the film. The entire thing was magnificent. A beautiful film that surpasses all others of its genre. If you haven't seen this yet, you're really missing something. A handful of theaters are still showing it. You shouldn't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Wonderful.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have already seen this movie 17 times within one month. Cannot get enough of it. You can tell that the Phantom of the opera is in my mind... If you like music this is a movie you must see and I am sure you will never forget it.Although the movie is a little bit different from the stage production, which I have also seen, but it doesn't matter. It is still great and enjoyable. I remember when I first went to see the movie, I spent all the time sitting on the edge of my chair. I didn't know what was happening around me - all I knew there was that great music and voices and I was lost to the World. When I went to see the movie the 17th time last weekend - I still felt the same. Speechless.... with my heart pounding... tears falling down my face... Never have experienced anything like that in my whole life. Mr Gerard Butler's performance is one I will never forget. In my opinion he is the best Phantom I have ever seen, and I am sure I have seen all the versions. What a talent! What a voice! What a power! Mesmerising eyes! And what a handsome ""gargoyle"". Even the mask didn't cover his charm. Miss Emmy Rossum; the most angelic voice ever. Makes you want to fly.... Great actress for that role.And talented Miranda Richardson; you can always count on her!Mr Joel Schumacher you chose well.I think this movie should get at least two Oscars. Good Luck!I cannot wait for the DVD to be out so I can buy it for my private collection and then watch it over and over again. Until then I will just keep on watching it.",The Phantom of the Opera

The music is truly magical and the characters are absolutely fantastic. I have never seen The Phantom of the Opera play but when I was in choir class we sang on of the songs from the play and I loved the song. I wanted to see the play after that but I live in a small town and we do not have big plays like that. I was sad because I wanted to see it and there was no movie at the time. When I found out that they were making a movie about The Phantom of the Opera I was very happy and excited. I've watched it three times already and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves music, magic, and wants to have the same experience I did.

1695,cclrnmas,stage vs film,8,16 February 2005,"I have seen the Phantom of the Opera in 6 cities, including London and can say that the stage presentations in each of these cities varied somewhat.The best performance was in London, however the best theaters, physically,for these musical were in Boston and Chicago.I feel that many of the critics who were more harsh in their comments were comparing the live stage performances against the film. There is no way that that is a fair comparison.These performers showed a wide range of talent and emotion that surely came thru more in the film than on a number of stage performances I've seen. Like many, I've seen the film a number of times, 7 to be exact and each time just as in the live performances,there are differences that make the whole more enjoyable.I'm looking forward to the DVD coming out and hope that it will contain all the extras of behind the scenes especially exactly how they made it.Thanks.",The Phantom of the Opera
1696,wbgi,Excellent Movie! (But then I'm a fan of Webbers musicals),10,17 February 2005,"I saw ""Phantom of the Opera"" twice on stage (both times in LA) and I have the Broadway soundtrack memorized. I have been anxiously awaiting the Phantom Movie since I first heard about it way back in the 90's. The long wait is finally over! The movie was everything I had hoped for and more! My husband, who is not a great music aficionado, also enjoyed the movie. I was bothered by Gerard Butlers rough voice the first time he sang, but by the end of the movie I was convinced that he was the perfect phantom--the rough edges in his voice just add more emotion and feeling to his performance, and thus made it more realistic and believable. Minnie Driver is a superb Carlotta (even if she doesn't do her own singing), and Emmy Rosebaum is beautiful in the role of Christine. This is a movie I could see again and again, and I am definitely buying the DVD when it becomes available.",The Phantom of the Opera
1697,angelsithdaughter,Wonderful,9,17 February 2005,"I gave this ten stars because considering the fact that it was the first time that I'd seen any version of The Phantom of the Opera, I thought it was wonderful. Andrew Lloyd Weber does a wonderful job with the music, it was just enchanting, especially The Point of No Return. I thought that that song and The Phantom of the Opera were extremely good. The others are enchanting, and my father's favorite is 'Masquerade' and 'Angel of Music'. Overall, I think that they did a wonderful job and the music was incredibly enchanting. I'd never seen a musical before, except for one scene in 'Cats,' and that was horrible. Thank you for such a wonderful film, ALW and JS. It was a real treat to watch because of the extreme beauty of the interaction between Raoul, Christine and the Phantom himself. Gerard Butler does an extraordinary job considering the fact that he'd never sang before.",The Phantom of the Opera
1698,Mckanz12,Great Movie,10,17 February 2005,"It was a fantastic movie. In my opinion Gerard Butlers voice was much better (especially in the unforgettable Music of the Night) than Michael Crawford's voice. Gerard Butler's voice is deeper and scarier, but can be high at times and seems so much more fitting to the character then Michael Crawford's voice. Even if you did'nt like Gerard's voice you have to give him some credit for his very thick Scottish accent. When speaking its hard to understand (maybe I was in shock because the accent was so much different and seemed thicker I don't know, and to completely drop it to sound American and sing like that...awe inspiring. Emmy Rossum for that young age of 17 sang exquisitely. Though the movie was wonderful in all, the play is basically better no matter what. The costumes were much more colourful, and the special effects were limited in the play but still extremely well done.",The Phantom of the Opera

They couldn't have chosen a more perfect man to play the Phantom. All in all, I thought that this was an amazing movie! After I went to see the movie my friend & I went to buy the soundtrack, which is wonderful as well. I loved everything about this movie. Emmy Rossum does an amazing job of playing Christine. She has an absolutely breath-taking voice. Patrick Wilson was also amazing. I mean, I've saw this movie 5 times and I want to go see it again. I loved this movie.

Phantom absolutely lived up to the Broadway play. They actually sang, absolutely amazing. The movie was flawless, I actually felt as though I was sitting in the theater watching a live performance of the play. The songs sounded wonderful and each performance was absolutely amazing. The cast was perfect, every person actually filled the role perfectly. A standing ovation to the entire production and directing team. BRAVO, ENCORE ENCORE!!!!!

I must have changed my mind about the ""Phantom"" ten times. This movie had great depth and dialogs. and the performances by Emmy and the rest of the cast was truly remarkable. They all showed great passion and talent. This movie is so great for the whole family. i know a great number of people ranging from anywhere between five years old and 63 years old and they all absolutely adored ""The Phantom of the Opera"".

1702,pattibarrett,"""PHANTastic!!!""",10,20 February 2005,"Let me start of by saying... that no one, and I mean NO ONE can ""swoop"" a cape like Gerard Butler. With that said... here is my official review of the motion picture. While I understand why many have baulked at the movie version of Phantom of the Opera because they have been raised & succored with only the Broadway play, I would have to disagree with those who have ostracized the film. I know the Broadway play had elements that were essential in creating the perfect atmosphere on the stage for Phantom of the Operasome of which, the motion picture omitted. However, there was a higher ratio of elements that the motion picture brought to life, that the play was incapable of creating, and never could have the capability of simulating. The cinematography for the film alone set a mood that was untouchable. Movies these days are just a bunch of fluff, comedic relief, T & A and absent plots. It is rare that a movie comes to the screen and leaves an infinite impression in the viewer's mind. Finally, someone had the nards to stand up, rebel against cinematic-conformity and create a musical of a beloved and well-known Broadway play. Is this dangerous? Yes but highly applaudable! And not only did Andrew L. W. and Joel S. have the fortitude to bring this recreation to the big screen, but they made it ASTONISHING! The music, the cast, the cinematography, the suspense, the emotion, the theatrical elements, the similarity between the play and the film, and the overall look and feel of the movie was Tres Chic!! And when it comes to the countless times I have read media and individual reviews rebuking Gerard Butler's ability to sing... I have to admit that I was impressed. Sure, he is not one of the Three Tenors, or the original ""Stage Phantom"" for that matter. With that said, neither is anyone else in the ""Film"" from the original ""Broadway Stage Cast""... because this was a FILM there is a vast difference between the two. No 'one' person can take the place of another in any situation. I was proud of Gerard B. for having the courage to accept a role that required him to sing, when he had no musical background. And from what I saw and heard... he rose above his challenges. What he lacked in musical ability, he made up in his acting. He was the perfect phantom! I am recommending this movie to anyone! I am telling everyone to go to the movie without previously reading ANY reviews. It is common knowledge that humans are lemmings... they conform to what a majority is saying or doing. Be a free thinker, don't let ANY review tell you how to like or hate a movie. Don't let someone else tell you how to feel about something... go out and see it yourself. Decide as an individual... be a critical thinker. Think for yourself... and enjoy... or don't... and if you don't like it... no worries... because it leaves a seat open for me at the theaters. BRAVO!!! BELLE!!! ""PHANTastic""!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1703,tjularbal,awesome,10,2 March 2005,"Great movie of mine. Loved all the songs. I thought the costumes were amazing. Everyone in the cast did an great job. The production I was amazed with it. I hope more of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals make a leap to the big screen. I have bought the cd & constantly listened to it. I might have to buy a new one b/c I'm wearing out my cd. :) I think they should have won best original song at the Oscars. They were cheated out. I really thought they would win in that category. I didn't even know that Motorcycle Diaries was nominated. Beyonce did a good job of sing ""Learn to be lonely."" At least she did not kill the song.

1705,skittlicous514,What was he thinking??,6,21 February 2005,"I have seen the Phantom of the Opera theater version countless times and have seen the movie version twice. The first time I saw the movie I didn't really like it but I figured I must have been tired or in a bad mood because I listen to the Broadway recording all the time and love it. Well, the second time I saw it I liked it even less. The singers were just not up to par with the orchestra and the music. Gerard Butler obviously had never had any form of vocal training at all. Emmy Rossum was too quiet and had no hold over the audience. And whoever played Raoul looked like a girl. The casting was terrible and the director focused too much on how the scenes looked than sounded. The mixing was horrible. The costumes were beautiful but I would have rather had them in rags and sounded like the original cast. It was a complete let down. I have lost some of the respect I had for Mr. Webber and hate to say it but I will never have the same feelings when I see my favorite show ever again. I could not believe how tragic it was.",The Phantom of the Opera
1706,Jackyboy2k2,The most amazing film I've ever seen,10,21 February 2005,"This movie was spectacular. The cinematography in it is amazing. Many critics down this movie, and I ask myself why? The Phantoms voice is rough at times, but extremely powerful. Everyone I ask says he has a ""bad voice"". This is not true, he has a great voice. At times it isn't perfect, but the rough rock-star sound of it fits perfect with his character. His character is in his voice. At times his voice is loud and scary, and others it is soft and gentile....this hybrid of emotion is the very makeup of his character. Half bad, half good. Christine has a beautiful voice, as does Raoul. The dancing and costumes are beautiful, and the the music is perfect. The acting is amazing, so many emotions, so many choices to be made. This is a very old story, no matter which way you look at it. The old fashioned adage of the mysterious ghost ""living"" in the opera house is always a chilling and awesome story. Andrew LLoyd Webber produced and directed the music for the film, so it is pretty accurate to the 1986 production. It soothes the senses of hearing, and seeing all at once. In todays day and age, you don't really see that too often. On the big screen, musicals are pretty much a dieing breed. The movie truly is a work of art. It is so beautiful, and is not something one in this day and age sees often. Every part of the film touched me.The movie is shot in a modern style, but still holds true to an old fashioned mantra of fantasy, and romanticism. Great film.......go see it.......NOW.",The Phantom of the Opera

I must comment on Emily Rossums performance, for she is only 17 in that movie and has one of the best voices I've ever heard. Although i do find her character debatable, she was a wonderful Christine. Gerard Butler was fantastic also. The scenery and costume's were created pure bliss for everyone in the audience, especially the Masquerade scene. The many costumes were beautiful in black, gold, and white. I also especially enjoyed the scene of Don Juan when Christine and the Phantom sing and dance as passionately as any couple i have ever seen in my life. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, because it is beautiful,mysterious, romantic, tragic, and action packed, a sure win for anybody.",The Phantom of the Opera
1708,milady-agus,An amazing adaptation that will leave every fan completely satisfied and a great point of entry for those who never knew the Phantom existed.,9,21 February 2005,"I entered the theater with mixed feelings. I have been in love with the musical (and the Phantom) for at least 8 years, and, as I'd never been able to see it on stage, my mind had had complete freedom to re-create it as it fitted it best, especially after having also read the book. Plus, I always thought Sarah Brightman's and Michael Crawford's voices were insuperable (and I still do, hence my 9/10); nevertheless, Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are amazing. G. Butler makes an outstanding performance, giving the Phantom that Gothic hero's dark sensuality. Although his voice seems to lack the ""strength"" of M. Crawford's (in my non-expert musical opinion), the amazing visual portrayal achieved by Mr. Shumacher makes up for that slight lack. E. Rossum portrays an incredible Christine. She has the innocence of the original heroine and a very good voice that makes up a great Christine, just not the best ever; it is hard, if not impossible, to make a better Christine than that of Sarah Brightman. The only flaw in Christine (the character) is that, as a woman, I think any of us would have chosen the Phantom over Raoul any time, but that's just the way the story goes, right? I'm still waiting for a Gothic heroine to choose the dark man...I think this detail would have been solved by making Raoul a little bit deeper, not just as a Prince in shiny armor and riding a white horse, we've outgrown that. Anyway, this is irrelevant to the discussion of the movie, since it is an adaptation from a musical that, in turn, is an adaptation of a novel. The changes and additions to the musical are really interesting and to the point. And the direction is impeccable. How the director played with the visual stimulus is in perfect coordination with the emotions the music conveys. Those of us that loooove the Phantom needed a movie like this one. And those who never even heard of it, but find it appealing will be completely seduced by the story. All in all, an excellent movie that surprised me every second. As opposed to what I had expected on entering the theater, I left in awe and completely in love all over again. An amazing adaptation that was even able to match my expectations. Piece of advice: if you're not into musicals and/or Gothic tales, just skip it; and Ladies (and some gentlemen too): a box of tissues is a MUST, I lost about half the water in my body!",The Phantom of the Opera

I was disappointed that they did not receive more nominations for Oscars. I thought Gerard Butler's voice was perfect. I even liked his speaking voice.

The sets are brilliant. I certainly would like to see more movies up to this standard. You certainly are glued to your seat throughout this movie.

I also can't believe it wasn't nominated for the Oscar-Best Picture-because I truly believe it deserves it. What's wrong with Hollywood that they can't see a movie of such extraordinary quality? The music, costumes, acting and sets were gorgeous. The story was intense and multi-layered to the max. They really pulled out all the stops on this one and went over the top, but it really worked! It is such a classic 19th century fantasy with a heroine pursued by two amazing suitors! (They don't make guys like that anymore!) The Phantom was the most sublime artist ever (georgeous guy that I'm sure lots of women would go crazy over!) For me, the genius of this movie was in the details. The subtle gestures and nuances of imagined touch between the Phantom and Cristine and between Cristine and Raoul. There's some truly extraordinary sexual vibes passing between Cristine and the Phantom when the Phantom leaps on stage and sings ""Past the Point of No Return"" with her. If they were really alive, I'm sure they'd never forget it! I found this movie a million times sexier than 90% of the movies that are made that are suppose to be sexy!! I'm sure I won't see a movie like this again! Bravo!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

The beginning is breathtaking; the transformation of the theater left me staring at the the screen while the overture played. I have seen the stage production once, and the movie was a very big step from it, but not in a negative way. In fact, it added just the small bit of story that left me more satisfied with this movie than with the Broadway version. The voices of every character were stunning, just the way they should have been. And my very favorite part; the Phantom. Gerard Butler portrayed him beautifully, i couldn't have asked for a more brilliant performance. What more can i say? I know i'll be seeing this one again- very soon i hope, and you have to see it too. I'ts the most powerful film i've seen for quite some time, and you'll be missing out on a great experience if you don't go to the movies to see the Phantom of the Opera.",The Phantom of the Opera
1713,DramaQueenKT2006,Top Notch Acting and Set ( Not Singing) Makes Film Excellent,8,23 February 2005,"This movie didn't come to our town until Presidents Day Weekend. I had been dying to see it so I dragged my little sister along for the ride. I have been a ""Phan"" since I was about 3 years old. I saw the stage production the last year it was in Toronto, and loved it obviously. Because I loved the stage show so much, I was VERY skeptical to go see the movie. I was very surprised to find that I really liked it. It gave me chills the moment everything started going into color and the overture started playing. My jaw dropped, and I got chills. It was definitely a good start... However I didn't really believe that was Minnie Drivers voice so that kind of bugged me, but she nailed the accent and the attitude!! Fabulous Acting from her! One thing I love and envy is Emmy Rossums beauty. She is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!! I couldn't believe she was 17! Her voice at certain points sounded perfect for the part then at other points I was like... "" Uh... No..."" As for Patrick Wilson he had the best singing voice in the movie and really didn't get to show his acting so bummer. Gerard Butler.... OH MY GOSH!!!!!! HE WAS WONDERFUL!!!! He nailed the part of the phantom acting wise. Singing not so much but acting OH! was perfect. He made the character so sexual and enticing. He had me coming out saying "" Why didn't Christine Pick HIM!?!?!"" that didn't happen we I saw it on stage. He was brilliant and it helps that he is very very SMOKING HOTT! LOl who cares if he's 36! So I'm going to wrap this up... go see it the costumes, acting, and art direction our awesome. 5 stars! Singing I'd say and average of about 3 to 3.5 stars. In the end GO SEE IT!

I saw the stage version in Lodon, Ont. with Colm Wilkinson and I thought I would hate the movie phantom. He won me over within 5 minutes. All the acting and singing is just phenomenal. Beware, though, this movie is VERY SEXY!!! My husband and I saw it on Valentine's Day and almost skipped dinner after the movie and went straight home!!!! This is not your mother's phantom. You learn so much more in the movie. The symbolism is incredible as are the effects. Sets and costumes are stunning! One to see again and again. Minnie Driver was sooo funny going on and on about her ""puppy"". She was a perfect pout. The roof scene (All I Ask of You) was filled with tension you never really see in the stage version. Being able to see such depth of expression on the actors faces added so much to the movie version. I also realized in the movie that Christine's father was a famous violinist. Notice how many of the musical themes belonging to Christine and the Phantom feature the violin. The movie also brings out the Fruedian theme of Christine's love for her deceased father and her not really knowing if her father is the Phantom or not. Go see this movie. It is worthy of all the praise it receives and more!",The Phantom of the Opera
1716,little_joes_rose,Sexuality = Womanhood?,8,3 March 2005,"From reading some of the comments for this movie, I've noticed a couple statements who's authors seem to consider as synonymous womanhood and sex/sexuality. From what I can understand from these particular comments, it appears that the authors consider one of the feminine gender not yet a woman unless they have experienced a sexual awakening. To be ""aware of her sexuality"" is to be a woman. With due respect, please allow me to disagree. My opinion is that sexuality is an over-estimated criterion for womanhood. I am not saying that sexuality does not or should not exist as a part of womanhood, I am simply saying that the use of or the ""awakening"" of sexual abilities is not a necessary requirement for a female to be considered a woman. Mother Teresa of Calcutta practiced chastity all her life, yet is there one who would claim that she was less of a woman than, say, Madonna? In POTO, Christine is pulled in opposite directions, torn at times between Raoul and the Phantom. It becomes a battle between physical/sensual fascination and spiritual love/Agape. In the end, Christine chooses spiritual love over sensual attraction. Why? Because physical attraction alone is shallow and it does not endure the test of time. Once one has gotten their physical pleasure from another, of what further use is that person? Does a person keep the carton after all the cigarettes have been smoked? Sensual ""love"" then, is transitory, fleeting. It is a sensory pleasure, something felt on the surface. How can something superficial differentiate between girls and women? Isn't it rather spiritual, mental, emotional maturity--something that rests inside--the measure of a woman? To say that one of the feminine gender is only a woman because of a sexual awakening, is to say that women have no worth except in their capacity to give physical pleasure.",The Phantom of the Opera

I walked in there thinking this will probably be an okay movie, I walked out with my mouth to the ground and the music still playing in my head. I was just blown away! I sat still during the whole movie. My eyes were peeled open and my mouth was open. I was just in aw. Anyone who say this movie was bad, boring, it stunk what ever, have you ever made a movie? Probably not. And I know I haven't but I'm sure it's not easy, and it must've taken long to make. I think they did an excellent job, I can only say good things about it. It is the best movie I've ever seen, and am planning to go see it again this weekend. And as Is aid, praying to be able to see the play! Everybody in the movie did an amazing job, and I am left still in aw of it. I have become a complete Phantom freak! I hope this helped some people who were thinking twice about going to see it.

My breath was stolen as the chandelier rose to reveal the magnificence of the Opera House's glorious past. The acting was superb and I found the singing to be even more astounding. Emmy Rossum was wonderful, conveying both the innocence of her character's age and the raw emotions of undiscovered lust and sexuality. Patrick Wilson shined as the young and might I add handsome Roaul and served as a perfect foil for our leading man. And now for the Phantom himself, Gerard Butler. The first thing that came to my mind was, ""What a heavenly man."" Butler is, in a word, sensual. His voice is deep and alluring and quite frankly sent shivers down my spine. Though many seem to differ in this opinion, I think Butler was perfect as the Phantom. His acting doesn't appear to be acting at all, he simply was the Phantom. I found myself in tears many times throughout the movie at the raw emotion conveyed by this talented actor. I give the movie a 10/10. If you haven't seen it, get to the nearest theater quickly and let the ""music of the night"" and the breath taking acting and visuals surround you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1719,Mandy-leagh,The Best Movie Ever,10,28 February 2005,"I believe this movie to be the greatest I've seen in my life. Everything was beautiful and extraordinarily done. the actors were the best chosen for their roles. Every time 'Christine' would start to sing, I would get teary eyed. she was excellent. I left the movie theater in awe and speechless. I just couldn't find the words to describe how it moved me. I saw it once in an opera house when I was 10 years old and was glued to the seat in front of me and could not get it out of my head and when I found out that they made a movie, I almost fainted. I am very upset that it was not nominated for an Oscar for anything else then set design and music. I believe it deserves so much more credit. there is no doubt that I will be the first person in line to buy this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera
1720,Westernrider1968,Phantom was incredibly awesome,10,28 February 2005,"I was able to see The Phantom of the Opera an stage about 10 yrs ago. I was in complete awe then. I remember asking the friend that went with me, ""if we go back in and sit back down will they do it again for us"". I saw the film this weekend and I was once again blown away by The Phantom. Everything about the adaptation was extremely well done, from the casting to the costumes to the script. I was first introduced to the story by hearing Michael Crawford sing ""Music of the Night"", this to me has become the center of the Phantom and I judge all that play this role by how they perform that song. I know that some critics described Butler's singing as ""limited"". However, the moment I heard him begin ""Music of the Night"" I knew they had made the correct choice in casting Butler in the role. He brought a genuine tenderness to the character. Rossum's vocal and acting was absolutely superb. The changes that needed to be made for the adaptation, I felt, took nothing away from the story. I feel that those changes gave the story a more 3 dimensional feel that the stage production did not have. Something I did not realize was missing from the stage version until I saw the movie.I highly recommend seeing this film.",The Phantom of the Opera
1721,piya9868,Phantom of the Opera,10,2 March 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera movie, is one of the best musical movie I have ever seen. I'm not big on musicals, but after I saw the Phantom it changed my whole view of the whole story of the Phantom of the Opera. To my surprise, I loved it, not only was the singing good but the acting was great, and the story written fabulously from beginning to finish. The cinematography was amazing along with the music. The movie had my attention the whole time. It was as if I was mesmerized by it. I think Gerald Butler portrayed the Phantom perfectly, I was mesmerized by him from the start to finish. I was so captivated by his whole character, his signing, his looks, his portrayal of the phantom. The other characters were also very well chosen for their part. It was a perfect cast. I felt myself being drawn into the movie. I feel that this movie should have been recognized more for the great acting and singing. I feel that the Phantom of the Opera should have been nominated for more awards and won.",The Phantom of the Opera

The story was delivered beautifully and the casting was right on the spot. I was especially glad that they had a relatively young cast so i was able to relate to them more. Gerard Butler was a bonus for me because he is gorgeous I would have loved the movie even if he wasn't in it, but i am very glad that he is. His voice was beautiful and even though it has been months since i first saw The Phantom I still have the songs in my head. I am not usually a fan of opera but the score in this was so catchy that I couldn't help but love it. I have seen this movie over 5 times and I still do not grow sick of it. I am so happy that this movie was made. I just love it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1723,jojunk,Brilliant,9,3 March 2005,"The Acting was surprisingly very good, and the singing was even better. Wonderful to see a classic come to life on the big screen. I was amazed to find that some of the actors/actresses have been studying and performing opera for years to decades. The magnitude of the actors talent is only trumped by the outstanding directing. I admit i was skeptical about this movie being done by Hollywood. I feared they would forever ruin one of the all time best musicals. They didn't just meet high expectations for what i would classify as a good film, they exceeded them and then some. Cinematography was utterly brilliant. New composition was amazingly up to par with the original score. No distracting flares to dress it up, no repulsive deviation from original story lines. It was a breath of fresh air and culture that our society has long been in need of.",The Phantom of the Opera

In fact, we liked it so much we went back to see it seven times. I loved the costumes, the music, and the Phantom, Gerard Butler. It moved me to tears at the end of the movie. I thought most of the singing was pretty good too. I have listened to Michael Crawford's rendition of the Music of the Night and I like the movie version better. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals or to anyone who likes a little romance! BRAVO! Gerard Butler just smokes in this movie. He comes across as someone who you can't help feel sorry for and yet you wonder why Christine preferred Patrick Wilson's character. Love the music, love the movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

The singing was amazing, and the screenplay was amazing!!! Best Movie I've seen for a while! I bought the soundtrack too, which is pretty good! The cast was phenomenal, and the voices didn't seem to come from the people they came from. Actors did an awesome job of portraying their characters. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius. I cant wait for the movie to come out on DVD so that i don't have to keep spending 7 bucks to see it!! I really enjoyed the movie. It's definitely a feel good movie, but it gets emotional at some points!! Very sexy sexy men in the movie, especially the phantom, who is actually very good looking, as he has been seen in Tomb Raider 2 as Lara's old love interest, and very buff friend!! Appraantly good looks weren't the only thing working for the sexy beast. He has an amazing set of lungs!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1726,Christiesmom,"Powerful, captivating film",10,4 March 2005,"I fell in love today ... with the Phantom. He is the star of the show, not Christine. What fine acting in this film by the two lead roles. I hadn't seen either of them before in film and want to see more of Gerard Butler. This movie is a treat to the senses... the music so powerful. How great to see the virtues of humility and compassion so beautifully displayed. The romance between Christine and the Phantom is innocent yet sensual. The actress does an excellent job of portraying her captivation with the Phantom. Beautiful film. I saw it many years ago as a teen but this version is so much better. I took Mom to see this one (she saw the play and loved it). My aunt saw the musical and has been raving about it for years.

I cannot wait until this is out on DVD as i shall certainly be buying the film.It has been said by a few people that the film is too much like the stage show well DUH... of course it is like the show, as listed in the reviews etcto summarise this would be a good film for a loving couple to snuggle up to and watch on a cold winters evening",The Phantom of the Opera

It really captured the whole essence of what the original story was written about. I could go on to praise every little thing that this production has to offer, but I have to sum it up with ""absolutely spectacular""! I think that says it all. I was extremely happy to see Gerard Butler play the Phantom. He brought so much passion to this character that I had never seen before. I have seen the stage version and this surpasses even that.

If you are a fan of the stage version, you need to go see this film. You will not be disappointed at all. Lets talk about the music now. I can not think of any words worthy of describing it.

There is not one point in this film where it less than perfection. Although Christine and The Phantom should have ended up together. Gerard Butler is by far the best Phantom ever and he really put his all into this character, especially not being vocally trained he was outstanding in his performance. And Emmy Rossum has one of the best singing voices around. Patrick Wilson, although Raoul as a character was an ""insolent boy"" and ""slave of fashion"", i must compliment his vocal talents and his acting skills.

At points you could tell that they weren't singing but it was a rare site and I was looking for it. All in all it was great! The cast was very well chosen and I particularly liked the phantom, he looked exactly as I imagined he would and he is a good actor.

For his senior project he did little parts of different musicals. The first one he did was ""Phantom of the Opera"". Ever since I saw him sing in that I decided that I had to see the real thing. And when I saw it...it was just so amazing! And when I first heard Gerard(Phantom) I was so shocked because they sounded so much alike.I saw it three times because I loved it so much!! I also cried for all three of them because of the way Gerard Butler(Phantom) acts in a certain part of the movie. I was so amazed and astonished, it was just so wonderful. Ever since I first saw it I new right away that it was my favorite movie. I though that they picked the perfect people. Emmy Rossum(Christine) was so awesome. I just simply loved it.

My husband and I are both deeply in love with the theatrical version; it is a deep passion that we both share, and we were both excited yet apprehensive about a film adaptation...Then we got the soundtrack. And it was so lovely and so true to the stage version that we could not wait to see the film.Due to some various circumstances, it took us 'til tonight to finally see it in the movie theater...Oh, it's amazing!!!!!!!!!! It is heartbreaking and inspiring and it took our breath away and held us mesmerized. It is so gorgeously done and acted that it makes the heart ache from it.The cast was incredible - Gerard Butler was so sexy and powerful and sensual and tormented and fabulous...Emmy Rossum makes Christine her very own, and she is so effective with her expressions and acting, and so lovely and emotive - you can't take your eyes off of her.Look, I could go on and on and exude, but I will just wind up babbling for several pages, so I will spare you :) All I can say is that it is wonderful and amazing and if you haven't seen it - go see it; and if you have seen it - go see it again!!!!!! We will, and we will buy the DVD - probably one for everyone we know! And we will continue to go to the stage production every opportunity we get and be astounded, and it will be lovely to know we have this version at home to delight in as well.

I never tire of Gerard and Emmy's voices as they compliment the vocals and lyrics beautifully.I have to say that at first the different vocals surprised me, as we have all been used to the brilliant Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, however I feel that if you can push their style to one side, you can quite easily be caught up in the magic of their music.What more can I say - Gerard makes an impressive and handsome phantom, which you can easily sympathise with. And Emmy pulls off a naturally beautiful but innocent looking Christine. Many people have criticized it's over the top, Hollywood style glamour. Personally I feel it needed that to spark your emotions and add to the story, what the theatre production couldn't squeeze in. You must remember that it is a film production after all!

1737,marghe,Are you kidding me?,10,12 March 2006,"For the first time in my life I was asking myself, as I sat in front of the TV screen, what is wrong with all those people? Here, in this part of Europe, ""Phantom"" got the worst reviews. That's why I hadn't seen it in the first place. Now I decided to give it a chance, maybe it wasn't all bad I thought, or at least I should have watched it as I love musicals.I must have asked myself: why did they crashed this movie? about one hundred times during watching. Am I missing something? Or do I have such a poor taste in movies? Because I was stunned.First I must say I don't know nothing about ""Phantom"", I've never read the book (although I do have a copy and I plan to do it soon - especially now), I've never seen the stage show and, to be honest, all the songs had sounded the same for me. That I believe is good because probably if I have knew all above, I would have the same problem as with RENT, where I didn't like the changes in atmosphere between the show and the movie. Here I was just enjoying what I saw. So excuse me for reviewing it from a point of view of a layman.What I liked the best is the way Schumacher's movie works with the ALW's music. Because I must confess repentantly - the music is an masterpiece, absolute classic, it's spectacular and magnificent etc. I could go on for hours. But I believe that message has already been sent for the Broadway soundtrack had been a legend for years. If you heaven't heard it - Shame! Shame! Shame! The moment I loved this movie was the moment when the crashed chandelier is being pulled up and the first, thrilling notes of the theme song played. I was hooked.All right, Gerard Butler is hot. Every signs on sky and Earth show that he shouldn't be, but really - women don't mind and it works with the general idea of the movie. Because what shows better the change in the young girl becoming a women as not the wakening tension. This movie has this strange erotic atmosphere around it, but done with such taste that it heats up the audience but never crosses the line.Visually beautiful, moving and thrilling, with the very talented young singer and an actor who put life into the monster, this movie is a must-see. But the opinion of the critics is still a mystery, as most of the people here seem to like the movie. What the...? Anyway, don't always take reviews for granted. Go and see it for yourself. I've had this lesson just now.",The Phantom of the Opera
1738,katrin_ny,You should rather spend a night at the musical theater!,3,13 March 2005,"I've seen the stage show in Manchester years ago and 4 days ago in Shanghai with the London cast. Tonight I watched the movie. It's a pity: It's so much weaker than the stage show!!!In my opinion the whole show needs a strong (and strong voiced) Phantom. The movie doesn't have that. The voice is shallow and thin and shows a lack of deepness and darkness which is absolutely necessary for this creature of darkness. The other voices are quit nice but the Phantom really blows the whole show! The emotional ups and downs you have while sitting in the theater, not knowing which side she'll fall for, feeling sympathy and disgust at the same time, all this isn't happening 'cause the characters don't catch you! The goose bumps the stage show causes here turn to wishing there'd be a commercial break to have some time to recall the nicer off-movie theater version. Still the story and the songs are good and ""Christine"" is outstanding.It sort of feels like you read a book and then watched the movie ...doesn't work!To those who didn't see the Phantom before and don't have tho possibility to see It live I can recommend to watch it ...but in case you saw the stage show choose wisely whether you want to ruin your memories and warm feelings you may have for this musical.",The Phantom of the Opera

I am going to see this show again many more times. It makes me want to go see the Broadway musical. I liked it so much I even cried my wife laughed at me but then gave me a hug for showing my sensitive side at a movie. I think my favorite part of the movie was the first scene when the phantom is taking Christine into his cavern. I can't stop thinking about this movie. I went out and bought the CD the same day after watching the movie. I listen to the soundtrack nonstop and my wife now is asking me to not listen to it as much. Overall good movie and recommended for anyone. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!,The Phantom of the Opera

I can't understand why it had such bad reviews and why the cast was bashed so much. The Phantom, played by the sexy Gerard Butler, was breathtaking. Gerard Butler knew how to leave people breathless. There is something about him that is so damn sexy that you cant help but fall in love with him...and the character. The music and art direction was very moving. The story was very romantic and the music complimented the story immaculately. As soon as I watched this movie, I went out and bought the soundtrack and movie poster. This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone. Gerard Butler is one of the most gorgeous and passionate actors I have ever seen. Basically, seeing him in this film made me a huge fan.",The Phantom of the Opera
1741,karenlt24,The Phantom,10,23 May 2005,"He was the star of the movie. Dark, mysterious, sexy, even with his deformities. Or maybe it was Gerard Butler that made the Phantom sexy. His voice is so moving. His acting. The he moved when he touched her or she touched him. The way he looks at her. You secretly hope she chooses the Phantom. I would have. Emmy was wonderful too. Sweet, innocent. Her voice. I rented the movie. The next day, I bought it and the soundtrack. My favorite songs are Phantom of the Opera and Point Of No Return. You don't want the movie to end. You don't want the Phantom to leave her. He loves her so much. She loves him too. But he is obsessed. I don't know. There needs to be a part two, where he does find love. No there doesn't need to be. You need to leave some things to the imagination. My overview...this is the best moving, acting and singing I have ever saw. Bravo!! Everyone in the movie was wonderful. Gerard Butler was amazing.",The Phantom of the Opera
1742,endmost_dream,Brilliant!!!,9,9 May 2005,"To tell you the truth, when the movie had come out on DVD, i was skeptical to buy it or not.I read all the IMDb comments and all the critic comments you could imagine on the internet. Finally i gave it a go and bought it. Although i have never seen any Phantom of the Opera performance before, i was not disappointed one bit with this movie!. I thought it was great. The costume and set design was breath-taking and the singing was spectacular (i don't care what anybody says.. the phantom/Butler did a great job singing)The Phantom being somewhat good-looking i thought made the movie a bit more appealing and you actually feel some compassion for the Phantom. I really thought BEFORE i bought this movie that it would be flawed and i would hate it because of all the bad reviews it had received.. NOT ONE BIT!. i encourage every person to give this movie a chance and it no doubt will grow on you. It grew on me. Even if your not much of a musical fan, you will still be in awe by something in this movie. Personally, i wouldn't cling to critic comments or reviews because every person has a different taste, but i simply ask you..give it a chance, you may just become a dedicated phantom fan. Over all, the singing was great, the atmosphere was amazing, and all i can say is that i Loved it.",The Phantom of the Opera

The actors are great and I must say than I found absolutely amazing the lights and the camera set-up! The movie really takes you to another world e.g. the cemetery scene is absolutely fantastic with all the fog etc. You know its a set, but you can't believe it :). Well, thats cinema anyway ! It really is a masterpiece!!!! Thumbs UP !!!!! As for the script, it has some funny moments but it is NOT a comedy. It is a love story (in fact it is the first love story that I liked - I hate love stories...), but I assure you that it will please your eyes and your ears if you can deal with song-dialogs.

1744,allabouteve,It was Wonderful,9,21 March 2005,"This movie was so good. What a shame that it didn't wow the critics, since that seems to be what scared people away. It deserved to be honored with the other ""best"" movies of the past year. I don't know what it is that was found lacking - I've seen the show on the stage a few times, and loved it each time. True, on tour, it wasn't quite as sumptuous as in a settled production like Broadway, where I did see it once, but the music is gorgeous no matter what. And that really is the bottom line for me, although the production values in this movie were gorgeous. I've visited the Paris Opera House, and I felt like I was there again looking at the sets that replicated it. I had to get used to not hearing Michael Crawford, and even though that was difficult, I did do it. Emmy Rossum was beautiful in the role of Christine - a near-perfect combination of all the things that this particular heroine should be. I'll never get over how some folks despise ALW - I think that those were the hardest reviews to read - the ones where the critic stated at the beginning that he/she really didn't care for ALW, and then proceeded to bash the movie even more from that point on. Too, too bad about that.",The Phantom of the Opera
1745,aspenpeace,Passionate and hauntingly beautiful is the Phantom of the Opera,8,23 March 2005,"The music is hauntingly beautiful as the main characters play out their hidden and forbidden love for one another. The movie is grand and pulls you into the tragic dilemma of the Phantom. You feel his longing, and his pain. You sense Christine's faithful submission and confused emotions every time he is near. I think we can all relate in some sense with the Phantom about the loss of someone you longed to be with and never could. Grown men were wiping tears from their eyes as we left the movie theater. It was that moving. The movie and the music are wonderful and I will definitely own this on DVD. I live in Las Vegas and a major hotel is building a permanent stage to house Phantom which should open sometime next year 2006. I can't wait!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1746,rittercritter,"It was so good, I saw it with my husband and went back with my kids the next day!",10,24 March 2005,"I have had the original cast recording to the Phantom for several years but, living far from New York, have never had the pleasure of seeing the stage show. Thank goodness, Andrew Lloyd Webber saw fit to bring the Phantom to the screen for those of us who don't have ready access to live theater. I was completely enthralled from the moment the movie changes from black and white to color. I will admit that I was a little afraid that my husband would hate the movie since he has never seen many musicals; however, we were holding hands and, when the music started and the color changed, he squeezed my hand so tight that I knew he was hooked. I would have to disagree with critics of Gerard Butler who think his performance was not up to par. I found his performance to be absolutely mesmerizing. He brought an element of passion and anguish to the Phantom that makes it very believable that Christine could be drawn to him despite his disfigurement. The movie maintained its emotional pull throughout and when, the ending credits began to roll, all I could do for several minutes was cry while my husband said repeatedly, ""Wow!"" The very next day I went back and took my mother and my children to see the movie. They were just as awestruck as I was and again, by the ending credits, not one of us had dry eyes. The sentiment among us all was the same, we would have chosen the Phantom over Raoull even with his disfigurement. Butler portrayed him as such a tortured soul and his portrayal of the Phantom's passion in the ""Point of No Return"" scene could make the strongest knees weak. I give the movie a 10 because, in all the times I would listen to the cast recording and try to picture the story in my mind, I could not have asked for a better confirmation of the beauty and tragedy of this story.",The Phantom of the Opera

I play the music on the piano, I have two of the books. We have some collectors pieces, and I know all the words to the songs. I think Gerard Butler did an awesome job singing considering he has never took any lessons besides what he was just taught. He also gave The Phantom some character. Emmy Rossum did Awesome she was wonderful, she played her parts well and she sand beautifully. Patrick Wilson did good to, if you think mean can't sing out of the ordinary you are totally wrong because they picked out a cast to sing opera some very hard music to sing and they got these wonderful people. Minnie Driver sang well in her song 'Learn to be lonely' I thought she couldn't sing no offense to her but she sang really well.

I thought it to be an awesome movie, I have actually been in love with Phantom of the Opera for quite a few years now, so seeing the movie topped it off. I was in no way disappointed at all. I personally like musicals and above all I love P.O.T.O.. I loved the musical talent that was portrayed through the actors and actresses in the movie. They did a great job. I loved the costumes and whatnot. I think it was a great movie, and unless you just despise movies of that genre then I recommend people to go see it. I think a lot of people will like it. GO on and see it.Thanks Andrea.",The Phantom of the Opera
1749,gittelbug85,The drama of magic,9,24 March 2005,The movie was magical. The use of the black and white that fades into color was just the best. The actors were great. The music was with me days after i saw the movie. I've seen it three times and each time was like the first. I had seen the play a few years ago but the movie really made the story come to life. My only complaint was the age of the phantom i was under the impression he was supposed to be older than Christean but he appears around the same age. Becides the acting the music was great and made the movie more magical you will not leave the theater without at least one song in your head. Now all I have to do is wait for the DVD to come out and then i'll have the phantom all to myself.,The Phantom of the Opera
1750,quagmirelover,Awesome,10,28 June 2005,"I have seen this film fourteen times and I am still excited to see it. The acting is amazing and the singing is breath taking. Gerard Butlar got a lot of bad reviews for his singing but I think it suited the phantom perfectly.I fell in love with the Phantom;)Emmy Russom's performance was wonderful. Her vocals were unbelievable. I felt so bad for the phantom. I really felt his loneliness.Minnie Driver made me laugh with her character. She really is a ""bella Diva."" I would recommend this movie to everyone because of the wonderful acting, the beautiful singing and all the hard work and talent that has been put into this masterpiece . Bravo.",The Phantom of the Opera
1751,penkitten,Made me cry,10,28 March 2005,"I absolutely loved Phantom of the Opera. Words cannot express how I feel. The music is awesome. It's completely stirring and hypnotic. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius. The actors are superb. The supporting cast is wonderful, but the stars truly stole my breath away. Gerard Butler may be a young, sexy Phantom, but it suits this version of the classic very well. He's devastatingly gorgeous, tortured and emotional. His singing is powerful, moving me to tears. Even if I couldn't see the emotions in his face, I could feel them through his voice. He IS the Phantom - heart, soul and body. Emmy Rossum is a brilliant Christine. Her voice is angelic, her face innocent. She pulls you into her world, her confusion, her pain. Patrick Wilson is the only likable Raoul I've seen. He's brilliant and man, the boy can sing! He's born to play this part! I loved it! I cried at the end, I applauded the credits, I saw it 5 times!!! See it! Believe me - you'll love it!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1752,lsiegel-1,Best film ever made,10,28 March 2005,"Having never seen the stage play, I was curious -- and completely neutral -- when I first went to screen The Phantom of the Opera. The film knocked me out. I saw it once, and thought I might like to see it again. Then I saw it once more. After three screenings I was addicted. I've now screened the film 16 times and still want more, but it has left the theaters to my ineffable dismay. Never has a story or a film moved or fascinated me more. The tortured love triangle, the coming of age of the young opera singer, the conflicted agony of the Phantom...I have no desire to ever see another movie....it would just be a disappointment after riding the sublime emotional, romantic wave of The Phantom. Gerard Butler is the total package - a brilliant singer and actor who moved me right down to my toenails. Emmy Rossum was incredible for such a young woman. The costumes, music, sets, acting, orchestration, singing....every element is sublime. I can't begin to imagine why critics found fault with this production. It is perfection personified.",The Phantom of the Opera
1753,RegretfulPassion,"Not necessarily the best adaption, but a very good movie.",8,13 April 2005,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much. The vocals were very well done, and Emmy Rossum did an exceptional job of taking over the reigns from international superstar Sarah Brightman. Gerard Butler's vocal performance as the phantom is quite a bit different than Michael Crawford's, but I won't say it was necessarily better. Butler's voice is somehow more deep and dark sounding than Crawford's, and I think the movie version of this Broadway hit needed someone like that. Sometimes the special effects sort of drew away from the storyline, but it wasn't bad enough that you couldn't figure out what was going on if it was your first Phantom experience. In conclusion, I would very strongly recommend this movie to anyone, especially Broadway fans. Even if it doesn't quite live up to it's musical counterpart, it is a very good film adaption.",The Phantom of the Opera

Raoul was perfect..Christine was simply divine and Carlotta was a hoot...But the Phantom was what drew me into this movie...Gerard Butler was awesome.....He totally was into the character and with his masterful voice I simply fell in love with him....Some people said that they did not care for his voice...but I thought it was superb...it had range, power, deepness and the right edge needed to play the Phantom(loved the accent)...What really did it for me was watching his eyes...Those eyes that showed every emotion that the Phantom was feeling from laughter, anger, love to anguish...He made you feel these emotions too....My heart broke for him...For those who have not seen this movie....take the time to see it. It is truly a masterful film....Kudos to all involved in the making of this movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

The rest of the cast as well was by far the best. It was brilliant! The set was majestic, the costumes beautiful, and the voices were those of angles.

I was fortunate enough to see the performance live in San Diego about 6 years ago and just loved it. When I heard that they were going to make a movie of it, I was very excited to see it again. When I told my 14 year old son who listens to every imaginable type of music that we were going to see the movie, he looked at me funny but agreed to go. After the first time that we saw it, he was astounded (so was I). He could now relate every song he grew up hearing with a scene. He looked to me and remarked that all the songs are telling the story. I had to laugh and said, ""this is what I have been telling you about"". We have since seen the movie 4 more times, have pre-ordered it on DVD and will be seeing the live stage production version again this summer when it comes to town.

1760,B1CoolCat,Save the money and go see the play,5,5 April 2005,"I find it rather ironic that a movie based on an opera hired actors based on their looks rather than their voice. Having seen the play twice previously, I was quite disappointed to find the story very Hollywoodized. The flash back scenes were unnecessary as well as time consuming. Scenes were added with the idea of ""entertaining"" modern audiences, yet they come off as fake and do not coincide with what is currently going on in the film. Regarding the singing, there were more than enough ear splintering notes to make you wonder what will be the lasting effect on your ears. The Phantom more often than not spoke his words instead of singing, and with each attempt to create music, I found my self cringing at the off-key notes. Raoul and Christine were quite well, staying on key most of the film. Yet, as soon as I heard electric guitar accompanying a solo, I found myself wondering why I thought the movie could do the play justice. I suggest you save the money towards a ticket to the live show and allow yourself to experience the true music that this show was meant to convey to audiences.",The Phantom of the Opera

In past film versions and on the stage he is much more shocking to see and i did not feel that this was shown as well as it could have been. But his voice sure made up for that.I really cannot think of anything else at the moment, but i will rate this film as the best i have seen yet.

1762,kida3050,Wow,10,13 April 2005,"This version of the Phantom is incomparable to the others that have preceded it. The Phantom (gerard butler) is very seductive and enchanting. I totally fell into his lure with his passionate singing. Christine Daae (emmy rossum) was very sweet and angelic. You could see how she could win two peoples affection. Her very song is made the more charming when she takes the place of Carlotta, I still don't know why the managers would keep her. Raoul (patrick Wilson) seems kind of wooden and uncomfortable in the part. This was the first time I was introduced to The Phantom of the Opera and I was immediately hooked. I went out the very next day and got the sound track, later I got the unabridged sound track. Since then I have not gone a day without listening to it.",The Phantom of the Opera

If you've seen the play, don't be disappointed it's not as great as live theater but it's darn good for a movie. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. What else can I say about this movie? It was so good that I wish every one who can see's it on the big screen. (That is, if you can't see it on stage it's the next best thing.)

1765,PowderSnow,First time seeing the Phantom...,8,13 April 2005,"Prior to seeing this film, I had the idea in mind that all musicals were absolutely dreadful. Sure, I could stomach things like Moulin Rouge for a while but if I had any say in it, I would prefer my movies sans singing.However, when I saw the Phantom of the Opera film adaptation in theaters, I was pleasantly surprised. I was first taken by the costume and set designs, as they are absolutely gorgeous. I have nothing to compare to, but the actors, I feel, gave great performances for the most part. I wasn't too terribly fond of the Raoul character, as he was relatively flat, and the Phantom's voice was a bit strange at first, but I have come to like it. The music was great, very grand and quite beautiful.The songs were stuck in my head for hours... and even though I'm still not a huge fan of musicals or Broadway adaptations, I will be purchasing this on DVD.",The Phantom of the Opera
1766,jamespreaches,Not a complete travesty...some redeeming factors,5,13 April 2005,"Just having come from the theater I was intrigued by how often I literally burst into laughter. I have been associated with the Phantom for nearly 20 years of my life and after witnessing Hollywood's latest blunder, I can literally state a 50/50 mixture of pros and cons. The entire movie was a visual wonder but such was overshadowed by a virtual lack of emotional performance by several key cast members. Christine rarely blinked, hence giving an air of robotic dissidence. When you add her lack of facial expression and straightly non-tilted head, you almost got the idea she was just hoping to burst through to another scene based on the shrill performance of a piercing though often pleasing soprano. Raoul lacked any emotional performance, even during endearing moments between he and his love Christine. The Phantom redeemed the entire movie with his grandiose, yet vocally challenged performance. The additions of certain scenes including a SWORD FIGHT in the CEMETERY was appalling and only added to the arrogance of Raoul who suspected himself to be physically and mentally superior to the Phantom's genius. Finally the MASQUERADE scene was terribly uncolorful and only sought to offer the audience with an eyeful of blatantly produced choreography which stole from the stage production's opulence and brilliance. In short, if one has seen the Broadway production, you may find some times of joyous recollection in the movie version. But likely, you may find yourself doing as I did...laughing at times at this production. Please, ENTER EMOTION! Enter trueness to the original Broadway or even touring stage production. Do not seek to fool the audience with eye candy when what we desire is consistency from stage to the screen. I give this movie a 5 of 10. Enjoy!",The Phantom of the Opera

1768,ErikLover,Excellent!,10,18 April 2005,"Phantom of the Opera was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I saw it five times in theaters, and I loved it even more each time.I think that the movie is better than the musical because you can see the Phantom up close and you feel more connected to him because the movie shows you a bit of his past. You pity him more.Along with that, I think that Gerard Butler did a better job of PLAYING Phantom than Michael Crawford (I'm not saying that his singing was better, I'm just saying that more emotion was in his voice). I have listened to both the soundtrack of the movie and the CD of the musical (with Michael Crawford), and I think it is easier to listen to Gerard Butler and the rest of the movie cast.The movie itself was something to be marveled at between the costumes and the sets. The Phantom's Lair certainly was beautiful, as was the Cemetery. I think the Cemetery scene in the movie was better than the one in the musical. I have always been a sucker for swords, and I have to say that I was on the edge of my seat the entire sword fight.In conclusion, kudos to Joel S. and Andrew Lloyd Webber for making such a fantastic movie.

I felt for him truly and deeply and I think Gerard Butler gave one of the most emotionally solid performances I have seen since The Elephant Man. truly one of the best musicals I have seen, and the song ""Stranger than you dreamt it"" makes me just as sad as when i hear john hurt say ""I am not an animal!""

Anyway, The Phantom of the Opera, and especially Gerard Butler's performance, had an impact on me that I just can't describe. He plays the phantom with such intensity and vulnerability, that you just can't help loving and rooting for him, why did she pick Raoul...you know? The rest of the cast were also great, and the music and the look of the movie is absolutely mind-blowing.

I was in love with the movie until ""The Music of the Night"". If the Phantom was this musical genius that taught Christine to sing, it would make more sense if he didn't make an amateur's mistakes while singing. To many scoops and weak vocal areas to convince me that he is this maniacal musical genius.The film is beautiful without a doubt, some say it looks a lot like Moulin Rouge, I would say it doesn't look enough like Moulin Rouge. It's still gorgeous anyway.I've no problem with the other cast members, Christine (Emmy Rossum) is incredible and Raoul is as wimpy as he is supposed to be.

1775,AlexandraKeller,Let the dream begin........... let YOUR darker side give in.,10,26 April 2005,"I would just like to say that I have seen this movie about six times. Every time I take the time to notice the smaller things. Now I am a real fanatic, I saw the Broadway production when I was about 5 years old and fell in love. At the time I didn't venture that much further into the beautiful story. Last year I went to the library and checked out the book and almost immediately fell in love all over again. Then the silent movie was checked out too. The 2004 production blew my mind. The most favorite aspect I enjoyed was the portrayal of the Phantom himself. Gerard Butler pulled it off almost flawlessly. In the Broadway production the decision between Raoul and the Phantom seemed easy, he was deformed, Raoul was beautiful, however through readings I found that this was not the intention. Her decision was supposed to be difficult and this movie portrayed just that. As Gerard Butler made his debut in the movie in the scene where he takes Christine, played by then 16 year old Emmy Rossum, the women in the theater literally gasped. He was gorgeous. His eyes pierced through everyones heart, it was easy to fall in love with him. Watching all of the making of's with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, I found that they wanted to make it as modern as Webber intended in the first place. Afterall, Andrew wanted the Phantom to be portrayed as a rock n' roll kind of character, in that same scene you can clearly hear a little electric guitar, the perfect touch. The love triangle really tears at your heart and you can definitely relate to the young Christine as she grows into a woman with her childhood sweetheart and her mentor and ""badboy"" the Phantom. And not to hate on Raoul, Christine loved the Phantom, but was in fact in love with Raoul.No offense to her or anything, but I would have chose the Phantom. One look into those eyes and you find yourself rooting for him through the whole movie!",The Phantom of the Opera

Personally, I think it was snubbed for the Oscars. (I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.) Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver are fantastic.This is a Must-see!",The Phantom of the Opera
1777,schmauften,"Great film, a must see for all musical fans",10,24 May 2005,"This is a really excellent version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. It stays true to the musical although obviously there is much more freedom in a film than on a stage. I thought that the singing was excellent for a mainly young cast. I especially enjoyed Minne Driver's ""La Carlotta"" (although it wasn't actually her singing). All the other cast members sang their own songs and did them brilliantly. This is sung all the way through, so if you need talking and can't stand everything being sung, don't watch it. Aside from this it is amazingly directed and is a great interpretation of an amazing story that will entrance you in its spell",The Phantom of the Opera
1778,kmason5,"I was angry, but now I think I'm just sad ...",3,2 May 2005,"This movie had so much potential. Phans have been waiting for what seems like eons for a Phantom movie, and I definitely think they deserved something better than this. Whenever I read all these reviews praising the film and gushing over the actors and the plot and all that I can't help but wonder if we're watching the same thing. The thing that probably baffles me the most is all this talk about what a fantastic job the leading performers did. I bought the soundtrack to the movie before seeing it and was absolutely horrified at the obvious lack of vocal ability in nearly all the principles, the golden-throated Patrick Wilson and whoever dubbed in for Minnie Driver being the sole exceptions. I hoped that the acting would make up for the singing ... it didn't. Not that I place the blame entirely on the actors. Many of them simply were not right for the roles, most notably Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. Ms. Rossum has the wide-eyed, innocent ingénue look, yes, but that's about all she brought to the film, aside from a ridiculous amount of bare thigh and cleavage. Being only 17, she was too young to play Christine, who is supposed to be somewhat childlike, but a woman nonetheless. That transformation in Christine from girl-woman to woman at the end of the show is critical to the character, and demands from the actress not only a believable performance but a believable appearance as well. At the very youngest this role should have been given to someone in their early to mid-twenties, and definitely someone with a more trained and developed voice. Ms. Rossum's singing was more lounge singer than it was opera diva. Again, this was probably a result of her age. Her voice was not without potential, but definitely unsuited at this point in her life for such a vocally demanding role.And Mr. Butler ... The man cannot sing, and while some people thought his harsh, raspy voice added to the madman persona, perhaps they forgot about the fact that an indescribable talent for singing is KEY to the character of Erik, the Phantom. Any decent version of this story portrays him as a man with a hideous facade but a heavenly voice, which all phans should know. How else does he convince Christine that he is the Angel of Music? Certainly not by leaving the collar of his shirt unbuttoned to reveal his manly chest hair and parading about with a sword and cape like Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro. His portrayal of the role was also way off the mark. Erik is not a thirtysomething sexy madman Banderas wannabe with a ""deformity"" that looked like some sort of skin infection. It makes me cringe when I read all these reviews of people who swoon over how ""dark and GORGEOUS Gerry is."" This should immediately tell anyone who knows the show / novel that something is wrong. People have found Erik appealing because of his voice, musical ability and romantic devotion to Christine. He is not young and physically attractive, (that's the whole point!!) and attempting to make him so was painfully wrong.I'm not saying these people are bad actors. They were just given roles they were obviously unable to handle. Apparently the creators of this movie were so interesting in making their characters young and beautiful that they missed their most important goal : to preserve the story's original splendor. Dates got changed (the Paris Opera wasn't even finished in 1870, the year the movie is set in), characters got inflated beyond recognition (Mme Giry??), and the plot was completely twisted to more fully accommodate the Hollywood ""Awwww"" factor. The movie could not have ended the way it did if Erik was the age he was supposed to be (as in 45-50), and Mme Giry's story was unforgivably too similar to the novel The Phantom of Manhattan, which should make any phan shudder in horror.I do have a few positive things to say. The ensemble was quite good, and the orchestra was wonderful. Both are perfect examples of the trained and flawless musicianship everyone should have had. The costumes, sets, and overall art direction were also excellent. Patrick Wilson, as mentioned before, had a wonderful voice, and carried the part of Raoul pretty well, although he was a bit too swashbuckling for my taste. All in all, these few and far between bright spots were not enough to redeem the film. On the surface it appears to be beautiful and tragic, but I saw it basically as a superficial Hollywood vehicle for some up and coming young / sexy stars. I honestly don't think this is at all what phans had in mind when there was first talk about a Phantom movie over a decade ago. Too little too late, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.The thing that saddens me the most is that now people will pay eight bucks to see this instead of the standard ticket price to see it live, on stage, thinking that it's the same thing only cheaper. It is not the same thing. There will never be any film that can replace the magic and beauty of the stage version. I'm begging the people who have seen this and not the show to please, PLEASE, if you liked this movie enough, make the effort to see it on stage. There are touring productions. And you can get discounts on tickets with a student ID or through certain websites. Even if you don't have the money for the best seats it is still worth it to be there and see this show the way it was originally done! You won't be sorry. I really do apologize to the millions of people who apparently loved this movie, but I just love Phantom so much and was really hurt by the way this came out. I just want my opinion to be known.",The Phantom of the Opera
1779,molly12mccarty,excellent movie,10,2 May 2005,"this movie is so good. my history class went as a field trip and everyone enjoyed it. i can not wait for it to come out on DVD and buy it. the singing in the movie is phenomenal, and the acting is also incredible. i ended up seeing it 3 times. the costumes are incredible, and the settings are equally excellent. when i originally went to see it i was thinking it was going to be a boring opera. i could not have been more wrong. i loved it so much i couldn't get enough of it. i recommend this movie for anyone. it doesn't matter how old or young you are i guarantee you will like it as much as i do. i really felt like i was there, in the opera house. the acting seemed so real.",The Phantom of the Opera
1780,will-340,Phantom of the Opera - text book film-making!,9,3 May 2005,"I went to see this film over the weekend and was stunned!!!!. I have been teaching film & video production for a number of years and have to say that it is one of the finest examples of craftsmanship I have seen in a while. Like everyone else I am familiar with the score, and in this respect the film delivers exactly what it says on the tin. Where Phantom is particularly remarkable is in the direction, photography and mis en scene. There is enormous attention to detail. Tone, texture and colour are essential to this film and bear witness to the fine range of skills that the UK film professionals have to offer (this is uncharacteristically ""nationalistic"" for me). Schumacher's directorial choices are superb. There is a strong kinetic energy to the piece and the camera is beautifully choreographed to support the actors movements. Look at the subtle lighting design and how colour is used to draw us into the emotional framework of the script. The graveyard sequence is beautifully light with soft ""North Light"" reminds me of a ""Damned"" album cover. I was also interested in the way that Schumacher drew on influences from Belle et la Bete (check out the scene where the Phantom takes Christine to his lair), the cynic might say this was obvious - well, maybe. Eitherway this film is merits a much closer study. Enjoy.",The Phantom of the Opera
1781,fallingrise,Great Addition,9,4 May 2005,"All right, I admit, when I first saw this I didn't understand it exactly. I am a huge fan of Phantom, but of Leroux's book. And some other rather good adaptations story-wise made. I have seen them all at least a thousand times. I own Dario Angento's version, both 1990 T.V. adaptations, the silent film, read Susan Kay's 1991 novel, Claude Rains version, ""Phantom of the Paradise"", Some German version that I didn't understand a bit of, some thing called ""Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge"", and a whole lot of others. Seen every bit of it live, recorded, audio produced, written, that EXISTS that has to do with Phantom. But still this confused me. It has to cut a LOT of dialog from the stage play, both songs and just plain talking lines, and shortened Erik's past to a mere trifle that you'd think he could have gotten over after so long. There were also a lot of unreasonable points. For example, Madame Giry looks about three to five years older than Erik in the flashback scene, so, why is she so old and he so young when the story shows them 'all grown up'? I've never been an avid fan of the musical, to be truthful. I just loved the music and brooded over how I thought ALW made Christine a ditz. But then again, most other versions did, too. I mean, who would pity a poor girl in a love triangle who actually lies and cheats and USES her BRAIN to get out of a sticky mess? No. That's just not romance movie style. It worked in the novel, but, I doubt that they could pull that off in a movie or stage play. So, I forgive them. A bit.Gerard Butler is one of the greatest actors I have EVER seen. EVER. I've seen a lot. He set new standards for me, I think. Now, if he could sing, I bet every girl who'd seen the movie (Ages 8-80) would swoon as soon as the movie ended. He's very good looking and definitely strikes my idea of ALW's suave, sexy, sardonic Phantom. Of course, it's questionable WHY he where's the mask. In the movie, they really made it not so bad, and though shocking in the first two seconds then you're used to it and it's perfectly fine. But then again, that's only my opinion. But OH! If only he could SING! Then maybe all of those Michael Crawford fans would go easier on him. As I said, his acting was the best I think I've EVER seen, and I can't express that enough. He uses, unlike several actors/actresses that I've seen, very subtle gestures sometimes that can suggest certain thoughts and emotions, and it comes through very well. I admire that. But if ONLY. HE. COULD. SING. That frustrates me.Patrick Willson (However you spell his last name) was wonderful and no doubts about it. It's a thankless role, obviously, because everybody HATES Raoul from the musical because he's so darn insensitive. I mean, come on! Madame Giry tells this horrible twisted tale of a child's rejection and torture from his parents and the world around him and then tries to put in a good word for the guy, and Raoul says, ""But I think Genius has turned to Madness."" Basically he's saying, ""Well let's catch him and throw him in jail and torture him all over again anyway."" And in my opinion, just personally, I should add on, ""Because he wants my girl."" I think anyone could strangle him for that. But Patrick actually made the part of Raoul almost likable. Almost. To those who are open minded, of course.You'll notice that the critics are all insults, and that the movie won barely any awards or nominations and they didn't even have the decency to let Minnie Driver sing ""Learn to be Lonely"" at the Grammies. The explanation is simple! Look at the director's movie history. Remember that horrible movie that Hollywood practically died because of, the Batman one...? Yes! That was THIS director, too! Because like it or not, he made that, and though this was wonderful and should have been wonderfully acclaimed for the acting, set design, and costumes (And on that note everyone I've watched this with gasped breathlessly, ""Beautiful...!"")... It got practically NOTHING. Because Hollywood could never admit that Joel actually made something good. And the critics had to follow it. It's very political.But it was great, watch it, see what you think for yourself. I gave it a nine out of ten because of all of it's wonderful good points that after reading several other user reviews I know are definitely there... But I took that one point off because Gerard Butler couldn't sing so very well, even though you kind of warm to it toward the end, and it was obvious that, however beautiful talented and wonderful I and several others agree that Emmy Rossum is, she didn't sing as professionally as I know she could have if she hadn't had that big break from singing to do movies. If you're still deciding, note that all of the USER reviews (The people you aren't biased against the director) are positive. Very positive.",The Phantom of the Opera
1782,golden_willowbough,"A ""do not miss"" movie for all hopeless romantics",10,4 May 2005,"This is the Phantom as it should be. The added scenes and music, the unknown (or not famous) cast was a triumphant moment of genius. It just made this movie the best ever! I have seen Phantom on the stage several times but it wasn't until the movie that I could really understand why Christine was attracted to the Phantom and to Raoul at the same time. You don't need to be a psychiatrist to know that the dangerously sexual energy from the Phantom was irresistible to her but the safe, gentle and powerful love of Raoul was what she needed to live. It was particularly important to the whole triangle that Christine be very young and impressionable. An older actress would not have been believable in the part. Kudos to casting Emmy Rossum. Gerard Butler was amazing as the Phantom. His voice was just right, not over-trained, and all the emotion that the Phantom was feeling came through in each song. I like that his voice was gravely at times - it made him seem very real. All I can say is ""Bravo, bravissimo"".",The Phantom of the Opera
1783,carmen5731,Beautifully Done,10,4 May 2005,"When I first saw this movie I didn't know what to expect. I had seen The play on Broadway so I didn't think there was anyway they could bring it to the big screen. But as soon as the movie started I was proved wrong. How they did the flash backs was so beautiful and breath taking. The only problem I saw in the movie, was that the phantom was to attractive. I found it hard to consider him an ugly dis formed man, and his voice didn't do anything to help with that picture. Right when he started to sing Music of the Night I was pulled in. Emmy also has one of the nicest voice I have ever heard. To think that a young girl with that voice could take on a role like that is just so astounding. So I recommend everyone see this film.",The Phantom of the Opera
1784,browning_kt,Film Adaptation is Wonderful,10,5 May 2005,"I have been very lucky to have been able to see the stage version of the phantom of the opera and because of its magnificent theater portrayal, i was a little skeptical about seeing a film adaptation. I thought it may ruin my overall view of the musical by using Hollywood actors to play the leads in the production but...after watching the film i must say i thought i was back in the theater again. It was spectacular. For a little over the 2 hours it runs for i did not take my eyes off the screen. The voices of Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson were captivating and did the original version extremely proud. If you know the music you'll be singing along and if you don't then you'll want to at the end. The greatest Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is now on film and i recommend everyone see it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1785,RikkiBeau-1,A beautiful film,10,5 May 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera touched me in a way I can't begin to describe, you'd have to see it for yourself. the reasons why you should see it are endless. It has everything you need in a movie, it's a fun, romantic, and dramatic story, plus it's a musical which I think are the best kinds of movies. Emmy Rossum was brilliant, her voice is beautiful and unique. She really makes you feel her character's emotions. Gerald Butler's amazing, he blew me away, his voice is hard to explain, it's perfect for the phantom, it's bold and passionate. He really makes you have sympathy for the phantom, which I liked, they didn't really make much sympathy for him in the play. Emmy and Gerald together is like watching magic. They have a chemistry that'll suck you in. I actually wanted her to fall in love with the phantom and be with him. I didn't care that he had murdered a few people, Gerald portrays the phantom in a way that makes you want him to be happy. I wanted the phantom to finally be accepted in his life and finally get what he wants, that would've been so much more romantic. I was bummed when she chose Raoul. Patrick Wilson did a great job as well, playing the good boy, but I must admit, I am more of a fan of the bad boys. But it's like I knew the phantom was good deep down, he had just been hurt his whole life, so he had all this anger building up inside of him. It was all because of his face, which wouldn't bother me. The phantom's way more passionate than Raoul and it even seems like Christine wants the phantom at one point in the movie. But this movie will suck you in and it will make you feel like you are right there. I still haven't gotten sick of the sound track, I've listened to it at least 300 times! It's just pure brilliance, a true must-see. But it's for certain people, people who are romantic and love musicals, and people who are deep, people who will be able to understand what's going on. So, if this sounds interesting to you, what are you waiting for? Go see it! You won't regret it, I swear!",The Phantom of the Opera
1786,cmstrat-1,A movie to stir the soul,10,6 May 2005,"I seldom see a movie more than once - this was an exception. The acting, music, lyrics, set design and costumes tease the senses throughout the movie, while introducing almost every archetype of the human psyche; light vs dark, passion vs innocence, compassion and hope, vs frustration, pain, and despair, continually cascades and captivates the viewer through a spiral of shadows, sounds and depth of emotions, while at the same time illuminating the complexity we each travel and experience as human beings - including the masks we often tend to hide behind.A.W. and Butler in not making the Phantom hideous, allows Butler (and the audience) to make the Phantom their own, sensing the depth of his personal anguish highlighted by brilliance - struggle between turmoil, despair, hope, and in the end compassion - struggle between soul and physical boundaries that offer no exit, making the Phantom seductive in a healthy rather than garish manner and viewers who leave the theater wanting more.",The Phantom of the Opera
1787,actressonbroadway,The Phantom is in my mind,10,6 May 2005,"I just saw this today with my Theatre class, in preparation for when we see it as a stage musical next week. Instantly, I have to say, it has become my favorite film. The special effects are wonderful, I love it when the black-and-white beginning changes to color as the chandelier shines. The actors and actresses are fantastic - Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine, has a truly beautiful voice. Gerad Butler, the Phantom, also has a nice voice; as well as Patrick Wilson (Raoul). All in all, I love this movie for its scenery and sets (like the Phantom's lair), the remarkable music (who can forget the crashing chords when the chandelier is unveiled?), and its overall sparkle. ""Phantom"" has just enough creepiness to add to the music and romance. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it to anyone who loves music, theater, or romance.",The Phantom of the Opera
1788,efs94,Disappointing,4,7 May 2005,"Beware! If you have actually seen the Broadway play, this movie will be a disappointment! First, the live staging of the descent to the underground and the boat scenes--well, what can I say?--You can do anything in movies, but on stage it is a feat! And the screen doesn't capture the live effect of having a chandelier fall down on stage right in front of you. The masquerade--well live performance is hard to beat. Finally, the only actor who looked like she was really singing and not lip syncing was Minnie Driver and she was the only one who didn't sing her part. But I hadn't listened to the music in a while and it was good to hear the score. I'd forgotten how much I love it. So I went out and bought the CD--of the original Broadway cast. This phantom was OK, but he is no Michael Crawford. From a Broadway fan",The Phantom of the Opera

I have seen it many times and each time I feel so much for the characters, especially Gerard Butler. To me, he IS the Phantom (I saw the movie before seeing the play) and I cannot imagine anybody doing a better job than him! The singing was beautiful, Emmy has a gorgeous voice. I thought the choices for the roles they played were perfect. The ""Phantom of the Opera"" is one movie that will stay in my mind for a very long time. I really hope other people will give the movie (now DVD) a chance. The movie has a very wonderful story line (and little violence). It was nice to see a movie with real acting instead of special effects taking center stage. I have told many people about this movie and will continue to tell others of its beauty.",The Phantom of the Opera
1790,jomsmith2001,Phantom Was EXCELLENT,10,9 May 2005,"This movie was absolutely superb in my mind. I am a very, very big lover of this production. I have seen it live, own the score on CD and have now seen the movie and I believe they conveyed the feeling of this story beautifully. I am totally smitten with Gerard Butler as the phantom in this movie. I think he did an absolute superb job as did Emmy Rossum. I think anyone who loves good music and good love should watch it. The costuming and lighting was very vivid and rich in color and feeling. They did modify some of the music but it was well done and they were in my opinion good improvements. I would watch this several times in a day and already have, I was very nicely surprised as I did no think it would be this good due to the complexity and power of the live production. All the actors really conditioned their voices as well. WELL DONE!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

Now he songs the songs all the time, and so do I. Best! Magnificent! you get the idea. I've only had it for 5 days and I've already watched it like 10 times. My mom thinks it's annoying, but I like it. I'm not really into musicals. My top three are Phantom of the Opera, Grease, and Grease 2. In the movie, the new songs just go with the story so much, they each tell a story alone. Seeing the movie for band gave me so much more of an idea of the emotion in the music.

I am not one of those die hard Michael Crawford fans - though I did love seeing him live. I have seen the play many times after and have been equally thrilled. But Gerard Butler was weak, nasally, and unimpressive.The other characters were wonderful. Good voices and matched the characters well (though La Carlotta is stereotypically larger than Mini Driver). I thought the movie gave more background to the story and tied a few possible loose ends in the play.The movie is definitely worth seeing - but go into it knowing the Phantom's voice is sub par.",The Phantom of the Opera
1793,krwilcox,Beautiful!!,10,10 May 2005,"Awesome movie. The only thing I disliked is how they added a bass drum beat to the ""Phantom of the Opera"" song. They didn't need to 'rock' it up in my opinion. Otherwise a lot of simply amazing vocals, and an illustration of the phantom that makes you love him and hate him at the same time. The best movies in my opinion do not have static characters but characters rather that learn throughout the movie from their mistakes, etc... The Phantom realizes that his desires are evil and in no way deserved. This development near the end makes the movie a joy to watch. I also liked how the current clips corresponded with what was going on in the flashback, which was the story. It was a delight watching this movie, and listening to the soundtrack!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1794,normski-1,A great film expression of the musical,10,10 May 2005,"I have not been able to see the theater production of the Phantom of The Opera, so I was waiting for the movie to come out. I've loved the music from the original Broadway production, so getting to see the movie was a greatly anticipated event for me. From the very beginning of the film I was fully taken up in the world created. I loved the mythic texture and larger than life sets and cinematography. The music and singing are exceptional. I feel the singing voice of the Phantom is truly wonderful, powerful and heartfelt. I listen to the soundtrack daily. This is one of my treasured DVDs and CDs. My only reservation of the music in the film is that last song sung during the end credits. The country style singing just did not fit into the context of the film and detracted from it's appreciation. I usually stay till the end of the credits, but I strongly felt the inappropriateness of the last song and left early. Yet the film remains one of the greatest of musicals ever to be translated to the medium. My wholehearted endorsement goes to Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone in the film, especially to Gerard Butler who was fantastic as the Phantom in every way!",The Phantom of the Opera

I had never seen the Phantom of the Opera prior to renting to DVD, however, I'm slightly glad for this. I've had many people tell me that, had I seen it live, I wouldn't be one bit impressed with the movie. But alas, I found that the movie was completely and utterly breathtaking. The only thing I was upset about was that Christine left with Raoul. I had so hoped she would stay with Phantom. It reminded me of Dracula. As the movie progresses, you get to know the antagonist (if the Phantom may be called that), and you start to get closer to them and relate to them. And especially when you learn of their background, you realize why exactly they've become the way they are. But just as in Dracula, they don't win. In Dracula, I wanted Mina to stay in the castle. Screw Keaneau (sp?) Reeves, I was all for Gary Oldman. But what happened in the end? Poor Dracula got his head chopped off. Even though the Phantom's fate wasn't quite as dramatic, you get the sense that he almost would rather he'd been beheaded. Despite the disappointing ending, the casting definitely left nothing to be desired, and the movie was altogether absolutely captivating.",The Phantom of the Opera

She's SUPPOSED to be confused. And what about GERARD BUTLER? What kind of PHANTOM is THAT? That's a HOT phantom of the opera! Even with the mask on, he looks strangely HANDSOME...:).

Some entered the theater mistakenly expecting a horror film and came out with a passion and energy for more. So much so that I was driven to delve deeper in musical studies with them, when previously their responses were mixed.

I have read the novel by Gaston Leroux twice, which is wonderful, and i was soo very pleased that the movie was loyal to the novel and portrayed ERIK-the Phantom in the honest light he deserved, as a soulful poetic genius who is left heart-broken by his only love. Now to the cast, first of all Emmy Rossum was absolutely incredible as Christine Daae, and she has a beautiful voice. Minnie Driver was hysterical as Carlotta. and now to the star of the film(drum role): Mr. Gerard Butler*swoon* He was just indescribably perfect as the Phantom: he was charismatic, intense, passionate, sexy, debonair, emotional,& his voice won my heart over the very first time I heard him sing. ""Music of the Night"", omg, every time i hear Gerry sing this, it literally sends shivers through me. ""Past the Point of No Return"",OK holy ****, I so wish I was Emmy Rossum in that Scene, & I don't think any guy could be so intense and sexually appealing as Gerry. By the end of the movie, I was crying my eyes out for the Phantom & Gerry was just so emotionally believable, and he just broke my heart. I would pick the Phantom over Roaul any day of the weekI give this movie a 10/10: the music, the sets and costumes, will take your breath away.p.s. the Phantom frickin kicked Roaul's ass in the grave-yard fight scene, lol",The Phantom of the Opera

And the last is someone who enjoys all sorts of movies. At the end, they were all saying that they didn't understand the film. I didn't understand because it was a perfectly put together film. They all had their reasons. 1.) Too much music, not enough normal talking. 2.) Couldn't understand though all the singing. 3.) Didn't understand why Christine's lips didn't match the music...

Gerard Butler is the Phantom. His acting is superb and I fell in love with his voice. His voice is so powerful and yet so sweet. I loved the movie so much, I went and bought the CD. Mr. Butler made me feel all of the emotions that the Phantom was going through. It's like you can see the depth of his soul. One cannot see this without feeling some kind of emotion and have an emotional attachment to the film. I think this shows the talent that Gerard Butler has.

1802,retainingwalls,Much deeper than just a musical,10,15 May 2005,"This movie was astounding and everything Hollywood should aspire to be at all levels. The costumes were grand, the Phantom was more than a scarred horror icon, and the props were enchanting. Curious to me though, The ring given to Cristine at the Bal Masque by Raoul was put on a chain around her neck, then the Phantom rips it off her neck and disappears. We see the ring again when he takes her below the Opera house to his ""domain"" swearing to keep her there for eternity, he gives the ring to her in the palm of her hand and closes it. Then when she leaves with Raoul, she comes back and finds him then takes the ring off her ""marriage finger"" and puts it in the palm of his (the Phantom's) hand and closes it. When Raoul takes the organ grinder monkey music player to Cristines grave some twenty to thirty years later, he notices the rose, black ribbon and the ring that he had given to Christine. Um? What exactly does that mean? Perhaps the Phantom made his new home at the cemetery amongst the catacombs and mausoleums and decided that since Raoul gave him back the monkey he would give him back the engagement ring he gave Christine. What are your thoughts? Are the Phantom's visible scars that are masked symbolic of most love relations? When the courting stops the mask comes off and we are usually disappointed because our expectations were so high. We start to notice the imperfections of a well intentioned soul. We must learn to love the person all over again as a real person and not what we had imagined them be. In many ways this is not a story of horror other than the horror of our own misguided and usually selfish expectations rising far above the capacity of any human being or expectations dictated by society eluding the true undiscovered genius of one another. Also, adversity nurtures greatness. The Phantom in his loneliness is not any different from any intelligent person that must learn to live in a society of ignorance and apathy. Had he not been forced to live there because of his deformities, he would have made his own fortress in order to make the rest of the world bearable. Ah, if I had been Christine I may have been tempted to stay below and take part in the terrorizing of the Opera house as well, and still better yet, perhaps I would have expanded my cloak and dagger escapades to some nearby cathedral. An incredibly painfully sensual Phantom performed by Gerard Butler. Michael Crawford was definitely theater. Crawford had the power and training to deliver his message to the audience of the playhouse. Butler had the depth and power of subtleties at his command to appeal to our senses requiring little more than a twist of the neck or the brushing his finger over his lips, silently. Crawford did not have the advantage of film capturing his expressions yet his voice expressed what film captured, our undecided, uncommitted hearts. Don't compare the singing, the stage and film are two different mediums of equal strength proved by the two actors. There is only room for one or the other to avoid the over sell or over acting. I would think that Andrew Lloyd Webber was well ahead of us all in that calculation. Crawford earned his reign in the theater, Butler has earned his reign on film.

So many scenes, if isolated and framed, could become such sensitive and touching pictures, they could be displayed alongside the masters. The audience is led through the story to first despise the Phantom, but at the end to feel such sympathy for him. The direction was so skilfully done to have the viewer ""feel"" what the director wanted them to feel. The artistic director also has my total admiration. It looks like this will become my all-time favorite. Thank you Mr. Webber, Mr. Schumacher and all the crew.",The Phantom of the Opera
1804,lil_miss_thang6,"This movie is great, you should totally see it!",10,17 May 2005,"It's the best movie ever! I have seen it like.............5 times. I also own it and my friend Sydney-Hi Sydney-has it and so do my friends Dan and Chris-hi guys! I thought the Phantom was awesome...and really really cute! Christine was awesome at the high notes, and I can hit the high notes....On my good days. I think that Raoul is cute, and Meg and Madame Giry are cool. Anyhoo, I think you should see it because it is the best movie ever in the whole entire world, even better than-dare i say it?-Harry Potter!..so far. I think you should see both and judge it yourself, but that's just my opinion, it's not like the world will end if you don't think like me so see both and you can judge for yourself; ). I really think that this movie is the bomb. Two thumbs up and ten shiny stars!",The Phantom of the Opera
1805,sellersjn,Beautiful Adaptation,10,17 May 2005,"This was simply a heart-wrenching and beautifully done version of a well-loved story. This rendering truly has you fall in love with the Phantom and full of pity for his plight. Wonderful acting by all involved, and who'd have known that Minnie Driver could sing so well. Gerard Butler is amazing as the Phantom and his voice is haunting and powerful all at once. Emmy Rossom is captivating as Christine and plays that part as if she were born to play it. The costumes, art direction, and cinematography all deserved Oscars - never have I seen their parallel. (Especially in the Masquerade scene) I thoroughly enjoyed the film, as much as the live stage production. I highly recommend this to all lovers of the arts!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1806,metasomething,"Visually Stunning, but lacking seriously in the Vocal dept.",5,18 May 2005,"I was feeling very excited when i finally got around to renting this movie. I've seen the play twice in San Francisco, and owned the soundtrack for years and years.That having been said, this movie was great; visually amazing, acting was superb -- but i only made it to the introduction to the Phantom before i had to turn it off.This man's voice is not awful, but just SO WRONG for the part. This is all based on personal experience, but both times when this production was running on both coasts, the two Phantom's (Frank D'Ambrosio & Michael Crawford) both sounded similar. The vocal style and key NAILED the part of the Phantom PER-FECT-LY! the voice was high, appealing, sinister and mysterious all at once. This is the voice that's sung the songs in my head all these years, and when his part came in while i was playing the motion picture, it was like nails on a chalkboard for me. COMPLETE OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM HERE. and i hear A. L. Weber chose this man himself... i guess it takes all kinds, but i felt cheated & extremely disappointed to see such an overtly handsome devil of a phantom that sounded a little too much like Orlando Bloom. SIGH!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1807,obi_joel_geeroli,Outstanding for long-time Phans,9,19 May 2005,"The only reason why I gave this a 9/10 was because Gerard Butler's singing voice could have had a little more ""vibratto"" at times. He never-the-less did an absolutely outstanding job. Emmy Rossum is awesome and has a voice comparable to Sarah Brightman - in my opinion anyway. Patrick Wilson (Raoul) did a great job and my only disappointment would have been the fact that Lord Lloyd Webber chose Minnie Driver - a non-operatic singer - to play Carlotta. I had hoped that all of the cast would sing their own parts. Why didn't he choose a woman who auditioned for the stage play? Such an actress would have been just as good. Oh well. Driver never-the-less was as funny as heck and did a good job with the role. Kudos to the woman who did Carlotta's voice - like wow. I am a long time Phantom Phan and this movie did the stage play justice. I was terrified that when they first announced the project for this that they would just set up a camera in front of a stage and do the musical from beginning to end and have Antonio Banderas play the Phantom - thank God they did not! It was a great adaptation for the musical. Indeed, have tissues with you because you are going to be bawling at the end - even if you already know the story. Bravi Bravi BRAVISIMI!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1808,DTB391628,Phantom of Opera Praise,10,19 May 2005,"I am not one who enjoys opera. I've been a musician (trumpet) since I was in grade school and have learned to love most forms of music (except opera and bagpipe). I was totally captivated by the power, purity and quality of vocals and the music in the production. I found myself having great difficulty waiting for the movie to come out for public sale on DVD. The sets for the various scenes were exceptional in detail and realism. The costumes also were of the most outstanding quality and only added the the impact of the opera - without detracting from the vocals and music as they might have. When I bought the DVD and shared it with my wife and daughter, they too were struck with the beauty and quality of the vocals and music. I highly recommend this opera to all possible viewers. It will be an experience not to be regretted but well enjoyed. I recommend you search out the DVD as soon as possible that you might enjoy it for some time to come. My only regret that I have yet to purchase the extended version and the soundtrack. I will rectify this immediately.",The Phantom of the Opera
1809,Meghan_the_Melancholy,Classic in the making.,9,4 June 2005,"Last year, I saw ""Phantom of the Opera"" on Broadway for my 16th birthday. By the time the play was over, I had a lump in my throat and was hiding my tears from my dad. Thus, my love affair with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and Broadway began.Six months later, the movie version appears. Naturally, I was excited. However, it was in selected cities and living in the middle of nowhere, I couldn't see it. Fast forward another six months. I *finally* rent it on DVD.I originally expected it to not be as good as the play. Boy, was I wrong. Schumacer can direct his ass off! He managed to show the lavishness of 19th century Paris while showing it's grittiness at the same time.For those not familiar with ""The Phantom of the Opera"", it's set predominately in 19th century Paris at the Opera house. Just as two new managers come into control, there is an attack on the star of the show, Carlotta, who then proceeds to quit. With the suggestion of Madame Giry, the ballet teacher, they have Christine Daae, a chorus girl, take the main role which she performs brilliantly thanks to her ""secret teacher"". There, she meets her childhood friend, Raoul. They begin to fall in love, much to the dismay of the Phantom, Christine's teacher who has fallen madly in love with her.As for the actors, they were by no means bad. For a guy with no musical training, Gerard Butler was pretty good. True, he's no Michael Crawford, the original Phantom, but he was good, none the less. What bothered me most was the simple fact that he was too good looking and too young. Emmy Rossum was an excellent Christie although her lyp syncing could have been better. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was almost flawless. He was young, good looking, and a majestic voice.I advise any ""Phantom"" fan to see this. You won't be disappointed.",The Phantom of the Opera
1810,logan1960,Phantom of the Opera,10,22 May 2005,"The movie was pretty good, but the play at Her Majesty's Royal Theatre in London was incredible. You have to witness it on stage to really get the impact of this dynamic production. I saw it this past February with my family. Unless you go at the high of the tourist season, you can easily get tickets for the production at many ticket places throughout London, and cheaper.... The cost for the tickets ahead of time was about 350 USD. You can expect to pay about $25USD each if you buy them in the city. At the opera house, they are more expensive. Pick them up as you tour London. We wet in the middle of the week. Have a great time and take a cabbie to the show.Cheerio",The Phantom of the Opera
1811,melly_telly,No Less Than Astounding,10,24 May 2005,"I have had the privilege of seeing ""Phantom of the Opera"" on stage in Calgary, Alberta and I had an even greater privilege of seeing it again recently on Broadway in New York. In comparison, the movie was brilliantly put on screen by captivating all the essential elements of the stage while adding even more to it. Some of the scene sequences were changed for the better in the film version and the sets that were built were simply incredible. ""As for our star""... Emmy Rossum is the best Christine I have ever seen and it was great to see and hear such a young person in the role, who's voice has a clear and innocent, yet refined quality instead of having an over-operatic, ""Primadonna"" style. The movie is a must-see, a must-buy, and the soundtrack definitely is too.",The Phantom of the Opera
1812,al_gonzalez,Worth Seeing!,8,24 May 2005,"I have to agree with Steve Gillen's comments, excellent movie! I have been a fan since I first purchased the Andrew Lloyd Webber's CD. I did get to see the play once with Davis Gaines playing the Phantom, wish it could've been Micheal Crawford but Gaines was also very good. I am no singer or musician but I too felt that Gerard Butler, though a great looking Phantom, lacked the powerful voice I came to expect from Crawford and Gaines.I did purchase the DVD before watching it because I just had to have it and I am not disappointed! I will show it to my 6th graders because we study The Phantom of the Opera. My only reason to rating the movie an 8 out of 10, besides Butler's voice, was a part that was changed in the movie from the play. It was a major change and although it made sense for the movie I thought it was too major a change. I still love it and will watch it over and over again.",The Phantom of the Opera
1813,Flower0022,Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is brought to life in this film. Christine must choose between her tutor (the Phantom) and her true love (Raoul) in this dramatic romance.,9,25 May 2005,"I thought this movie was great and extremely well done. Of course it may not live up to the theater version, but really you can't compare these two versions. Film allows for so much more aspects that theater cannot grasp and vice versa. Theater has a way of grasping a live audience, but I think the movie captivates audiences just as much. You also have to consider that this is an independent film and was made on a limited budget. If you happen to buy the DVD, go ahead and spend the extra money for the two-disc set and watch the extra material. It's amazing. It tells how the story is based upon a book and how Andrew Lloyd Webber transformed it into one of the most popular musicals ever.",The Phantom of the Opera
1814,mattsgirl_11,A sensual masterpiece!,10,3 June 2005,"Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber's adaptation of the glorious stage musical, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is stupendous. Emmy Rossum portrays the role of Christine Daae incredibly. She is the perfect person to show how Christine goes from an innocent teenager to sensual woman. Her beauty is perfect for it. Patrick Wilson is a Broadway actor turned movie star. His voice is fabulous and each time you here it you feel closer to him and begin to sort of love him. His romantic feeling towards Emmy Rossum seem very real in the movie. Patrick did a fantastic job. Gerard Butler was a stupendous actor to choose for the Phantom. He has a very deep low voice that is incredible. He is a very sexy man. The way Gerard portrays the phantom is dramatic yet enticing. His pull towards Chrisistine and his love for her is magnificent. Minnie Driver is a hilarious Opera soprano. That has an attitude problem. She is the perfect role for Carlotts Judechele. This movie will lure you past the point of no return.",The Phantom of the Opera
1815,urban_salsa,I love this movie. The Phantom of the Opera.,10,25 May 2005,"WATCH IT! GERARD BUTLER IS SO SEXY IN THE MOVIE! I think this movie was one of the best done in a long time and I think it IS about time to have seen a movie that shows love and horror at once. I think that Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is amazing, being a piano student, and that Joel Schumacher portraits the music in a beautiful way while still showing the drama and action of the story. Good job both of you and I must say I will never stop loving the music or the film or the actors. I am actually listening to the soundtrack right now. From one of the most romantic scenes displayed ever in my lifetime. All I Ask Of You, wonderful song. Please continue to make my heart melt in your films,Mr. Schumacher and Mr. Webber.I recommend this movie to everyone, child, mother or father, aunt or uncle and grandfather and grandmother. Thank you very much again. Thank you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1816,goldelox-1,Great film but for the main actors,5,12 June 2005,"The first time I saw this film, I thought it was fantastic. I rushed out to buy it on DVD as soon as it was released. Watching it the second and third time around, I realized how inadequate the two main performances truly were. After hearing the major songs sung professionally by different singers, Emmy Rossum's barely mature, straining-at-every-high-note vocals for Christine made me cringe. And I really don't think that giving the retarded-deer-caught-in-the-headlights look for every emotion can be called acting. I have no complaints about Gerard Butler acting-wise in the role of the Phantom, and his vocals didn't bother as much as they have other people, but I do agree that a stronger voice was called for and Butler, despite his obvious efforts, just did not fit the bill. Other than those two, I found every other actor's performance satisfactory and enjoyable. Patrick Wilson as Raoul was not extraordinary, but still well sung and acted. Visually, the film was dreamlike and the story unfolded nicely with comic relief in all the right places. The music itself was excellent, but hard to appreciate due to inadequate singers with poor lip-syncing skills. Had Schumacher and Webber just held out for more experienced leads, this film could have been a masterpiece.",The Phantom of the Opera
1817,bstevens62,Casting was excellent!,10,21 June 2005,"To me the ""phantom"" lacked ""felling/pain"" in his voice until the end. But it was an excellent movie! I have seen it three times. Casting was done very well! Everyone did their role perfectly! I've been listening to the phantom of the opera since I was very small. I have a CD of it form 1987. So I'm comparing the phantom from the movie to the phantom from my CD. The phantom from the movie is the only person I wasn't impressed with at first. It was a really good movie and I am sure to watch it again. My favorite character is La Carlotta. Mini Driver did an awesome job! The music is so moving and powerful! An endless classic I'm sure!",The Phantom of the Opera
1818,billyw1953,A musical love triangle based on the classic story.,10,26 May 2005,"I have read many articles relating to this movie, 95% have been positive. Most of the complaints have been about Gerard Butler cast as the Phantom and how his voice does not compliment Christine's and Raoul's. Some complain that John Travolta or Antonio Banderas should have been cast as the Phantom regardless of their prior commitments. I submit that history shall be the final judge. The Phantom just had to be a baritone, that is a given. Gerard Butler's voice is rough and has a sinister effect that in my humble opinion make him the perfect Phantom. He will go on to be a very famous actor after this move, he was magnificent.",The Phantom of the Opera
1819,CourDeParis,Not so swell,2,26 May 2018,"Well, let us be honest. I never watched this on the account of really wanting to. Yet, since I adore the original story and the esquisitely done silent, I have to complain about this one. Firstly, the introduction was a bit off, and it went down from there. Of course, you could rave about the costumes, but most weren't that accurate for 1870 (except Christine's masquerade gown). Christine's costumes were reminiscent of Ella Enchanted glitter parties, and Raoul was wearing romantic/I'm so snazzy motorcycle outfits. Then, they decided to add in these new characters and change the cast. And where was the Persian? He is my favorite, and he didn't even make an appearance. Yes, my biggest fit is with the ""off"" characters. I feel as though the director felt they couldn't deal with the true, gritty nature of the story. Christine wasn't beaming with innocence, or was she in a state of great perplexity concerning the Phantom's nature. Mary Philbin captured Christine perfectly I think, in the 1925 film. Here, the actress is more, ""I am going to sing a very lovely song, and I will be in love with all of you, but I don't really care...sorry."" And the Phantom wasn't some ugly, beast of a man; mysterious to all, unloved and feared with his seemingly magical powers and his peverted, disgusting nature. Instead he is more "" I am trying the David Bowie deal, and I seem kind of tough, but I am really fuzzy inside. Christine, love me! I have great legs. Calling all girls, love me!"" Far too romanticized, too transparent, and soft. This is where the biggest mistake is I think. And Raoul? He is still on a motorcycle/white horse with randomly long hair. Also, they skip the best scene, which is the touture chamber... who skips the touture chamber? As I said, all the gritty horrors which make the story beautiful and less high school theatre are gone. The true beauty of the film and story have been erased by Hollywood ideals. Still, people obsessed with musicals with high budgets and romantic stories will enjoy this. Yet it is really bad if you have read the book or watched the silent ( and a historical costume nit-picker).",The Phantom of the Opera
1820,MissPerspective,Loved this Phantom,8,3 September 2016,"Loved this adaption. I only watched this movie now in 2016 and was surprised with all the bad reviews Butler had at first when this movie came out. I thought he was Very captivating as the Phantom and it's hard not to fall in love with him. His body language and the way he sang with emotions added a lot of depth to the character, we can actually feel what torture he was going through. His eye contact behind the mask, scary and seductive in one. Emma is top as a very sweet Christine with a gorgeous angelic voice. A great render of the theatrical musical, I enjoyed every bit, the costumes, the music, the acting and the settings. By now, they are probably thinking of doing a new remake but for now Butler takes my award of best Phantom!",The Phantom of the Opera

The score and music soar through this amazing movie. The cast is perfect for their roles, Gerard Butler makes you empathize with the Phantom and feel quite heartbroken through the entire movie, Emmy Rossum is a beautiful Christine, and Patrick Wilson has a fabulous tenor voice that is just unbeatable.Joel Shumacher constructed eye-popping sets and beautiful designs and costumes. The storyline is haunting and beautiful and when it comes down to it, this tragic love story is just tops! I would watch it a million times and still cry at the end.

Both, I recommend the show but the movie is just as visually enticing. I saw the movie when I was about 11-12 and later saw the show. After seeing it on Broadway, I was fully in love with it. Download the soundtrack, Best thing I ever did. The music is what really sets this picture into motion. Even if you find yourself saying ""I don't like Opera"" after seeing this movie you may love it more than ever. (Or at least TPOTO version which features rock ensembles and ballads).

I settled down, wine in hand quite ready to switch it off,well of course i didn't. I thought it was one of the most emotional films I have ever seen. Emmy Rossoum was so mesmerising to watch and to listen to, they couldn't have picked a better lead. Raoul was gorgeous but the clincher for me was the phantom. He has definitely become my next crush. His singing was not fantastic I agree, but the charisma that man had was amazing.

The actors were brilliant singers, and they fitted the songs excellently. This film is brilliant all the way through, from start to finish there is never a moment of boredom. By the end of the film, I found that I was nearly singing along to the songs, and I just had to come onto the IMDb to find out some more information about the actors and actresses, as they were all fabulous.I gave it a mark of 10 out of 10 because I couldn't find anything negative to say about it.

My friend and I are always quoting it and singing songs from it. It really did captivate the thrilling story that Andrew Lloyd Webber has only made better. It is a movie that I could watch again and again and never get sick of it! That's why I rate it 10 out of 10! My father wants me to make him a compact disk of me singing some of the songs and of course I was all too happy to do it! I couldn't believe how young Emmy Rossum was when she tried out. I think she gives hope to younger girls like my friends and I who want to go into show business because she is do young and talented.,The Phantom of the Opera

1827,sonta_en,Worth every moment! I strongly recommend to music enthusiasts.,7,31 May 2005,"Firstly, the spoiler to which I refer may not be a spoiler at all. But since it refers to story ingredients that I could not understand, I wanted to mention the possibility. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Of course, the music is pretty much flawless, so it's quite easy to be literally swept away without even thinking of a story line, or anything else for that matter. However, there were at least two facets of the story that I felt were left completely unaddressed, which bothered me. One involved the birth history of the daughter of Miranda Richardson's character, and the other was something about holding one's hand level with their eyes, as they descend into the catacombs. I vaguely recall it being mentioned in a song, early in the film, and then again toward the finale, but still I could make no sense of it. But other than those two items, the production was a visual feast from sets to costumes. I saw the stage production twice in Houston, TX and once in NYC and I must say that, visually, I did enjoy the stage version of the Masquerade number much more than the film, but simply because it was much more colorful. I have only seen the movie version once, but I definitely plan to see it again very soon!",The Phantom of the Opera
1828,s_tyler2003,Blown Away,10,1 June 2005,"I had previously seen another version of the Phantom of the Opera that was a non-musical version, and wasn't really impressed-It seemed to focus mainly on blood and gore-so I'm sure you see my skepticism towards this film. However, just the day before yesterday I decided to rent the 2004 'Phantom of the Opera' and was completely blown away. Lets just say, I watched it 5 times within 2 days.To start with, the cinematography was brilliantly done. The set of the opera house was absolutely breath taking, I cant imagine that it could have been done any more beautifully . And the way that it was shot almost gave it a feeling of actually being there, in the opera house, experiencing the show first hand.Secondly, the casting was superb. What an eye the caster must have, casting some virtually unknowns in such key parts. Jennifer Ellison had such an innocence to her, a very pretty little starlet. I only wish I could have heard more from her. Ellison has such a pure soprano voice that it seems a waist not to have used it more. Minnie Driver played a perfect Carlotta. I was a bit skeptical of her part at first, but she played the diva to a T. Patrick Wilson, who is he? I've never heard of him before, but after his portrayal of Raoul, I would love to see more of him, especially if it involves singing. Then, Emmy Rossum. How perfect. What more can I possibly say. I couldn't have asked for more from her.Then, what really made me fall in love with the movie was the Phantom himself. He was so believable, even being a handsome man. His portrayal was so touching and heart wrenching. His story of a love not meant to be is so timeless and he takes you through a wonderful journey of emotions in telling it.I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether they are a fan of musicals or not. Just sit back. Relax. And prepare yourself for an enchanting ride, that will keep you coming back time and again.",The Phantom of the Opera
1829,SouthernSon2003,Just like the Play,10,1 June 2005,"This movie was awesome. I have been a fan of the Phantom of the Opera since I was 8 years old and am now 20 years old. This movie portrays the play exactly but a few things were added in like the black and white sections of the movie. I could not be happier with the way it was done. Emmy Rossum did a wonderful job playing Christine, she wasn't who I expected to be playing the part but I could not have thought of a better and more qualified actor (except maybe the lady who plays the part on Broadway). I was really really happy with the movie all around but even more happy about the way it is exactly the way the play is.

It has comedy, tragedy, drama, action, sword fighting, romance, music, internal conflict, and everything else you could possibly put in a movie! I especially enjoyed the singing, but that is mainly because I enjoy singing myself. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a musical GENIUS! If you haven't seen it, go to your local movie store and rent it or buy it, because I know you'll love it, too! It is the best movie ever made! It will capture your heart, and you will need to stock up on tissues, because its THAT good. I will warn you though, once I saw it, I was hooked! I love it so much! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. The music is OUTSTANDING, the acting is FLAWLESS, and it makes you want to jump up and shout ""BRAVISSIMO!""

1831,pookie62484,Best movie of the year!!,10,4 June 2005,"I have been a fan of ALW's musical version of the Phantom of the Opera for years and this is just the icing on the cake. This movie was amazing and truly impressed a very harsh fan. I wanted the beauty and emotion from the play to be passed on to the movie and it did in every way possible. The choice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom was amazing and Emmy Rossum did an amazing job of filling Sara Brightman's place as Christine. Bravo. I would suggest that those of you that haven't read the book do so. The movie had more elements from the book that weren't possible on the stage. This is truly an amazing film. The music is amazing. Butler has an amazing voice, yes it is different than most of the men that have played the Phantom, but he adds something new and beautiful. Being a musician and singer myself I am very critical of anything new, especially in this musical. Rossum is truly amazing. She was 17 when making this film and has a voice better than most older professionals I have heard. This is an amazing film, people that disagree are entitled to their own opinion, but they must realize that this was a very difficult film to make and ALW took a big chance. There will never be another Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman to be the Phantom and Christine, but there is a new generation that will be remembered just as fondly as the original cast.",The Phantom of the Opera
1832,Angie50,Wonderful.,9,14 August 2005,"The Phantom of the Opera is a marvellous production, the costumes, the sets,the music etc all top notch. Now I do appreciate it's not everyone's cup of tea but the reviews received from so called professional critics just proves once more how unnecessary and bias they are.Despite the reviews Phantom is still a success via word of mouth, I just wish the powers that be would have left it running in theatres a little longer so I would have had the chance to see it on the big screen. Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is so full of emotion and paired with the lyrics of Charles Hart and Richard Stillgoe its near perfect. The acting is very good from all and exceptional from the Phantom, and while I agree his voice is much deeper and rougher than I expected I believe it works very well in this production, remember its an adaptation of the stage show, not an exact recreation and if Andrew Lloyd Webber and Simon Lee the conductor thought he was a revelation, I am certainly in no position to second guess or disagree, as I am sure the vast majority on this board are not. Phantom took me back to the old golden days of musicals, as much as I enjoyed certain parts of Chicago lets face it Richard Gere was dreadful in the singing and dancing sections and although Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zelweger(apologies for spelling on that one)did quite well with the singing,the choreography for their dance routines was shall I say basic in the very least, basic and flash and being a dancer that is something I can comment on.Finally to the previous comment its Christine not Caroline. To all who have not seen Phantom yet, do give it a try it is quite wonderful.",The Phantom of the Opera
1833,dawn-abbott,Phantom of the Opera,10,5 June 2005,"Phantom of the Opera was an inspiring movie and after seeing it the second time was hooked. I never really noticed Gerard Butler and now am very fascinated with him. He seems to really care about his acting and it really shows in the Phantom of the Opera. I haven't seen that many of his movies but look forward to watching his career bloom. Unfortunaly here in the states it is hard to get a hold of a lot of his work. My daughter is also a new fan because of the Phantom of the Opera, and she is only 13. We have discovered that we like Scottish actors, since we already adore Ewan Mcgregor in the movie Moulin Rouge, I guess we just love musicals with super handsome lead singers.Thank you Dawn Abbott",The Phantom of the Opera
1834,cyberman1956,It was a great production.,10,5 June 2005,"For all you picky critics here goes. I think it was a great production. I was the Broadway Production when it came to Nashville, TN. To be honest the movie answers a lot of the questions you have after seeing the show. In fact I recently purchased the movie on DVD to add to my collection. Up date the songs Hell would did you expect a Rock N Roll update. If its not broken don't fix it. Next time the Broadway Production comes to town I will watch it again. Now I know what the hell goes on throughout the show and why. Why do you critics insist on modernizing everything. I just cringe at the thought of The Phantom singing the songs at a hip-hop melody.",The Phantom of the Opera
1835,jjbean0915,Unbelievable!!,10,19 June 2005,"I finally saw the film version of the well known ""The Phantom of the Opera."" I have seen the stage production three times and now I think nothing except of the movie version. It was amazing and awesome! I am still in a surreal state after watching it. It was beautifully done. I still love the stage and what it brings it's audience but the film was able to bring out special effect only the movies can do. The set was breathless. It was like watching it all for the first time. The ending was amazing and I am set to watch it again. i had my doubts about the director but I think he could not have done it without the artistic genius of Andrew Lloyd Webber whose talent speaks for itself. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, even the ""non-theatre buffs"" because this is a love story that needs to be seen and heard.",The Phantom of the Opera
1836,franksmic,Omg!,10,6 June 2005,"Not much to say about this really, only that it is the only film i would ever give a 10/10 just for its brilliance and its absolutely cracking soundtrack! However, for acting, it would get another 10/10! Utterly wonderful from the beginning to the end. Gerard Butler makes an astounding Phantom! Omg! What a cracking adaptation! I never thought i would see a such a brilliant transformation from the stage to the screen! I have seen it on the stage, seen it on the big screen and seeing at home was just as good with all the special features on the DVD! Brilliant cast,brilliant direction! I laughed, i sang along but it hit all the right notes because i cried, time and time again! M.x",The Phantom of the Opera
1837,curtys_chick18,The Phantom of the Opera,9,6 June 2005,"I never had the privilege as a little girl to be able to see the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. However, my parents saw it three times and I have read and looked through the programs and brochures a dozen or so times. Once the movie came out into movie theatres I was very excited to go and see it. Having never seen the play the movie did a very good job at explaining the story. I got goosebumps and shivers were sent up my spine when I watched it. I think that Emmy Rossum (Christine), Gerard Butler (Phantom), Patrick Wilson (Raoul), and the rest of the cast did an awesome job. It is quite obvious to anyone who has seen or will see the movie that there was a lot of dedication and hard work put into the making of the movie. As soon as it comes out on DVD I plan on owning a copy and adding it to my DVD collection. It was an awesome and well done movie. I also plan on seeing the play as soon as it comes to city close to me. I know that it will be as good or even better than the movie. I would recommend to anyone to rent The Phantom of the Opera, you will not be disappointed.",The Phantom of the Opera
1838,m_mouseca,One of the best movies of all time,10,26 July 2006,"This has got to be one of my favorite all time movies. I am a musician, and my main instrument is the Clairnet. All throughout High School we played songs from Phantom of the Opera, and because of where I lived I never had a chance to go and see the live stage production. I now live in an area that I can go and see the live stage production when it comes in August and am planning on seeing it. But because of that the first chance of me being able to see it was when it came into the theaters. I have watched this movie, over and over again, I have the soundtrack, and my screen saver is from the movie. I will watch this movie for years to come and it will always be a part of my collection. As soon as I own a Blue Ray player, and it is on disk for that I will by it for the Blue Ray as well. I'm sure my husband wishes I had never seen it but I have and that is all I can say about that.",The Phantom of the Opera
1839,patrick_n913,A great movie for a great musical.,10,7 June 2005,"As a tremendous fan of the musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber, I must say that this movie is an excellent adaptation. It captures the fun, suspense and romance that you would experience if you went to a theater to see this. Gerard Butler does an amazing job in portraying the complex character that is the Phantom. Just like the Phantom, he can go from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other in a flash. He is tender and vulnerable when he needs to be, but also angry and brooding when it is necessary. The casting in this movie is fantastic. Emma Rossum is incredible as Christine considering she was only 17 when they were filming. The transformation from the old, decaying opera house to when it was in its prime is heightened by special effects which are impossible to recreate on stage. This use of effects pushes parts of this film beyond even the stage show. Take it from me, a true Phantom of the Opera fan, this is the best film adaptation of the beloved play to date. That is why I give it a 10 out of 10.",The Phantom of the Opera
1840,Lynnxox21Marie,Great Movie!!,10,7 June 2005,"I loved this movie...i can't believe that Emmy rossum has such a good voice and she only 17 when the movie was made...Now, i am found singing the songs to the movie during school and randomly at home, they are so captivating, the costumes and the scenes are beautiful...i do have to say...i cried during the movie...numerous times...ha ha I'm such a sap... ha ha...the phantom deff. captivated me...and the story was just great that wanted too keep watching to see what happened...in the second and third watchings of this movie i found so many thing's i had missed the first time and total understanding came along...i found that there are so many hidden plots and story lines, along with hidden lessons and guides...in short..i loved this movie!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1841,Mirkwoodelf2,Not That Bad,7,10 May 2006,"This movie wasn't the worst and it definitely wasn't the best. I'm a huge fan of the play version so i was really excited to see the movie. I was disappointed with some areas. Emmy Rossum was very good as Christine. She stole the show. Some may disagree and say she can't sing but I thought she was great. Patrick Wilson had a sweet voice but didn't pack the punch. At times i felt like he was too nice and his singing was too nice and ohh la di da. His hair was horribly done. The two managers were very good but sang okay. Miranda Richerdson was good but i missed the older and stricter version from the play. Minnie Driver made an excellent Carlotta. As for the phantom well heres where it goes bad. Gerard Bulter no thanks. Sure he's handsome and can cry but he can't sing. He should have stayed with rock and roll. Maybe Webber wasn't feeling well when he cast Gerard but not a wise decision. He ruined the movie for me. Butler didn't bring no mystery and goose bumps to the role like Michael Crawford, the original phantom from Broadway. He shouted more than sang. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! That facial deformity sucked. It was a sun burn not a born with deformity and that didn't help the emotional punch of why every one made fun of him when he was younger. The set was lavish and pretty but not mysterious and dark like the play. I think Schumacher missed the point. The phantoms lair was too nice and looked like a house with rocks around it. In masquerade i missed the different outfits. This was too plain Jane and black and white. The dance was changed too.I especially miss the phantoms pirate outfit. He just wasn't as scary coming down those stairs. The opening scene was great. Now that gave me goosebumps! Even adding the graveyard scene at the end was good because in the play you don't know what happens to the phantom. Sweet with the rose and all. You have to give the movie credit. The scenery was nice and colorful, the music was very good except at some points the lips don't match with the singing but that can be forgiven. If you haven't seen the play but this movie and like this kind of music than you'll love the movie but if your like me and are used to the play then you'll have a harder time letting go. It took me about 30 times of seeing the movie to get used to the changes and especially Butler. And if you can't well then all's worth it to pay $200 dollars for a theater ticket. It's a movie you can watch if your a fan but if you want to see the true version go see the longest running play in Broadway history for the true phantom feeling.",The Phantom of the Opera
1842,mdvlmomma1,Fantastic Movie!,10,7 June 2005,I thought the movie was fabulous. My husband loved it as well. We don't typically watch musicals but this one is outstanding. I had heard a lot of things from the critics saying that Gerard Butler's voice was not right for the role. I think he did a perfect job playing the phantom...he brought a lot of emotion into the character..you could almost feel his pain. Emmy Rossum was great as well. This is a movie that can make you forget you are watching a musical. The opera house appeared very opulent and the effects were good. It made me want to see it performed on stage. I just hope that the stage version can live up to the movie version!,The Phantom of the Opera
1843,zyphra7,Best Movie I've Ever Seen!,10,9 June 2005,"I have to say this movie is in fact, to this day, the best movie I have ever seen. The combination of actors/actresses with the drop dead gorgeous set, the fabulous music and every other aspect of this brilliant movie is just breath-taking. This is one of two movies that have made me shed a tear, the first being when I was eight and watching some cartoon. Emmy does a fantastic job at only sixteen years old. Patrick has a beautiful voice and is so dashing when he tries to save Christine, especially with a noose around his neck in the lair. Gerard, well, stole the show in my eyes. He adds a deeper emotion to the character of the Phantom. You can hear the desperation and assertiveness in his voice at all the right times. Gerard gives the Phantom a much needed edge to his voice that wasn't in Michael Crawford's phantom. Personally I prefer Gerard's version. Not to mention Gerard is also undeniably hot! They put together a fantastic cast with this movie. It is a must see! I absolutely loved it and watch it over and over!",The Phantom of the Opera
1844,denise-laing,"Good film, shame about the leading lady",8,10 June 2005,"This film was really enjoyable, but I may be being biased as I loved the musical.The most disappointing part was the lead actress playing the part of Christy, she was terrible, with no facial expressions, which is what you expect when someone is singing songs with such a range. She looked really wooden and the scenes where she is singing to the camera it helps if you turn away.The phantom was great though, and all in all it is a great film, just squint your eyes when the leading lady is on the screen.I was waiting for ages to see this movie and it did not disappoint.I have now bought it on DVD and have watched it quite a few times already, but I must confess to forwarding some bits when the leading lady is singing, not because of lack of talent but having to watch her singing with no compassion",The Phantom of the Opera
1845,shavingkills,Not meeting expectations,6,10 June 2005,"As a fan of the novel by Gustave Flaubert, I was let down by this film version. While the visual effects, lighting, and set design were stunning, I felt that the casting was sub par. For the timeless and recognizable story that ""Phantom"" is, I was left wondering why the lead actors, Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler were assigned their given roles. It is highly apparent that Rossum is an inexperienced actress, and I couldn't help but notice her constant gawking expression. She looked rather lost. She has a beautiful voice, but her acting needs work. Butler, on the other hand, is a fine actor, but his singing voice fails in comparison. I felt that the supporting characters played by Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver were excellent, and they definitely upstaged the performances of Rossum and Butler. Also, I was upset with how the Phantom was depicted. In the novel, the reader tends to sympathize with his character, because he is seen as more of a battered, misunderstood person who has a real name, Erik, other than the title ""The Phantom"". The movie failed to fully personify the character, and the Phantom comes off as plain horrible and inhuman, even in spite of a flashback scene to the Phantom's twisted past. All in all, the movie was beautiful, and for the most part sounded good, but lacked much needed strength in its main characters, and did not do the book justice.",The Phantom of the Opera
1846,Phantomlovergirl,The Best Movie to see!,10,12 June 2005,I about died watching this movie with my boyfriend. I balled for the last hour. Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are great together. Gerards performance was one of the best i have ever seen of his. It was Fantastic. Their voices where great! According to some they weren't. But obviously they listen to todays music. Which is to me crap. When i saw they should make it more..UPBEAT AND POPLIKE i about died. Who would want to change Andrew Lloyd Webbers MUSIC! Its great the way it is. I liked what they did with it in the theme song. But NOTHING MORE should CHANGED! They would be crazy if they did. I loved this version. On screen there is more depth to it. And it was one of the best ones I have seen so far. I fell in love with the phantom the first time i heard him sing. They did a great job of putting this together I cant wait to see what else is going to be a good musical on screen like this one!,The Phantom of the Opera
1847,michelangalo2000,A True Work of Art,9,11 June 2005,"I have read the book and seen the play, Phantom of the Opera. And recently, I watched the movie. The movie was spectacular.I find Minnie Driver as a horrid actress. But she nailed her part. She acted so that you could imagine her singing, even if it wasn't her voice. Christine (Rossum) and Raoul (Wilson) were absolute perfection, singing and acting. The Phantom (Butler) could of been a stronger singer but was a great actor. I was a tad disappointed with the Masquerade Scene. Christine and Raoul watching on the sidelines? Not working for me. Every sponsor, every singer, every dancer of the Opera House should of been included in the chorus part and the choreography of the Masquerade scene...but that's just me.The sets were amazing...true French Architecture. Although the Phantom's Lair should of been dimmer, for dramatic effects, and would of made songs like Phantom of the Opera, Music of the Night, and the ending scene in the Phantoms Lair more powerful and passionate.But, despite my little nitpicks, the film was beautiful. Casting, producing, editing, singing, story, choreography, costuming and sets were perfect if not almost perfect. I had goosebumps after watching it, and just wanted to be part of the music of the night!",The Phantom of the Opera
1848,gerardbutlerfan1,The best movie ever!!!,10,11 June 2005,"I loved this movie! It also helps that Gerard is so hot in it!! But it is also a very moving movie, I cried, that's for sure. The story was great, the way they presented it, it was all perfect!! I have never seen the play before, but let me tell you i really loved this movie. The actors in it really took their parts seriously, they made me feel like i was right there next to them witnessing the action. When they cried it just seemed so real. The music was great also. It was a nice full sound, and it fit very nicely. It didn't seem like too much music at all. Every one in it did a great job acting and i have to give three cheers to Joel for directing such a god movie!",The Phantom of the Opera
1849,LittleMissStrange,"Pretty, but lacking.",5,11 June 2005,"The set: lavish. The costumes: the same. The acting: slightly better than that of Keanu Reeves (be careful how you interpret that). The singing: very unimpressive. The Phantom is supposed to have a strong, mesmerizing voice, but all that Gerard Butler did was yell with something like a tune, but not quite. As for Emmy Rossum, her voice was pretty, but very weak, and her phrasing was terrible. It was not a bad voice, don't get me wrong, but I think a couple more years of lessons would have better prepared her for the part. As it is, she didn't quite live up to it. Other than that, the movie was alright. It stuck fairly closely to the play. But I think if they had been going for production of the year, a couple of replacements in the cast would have been beneficial. If you like pretty, dramatic movies, this will suit you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1850,gracelessly,Very true to the stage adaptation...,7,9 January 2006,"... except for Gerard Butler's absolutely terrible singing. His acting is pretty great and when I do my best not to listen to his singing, I actually like him a lot. But what a poor choice to play the Phantom, the musical genius, when he appears to be struggling to stay in tune throughout the movie. Especially alongside the other voices in the cast, which range from decent to fantastic (particularly Patrick Wilson as Raoul!) Other than that, it's so visually beautiful that I can actually find it comparable to the Broadway musical (forever my second favorite version of Phantom, Leroux's book being #1).However, some details I MUST nitpick on: The lip-synching is generally poor, especially on Emmy Rossum's (Christine) part, but it can be overlooked very easily, particularly if you don't happen to be one of those people who pays special attention to that sort of thing. As a voice performance major, I'm probably more critical than most about such things. Another part that throws me off when I watch is the varying accents. Many characters don't adopt any accent at all; characters such as Madame Giry have thick accents, and so on. Sometimes the accents (or lack thereof) shift slightly.Overall, its enjoyable and entertaining.",The Phantom of the Opera
1851,bholtin-1,An excellent rendition of a Classic Story and Classic Musical!,9,12 June 2005,"Simply put, this film is a triumph in the world or musical movie production! One of the greatest and well loved Broadway musicals of the late 20th century comes to life on the screen. The story of the Opera Ghost and Christine Daae is a wonderful story of horror, love, and compassion in a time when opera was the playground of the rich... Musically and artistically, this film holds true to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production very very closely and adding new magic that the stage cannot create. In truth, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson shine as singing and acting stars; however, there is something lacking in the key role of the Phantom. Butler perhaps should have attended vocal rehearsals a little more often and learned to add enthusiasm to his acting in such a dramatically important role. The directing and cinematography added a special magical effect that can only be portrayed in film. All-in-all it is a most excellent reproduction of the classical original musical! Two thumbs up! Bravo!",The Phantom of the Opera
1852,edsonlylover,Tremendous Movie! Must See!!!,10,15 June 2005,"I have been a long time fan of the Phantom's. I was very pleasantly amazed with the movie production. I had seen it NYC. I never saw it in the movies because friends said it was lame. They lacked vision. I have since connected them with my Optometrist. The passion in the film was soul rendering. The Phantom was everything that he needed to be. I don't know how a woman could choose Raoul over him. Refer to the vision statement. The greatest thing I can say about any of the actors is this. They were all very good. Gerard Butler totally blew me away with his portrayal of the Phantom. His voice, his mannerisms, his presence in the role was definitely inspiring. My favorite moment in the film is during the scene ""Don Juan"". Again the PASSION. Some might argue that the Phantom was a psychopath fixated on Christine. My answer is get a grip. It was definitely not a healthy relationship but given what you are lead to believe in the story it was somewhat understandable. The Phantom could be called emotionally immature. Reminded me of my teenage kids-without all the singing, with their first crush. A psycho probably would done a lot worse. Anyway, GREAT movie. Characters were fantastic. Bravo,Mr. Butler. Brava, Ms. Rossum. For the music, I am speechless.",The Phantom of the Opera

I too didn't know what to expect when I saw the movie, thinking it couldn't possibly be as good as the play. I was anxiously awaiting the movie to open here in the U.S. It was every bit as good, it exceeded my expectations. The costumes were beautiful, the scenery, and the actors, Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson did a fantastic job. Honestly, I was shocked because seldom does a movie do a play justice. I felt like I was sitting in Her Majesty's Theater. I will buy the movie so I can watch it over and over. I own the soundtrack, and it is excellent. A big thumbs up!",The Phantom of the Opera
1854,xx_creepy_lil_duckie_xx,The most excellent movie ever!,10,16 June 2005,"I have always been a fan of The Phantom of the Opera and honestly I thought doing a big time production on it wouldn't turn out good, I thought it would ruin it. Boy was I wrong! That movie was the greatest, most emotional of all The Phantom of the Opera performances. The sets were extremely elaborate and beautiful. The singing was most spectacular especially from Emmy Rossum & Gerard Butler. I especially loved the scene when Christine and The Phantom are going down to his 'layer'. They put this in the perfect spot in the movie, it gets the beautiful singing and wonderful sets into the movie quickly so for the rest of the movie your longing for more of that, and you get it. My other favorite scene is when Christine and the Phantom are on stage for Don Juan and sing the point of no return. The music is most lovely and following scene with the chandelier is a classic perfected. My last comment is about The Phantom. This movie is most eye pleasing not only for it's sets but it's actors and actresses. The Phantom was quite handsome, until he took off the mask. And Raoul was very fine. For the guys, Christine and Meg were very beautiful as well. In conclusion this was an all around awesome movie.",The Phantom of the Opera

This was the 1st movie that my husband has EVER taken me to, and we started dating in 1998!!!! He had seen it on Broadway a few years ago (a school trip with his son), but I had to wait until this last April to see it on stage.There just aren't words to describe how wonderful this movie is: the costumes, the music, the casting ---- it all falls together perfectly!! I actually love the 'kinder, gentler' Phantom of the movie over the stage version. Actually, nearly all of the characters are much warmer on film than their stage counterparts.The decision to film it as a flashback just makes it that much more delicious (although don't you think that they cast Will Ferrell to play 'old Raoul'?). Also...hubby & I argue over who the woman is -- hubby says it's Madame, but I think it's supposed to be Meg.So now, every night when I get home from work, I find my husband has fallen asleep with the DVD playing.

It had me singing along with it almost the whole movie! It's one of the very few I can watch over and over again without it getting old. There is something for everyone in that movie, it has you at the edge of your seat or dancing around! I don't watch a lot of TV or movies and when I do it's hard for me to say they are the best since I might as well be one of those evil movie critics, but for the Phantom of the Opera it was easier said than thought of. I am saving up to buy the move and the soundtrack, perhaps even tickets to an on stage showing. I give the Phantom of the Opera a perfect 10, but I wish the ratings went higher! Bravo!

I have watched it 7 times(another time tonight will be my 8th...) and not one viewing was I tired of it. When my brother rented it, I thought it was going to be a boring opera movie that I would sleep through. Yet there was something in the title that sounded exciting...I have been to 2 operas on stage(Don Giavanni and Cinderella)on class outings for school and they weren't at all entertaining. But the elaborate decorations, outstanding vocalization, awesome outfits, and thrilling action in this opera film make me want to watch it again and again. The acting was the part that impressed me the most. Emmy Rossum is an amazingly talented actress!!! No one could have played the part of the skillful, affectionate, and eloquent Christine Daaé better than she. This girl can do everything!!! She knows 5 or 6 languages, sings expertly, acts expertly, and yet still manages to take classes, when she is already acting, singing, practicing, over the internet at an Ivy League college at the mere age of 18...HOW DOES SHE DO IT?!?!? I greatly admire how Emmy can be a famous actress yet stay rational and pray every day!!! Keep it up, Emmy :)!!!! Even I forget to humble myself to God and pray some days!!! And Patrick Wilson has just the right character for the part of Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, Christine's passionate lover. The movie is a masterpiece beyond doubt, but the plot did not follow the one of the book very well. The phantom's are very different. The book's has skin like yellow parchment, they do mention this a little, but the description does not fit the one of the phantom in the movie, and burning yellow eyes. Christine mentions ""those eyes that burn"" when she an Raoul are fleeing to the roof of the opera house from the stage. The book also tells about a persian man who saved Erik's( a.k.a the phantom's)life and knows the theater very well. He helps Raoul rescue Christine from the now insane with love Erik. They have to keep they're hands at the level of their eyes to prevent the Punjab lasso from coming over they're heads, one of Erik's ways of killing(which is also mentioned in the movie by Madame Giry). They are locked in a ingenious torture room by the mad Erik and Raoul starts to break under the torture...The Persian finds a button under the tree that opens the door out...(my hands hurt)...and the ending is so much different because of the Persian and his connection with Erik.

I really couldn't see anything wrong with it, the singing, especially, was superb. To all of you who don't like the way Gerard Butler played the Phantom, well, I don't like you!(Kidding! I was kidding! Jeez!) Anyway, back to being serious now, I really think Gerard Butler did a wonderful job playing the Phantom. He really put tons of emotion into the movie, and truly, I think, that's what makes the story so wonderful. That scene at the end where he was singing to the music box broke my heart into pieces. Emmy Rossum did a phenomenal job as Christine. Her voice, I think, was the best in the whole movie.

I have watched it over and over...first with subtitles so I could grasp what was going on. I have never loved a movie so much. I am WAY over the top. My husband loves it too, but he laughs at me because I have it on at almost every opportunity. I also have the soundtrack and generally go around with different songs from the movie in my head at all times.The actors were wonderful. I think they all did a great job with the singing and they look as good as they sound. I think the world has been too hard on Gerard Butler. He did a good job. He was outdone by Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum, but he certainly isn't hard to hear. I find his voice quite pleasant.The overall picture is a beautiful experience not to be missed. It is funny, tragic, beautiful, exciting and romantic.The double DVD has a lot of worthwhile special features. I particularly enjoyed the history of the making of the stage production.

The BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS songs are still glued in my head. First let's say...Gerard Butler has like a REALLLLLY HOT voice!!! OK, he can so sing. I don't care what people say. His voice is unique. He can portray so much emotion with it, it's unreal. This is not the easiest thing to do, to go instantly from hot, romantic voice to tormented angered voice. I should know. I'm a singer. Also, can we say that Emmy Rossum has A GORGEOUS voice? I heard it and was like, ""HELLO!!"" I cannot get over it!! And Patrick Wilson had a lovely voice as well. Man, Christine is sooo lucky!! She has two pretty hot guys madly in love with her, not to mention two hot guys with AWESOME voices!! It's sooo not fair!!! Also, I'd like to say how much Jennifer Ellsion and Miranda Richardson look alike!! It is so nice to see two people who we are supposed to believe are related actually look like each other. And how HYSTERICAL was Minnie Driver as La Carlotta? even though it was not her singing voice (but it was hers in the credits), it was still soooo funny!! I loved her accent!! It deserved so many more awards than it got. At the Oscars it should've won Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Song, etc. It's unjust, I tell you! lol. I want the soundtrack sooo bad now so I can put it on my iPod (when I actually GET an iPod lol). Well, I just want to say, if you haven't seen this, you HAVE to!! It's in my top ten favorite movie list! Wouldn't it be great if real life was like that, and you could sing everything instead of say it?",The Phantom of the Opera
1861,feul8853,Christine Makes This Movie,9,16 April 2006,"I was not a fan of the stage show before seeing this film. Despite the obvious quality of the production, I was always felt that the relationship between Christine and the Phantom lacked depth. I wanted to feel conflicted about Raul and Christine's triumph, to feel for the Phantom and his hopeless romantic plight.The movie, with the aid of close-ups, angles, lighting, and good acting helped solve this dilemma. There is a tangible attraction between Christine and the Phantom. She feels his unyielding love and reacts to it. The gazes between the two are haunting and alluring, bringing us closer to understanding the humanity of the Phantom and the capacity of Christine to love him despite his physical deformities. Their love is impossible, and we can feel its frustrations and our hearts ache for the cruel fate of the Phantom. This is apparent throughout the entire movie, but is especially poignant in Point of No Return scene.Emma Rossum expresses her character's innocence through a tremendous vocal display that I believe surpasses the original cast recording. The depth and quality of her acting make this movie a resounding success, carrying scenes where the other actors only provide sufficient performances. Overall, a highly recommended film.",The Phantom of the Opera
1862,limwen_greenleaf07,an excellent movie,10,12 September 2005,"i just recently bought the DVD of this movie. i've heard about the play all my life, but with this DVD i really got into the Phantom's feelings, that he isn't just an animal, an inhumane murderer, but a misunderstood genius. i thought Emmy Rossum was incredibly gifted Christine, and Patrick Wilson was the best Raul i've ever had the pleasure to see. i think my favorite feature of this particular version of PotO is that the main characters were doing all the singing for themselves. that just makes the movie so much more enjoyable. and of course while the screenplay is delightful, the real drawing feature of this movie is the music, the wonderful soundtrack that accompanied it. if you're worried that you won't like this because of the ""opera"" in the title, please consider watching it. this is not your stereotypical viking-studded ear-piercing opera, this is a classic, a gem of modern cinematography. i heartily recommend watching it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1863,horsegirl535,Wonderful making of such an awesome opera,10,23 June 2005,"Gerard Butler was the ideal casting as The Phantom. He had the more dangerous appeal than some had. It was obvious that Christine would like him because he was more the right side of danger. The set and special effects were out of this world. If I was a director, I would cast all of these people together again, because they just fed off of each others confidence. The design of the Phantoms layer was quite elaborate looking. I would like to know how it was made. The actual interior of the opera house was very stunning. It took my breath away as the movie showed it being re-created when the chandelier went up. The ending was sad, but I will not tell you about it. You must watch the movie and be amazed for yourself. I hope you enjoyed reading my comments.",The Phantom of the Opera
1864,dudek-6,Breathtaking,10,23 June 2005,"Wow this film really blew me away. I had always wanted to see the opera but could never afford the tickets, so was thrilled to finally know what the story was all about. As for the cast, they were perfectly selected. I fell in love with the Phantom (Gerald Butler) but also Raoul (Patrick Wilson) The music still puts goose bumps on my arms even after listening to it over and over. Bought the film and the cd of the music, made myself a copy as i am sure it will soon be worn out from using them. Anyway, I have never seen a movie that has moved me so much emotionally as this story. I would say without a doubt that this is my favorite movie in its category, and that it was fantastically made. Can't say enough about it, just go and see it and be pleasantly surprised as I was.",The Phantom of the Opera
1865,roxade,Astounding,9,23 June 2005,"I just loved this version of The Phantom of the Opera. Great scenery, photography, costumes and great music as well, wonderful soundtrack, elegant and sensual movie. Beautiful voice that one of Emmy Rossum (Christine),delicate, fine. One of the best performances of Minny Driver I've ever seen. She can be funny!! And what to say about Butlers performance... incredible phantom, unforgettable, intense, passionate and yet... vulnerable,lonely and sad, it really warms your heart until tears... I LOVED him in this movie!! To really get to the heart of the intense feeling the Phantom felt for Christine, I had to see this movie a couple of times. And I hope to see this opera in a theater some day...",The Phantom of the Opera
1866,deanpiriedp,Abominable!,3,21 May 2015,"As a huge Phan of the stage show, i can honestly say that this is one of my least favorite films. The stage show means so much to me, and many other people, and all this film does is take a huge sh*t on it. While the sets look great, and the singing is decent, even for a film adaptation, it just doesn't work. The majority of actors are terrible, Gerard and Emmy in particular. Its such a shame because this really could have been great but it was doomed ever since Joel Schumacher got involved. Really the only good thing about this is the soundtrack, but with Gerard butler as the title character; avoid.this is god awful, but what would you expect from the man who put nipples on Batman?",The Phantom of the Opera
1867,JTHMclone,Phantom of the Opera,10,24 June 2005,Phantom of the Opera was the best movie ever. I despise love movies but This was different. It had excellent actors and actresses they were the Best IV seen in a long time. The music was also excellent enough that I Went out and bought the soundtrack. I cant say how much I loved this Movie. I cant wait to get it so I can watch it and not have to worry about taking it back to the video store. The soundtrack had some of the best song IV ever heard. I can't stop listening and it never gets boring. If the book is anything like the movie I will adore that too. They choose the best people for the movie they did their part very well. It wouldn't be as good if the characters were different.,The Phantom of the Opera
1868,luvspasta,"Wonderful, Astonishing, Stunning",10,1 July 2005,"I do agree with most of you that this is a remarkable film. Not only does it display a wide variety of singers with different tones that mixed together make magic, but it also shows great improvement from other stories of 'The Phantom of the Opera'. Before my friend told me to watch the movie, I would have never, ever listened to Opera music. Once I realized how stunning and adrenaline-rising it is, I got the soundtrack.I must say that I was a little disappointed that Christine ended up with the Phantom, though most say that she was meant to be with Raoul. I totally disagree, because if you notice when she is in the room after the great performance she did, Raoul is being rather pushy with her and telling her to come and meet him when she doesn't want to. In my opinion, Raoul de Chagncy or whatever is a trouble-maker. Because he: #1- Made the Phantom go crazy by taking Christine back. Then he wants to fight him at the end for what he did. What is he doing? Challenging himself to prove he is worthy of Christine? Then I suddenly want to change my mind and change it back when I remember the sword fight. Raoul could have killed the Phantom, but he didn't because Christine told him not to. Christine wanted him to love- so if she didn't want to be with him, why wouldn't she let Raoul kill him? It seemed at the end when she said, 'This haunted face shows no horror for me now' that she might actually want to be with him because she isn't scared anymore. Why did Raoul even deserve Christine? He had Christine when he was young, the Phantom had a man beating him as a child. Back to the sword fight, Raoul could have killed the Phantom, and I do think it was rather rude that the Phantom tried to kill him after Raoul let him go. But he's a Phantom, you know? My opinion: Wonderful movie, doesn't show the happy-fairy tale ending, but it does show an ending that would actually happen in real life. I loved it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1869,babyj_1291,I love this movie,10,27 June 2005,This movie is the best of all times and I don't usually say this about musicals. I just feel bad for the opera in the end of the movie. I wish that some one would of stayed with the phantom. It made me feel sad. Christine should have stayed with the phantom instead of Raoul. I felt like crying. I don't like musicals that much but I love the Phantom of the Opera. I liked at the end of the movie when Raoul saw the flower with the black ribbon and the ring. I felt like really bad for the Phantom. But I didn't really get the black and white scenes. They confused me a lot. Even at the end of the movie I didn't really get who the old lady and old man was. But I still love that movie.,The Phantom of the Opera
1870,morgan05,The best version I've seen!,9,28 June 2005,"This movie really converted me, I've seen it on stage once and heard the track with Brightman and Crawford, but the music never caught me until I saw this version. It's truly gorgeous, beautiful pictures and sound, great actors and great story. See this if you want to be seduced, it has it all: romance, excitement, action, song, comedy, tragedy... As for the singers, especially the two leads are magnificent. Emily Rossum has a good voice and a sweetness and tenderness which is needed for the role. Gerard Butler is just as great, but if you can't cope with his voice and personality you probably won't enjoy the picture. Personally I really like both his singing and acting, he's probably more actor than singer, but though his voice is a bit rough it just adds to the role. His phantom is more romantic lover than madman. The film could be more scary, and the phantom isn't ugly enough, but that's minor flaws. I think the movie's deeper and open for various interpretation and will attract a new, younger audience who might have trouble relating to the show. Definitely worth seeing!",The Phantom of the Opera

Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher made excellent choices for the roles! i couldn't have chosen better! Gerard Butler has the exact voice the phantom should have and Patrick Wilson was an amazing Raoul! but Emmy...wow, she has an amazing voice. i was very surprised at these people's abilities to sing, and to sing well. it was a huge improvement from the stage play. and the sets were just amazing! when you see the movie on the big screen, it almost feels as if you're there. i saw it 8 times in theatres and 25 times at home. that might give you an example of how amazing this movie is!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1872,brittchick529,One of the greatest films of all time...,10,23 July 2005,"I love this film. Need I say more. Coming from someone who has never seen the stage production, I loved it. The music, the actors and actresses, the set, the entire film was amazing. Emmy Rossum is one of the greatest young actresses around and she was inspiring and wonderful. She was perfect for the role of Christine and did a phenomenal job. Gerard Butler doesn't seem to get enough credit from most people who have reviewed this film. He was the perfect, ideal Phantom. I see what Andrew Lloyd Webber saw in him and wanted others to see. The Phantom needed to be sexy, yet mysterious and passionate. His voice was soothing and heartfelt. Andrew Lloyd Webber could not have had a better cast. I'm glad he chose actors who weren't that well known because it gives the movie more of a realistic truth. If he had casted well known actors, the film wouldn't have made it seem so real. You have a certain image of what certain characters are like and with these actors, I had that. It was almost like I had invisioned it, only so much better. It exceeded all my greatest expectations and desires. This is one of the most amazing films of all time. Though it didn't receive many awards like it well deserved, it's passion carries on and into the hearts of all of those who are inspired by, ""The music of the night.""",The Phantom of the Opera

1874,miranda-dudley,What i thought:,9,26 August 2005,"OK, so i have seen the stage show 2 times, and the first was with Micheal Crawford. What has irrupted me is that all the Micheal fans did not even give this movie a decent chance because he was not in the movie. The fact it that this movie is AMAZING!!!! I loved it so much!!! Yes, Gerard Butler is no Micheal Crawford, but he wasn't meant to be. The movie goes in a completely different directing then the stage show. It is beautiful to look at and a captivating story. I was glued to the screen through the whole entire thing.I think that all of the the actors did a wonderful job, the acting was wonderful and they sung great. Gerard was very impressive with the character and i found his betrayal so beautiful and sad, that i cried at the end. He captured the sadness of the Phantom so well! And yes, i think he can sing and did brought a different sound to the parts. I really think that if the Micheal fans can loosen up, they will realize the true beauty about this movie. I mean, why cant you like both? And for the people that haven't seen the stage show, you are in for one heck of a ride!!! When u see this movie, you will be hooked! I have never been able to get the songs and scenes out of my head!

I had seen the stage version 3 times in London since 1990 and enjoyed every performance. I had never considered watching the movie version until now.Both Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum were magnificent in their respective roles. They were backed up by an enchanting supporting cast and concise direction. It amazes me how this movie was given such bad reviews when it first came out. The so called ""professional"" critics gave it a hard time. I suppose these are the same ""professional"" highly paid critics that have never acted, sang or danced in their lives? The answer is of course Yes! Gerard Butler had never had a singing lesson in his life yet he was superb. He must of been unsure of his ability to perform this role but he delivered a wonderful performance. Emmy Rossum was a memorable Christine. Delivering innocence and beauty combined with vulnerability. This is a tragic love story that has been transferred to screen quite beautifully. I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not have at least one tear in their eye by the end.",The Phantom of the Opera
1877,evlohl,This movie was an unparalleled delight!,10,16 July 2005,"I truly loved this movie. It was everything that a person would want to see. The music was wonderful, the sets were gorgeous and the acting was unbelievably wonderful.I saw the live performance a few years ago and it was very good, but I don't remember that much about the ""Phantom"" character. You definitely could never forget the Phantom in this movie. Gerard Butler played the Phantom with such charisma. The character, you felt, just came alive. I loved his voice -- it was so strong. Actually some of that music would be very difficult to sing and especially someone that was not professionally trained. All of the cast was superb and they all did a marvelous job. I think you have to see this movie at least a couple of times before you really appreciate it.I saw this movie over 30 times in the movie theater and was so depressed when it finally left the end of April 2005 in my area. I don't go to many movies because I don't care for most of them but this one was SOOOO special. I bought the CD and DVD as soon as it came out and I'm still playing it in my car. I just cannot get enough of it. I truly believe that this movie is the best I have ever seen. It is so classy and so beautiful and the three leads were wonderful. But truly the STAR was Gerard Butler--he was just magnificent. I don't think this movie would have been as good without him. Many times when the movie ended, people would applaud and I thought that was so great -- I don't ever remember that happening before. This applause also included a lot of the younger people. I think Mr. Webber gained a lot of new fans.I had never heard of Gerard Butler before this movie but I have since gone to see Dear Frankie, which was an absolutely charming movie. I bought the DVD and will be following his career.Joel Schumacher did a great job in directing this movie and I believe he and Andrew Lloyd Webber worked very closely together in the making of this movie and it definitely shows.It truly was ""An Unparalleled Delight"".",The Phantom of the Opera

I have never seen the stage production, and am not really into musicals all that much.That being said, I cannot believe how captivated I was by it all. I was very surprised by Gerard Butler's role as the Phantom. I have read some reviews stating that his singing wasn't what it should be, but to me it was perfect. The harsher tones at certain points conveyed feeling. A man with inner turmoil. Rossum's voice is flawless, and she is truly a gifted actress as well as singer. The scenes were beautiful, the costumes exceptional. For a person who doesn't care much for opera, or musicals... This is truly a wonderful movie about one man's inner struggle to control the demons society has placed on him. I would recommend this movie to all. Bravo!!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

Gerard Butler is so hot and has such an amazing voice, i think he was perfect for the part of the phantom. Emmy Rosum is great in it too. She has a great voice and is so beautiful.

Phantom has always been my favorite opera and book and I was not sure that a movie would be able to do it justice... However I must say that I was absolutely blown away. This has become my favorite movie, the music is wonderful, they could not have chosen better actors and actresses to play these parts. I could feel the Phantoms pain and hurt and I could feel Christine being torn between Raoul and the Phantom, her Angel of Music. Such a beautiful, sad story... He just wanted to be loved. No matter how many times I see it, or listen to the sound track I am still drawn into it, I still feel the magic, my heart still pounds in my chest and I wait with baited breath to see what will happen.

It is timeless, the story and the emotions.",The Phantom of the Opera

Besides being hot, Gerard Butler is an eloquent inspired Phantom paired with fragile, innocent Emmy Rossum as Christine-I love her voice! The thought of watching it is thrilling, and I am glad to own it. Any lover of the original movie, the Broadway musical, or the novel will absolutely love the movie. Every character is refined and wonderful-I love Miranda Richardson, or Mme. Giry.It will be anyone's classic. Eveeryone in it sings beautifully, and I am slightly embarrassed to say that I use it to train my own voice.

1882,GMahler1911,breath taking visuals vs. slightly off key singing,7,16 July 2005,"The movie is breathtakingly beautiful that I could watch it over, and over again. Which is good, since it can over shadow some of the singing off key of the Phantom (Gerard Butler), and the light mousy voice of Christine (Emmy Rossum)which is airy. This makes it very hard to believe that she could be any kind of replacement for an opera coloratura soprano. It's too light, and has that innocent childlike sound to it. Sweet in sound and texture. Also I had to wonder when does a ballet choreographer became and expert in operatic voices?The movie overall is hypnotic watching it, and I'll watch it yet again. The scenery, the actual music, the costuming, the effects that left my mouth gaping in awestruck, wonderment and fascination. Then again, maybe I'm hoping Butler will finally hit the right notes.",The Phantom of the Opera

My 10 year old daughter and her cousins have never seen the play, but just saw the movie a few weeks ago.

Incredible actor, great voice, sexier than any man I have ever seen on screen. Made me wish I was 20 years younger, and he was just around the corner. Very believable as the Phantom. 5 star performance. All of the other actors were divine. I came away thinking, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I have purchased 5, for different friends and family.

1886,toni_the_squirrel,A Delight to the Ears and the Eyes,10,22 July 2005,"For most of us, we have only heard about the Phantom of the Opera, and the image we usually get is a masked man sitting in front of an organ. Imagine my surprise when I saw the movie for the first time. The scenes were beautifully constructed, and there was no doubt it took place in Paris in it's time period. Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber's choice of cast was ideal. Emmy and Patrick already had years of musical experience under their belt, and Gerard had a natural gift (despite being somewhat distracted by his singing lisp), so the opera style of singing was bearable to the ears and did not threaten to break glass. The storyline flowed nicely, although a question arised often, ""What happened to the Phantom's face to begin with?"" This was neither explained in the movie nor the book, so it leaves an essence of mystery to the viewers. What makes this even better is that it only differs slightly from the actual stage version of the show. Tweaked lyrics and many more instruments only adds to the effect a movie gives.",The Phantom of the Opera

It's awesome. Different. Three-dimensional.I loved the chandelier.

The Music Score was excellent, the Acting was brilliant and I was enthralled from start to finish. So much so that I never realised that it went on for as long as it did.The Only Critiques I can come up with are really very minor, and that is the guy who played the Phantom at times did not have a voice that was powerful enough to do justice to the music score, otherwise no complaints.I have to admit that what recommended me to this film was watching a video of the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" performed by one of my favourite bands Nightwish, the video made the film look good. The thing is the Film is so much better than the Video as to lift the Video up, not the other way around (as is normal).As I rented it, tomorrow (or later today should I say) I am gong to go and buy it. Awesome.",The Phantom of the Opera
1889,trevor_ownage,Visually Stunning,7,25 August 2005,"Sitting at my girlfriends house we sit down to watch the rented ""Phantom of the Opera."" Not knowing much about it pre-viewing I have neutral feelings of anticipation for this film, however hoping the screenplay will live up to the musical...Unfortunately I am ignorant of Schumacher's prior works which probably, to some extent, helps me to enjoy this film more than usual taking into account that the style of direction used in this film would usually irritate me.Visually the Phantom of the Opera is nothing short of breathtaking; adopting a dark and artistic approach from the outset. I commend the direction of this film, which adopts perfectly to the screen play. If anything this film has inspired me to go out and view it in its intended context at the theatre.However this film does have it's pitfalls, and major ones at that. I have deliberately failed to read reviews prior to publishing mine in order to not have my views swayed. But.... the music is terribly out of tune in places, with the main protagonist being ""The Phantom."" Especially in the opening few scenes his voice is weak and tuneless, which personally, from then on, put me on a downer throughout the remainder of the film. This thoroughly peeved me off as apart from the performance of Lloyd Webber's score the cast have done a fine job of adapting this to the screenplay, it's just that bloody Phantom that lets the side down (pardon me for being short).If you feel I am being a tad harsh emphasising and playing on the fact that some notes are misplaced then let me point out the fact that this is an adaptation of a hugely successful musical and should therefore be of the highest musical quality, is this unfair to ask? Apart from this the film is spectacular visually and in most places musically. Well worth the watch, but be warned I felt some of the scenes in this film were a little ""lucky"" shall we say of receiving a 12A stamp.",The Phantom of the Opera
1890,greymooseajp,Pleasantly surprised!!!,10,25 July 2005,"I was pleasantly surprised after initially viewing this movie adaptation of the historically renowned theatrical performance. As a trained vocalist, I was not surprised to read several snobbish and boorish reviews concerning the lack of trained vocalists included in the movie. I often wonder if the people paid to review these films actually have any training to accurately comment on such matters while spewing venom from their esteemed perches. Personally, I make a point to see any movie that has been vilified by the pseudo-intellectual vermin. The critics certainly missed the call on this movie.Gerard Butler was outstanding in his rendition of The Phantom. Unfamiliar with his previous acting ability, Butler's strong acting performance encouraged me to further inquire about his training and career.Familiar with many of the previous movie adaptations and the Broadway performance, I always felt that the phantom was a figure whose devotion to Christine and her musical career were misunderstood. This further applies to the fact that The Phantom is a figure who exudes a tremendous amount of sexuality in pursuing Christine. The sexual bond existing between these characters becomes clear when watching the progression of the opening sequences following Christine's magnificent rendition of Think of Me.Christine, torn between her obligation to the Angel of Music (The Phantom) and her childhood sweetheart Raul, remains torn when it concerns the sexual appeal of The Phantom and her present lover. This sexual attraction remains with her despite recognizing the extreme measures that The Phantom is capable of taking in order to assure their future together. In The Phantom's mind, their relationship gradually transcends from tutor-student to a potential love affair. I know this contradicts the ending, but the possibility remains throughout the movie.The most exhilarating moment occurs when The Phantom exits his lair near the end of the movie. I wondered just what happened with respect to Meg (Jennifer Ellison) and a potential relationship with our suffering hero. The fact that she locates his discarded mask, picks it up, and appears to follow after him conjures up the following in my mind: I envision Meg finding The Phantom, becoming his student, and becoming romantically involved with the latter. This would certainly be plausible when at the end of the movie we note the single red rose securing the ring returned by Christine to The Phantom. In this way, I could believe that The Phantom gained some degree of happiness in his life. Regardless, the ending was simply touching and personally moving! I actually hope that Andrew Lloyd Weber considers producing a sequel in order to answer some of the questions that remain once the movie ends. Watch this movie. It allows for conjecture as to what occurred during the period that the Opera House burned and Christine's death.",The Phantom of the Opera
1891,KLange621,Warning! Extreme amateur singing in this disappointing musical movie.,6,23 October 2005,"If you want to be wowed by Broadway-style singing, do not see this movie. After hearing Michael Crawford as the Phantom, my expectations were high. While this movie is a visual feast and the story is classic, the poor quality of the singing ruined it completely. Emmy Rossum as Christine, although not horrible, definitely does NOT have the powerful soprano voice that this role requires. Instead, she has a wispy, weak, somewhat pretty voice that does nothing to enhance her character. Most disappointing was the Phantom. It sounded to me most of the time that he was half speaking during his singing parts and ended up yelling during louder notes. I thought that if the people that made this movie were going through all the trouble to make it so visually splendid, that they would have been able to get some great, or at least strong, singers to fill these roles.",The Phantom of the Opera
1892,urbancountry,I'll Stick With the Stage Production,1,25 July 2005,"I've seen Phantom Several Times on Stage, and this movie doesn't even come close to the stage production at ALL. I was really bored with the Movie not what I expected from Joel Schumacher at all, not that all of his movies are bad, I actually enjoy quite a few of his movies, but in this one The Phantom was played poorly, Christine was played well, plot was nothing like the stage production, some of the musical numbers were rushed I think the thing I enjoyed Most about the Movie was the Music, but that's because I enjoy singing along. More then Likely I won't be adding the DVD to My collection, thought I will be buying the soundtrack. I still think Michael Crawford makes the best Phantom, and Sarah Brightman the best Christine I've ever seen. I was Surprised to see Minnie Driver in this Movie, didn't think she go for a role like that.",The Phantom of the Opera
1893,mrshell87,It's backwards!,6,8 December 2005,"I thought the overall production was good. Emmy was horrible! She looked the part of Christine and that's about it. Her voice was airy and young sounding, nothing like Christine is supposed to sound like. Emmy had no core to her tone and was awful on the high notes-now Christine is supposed to be better than Carlotta but in this movie this was not the case. So it made no sense as to why the phantom was pushing so hard for Christine to get the role other than he was teaching her. This movie would have been a lot better if someone else had played Christine. Gerard Bulter did a good phantom, but the phantom is supposed to be the best singer in the show and Raoul was so much better than him. And Raoul is supposed to be better looking than the phantom and the phantom was better looking than Raoul. So this movie is kind of backwards.",The Phantom of the Opera

I sing it in the car everywhere we go. I have the DVD and i also have a script from the play. i watch the DVD as much as possible.Emmy Rossum was wonderful for the part because i think her beauty was perfect, her voice is like a thousand angels. It's not squeaky and its not low. But Gerard Butler sings a little off key.But when my family went to the play, when the masquerade stairs showed, we were blown away, all the color!

1895,charmedqueen03,My Thoughts,9,4 August 2005,"I've never seen the original plays or read the books, but the movie got me interested. I'm a girl who likes romantic movies. I own at least one movie that has at least one member of the cast in it so most of the actors are familiar to me. Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Emmy Rossum all star in films I own and I've seen Gerard Butler in a movie. The Music- I fairly enjoyed the music. It's probably the one thing that got me attached. I've read that some people thought that Gerard Butler's voice was pretty much, pathetic. However, to me I love it. Emmy's is beautiful. Much more beautiful than my own and my friends think I have a great voice. Patrick, his voice portrays the pretty boy that I've heard from most of my Phantom friends. The Acting- As usual the acting is sublime. That's all I have to say really. Sets, Design, and the what not- The sets are very extravagant, costumes excellent, but to me it's a bit overdone. The plot- It drew me in when I rented the movie on DVD since the movie had not entered theaters around my hometown. So I paid $1 to see this movie and then I bought it with my own money.To the haters, that's your opinion. For me I adore the movie and plan to keep it in my collection for it is an excellent movie that captured me just like Moulin Rouge did when I first saw it. In truth I love the movie more for the costumes and music.",The Phantom of the Opera

Not to discount your opinion, but I think the fact that you haven't seen the play is the only reason you like the movie.First of all, the Phantom of the Opera is supposed to be able to sing. That's kind of the whole point. This guy just cant do it. Second, the Phantom wears a mask for a reason. He's not supposed to look like a Ken doll. ""Oh no his face is so hideous! It's chiseled and clean shaven! It was horrible!"" Whatever. Third, the first time the Phantom of the Opera theme was played, what was that? Nightwish?? That was the worst cover of a song ever done... and definitely didn't belong in this film. Well, maybe it does, it was just as horrible as the rest of the movie. Lame attempt at ""jazzing"" up the movie, and it made it sound cheap and lazy.I'm a huge fan of the play, and this movie is just plain insulting. I'm curious as to whether anyone who put together this movie has ever even SEEN the opera, or if they just read from a screenplay. Absolutely horrible, wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy, please spend a couple dollars and go see the play. On the other hand, if you like cheap hacks and a complete lack for all soul in a story, this might be right up your alley.",The Phantom of the Opera

The Phantom said it to Rauol when he was in the underground caves.It was repeated 2 or 3 times in the movie and I do not understand the significance.I do not know why I have to have ten lines of print in order to ask a simple question.I would appreciate it if someone knows the significance of this phrase...Thanks Tim",The Phantom of the Opera

The film portrays a fantastic view of the whole story.The way in which Emmy and Gerry portray the relationship between Christine and The Phantom is beautiful.This film is absolutely faultless.Every member member of the cast is perfect for each role.This film is more beautiful than I ever thought it could have been in my wildest dreams.Sheer beautiful.,The Phantom of the Opera

They used an outstanding, extremely talented cast and crew who obviously felt they were working on something quite special that only comes along once in a lifetime.Emmy Rossum was born to play Christine and Patrick Wilson shines as Raoul. But, ""at the end of the day,"" it's Gerard Butler who excels in his role as The Phantom, a gutsy, raw, electrifying performance that captures the deepest emotions and leaves the audience overwhelmed with what has come to pass.Bravo!

1901,Suzybelle,Unforgettable!!,10,31 August 2005,"I have never seen the stage production but I do have the Original London Cast recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I loved the music and their performances. I liked Sarah enough to have watched a few T.V. specials in which she performed. Then I watched this movie when it came out on DVD. First of all, let me say, I couldn't speak at the end, the tears were streaming down my face. Gerard Butler as the Phantom gave that role the heart and soul that frankly I have to admit I never got from Mr. Crawford's rendition. Emmy Rossum became the definitive Christine and suddenly Sarah sounded like Carlotta. The rest of the cast were wonderful as well. I am forced to conclude that while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman may sing technically perfect, they miss the boat as far as emotion is concerned. Maybe it's the switch from performing on the stage and performing in a movie. Something the critics seem to have forgotten when they were writing their reviews. Anyway, in a word...UNFORGETTABLE!!!",The Phantom of the Opera

He had this sensual, smoldering sort of thing going and you could really feel the character when he played it. The love, the passion, the heart-break. Everything was just so fantastic. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on SO MUCH!!! The Phantom of the Opera is such an old production, and Webber has really brought it to life this time. The cast he has chosen are PERFECT for their parts, and you can feel all of their emotions. Christine and her love for the Phantom and Raoul, understanding how she must feel about Phantom. He inspires her voice, but she still loves Raoul and always will. When you see that, you know it will destroy Phantom, because he loves her so completely.

Each time I watch the scene where they bring up the old chandelier and they play that music I get chills! It's about a disfigured musical genius who lives in the cellars of the Opera house. He soon falls in love the Christine Daae's voice and is determined to make her a star. Christine is then forced to make a choice between her childhood sweetheart (Vicont de Chagney) and her beloved Phantom. (I personally would have chosen the Phantom. Raoul just really bugged me for some reason. I don't know why.) I absolutely LOVED the singing! Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice, and I thought Gerry Butler did a great job as the Phantom! I LOVED him in the Point of No Return! How could Christine say no to that? I also loved him in the Music of the Night.Well, it's my favorite movie ever and I highly advise that you watch it. it's amazing!

They can show much more in a film than they can on a Broadway stage. I loved the stage play because your listening to this beautiful music from a live orchestra! I didn't see how the film could be anywhere near as fine as the stage play but believe me it is great! Gerard Butler is so good as the phantom. Emmy Rossum is just as good. I don't know if her singing is her own voice or not but it is beautiful. I have seen the stage play once but intend to see it again in the fall of 2005. The tickets are $100.00 but it is worth the price. I bought the DVD of the movie and have watched it five times so far. I know I will watch it ten times ten in the future. This is the most beautiful music, and lyrics I've ever heard anywhere. Go see this film, or if in New York the play you will be very glad that you did. A huge fan.",The Phantom of the Opera

I have seen it a couple of times now and the music stays in my head. All of the characters are great but...... The phantom, played by Mr. Gerard Butler is by far my favorite. I simply ""fell in love"" with him. Mr. Gerard Butler played the role in my opinion to perfection. He takes you with him through the emotions of Love, hate and despair and you wind up wishing that you could change the ending of the story.

1909,too_damn_tired_2_care,If only Butler hadn't spoilt it ...,5,5 September 2005,"I must say I was terribly disappointed by this lavish film version of the brilliant West End hit. Firstly I will say that the casting of Minnie Driver was inspired - she is brilliant. All the supporting cast do a superb job and Rossum has a brilliant voice (even if her acting isn't up to scratch). Also I loved hearing the score revamped and played on a full orchestra. The costumes were brilliant, and the set pieces lavish and just as you would expect. I thought the explanation of where the Phantom came from was well explained and they made a good choice by explaining it in full (where as in the musical it is only touched upon). It is Butler's dismal performance as the Phantom that ruined the film for me. Why they cast him I will never know. He can barely hold a tune and as for his acting - HE IS AWFUL!! The Phantom holds the piece together and without him the film falls flat. Butler has about as much charisma as a damp flannel. I only really enjoyed the film when he wasn't in it - which is a pity as he is in it for a substantial amount of time. See it, but only after you have seen the stage version.",The Phantom of the Opera
1910,Sweetykat38,Beautiful and breathtaking just like the live production,10,29 August 2005,"I saw The Phantom Several years ago live on stage in Toronto. It was magnificent then. I thought I'd never see it again. When the movie came out I ran to see it. It was fantastic! Beautiful voices and characters! Now I can watch this Masterpiece of Drama and Music over and over as often as I like. It's fantastic. I love the Story line here, Webber's music just brings it all together. Along with great casting and a wonderful set this movie is amazing. This movie really touches me when I watch it, every time. The emotion that is meant to be there in every song and filling every second of this movie is very well displayed. To show that much emotion in any given song without ruining it is truly the mark of a good singer.PS I'm a choir girl I KNOW good music. ;-)",The Phantom of the Opera
1911,mikenathrose,A highly memorable movie that I enjoyed immensely,10,30 August 2005,"I was at first skeptical about seeing this movie since the reviews were so bad. After a friend recommended it to me, though, I rented it. It was nothing short of phenomenal! Bosh the sights and sounds were spectacular, and I found myself humming the songs afterward. Since then, I've seen the movie at least ten times, and I have the songs memorized. I love them! I've never seen the play, so I only had a vague idea of the plot. I (like many others) had seen Emmy Rossum in The Day After Tomorrow. In this movie, I was completely blown away by her performance as Christine, and especially, her voice. This was a movie that truly showcased her talents.I was not expecting to see such a handsome phantom, but Gerard Butler's portrayal of the reclusive musical genius was wonderfully genuine. Patrick Wilson also did quite a fine job as Raoul.This movie contains riveting performances, incredible singing, and many spectacular images. The opera house interior was gorgeous and colossal, and all the other sets were similarly amazing. Possibly my favorite part of the movie is near the beginning, when the opera house transitions from its decrepit state of the future into the glorious theater that it once was. The dazzling visual effects combined with the haunting organ music of the overture creates an astonishing masterpiece of a scene that sent shivers down my spine.If you are a person who likes musicals, go see this movie.

I have watched it many times and I am still seeing things I hadn't seen before because I am so entranced with these wonderful performers and their superb voices. Joel Schumacher does a wonderful job transforming this from play to movie, it is dark and mysterious when necessary but always beautiful. The casting was perfect, this phantom has a deeper/richer voice which blends so beautifully in the finale with the higher voices of Raoul and Christine and adds darkness, mystery and power to his portrayal as well.

1913,SnowyCrow,Brilliant adaption!,8,2 September 2005,I have seen a great many versions of this timeless tale of obsessive love. This is the first version that feels the truest to me. The scenery was superb and lavish. The costumes amazing and the singing was the quality one would expect of a Broadway show. I fell in love with this tale after seeing it on Broadway. The story itself was enough to bring me to tears every time i see it. The music is splendidly redone in a more modern tone and manages to loose none of the complexity of Webbers compositions. The film adaption of the play is by far the best version i have yet to see. Christine and the Phantom congeal in a spectacular form. The acting is flawless and the chemistry between the three main characters is enough to drop the toughest to their knees. I had one problem and that was the synchronizing to the music and acting. It was off in many places. It did not however distract me from the extravagant sets and music in this timeless film.,The Phantom of the Opera

Gerald Butler with the little experience that he had as a singer was very moving, seductive and perfect for the role of the Phantom. Why this movie got some of the worst write-ups I will never know. I have watched it many times and the Phantom still brings tears to my eyes. The music was perfectly matched with the person(s) singing it. I had not one complaint even though I could see some flaws.

1916,KateDestler,'Phan'tastic!,8,11 September 2005,"'The Phantom of the Opera' is the cure for all those who are bored to death with Hollywood blockbusters.The Phantom, (or Erik, as he is known as in the Gaston Leroux novel) is a disfigured genius who has created his home beneath a Paris Opera house. He has lived in solitude since he was rescued from the freak show by one Madame Giry. But, the moment he hears young Christine Daae sing, he knows that he loves her and becomes her 'angel of music'. He believes he can make her love him, until Victome Raoul De Chagny, Christine's childhood friend, gets in the way.The performances in this piece are brilliant, with the exception of two. Gerard Butler, playing The Phantom, cannot sing. Andrew Lloyd Webber says he had a 'rock and roll' quality he wanted for The Phantom, but I wonder whether he was really vying for a more attractive Phantom. Jennifer Ellison, playing Meg Giry, was a wonderful dancer, but to weak a singer to play a part in this movie.The songs were displayed in all their original brilliance, although some may find a few songs too dry for their liking, such as Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again or Prima Donna.There were only two truly pointless parts of this piece. In the graveyard, Erik and Raoul sword fight after Erik pretends to be Christine's long dead father. In the original play, Raoul and Erik simply talk at this point, there is no extravagant duel between them. In the movie, Raoul is able defeat Erik, and only spares him because Christine begs him to. This is ridiculous. Even if they had fought, Raoul could not have beaten Erik. Erik has been climbing around the opera house for years, and Raoul was a spoiled child who probably never had to lift a finger.Also, when Raoul is going down to Erik's lair in the movie's climax to save Christine, he falls into one of The Phantom's traps. He falls into an underwater pit, with a grate falling on him. Raoul however, simply pulls the wheel to raise the pit. The wheel is conveniently located right where the prisoner could find it and free himself. Can we say plot device? I have been extremely critical of this, and you may be turned off. Don't be. This was easily the best movie of 2004, and my favourite film ever. If you see this, you won't regret it. It was, as the 'phan' girls would say, 'Phantastic!'",The Phantom of the Opera

The sets and acting are a definite 10+.I especially love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I have been involved in the theater arena for over 10 years,not as an actor,but in the business end, and i am familiar in the hiring practices. The choice for the Phantom was perfect.

I was blown away. I won't repeat all the positive comments that others have posted, but I just have to say one thing: I don't think that there could have been a better choice for the Phantom than Gerard Butler.I, like many others, owned and constantly listened to the original recording with Michael Crawford ever since I was little. And I honestly and truly prefer Butler far above Crawford. I am a sensible young woman in a serious relationship and I do not normally flip over other men. But wow, Butler was so incredibly sexy, magnetic, sensual that I was completely mesmerized by him from the first moment he came on screen. And frankly, I thought his voice was absolutely beautiful; I have listed to ""Music of the Night"" at least 10 times and every note that Butler sings sends chills down my spine. He intoned every single lyric with the most intense emotion, and his rich baritone was absolutely beautiful to listen to. And, I agree with one of the earliest posters that by the end of ""Point of No Return"" I was ready to ""rip my bra off"", it was the sexiest scene I've ever seen in a movie. I didn't even know who Butler was before, but now he has topped my list of the hottest, sexiest men in show business.",The Phantom of the Opera

This is an entertaining film with wonderful performances by all, particularly Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Emmy Rossum as Christine. Gerard Butler plays the Phantom with dramatic intensity and flair. He plays up the dark and dangerous side very well and adds heartbreaking vulnerability during the tragic moments. His singing voice was also very good and has a haunting, raw and passionate cadence to it. I actually prefer his voice in comparison to the smooth, musical notes of a Broadway trained singer. Emmy Rossum is the perfect Christine, with a sweet and vulnerable portrayal that later grows more confident and mature as the story progresses. As a professionally trained singer she hits all the right notes and has a passionate, melodious voice that is a delight to listen to.The Phantom of the Opera is a visual feast with all the right ingredients: drama, suspense, action, romance and tragedy.

The music, played by a 105-piece orchestra is lush and amazingly beautiful and the acting, for the most part, is quite good as well. The characters are interesting and well developed and each and every song is simply enchanting. The only draw back is the ending is rather sad and leaves many a viewer wishing for more. In addition to all of this the sets are beautiful and give off the amazing feeling of actually being in the a Parisian opera house. Grandeur is the only way of describing.

It has tons of controversy, which causes the audience to want to watch it multiple times in order to decide what to believe. It also has symbolism throughout, which adds to the quality of the plot. Additionally, it has layers, adding to its re-watchablity. I have watched this movie more times than I can count, and I have yet to get bored of it. This is because, every time I watch it, I catch something I never noticed before. I see the situation in a different light. Along with this, the actors and actresses are excellent. No action or expression ever contradicts the characters' personalities. The emotions also seem real, which causes the watcher to become very involved, especially if he or she enjoys romance.",The Phantom of the Opera

And, like plenty of others, I was extremely disappointed. I don't know, I just think if the Phantom is able to make Christine think he's an angel of music, then being able to actually sing is kinda important. Also, considering Christine is supposed to amaze people with her voice, you'd think she could at least hit the notes. Just my opinion. Granted, the characters are hard to live up to, but it can be done with proper casting. I actually preferred some of the smaller characters to the main ones. Madame Giry, Meg, Firmin, and Andre always stayed fairly close to the stage version, and did well. And a lot of people criticize Minnie Driver's over-the-top portrayal of Carlotta, but that's just the character.Overall, I'd say that the movie had great potential: the sets were very nice, and the costumes exactly what they should be. But the changes from the stage version and the poor casting took whatever chance this movie had to be good, and smushed it under the chandelier, which, due to drastic changes, isn't nearly as climatic as it should be.",The Phantom of the Opera
1924,jm91,Phantom of The Opera is a wonderful tragic love story.,10,3 October 2005,"At first I really didn't want to see the movie, but my sister talked me into it, and I'm so glad that she did because this movie EXCELLENT. Before you go see this movie you need to go into it with an opened mind, and not just think of it as a bunch of singing and dancing, because it is not, it is so much more than that. Joel Schumacher did a fantastic job casting everyone, especially Gerard Butler as the Phantom, and Emmy Rossum as Christine. People bash and criticize Gerard Butler's voice, and say that it is not good, or his voice was not right for the part, but they could not be more wrong, it was PERFECT for the part, and that is exactly the type of voice that Joel Schumacer and Andrew Lloyd Weber wanted. Gerard Butler has a wonderful and almost ""haunting voice"", and that fit the character so well. Gerard Butler added so much PASSION, ROMANCE and intensity into the character, and I loved that so much, and I also think that is why you feel so sorry for him.(especially at the end.) Emmy Rossum is beautiful, has a gorgeous voice, and is a great actress. Christine is so mesmerized by the Phantom, and with Emmy Rossum's acting it is so believable. She was only 16, and has a fantastic voice, and better than some of the people who played Christine in the plays. The love between the Phantom and Christine is so passionate, sensual, lusty, and romantic. Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have so much chemistry together that you would think that they were actually in love. Gerard Butler is so sexy and passionate, and that really comes out in the character. The casting, in my opinion could not of gotten any better. This is a wonderful romantic movie for anyone to see no matter who you are. The production of this movie was so incredibly amazing. The music, the sets, the acting, the singing, it was all incredible. This is a fantastic tragic love story, and Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson did a spectacular job in this, and made it so amazing.THIS IS A SPECTACULAR AND AMAZING MUST SEE MOVIE.",The Phantom of the Opera
1925,kphamp,"Good, but Gerard Butler lacking",7,29 September 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie, except for Butler's portrayal of the phantom. I found his performance stilted and without the depth it really required. Michael Crawford is the best phantom as far as I'm concerned, his voice is so rich and smooth. It was however great to be able to put the story together after loving the music for so many years. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were excellent, and how funny is Minnie Driver? I have just recently rented this and watched it three times, so obviously it was palatable, but honestly this phantom made me cringe and snarl in some scenes. When he has Christine in the cavern and she rips his mask off, it seemed so forced and fake. Overall though costumes, special effects, and pure cinematic beauty rule this film and make it worth enduring Butler.",The Phantom of the Opera
1926,bebouts32,Gerard Butler A+,10,3 October 2005,"I passed Phantom of the Opera by when it was in theaters. I've seen clips of Michael Crawford singing the role and I thought it was just plain creepy and overblown. I passed it by again when it appeared on DVD. Only when I was looking for a 7th movie to complete my pile of movies at the video store for 7 movies/7days/7dollars did I pick it up, and only because I couldn't find anything else. I reluctantly watched it last of the seven.I was totally blown away, to use a trite phrase. I couldn't believe that I had not seen this in a theater with a huge screen and surround sound. Yes, I have listened to the Crawford/Brightman soundtrack many times. I believe that stage requires strong singing presences. They have to convey everything by their voices and theatrical stage effects.I have read all of the critics' reviews on this site and 50 pages of viewer reviews here. I've come to the conclusion that negative reviewers to the movie would not like it no matter who directed or starred in it. My only question is, Gerard Butler, why have I never heard of you before? Butler was stellar. He brought a passion, roughness, and soul to the Phantom that I never felt hearing Crawford sing it. All this flap about his voice not measuring up to Crawford's....poppycock! His voice perfectly fitted his portrayal of this character. I believe that the lyrics in the title song say ""his"" spirit and ""her"" voice. He is the musical genius, she is the voice. For him to have a gorgeous tenor voice that reaches to the rafters would make no sense at all in the movie. Listening to the soundtrack CD over and over only strengthens my opinion that his voice was perfect for this part.Also, a handsome Phantom with a minimum of facial distortion was another stroke of genius. The real distortion was in his soul, as Christine's song says, not his face. Because of that soul distortion, the Phantom sees himself as a gargoyle, when he is anything but. It makes him even more of a pitiful creature of darkness, and his handsomeness makes the love triangle far more believable.Seeing Butler in this role got me to researching this actor and other things he has done. I highly recommend ""Dear Frankie"". He can put soul into a character with the minimum of theatrics.Kudos to ALW, Schumacher and all the cast, but most especially to Gerard Butler. I will be waiting to see ""Beowolf and Grendel"" when it comes out thanks to my awakening awareness of this fabulous actor by my chance encounter with a great film. Do not let the critics keep you away from a wonderful experience. I now own the 2 DVD wide screen edition and the soundtrack. And to think I almost missed this! Don't you make my mistake! Enjoy a great film and a great actor.",The Phantom of the Opera
1927,franf-1,Exciting and excellent movie!,10,14 January 2006,"The casting was the best. I don't pride myself on spotting errors. Emmy Rossum was sixteen when she was in this film. Her voice was beautiful and the voice of a young girl. I was curious about who did the actual singing. I loved Gerard Butler's Rock N Roll voice and his portrayal of the phantom.This movie was packed with action and I loved it! One scene reminded me of a Gilbert & Sullivan production when actors and actresses were marching forward on stage in full opera costume and singing. I never saw or could afford to see the stage production. Thanks for making a movie of it. I am still trying to figure out who the two elderly characters at the beginning are. I'm guessing that the man is an elderly Raoul. When the film begins it looks like it might be a remake of an old movie version, very clever.",The Phantom of the Opera
1928,deezasterstrikes,Seeing the Phantom of the Opera,9,9 October 2005,"I found the movie to be absolutely wonderful and I bought it as soon as it was released on DVD. I believe there are a few things that could have been done different, but overall, the movie was great. It pales compared to the stage performance, of course. Gerard Butler was spectacular. He brought out the mysterious and threatening side of the Phantom very well. Emmy was perfect for Christine, however, I was sort of disappointed in her voice, since I'm so use to listening to Sarah Brightman's version. I also didn't like the singing voice for Carlotta. Even in the stage production the character had a beautiful voice. Carlotta's voice was never the problem, it was her attitude in the story. I loved how they brought some scenes from the original novel into the movie and laid on some background to the history of the Phantom. Also, the Chandelier, I believe it would have been better if they had gone with the original look of it from the play. It was just too much crystal. Even the original chandelier of the Paris Opera House doesn't have that much crystal. Just my opinion of course. To conclude, the movie was wonderful I recommend it to anyone who likes a tragic love story.",The Phantom of the Opera
1929,irishangel3103,"Amazing, entrancing, one of a kind, best movie i've ever seen",10,10 October 2005,"This is the absolute best movie I have ever seen in my life. This is real music. The costumes were amazingly unique, and the singing was unreal. The ability of Gerard Butler(the phantom) and Emmy Rossum (Christine) is just....wow. I would like nothing better than to sing like her, or even remotely close. The acting-Well you think okay, you can't have everything you want, at least the singing was amazing....WRONG... I don't know how they managed it, but it's also some of the best acting I've ever seen. You really get the best of both worlds. I memorized the movie and can recite it after watching 3 times (I've only had the movie for 3 days). I bought the soundtrack and listen to it endlessly. I've gotten 9 people hooked and I am going in December to see it on Broadway with 6 other people. There is no other movie with an even similar plot or story to this. And the music....the music Now that's real music. MY favorite songs...MY favorite movie...The Phantom of the Opera!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1930,sugar529,Questions People Have,9,10 October 2005,"I am one of those that loved Phantom of the Opera starring Gerard Butler. I realize that many did not. However, I would like to comment that just because you don't like something, it doesn't mean it is bad, it just means you didn't like it. And I suppose just because you like something doesn't necessarily mean it is good, either. Now that I have stated the obvious, I would like to go on and give some of my opinions here.All films, books, art, etc, are subjective. Some will love and some will hate the same thing. I doubt there is a film maker out there that expects to thrill every single person. They gear their movie for a certain audience. Undoubtedly ALW and J. Schumacher were going for the younger audience. They made the three leads attractive and young, and allowed for a more realistic singing style that would probably appeal to those who listen to rock music. They de-emphasized the supernatural and emphasized the love story.This does not make this film ""bad"" or ""worse than the original stage play"", it just makes it different. The criticisms I have heard of Gerard Butler's voice are, in my opinion, totally unfair. I have listened to Michael Crawford sing these songs many times, and yes, he has a wonderful voice. But I have listened to Gerard Butler sing them many times too, and he has a different, but just as wonderful, voice. I listen to the movie soundtrack every day in my car, and every time I listen to it I am moved by the range of emotion that Mr. Butler expresses in his singing. It gives me chills and makes me feel the thrill of the story again and again as I listen to the music. I have found I prefer to listen to Gerard Butler sing the songs rather than Michael Crawford! I am not a youngster. I was graduating from high school when Gerard Butler was born (I'll leave the math to you). But I was utterly moved by his portrayal of the Phantom. He gives such emotion to the character with his eyes and his pathos. He approached this, it seems, as the opportunity to portray a very flawed and complicated character that he gave his all to convey, and carried that effort over into his singing as well. That is why listening to the soundtrack is like watching the movie. All the emotion comes through, and I believe that is a very great accomplishment. Gerard Butler deserves recognition and praise for what he did for this role, not scorn and criticism.His singing style may not be your cup of tea. We all have different tastes and likes. When I first heard his voice watching the movie, I thought it was a bit raw, but watching him yearn and ache while singing ""Music of the Night"" made me realize just what a great thing his voice was for the part. I felt his passion and I felt his pain, just as Gerard Butler says he did in the bonus DVD footage. Only I would not have felt that if Gerard Butler had not had the skill to convey that through his character. That he could do that just speaks well for his acting ability. He has earned a lifelong fan in me. I know his Mom is really proud of him and what a lucky Mom she is too (he took her to his Lara Croft Tomb Raider premiere)! ""Dear Frankie"" is a gem that I enjoyed thoroughly, because he was in it.Now, one final comment. I have seen lots of questions on this board about things not explained or fuzzy in the movie, like ""Why did his hair change color when he was unmasked?"", ""Why did he kill Joseph Buquet?"", ""Why was Raoul buying the monkey at the auction?"",""How could Cristine afford such an elaborate crypt for her father?"" etc. If you give the film a chance and watch it several times, you will find the answers to all of these questions and many more within the movie itself. The film makers were giving us clues right and left, and so many missed them. I love that they gave us credit for a little intelligence and let us figure some things out on our own without having to blatantly explain everything that was going on.What a deep, wonderful, challenging movie, and one that does not get old when viewing it multiple times. Love it or hate it, but I can only feel sorry for those who hate this film simply because it made us think outside the box.",The Phantom of the Opera
1931,Ichorfountain,o my god,2,17 January 2006,"This rendition of Phantom of the opera was just awful, it is as if the producers of the movie were trying to replicate the plot of the producers show and find the worst director and casting possible but using a great show instead of an awful one. the cast lacks any sense of testosterone from the male actors who neither of the lead rolls could seduce a fly, never mind Rossum, who does manage to pull through as a very convincing Christine. However the Phantom strikes me as a model rather then as a mysterious character capable of being responsible for the rise or fall of an entire opera house. really just awful. Rossums roll is filled out nicely and is possibly the only well done roll, aside from the disjointed mouth-song timing which suffers for every character, not least the phantom himself. I have no major qualms with many of the musical pieces in the show it is music which I know and love however the phantom has a tendency to tack a fairly optimistic tone into the darkest of songs, which is bothersome to say the least.",The Phantom of the Opera
1932,Swimmer-9,Review,9,16 October 2005,"Based on the popular Broadway musical, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Phantom of the Opera tells the tale of a twisted genius who was shunned by the world because of his hideous disfigurement. With the musical (Which was based on the book, ""Fantôme de l'opéra"", by Gaston Leroux) being so timeless and loved, many wondered if the movie could measure up. It did.Our story opens with Opera Populaire's manager, Monsieur Jean Lefevre (James Fleet), leaving. His successors, Andre (Simon Callow) and Firmin (Ciarán Hinds), (who have become rich in the scrap metal business) take over the opera, and bring with them their new patron, as well as Christine's childhood lover, The Victome, Raoul de Changy (Patrick Wilson). During rehearsals to open a new performance of Hannibal, a backdrop is dropped on the screeching diva, Carlotta (Minnie Driver) by the infamous 'Opera Ghost' who seems determined to have the diva out of the picture. Without a diva, Andre and Firmin are panicked that they shall have to refund a full house. Until the ballet instructor, Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) tells them that a young chorus girl, Christine Daae' (Emmy Rossum) can sing it. Hesitantly, the managers agree, and at the gala, Christine brings down the house. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) has heard her, and fallen in love with her. The phantom vows to make Christine his and stop anyone who gets in his way.This story on its own is a powerful mix of love, hate, and revenge, but a wonderful cast helped compliment it and bring it to life on the screen. Emmy Rossum, only sixteen when filming began, brings an angel like innocence to the young Christine, while Gerard Butler makes the Phantom less maniacal and more misunderstood then has been done in the musical. One concern of many people, who were fans on the original Broadway production, was the singing. Could one really make a movie that had voices like Broadway? The answer is yes, and no. While many of the voices were praised, many scrutinized the casting of Gerard Butler. One complaint of many of the Musical Theatre goers was that Gerard didn't give the phantom enough of a musical theater voice.Another complaint given by hardcore musical fans was the re-written lyrics that were used in place of some of the old familiar ones. While in the transference of stage to screen it is understandable that some things be changed, lyrics as timeless as those of The Phantom of the Opera should not be changed.The biggest complaint of any made, was the ""Great Disaster"" being moved. In the Broadway version, the Chandelier crashes at the end of ACT I, while in the movie, the Chandelier crashes at the ending. Those who have seen the musical disapprove of the change, saying that it distorts the original story line, while in fact, it has very little to do with the actual story itself.Weather you are a die hard musical theater fan or just someone interested in seeing something interesting and exciting, this movie is for you.",The Phantom of the Opera
1933,ferguscloughley-13389,My favorite film!,9,6 May 2017,The Phantom of the Opera is a musical. It is set in Paris in a theater in 1881. The main actors are: Gerad Butter and Emmy Rossum. The acting and special effects are very good. I really liked the whole film but my favorite scene was the scene with the fire. The music is the best thing about the film and the plot is very interesting. by jim,The Phantom of the Opera
1934,moheesviolin,the good and the ugly,6,22 October 2005,"Finally saw this movie while trapped in my room, rather ill. A friend of mine thought I would like it because of the singing. I'm a vocal performance graduate student, soprano, and have performed Phantom of the Opera several times, as Christine. Not to sound arrogant, but I can actually sing. First- the good. Raoul has a very good voice, strong, clear, in-tune, and doesn't seem to think that adding emotion to a piece consists of....well, whatever it is the Phantom was doing. Sliding around the pitch, as far as I could tell. His acting was convincing, his concern and care for Christine touching. I rather like the added sword-fight, but I figure a good sword-fight is always fun to watch. When he tried to be angry though, it was just funny. Emmy's voice is pretty, but not much else can be said for it. If ALL of that singing was her's, kudos, she has a pretty decent range. From the sound of it though, quite a bit was synthesized. Not to mention it was all done in a studio, so it can be messed with quite a bit, and rather obviously was. I'd like to hear her non-studio voice, it would be interesting. Her acting was rather floaty, made me wonder if she was tranquilized before her scenes. She is very beautiful, I must agree with Andre on that one.The ugly- The Phantom. Not just his face, but his voice. Reading information on Gerard Butler, it seems he has NO musical training what so ever, and that shows. My ears still hurt. Never have I heard ""Music of the Night"", a piece I love, butchered quite so brutally. I don't understand how he could have been Christine's teacher, when he can't pick a pitch. His voice is not ""sexy"" or ""manly"", it's hideous and painful to listen to. His version of trying to show emotion in a piece of music is simply dropping out of singing voice to a strange, strangled, off-pitch groan. His portrayal of the phantom reminded me of a spoiled child that stamps around a cries when he doesn't get his way. Except he kills people. Yes, Butler is a better actor than Emmy, but for goodness-sakes, this is a musical!!!! You need to cast someone who can SING! Especially for the phantom, the musical genius, and Christine's teacher. It seemed in this movie that you either got acting ability or singing ability. Not both, sometimes neither. Minnie Driver as Carlotta did manage to amuse me. She reminds me of a few of my worse colleagues.",The Phantom of the Opera
1935,smartsponge22,The Phantom of the Opera is awesome!,10,29 October 2005,"This movie was an absolute pleasure to watch. I originally never knew it was a movie, but my friend became a fanatic and suggested that I watch it and that I would love it also. I ended up watching it in my music class and well, she was right! The music was what got me hooked first of all,even though it was and opera and I am not a huge fan of musicals. It has great sound and easy-to-understand lyrics. When I finally bought the CD, I listened to it constantly, almost once a day, to the point I was singing it around the house. I even bought sheet music for me to try with my violin.Focusing more on the characters, Christine and The Phantom were both portrayed beautifully. They both are excellent singers and really blew me away with their singing abilities. Also, I like how Andrew Llyod Webber changed the perspective on The Phantom as the movie progressed. At first you think, ""Man, why is being such an evil person."" But, towards the middle and the end you start to get attached and begin put empathy in place of hate towards the character. It was definitely not a waste of time and from a play, which I haven't seen yet but will soon, it wasn't turned into a disgrace on the big screen. I definitely recommend it if you love this genre of music and a good plot! A definite, in my opinion, excellent 10 out of 10!",The Phantom of the Opera

But, could you please explain to me who was the old man in the carriage? Toward the end of the musical, an old man, along with his driver, and a nurse...placed the little statue of the monkey at ""Christine's"" grave site...then there was the rose with the black ribbon tied to it.

Emmy is so cute in that and she is a really great actress in spite of her young age she gives emotions during all the movie and so does the love triangle.

1942,eaziber,Movie let down,3,26 December 2005,"A few years ago I saw POTO on stage and I enjoyed it very much, considering I had the original cast CD and was temporarily obsessed with it in my early teens. Since I still love POTO and anything ALW really I had to see the movie. Well let me say that the movie was a huge let down. First of the person cast as the Phantom couldn't hit (or at least in my opinion sounded like he couldn't hit) the notes written for the part. Additionally, how the Chandelier scene was switched around and out of place it upset me a bit. But the movie is a masterpiece unto itself. Not comparing it to the stage production it was fantastic. I greatly enjoyed the black and white scenes thrown into random parts of the movie. It made me think of when I read the book, but then the musical itself isn't the best representation of the book, so changing from a book to a stage musical to a movie musical one must allow for some changes.",The Phantom of the Opera
1943,twilightendeavor,"Love the Movie, But See It's Weaknesses",9,28 November 2005,"I'd always wanted to see POTO but never had the opportunity. A friend and I saw saw it in an empty theatre at a late night showing--and in short we were STUNNED. However, after a LOT of watching the DVD, listening to the movie soundtrack, and listening and reading along to the original stage production and script, I can see where Fans are vehemently disappointed in this movie portrayal. There are some key elements that are stressed in the stage production that don't really happen in the movie. For one thing, the Phantom according to the stage production is really supposed to be much darker and more cruel than the movie Phantom. As attractively pitiful and threatening as he is, the movie Phantom really doesn't get the cold, dark madness across that, say, Michael Crawford did. If you listen to him on a soundtrack... especially during his maniacal laughter during the Il Muto (sorry for spelling..) scene... you get the sense that the Phantom has a very real evil side, while the movie Phantom is more easy to forgive, mostly because he is so pretty. I agree that his ""disfigurement"" in the movie is pretty pathetic, I was expecting something way more freakish for his mother to basically disown him, and how his face apparently has driven him mad.And while we're on the physical characteristics of the movie Phantom, let me add that the voice issue really is a big deal. Watching the movie, even the first time, I was confused because after getting acquainted with the plot (remember, I didn't know anything about POTO other than that there was a scary masked genius dude in it) I was expecting the Phantom to have this amazing, entrancing voice... but it wasn't any better than Raoul's, who is supposed to be an annoying sissy-boy. Yes, Gerard did a GOOD job singing, or else I wouldn't be in love with the music like I am, I wouldn't have even given it a chance. But his voice just doesn't fit with the Phantom's character. So just to sum everything up, the movie is great if you've never seen the musical and want a taste of it. Please allow me to shout: THE MOVIE IS BY ***NO*** MEANS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE STAGE PRODUCTION!!!!! I've read some of the posts and seen people say how they don't feel like they need to see the musical now that they've seen the movie. NO! NO! NO! That's like saying you don't need to read the Lord of the Rings books now that you've seen the movies. There is so much more depth and beauty that you can't express on film in the books, and the same goes for POTO. The movie and the musical are two different things, and if you count the stage production as the ""mother"" of POTO, then the movie is definitely not a replacement, it is a sample. It made me REALLY want to see the stage production and learn more about how the characters are played by different people.",The Phantom of the Opera
1944,ion_e_croitoru,Magnificent! A tragedy I'd love to live...,10,1 December 2005,"I am afraid there are no such a word that would match the full symphony of gentle emotions what are rolling again and again in my heart with this film. It's like being in love for the first time, never even imagining that there is possible an end. Voice of Christine replayed that feeling in me, and that was superb! Sadly (but what makes the impressions even more powerful, by introducing a drop of reality in this magic ocean of a fairy tail), the beauty is not necessarily the face of the goodness, and it becomes a true tragedy when love is that to reveal it. This is the moment, I think, for which the life is so disgusting... the moment what puts in front of us our own self, the most awful state ever lived by someone. Why we ought always to sacrifice all things for the sake of good alone, even the beauty? I'd like to think Christine as still cherishing for her ""music angel"", whatever moral sense says: episode with ""Don Juan"" is encouraging enough for me. At least, let it be another form of love, yes, a tragic one, but - the highest. Thanks a lot for such a magnificent experience!",The Phantom of the Opera
1945,neverland57867,Not So Great,1,2 December 2005,"I really, really disliked this movie. It was an awful adaptation of the stage version. I love this book and I've seen the play a couple times and this was just not all that it could be. If you're going to take something so huge and so loved, why not try to make it all that it can be? Emmy Rossum did well but Gerard Butler was terrible. His voice just didn't sound right. A couple of times I winced it was so bad. I know it's hard to make a play into a movie but can't they try? It didn't portray the excitement of the stage version and it sure didn't show off the songs. I thought the guy who played Raoul didn't have a very hot voice either! The movie was just.... boring. It didn't interest me even though I love the story line. A woman behind me fell asleep and was snoring and I remember thinking, ""God, I don't blame you!"" Where was all the passion and the voice's that make you wish you could sing? I wish I could sit down with the director and ask him what he was thinking! There were so many awkward moments and un-subtle transmissions from song to song. After I saw the play the first time I told my friends all about it and was so excited and when I took one of my friends to see the movie she was like, ""You thought that was good? That was probably the worst thing I've ever seen!"" If you love the play and have read the book more then once, don't see the movie. It will just depress you. It will also make you very, very frustrated!",The Phantom of the Opera
1946,usmcjen,not a movie for the fans of the musical.,2,5 December 2005,"if you know the music or have actually seen the musical, this movie is not for you. i love the music, know all the words by heart... have seen it on stage and was very excited to see this movie. it took me three separate times on two different days to watch the entire thing. i actually thought about just giving up.the screenplay is beautiful, and it was well-done... but my major complaint is the inaccuracy of the music. they speak some things that should be sung, and they rearrange the timing and meter of the music to make it sound more spoken/conversational than the music intends it to be, like the opposite of setting a story to music... in some places it's like they're trying to make the musical into a regular spoken movie and it doesn't work.also, the phantom sounds like he's shouting rather than singing - especially some of the higher notes which are the most beautiful when sung properly.again, this movie is not for anyone who has seen the musical or knows the music.",The Phantom of the Opera
1947,tlspielman,Please stop comparing stage & movie actors!,10,7 December 2005,"I have read many of the reviews (good and horrible) of Phantom of the Opera. And now, with a belly-full of annoyance due to some of the comments I have read, I have to say: Please stop comparing stage & movie actors! The original stage actors, I'm sure, did a great job with the roles... but consider this: Christine was a 16 year-old aspiring singer with SOME training, guess what: Emmy Rossum, when filming the show, was ALSO a 16 year-old aspiring singer. She is true to her role in that her voice is not the 'warbling perfection' of some seasoned singer's voice who was ruined by being told they had to sing that way.The Phantom: The cast was specifically chosen a little younger than the book/stage show in many cases on purpose. I've seen the way Lon Chaney looked as the Phantom and he looked the part according to the book. I have never SEEN a stage show, but guess what: the Phantom was a resident of a huge opera house - he might have had access to the makeup and costume department when others were not there. If he had the chance to learn how to cover his scarring by makeup of course he is going to look less deformed. This is possible. We only see the Phantom when the other characters in the show see him - and that is when he would be protecting himself by covering his deformities.As for everyone ripping on Butler's singing... his emotion that he puts into the songs is far more convincing than any other version I have heard. He actually sounds angry, sad, in love, PASSIONATE! Webber wanted a 'rock & roll' type voice for this role to give it the depth it needed, and that's what Gerald Butler has. His accent adds a roughness that, to me, enhances the emotional edge in the songs.If I had to listen to people sing for ours I would like to hear them pouring emotion into every word of a song, rather than the 'technical perfection' that others like. This is why La Carlotta is the butt of so much dislike in the film. She is the singer with 'technically' an excellent voice - but because of this she sounds horrible. She's ONLY SINGING THE WORDS, there is no meaning or emotion behind anything she sings in the movie at all when she's on the ""stage"" of the opera house.Raoul, he was excellent. He was not supposed to be some 'manly man'. Patrick Wilson played Raoul just right. He should sound like a whiny guy compared to the Phantom. He's in love with Christine & some unknown ""thing"" is terrorizing her, therefor he strikes out at the Phantom but lets him go because the love of his life asks him to.The main three characters are torn between their 'proper places' and the way they feel... and the portray this quite well.""Technically"" the film is not perfect, but no film is.Once again, all I ask is that everyone quit comparing stage actors to movie actors and let the movie speak for itself.",The Phantom of the Opera
1948,Lady_Godiva_chocoholic,not at all impressed,5,24 December 2005,"As much as I love Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, and as much as I adore the music, I was very much disappointed in the casting of the movie. All but, the managers (andre,fermont), madame Giry, Meg, and Carlotta seemed unfit for the role. My biggest disappointment was Christine whose voice was obviously not made for this sort of singing. She would do well as a pop star, nothing more. The costumes were beautiful, the cinematography was very good and the instrumental music was unbelievable. The sets are breathtaking and the scene where they first go to the ""Phantom's Lair"" is incredibly well done (although, as odd as it may seem, it looks better on Broadway, perhaps it's a lighting issue?). Minnie Driver stole the show, she did very well with her part. I am not sure if she is singing on her own or if she had a singing double. Either way, she did a great job. However, to my great disappointment, the film is greatly lacking in good vocals and good acting.",The Phantom of the Opera
1949,seabluecastle,Soul Of Undening Love (The Phantom),10,26 December 2005,"""Keep Your Hand to The Level of Your Eyes"" .Sir Andrew Webber is indeed a genius!! In composing such a play as the Phantom of The Opera, is indeed a feat all its own.The cast members in their portrayal were magnificent! Christine, was naive, yet knew not her teacher personally, but in music. At a later date introduced to him. So much she was not aware of during her ballerina days at the Opera House.Madame Giry appeared to of known the Phantom well, which makes one wonder, how intimately she knew him. She was sensitive, well aware of his disposition. Raoul is dashing, a man of a more tender nature, sensitive, and very well protective. Carlotta is so whimsical, and a true comedian it appears.The Phantom is so full of anger, intensity, and passion of what he wrote and did, it made one think he would indeed finally have a life of happiness and love. The costumes were beautiful, the musical transcending into your inner spirit, and the vocals were capturing of ones mind, even ones emotions.As a final thought, allowing you to be swept into this fantasy brings so much emotion, and thought provoking moments.It allows ones inner being to surface for a bit into a world of where anything can happen and anything is possible.The best scene of the whole movie is where her hand meets his, before he takes her underground, the first time. There is something of allowance, and acceptance. Of yet being unsure of what you will be lead to, but somehow trusting.This is the Point Of No Return.",The Phantom of the Opera

1951,temembase-moviebuff,Wonderful characterization from Mr. Butler,10,29 December 2005,Yesterday marked the 10th time I have seen this movie. I remember the first time I saw it and the Phantom caught my attention straight away because he looked so familiar to another actor I have seen on several movies...yet never spent the time to read the itty-bitty fast rolling credits. Mr. Butler does an incredible job with this and his acting styles I think differ from one character to another. Each scene shows so many different sides to this character and I caught myself wondering if he was indeed the same actor. What else amazed me was the fact that I had no idea he could sing so well. Nice voice with a great understanding of the phrasings and story line. Very important to understand what you are singing when doing so. Brings the audience into every situation.,The Phantom of the Opera
1952,missy27-1,Love Phantom of the opera,10,22 January 2006,"Phantom of the opera is a great story. I was left at the edge of my seat the entire time. Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance(like always) and has a great voice (I think unlike most people), I believe that he was well casted. This was the first movie I saw with him in it and I liked his acting so much that I know have seen many of his movies. Emmy Rossum, Christine, is really, really well casted though I think she is a little young for the role, she plays it better than anyone else could. She has a great voice and is extremely talented. Patrick Wilson did good as well he makes a great Roul and has a great voice. Overall I think this movie was well casted, well directed and has great scenery and costumes.",The Phantom of the Opera
1953,ChangLee40919,ONE of the GREAT MOVIES of our time,10,29 December 2005,"The last thing I can remember about this movie was 3 to 4 yrs back when I heard they were casting for the film, and I remember being upset that Michael Crawford had been ruled out. However I should have realized that Andrew Lloyd Weber knew what he was doing. A year ago when it was released in theaters, I didn't bother to see it, because I only heard what most of the highly biased critics were claiming.We happen to have a 96"" front projection hi definition LCD front projection system, allowing us to watch movies as they were shown in the theater, however this requires waiting for films to be shown in Hi Definition on our cable system which fortunately also permits (Digital Video Hard Drive) recordings of a film - something very useful as DVD hi definition is still 6 to 12 months away, allowing us to see the same film over and over. Note in practical terms (sharpness, color intensity, and overall impact) such a high definition setup can exceed even that of a typical commercial film showing. The good news is that this technology is now very inexpensive, meaning nearly anyone can afford to eventually see this film equal or better to the quality of the theater experience. When we watched this film in large screen hi definition, it was as if we were basically there in person, in that 19th Century Opera house in Paris.We saw this film for the first time on our home theater around Christmas, about a week ago, when our cable company (one of the biggest in the USA) first decided to air the movie in hi definition. It has been awhile since any film has stunned me this much in terms of the visual effects, excellent story, combined with sensational music. It was everything most of the critics said it was not - basically a magnificent work of art.There are so many great moments in the film, they cannot fully be described, for example Christina's first performance in the movie, when the movie (using a time shift) suddenly converts from her in the tryout/rehearsal to the actual performance with the Opera House. Her voices is so great, and the cinematography is stunning.Aside from the obvious highlights of the film, I will focus on several scenes that I thought were amazingly well done.Consider how Christina (being forced to choose between Raouls death or The Phantom)is heard asking for Gods help to help me make sure he is not alone, as she then slips the ring on her finger, and kisses him in the mouth. While he has murdered, she understands his loneliness has driven him to partial insanity- and only a divine intervention (not necessarily just herself) will save him. Of course as we find out - God in effect does step in causing The Phantom to do the right thing.Five minutes later comes one of the most beautifully photographed scenes in film history and one of the saddest moments of the film. This works particularly well with widescreen (hi definition) as we see The Phantom singing to his musical box (the clapping monkey with the cymbals) and the camera moves to the right - with Christinia appearing on the far right of the film, with the Phantom now at the far left with his head turned toward Christinia - where he tells her he loves her. All should note that when Christinia first puts her hand on the ring (a sign she is about to give it back) The Phantom is still focused on her face - he seems not to notice what she is about to do - and it seems as if he is still desperately hoping she is about to change her mind. Note when she draws closer how he reacts when she looks down at her ring finger, before she takes its off - as he has now finally realized that all hope is gone - as he realizes she is about to return the ring, which she then places in his hand. This scene is so typical of the futility that love can often bring, as one party will sometimes keep hope alive no matter how impossible, right to the last moment.A moment later, a brief shadow runs across The Phantom's face and when the shadow leaves, and with his head bowed down, lips quivering, the tears running down his eyes - as this man is a lost soul. This version thus being a sympathetic version of the The Phantom - a man driven to insanity by his unconsummated love for this young woman.When this comes out in Hi Definition DVD - we will be buying a copy and enjoying if for years, meanwhile I hope others finally find out how great this movie really is. Andrew Lloyd Weber and everyone associated with this film should be commended - as they have managed to put together a true work of art",The Phantom of the Opera
1954,stephanietraylor,Beautiful Depiction,10,30 December 2005,"I've seen and studied the Broadway play and I just have to say that the movie is such a good depiction of it. This is my favorite story of all times, and as a Broadway enthusiast, I always dreamed of playing Christine, either on the stage or in a movie. I felt like it was very well cast. Even though there were some differences between the movie and the play, I thought they were excellent. I felt that each was strategically placed to answer all those questions left after seeing the play. To me, they simply tied up all loose ends and gave each scene more clarity. It takes a lot to move a person with a film, but it does it for me. I get goosebumps every time I watch it. If you're a fan of the arts or even not so much, see this movie.

The singing is by far phenomenal and beautiful beyond measure. The only thing that I had a problem with was the way that Emmy sang her songs. She has a beautiful voice, no doubt, but when she's singing I'm not sure that she really knows what she's singing about. She has the same blank look on her face the whole movie while she is singing. It doesn't matter who she is singing to or about. Overall everything was just fabulous!

I never saw the play, and absolutely think this is the best movie I have ever seen. But it obviously draws a line and makes the story its own from the play. Gerard Butler is breathtaking, and his variety of emotions and expressions, even with a mask on, is very impressive. I read that Andew Lloyd Weber wanted a more ""rock and roll"" voice with the Phantom, and he hit the nail on the head.Those of you who keep complaining that the movie cast was better need to realize that Andrew Lloyd Weber himself chose this cast for the movie, so he knew what he wanted. I do not know why this movie did not do better, it is excellent. Also the prettiest movie we have ever seen. The music is wonderful and haunting, and the cast is perfect. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It has gotten my whole family more interested in plays and operas now.Also, try watching it once with the subtitles...we loved the music even more once we understood what some of the words were. Made the movie make even better sense. I wish there were more musicals like this one out, our whole family has enjoyed watching this movie many times.

1958,nancywhitneys,Where Has This Masterpiece Been Hiding?!?!?!?!?!,10,5 January 2006,"I grew up watching movies of all genres...from Westerns, to War movies, to Musicals. Attended many plays and musicals, of which I had the great fortune of seeing Yul Brynner at The National Theatre in Washington, D.C., in one of his last performances of 'The King and I'.Cable channel surfacing...I was drawn to this production. The first time I saw it...I could not quite get through the whole thing. Some parts, at first, were ~ on the surface ~ a bit of a 'turn off'. But, something about it drew me back again. I have the 'on demand' feature with my cable service. I found myself drawn to this masterpiece over and over. Each time, another detail...another performance would stand out and enlighten...and awe. Then, I found that the songs were replaying through my heart and soul all day long...and I could not wait to get home to watch 'The Phantom' once more. I found Gerard Butler's performance beyond breathtakingly amazing and believable. Honestly, I didn't know who he was...yet had seen most of the movies that he had been in before this.Maybe...because I have had a lifetime of personal betrayals and pain...the compassion that I felt for his character...his portrayal of a lonely, thrown away, human soul...longing to just be seen for who he really is. How many of us walk through this life with parallel isolation, pain and rejection?!?Gerard Butler brought the man behind the mask, the lonely soul, the betrayed human...out in a way that, at least for me...with each additional viewing, I began to find myself crying openly for this kind of human pain. He was truly beautiful in every aspect of his performance. I never once saw any grotesqueness to turn away from...only a broken heart and such an empty dark life...that simply wanted to be known and loved for who he is under the superficialness that so many shallow people on this earth would only see.He was magnificent. The intonations within each delivery of each song. The power in his movements...yet...that gentleness longing to be known. Just amazing.This film will be one of my library editions. And, having Scottish heritage...I will be paying a bit more attention to this actor's endless and expansive talents to pull the viewer in to the soul of the character's that he is portraying.BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!THANK YOU FOR SUCH A MAGNIFICENT WORK OF ART!!!

You fit all of the clothes in every area of your body. I like the Red Costume the most. You are a great looking man. Even without your mask @ the end! Your music that you sing,it is perfect.I like the The Phantom Of the Opera song you sing with Emmy in the beginning of how you express her to sing, Sing for me My Angel of Music.

1960,JordanP09,The Phantom Lives On,7,18 April 2018,"The best part of a musical movie is not only can you take away the iconic and most memorable lines- but also the songs that you sing and listen to even after the credits are done rolling. Back in 1986 Andrew Lloyd Webber blessed us with Phantom of the Opera. To this day, the musical has proved itself as timeless and continues on tours all across the USA. In 2004, Hollywood gave us easy access to view the musical by turning it into a movie. Emmy Rossum plays Christine, member of the ensemble in the Opera who has yet to show her full potential to her superiors. The Phantom, played by Gerard Butler, lives in the depths of the Opera house and captures Christine as hostage to convince the owners of the Opera to make her lead role. 
 The visuals of Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera (2004) do a great job of convincing me that I'm back in the late 1800's. The costumes and makeup are elegant and well thought out. Emmy Rossum never failed to take my breath away with each close-up or each gown she had on. Her voice was easy to listen to and had me siding with the Phantom that she should be lead role. Gerard Butler, while cheesy at times, did a wonderful job at portraying the vulnerability and loneliness of the Phantom. His red tuxedo worn to crash the masquerade had me weak in the knees, and so did the change of the music's key playing upon his wake. 
 The movie shows us how timeless and beautiful the story of Phantom of the Opera truly is. A man traumatized by the experiences in his childhood, with a disfigured face to prove, only seeks acceptance and the best for the Opera house in which he resides. The acting is almost just as theatrical and overbearing than if you saw it on Broadway, and I don't mean that as necessarily a bad thing. It is great to see how Hollywood transfers musicals into movies and gives those of us who can't see these live shows a chance to watch the story. Now, ""All I Ask Of You"" is to go watch and enjoy it for yourself.",The Phantom of the Opera

The movie is beautifully directed by Joel Schumacher and full of emotion. Beats the stage version in my opinion. I am startled that this film was ignored for any recognition. Not your typical Hollywood attempt to just cash in on a hit. Was doubtful prior to seeing the film that it would hold true to the Broadway spectacle, but I have never been so pleasantly surprised. Had to buy both the DVD and soundtrack. I would recommend everyone see at least once.....although once for Phantom is never enough!",The Phantom of the Opera
1962,fantabadoozie,why do i LOVE this???,10,7 January 2006,"Before seeing this film, i had not seen the stage version and didn't really know any of the plot and had only ever heard the Phantom's song. I saw it at the cinema and although i enjoyed it, i also thought it was really corny. Also i couldn't understand half of the things they were singing about, a lot of the words were indistinguishable. But for the next two weeks i couldn't get the tunes out of my head. Which was frustrating as i didn't know any of the words. Only this Christmas did i receive the DVD, and i cannot stop myself from watching it. it's just brilliant and the more times i hear the songs the more i love it! But i don't know why because it is soooo cheesy. But that disappears about 10 minutes in and your swept away by the unashamedly romantic old-age love that we all long was in the world now. My favourite bit is the ""Don Jaun"" finale'. How can two people singing and strutting around the stage be so thrilling? I think Emmy Rossum is spectacular, i didn't find out she was only 17 until after the movie and i couldn't believe it. Every movement/sound she makes is captivating, i couldn't imagine anyone playing Christine better. And her portrayal of Christine makes you understand why the Phantom and Raoul are so obsessed by her. The rooftop serenade ""say you'll share with me"" is just gorgeous as well. The Phantom is sexy, Raoul is dashing. I still can't decide who Christine should have chosen. It's just blooming brilliant!!! I feel like bursting into song this very second.

1964,prolink18,"Great Play....Movie, well.......OK",7,8 January 2006,"I have seen the stage production of Phantom probably about 7 times. Overall, I think the play is excellent--great music, spectacular scenery, etc. I've also seen several different Phatoms...including Michael Stanley (yes...from the same guy in the band KISS)who was an outstanding phantom, surprisingly.My anticipation of the movie was great...but given my hectic schedule, I did not happen to catch it until it came out on DVD.Okay...here's the issue. Phantom could have been movie of the year...winning awards galore and revered. Instead it simply passed as a good film. While it may be a good film...it is a GREAT play.I think where the film lacks its vigor is quite simply in the casting of the Phantom. I thought that Christine (Emmy Rossum), Raol (Patrick Wilson), and even Carlotta (Minnie Driver) were OUTSTANDING. But quite simply put Gerard Butler was a WEAK phantom. He lacked the intensity and passion of previous players.Obviously Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber had a different artistic motivation for the casting. But when it comes to the bottom line...they simply messed up, leaving the world with a Phantom movie that is quite simply put, above average.People wanted a great movie, and I think it left those of us who have seen the production live (with people who are GREAT phantoms) disappointed. I still don't understand why the hell they didn't convince (and pay) Michael Crawford to play the role. His portrayal of Phantom is the ""gold standard"" that other actors strive to reach. In my humble opinion, if you want the best movie...cast the best people. And ultimately, cast towards the audience--who was expecting a dynamic Phantom--like Michael Crawford. Unfortunately, unless someone ever picks up to remake the musical (at some future time) we will be left with a movie that is quite simple average. It could have been great guys...it could have been great.",The Phantom of the Opera
1965,uw_badger_fan,"Some good, some bad but in many ways disappointing.",5,3 May 2006,"To start, I have seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage two times and regularly listen to the recording of the Broadway Cast, so perhaps I was expecting too much...The Good ---------- The opening of the film was amazing and really grabbed my attention. The sets were amazing and the costuming was great. They were really able to bring the world of the Opera House to life. The director very closely followed the stage production, which I really appreciated. Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine is gorgeous and does a great job for the most part with the singing. Minnie Driver does a superb job portraying the diva, Carlotta. The rest of the supporting cast were great as well (singing, dancing and acting). Now for the bad...The Bad ---------- In one of the songs, as they are traveling on the Phantom's boat for the first time, they added a very unnecessary and distracting electric guitar part to the song. Gerard Butler was a poor choice as the Phantom. In some songs, he is successful but the rest he does a very poor job on. I'm not sure why they couldn't just cast the Phantom with one of the Broadway/Off-Broadway actors who play the Phantom. Obviously they can act and sing since they perform the part night after night. Perhaps, it was felt that an actor that had been in previous films was necessary instead of a stage actor. If that was the case, maybe they should have had Butler lip-sync Michael Crawford singing the part. In addition to Gerard Butler's singing, the Phantom looks ""too good."" In the stage version, the Phantom's lip under the mask is noticeably disfigured. In the screen version, the Phantom has no noticeable disfigurement outside of the mask and is too much of a ""pretty boy.""Conclusion ---------- If you've never seen the stage version, you will probably enjoy this film. But if you have it on stage or have listened to it by the Broadway Cast on CD...you will likely be disappointed by numerous parts of the film.",The Phantom of the Opera

1967,glo4231,Bravo to the cast in this movie,10,9 February 2006,"I first watched this movie in the theater and went out singing the Phantom of the Opera Song. I was mesmerized probably more than the character of Christine by the Phantom (Gerard Butler) what a handsome man even with his deformity I felt the same as Christine when she sings it is only in the phantoms soul that he feels ugly. I could look past that deformity because of his charisma and seductive demeanor if I were Christine. I found myself even though Patrick Wilson (Raoul) handsome as he is wanting Christine to end up with the Phantom. I felt that the movie portrayed the phantom as a pitiful child abused and a as man hated his deformity because it prevented him from being loved at both stages in his life. In this day and age more than likely could have been healed by doctors. Unfortunately for him not possible in the time era portrayed. Scorned by first his mother then by the public being placed in the circus. His anger was a result of all of this and so you could not help but feel badly for him and understand his anger and want for him what he really deserved which was to be loved. The song at the end of the movie describes his life and I found myself like Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) wanting to help him even to the end of the movie. If Raoul had not pursued Christine I felt the killing and the madman would not have surfaced. He was so in love with Christine and I could feel her confusion ""did she love him? did she love Raoul? or both? What a love story and the seduction in the final Opera scene of Don Juan made you want the Phantom and Christine to end up together. I have watched this movie over and over and over and I love it and Gerard Butler well he was outstanding in this movie and if you don't know what a hunk he is see ""Timeline"" and you will find out. As the French would say OOH LA LA!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1968,scott-1246,Pretty Good,9,10 January 2006,"After seeing this movie, i have to admit it shocked me. I had the great opportunity to see the original stage performance from Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in 98', and purchased the original soundtrack when it was available. I was skeptical when first hearing that Loyd Webber was going through with the movie version, for reasons I'm sure most of you phantom fans realize. Sarah Brightman is an extremely sophisticated singer, and i have always thought there as no one that would match her ability to sing. I still think this, but, i have to give it to Emmy Rossum, she commanded her voice very well, along side butler, they portrayed this epic in a manner fitting the theatrical production.. All in all i believe that this was an award winning performance, and Emmy Rossum has given herself another career path if chosen to do so. 9 out of 10. I could never give a 10, i hold that for Sarah!!",The Phantom of the Opera
1969,kittything,Great Movie/Play,8,10 January 2006,"I could hardly wait for Phantom to come out in the movies, I was counting the days and when December 22 came around I went immediately to the theater to see it and I was hooked, I then proceeded to see it every week for several weeks....I was sneaking out during the day to go see it..it was marvelous and the music is the movie. Especially in the high def surround sound of the theater....I cried the first time and every other time. When May came around and it came out on DVD I was at the store when it opened and I have the extra edition and the regular one, good thing I have surround sound at home, it rattles while I am watching it..now it is on the HBO channels an I have them marked and watch it every time its on..I did see the play in NY when it first came out with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and fell in love with it then but the movie gives you so much more, there are places that the movie takes you that the play cannot, there is a certain extra that youcannot see in the play... Gerard Butler makes a great Phantom and in my opinion I would have chosen him, Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine and her voice is a joy to listen to as is Raoul. I would recommend it to anyone......",The Phantom of the Opera
1970,amanda121283,All I can say is WOW!,10,10 January 2006,"This movie is absolutely wonderful I have it recorded so i watch it at least once a day... Emmy and Gerald played great... I mean to look at that man in real life and then in that movie, he's gorgeous... This movie is really great and anyone who doesn't think so needs to watch it again.The only thing that i can't understand about the whole movie was if it was her father.... And who was the woman at the beginning.. Those are still a bit confusing to me. The erotic tension the actors shared in this movie make me want to join the opera. I have never been to a real live opera but if its anything like that I would love it. But there is no way that any opera could out do this movie... I loved it and congrats to all the characters that made this movie and the producers. THey really know how to make an eye catching, heart throbbing movie... My Husband actually liked and thats really saying something..",The Phantom of the Opera
1971,turnertrevin,brilliant,9,18 May 2018,"A musical? Can it really be that good? Yes It can and it is. This movie has a dramatic plot and the filming styles really helped stress that. There are a lot of close ups and medium close ups that really display the passion and emotion between the so seen love triangle of the Phantom, Christine and Raul. This movie proved to be very powerful, from the music and characters to the messages that it sent. One of the many powerful scenes in this movie are near the end of the movie when things are getting chaotic and Christine is venting to Raul and laying it all out there and Raul sings this beautiful song to her that comforts her and then they kiss. This scene is what really sells you on this couple. It shows his deep love for her. The moral message of this is that we should be careful how we treat those who are different from us. We don't know what they went through, the trials they have had. The other thing that I learned from this movie is that music can stir up emotions like no other. I truly believe you can not watch this movie with out feeling anything. The internal conflict of this movie is both pride and ignorance. The owners of the opera house were too prideful to listen to the demands of the much wiser and cunning Phantom who made them pay dearly for that. This movie was captivates, moves, and teaches you. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. 9/10 for me.",The Phantom of the Opera
1972,ritzrita,Wonderful,9,13 January 2006,"Just saw the movie during Christmas break 2005 and have NOT stopped watching it. I have seen the show both on Broadway and in Dallas...I went out and bought the DVD and the CD because I thought the movie was fantastic.My opinion the extended version of the CD is not worth it. The CD is dialog and singing. If I wanted that, I could just watch the movie. The regular soundtrack is great.I am in love with the Phantom. Although some comments are made about his singing I think it fits the Phantom role. His move and mannerism's made me fall in love. Thank goodness my husband understands and lets me watch the movie 3 time a week.Christine is absolutely wonderful. She was refreshing and so young & innocent...she played the part wonderfully.The only thing I did not understand in the movie is 'keeping your hand to the level of the eye when approaching the phantom'.Great movie make sure to see it.",The Phantom of the Opera
1973,Carinna-1,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" 2004 Movie is great!!",10,20 January 2006,"I had always wanted to go and see the Broadway musical ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" however I never got the chance. Perhaps another time. Fortunately when ""The Phantom of the Opera"" came out as a movie in 2004, I was able to go with my daughter to see it. I thought this movie starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, and Minnie Driver was magnificent!! Then to learn that most of the major characters actually sang the songs in the movie was awesome!! What wonderful and beautiful voices!! I can't imagine the Broadway musical being an improvement on this movie and I can't imagine any other actors than those stated above doing a more wonderful job performing ""The Phantom of the Opera."" I think this 2004 movie version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a 'must see' and rates up there with James Cameron's 1997 movie ""The Titanic"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett. This movie was so wonderful I decided to buy the DVD!! If you haven't seen it, rent the movie, and enjoy!! Caren January 2006",The Phantom of the Opera
1974,l-jaye,my thoughts on the phantom movie,10,15 January 2006,"I thought the Phantom of the Opera movie was great. My two favorite character are the Phantom and Madame Giry, both performer were great and their voices were wonderful. Gerald Butler is so handsome in his mask and cape and seeing him in this movie just gives me the chills. Also if we had to choose between the Phantom and Roul i will definitely choose the Phantom. Mirenda Richarderson is a very Lent actress i seen her in all her movies and her character as Madame Giry she was born to play that part.If they ever make a sequel to this movie they should bring back all the original cast-member. I will also like to say that if they did make a sequel i think Christine should go back to the Phantom and stay with him.",The Phantom of the Opera
1975,MasONeil,Compelling,10,15 January 2006,This movie was loaned to me by a friend. I had recently seen the production on stage in Boston in 2005; I wasn't really very excited about watching the movie. I have to say I was quite overwhelmed when I finally took the time to watch the movie. The character development was incredible. The scenery and costumes fabulous. The movie drew me in and held me there waiting for more (the stage production put me to sleep). The vocal and acting talent was directed perfectly. I would consider this an adult Cinderella story . . . two men mesmerized by a woman . . . a woman in love with one man and bewitched by another . . . a love triangle . . . three different worlds colliding. The PG-13 rating understandable only because small children should not see some of the violence disbursed by the phantom.If you enjoy a good love story . . . hidden worlds . . . conflict . . . intrigue . . . incredible voices and music . . . this is the movie for you!,The Phantom of the Opera
1976,angelofmusic1219,Great movie for those who love musicals!,9,23 June 2006,"I have read many reviews on Phantom of the Opera that have upset me, so I'm writing my own at last! OK, just so everyone knows, this movie is great for people who tend to like musical movies (such as Chicago, Moulin Rouge, you get the idea). With that said, if you're not much of a musical person, here's my advice for you: avoid this movie if you can't stand almost non-stop singing. But as for me, a musical lover, I adore this movie! People often criticize Gerard Butler for being too good looking with little talent compared to the great Michael Crawford (one of the original phantoms on stage). For these critics, I have two things to say. Firstly, you cannot compare apples to oranges, meaning that Butler and Crawford are two distinct individuals, each possessing his own unique sound. Isn't music subjective after all? Secondly, I find nothing wrong with Butler being good-looking. Isn't it just more realistic that a young girl of sixteen would be attracted to a good looking guy? As a seventeen girl myself, I wouldn't be happy with a less-than-attractive 30-something, even if he had an amazing voice. That sounds shallow, but it's like wanting Brad Pitt and getting Taylor Hicks. One has a good voice, the other not so much. OK, I'm digging myself deeper and deeper so I'll stop. The point is Phantom of the Opera is a great movie full of romance, music, action, and lots of emotion. I dig it all, and I hope you do too.",The Phantom of the Opera
1977,darialex76,Unforgettable,10,19 January 2006,"Being a Phantom fan from the early age of 13 and not having seeing it on stage it was like a dream coming true when I heard that at last my favorite's musical was coming out. The result didn't disappoint me although i had some small objections for one or two scenes. I absolutely loved Gerard Butler who proved to be both a great actor and an excellent singer and whose performance left even those who originally doubted his skills, completely satisfied. Emmy Rossum was quite a good choice young,fresh,lovely with a beautiful voice.Moreover, i really enjoyed Patrick Wilson who gave the most interesting,active Raoul. Finally, Minnie Driver was exceptional as Carlotta, Miranda Richardson a gracious,elegant Mme Giry and the manager duo Simon Callow-Ciaran Hinds were a pleasure to watch.As about the music,what more can be said? Andrew Lloyd Webber has written his masterpiece which is by all means considered classic.",The Phantom of the Opera
1978,defygravity23,"Great movie, bad musical",3,29 January 2006,"As a total Phantom fan I would like to say that I was incredible disappointed in that movie! The true heart of the original stage show was completely and utterly lost! From a cinematic point of view, it was an excellent movie. The special effects, props, and costumes were wonderful. However, as a musical it was a disgrace to the Title. The Phantom could not sing, he just screamed! Christine was obviously NOT a opera singer, she was too breathy and could never be heard over a pit. Her Performance in ""Past the Point of No Return"" strayed from the actions and personality of the stage version Christine, and the book Christine. At this point she is not entrance with the Phantom, but more fearful, to the point of almost trying to run away, ergo the line ""Raoul I'm frightened don't make me do this, Raoul it scares me, don't put me through this"" (Act II Scene:2). In the movie she seems to be seducing him, more than being afraid. The character of Raoul was lost. He was not the brave hero that he is in the stage show. His voice and actions seemed more of a scared child, then a heroic lover. Over all I hated this as a musical, they killed the music. In the Song ""The Phantom of the Opera"" had a random guitar solo, which takes away from the operatic feeling of the show. Also the Chanedlier is meant to fall in the middle of the show. It is also this way in the book. The falling is meant to add to the Phantom's frustration. Even more importantly, how can the Phantom make it fall, if hes on stage?! Overrall the movie does no justice to the original work by Weber.",The Phantom of the Opera
1979,algray-2,Phantom is fantastic!,10,21 January 2006,"I had never seen the Broadway show, which I think was a benefit in watching this movie, as I didn't have the urge to compare it to anything. Everything about this movie was perfect as far as I'm concerned, and most especially Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He was dark, dangerous, and mesmerizing. I so wanted to be Christine!!! I loved how Gerard's voice contrasted so beautifully with Emmy Rossom's and Patrick Wilson's. They blended beautifully in the final dramatic showdown. Kudos to everyone on the production of this film, especially Joel Schumacher (sp?) and the set designer. I have watched this movie at least 1/2 a dozen times in the past few weeks and it draws me in EVERY time. It is now my all-time favorite movie musical. Andrew Lloyd-Webber was truly inspired when he and his team created this little slice of heaven.",The Phantom of the Opera
1980,mlarsen-8,The best love story I have ever seen,10,23 January 2006,"I have been reading some of these comments about Emmy Rossem, Gerard Butler, and Patrick Wilson. Most of them are very nice and truthful. It angers me to hear their voices and their acting cut down. I am not a person that will sit down and listen to a musical. My aunt had been flipping through stations one day and kept watching it, it caught her attention so much that she was anxious for me to come over and watch it with her, so I did, and I LOVED it so much I went over there and watched it again to get more out of the story, then we watched it again a couple days later. I came to the conclusion that I should just go get the DVD for myself so I could watch it at home also. Then that wasn't enough to be able to watch it whenever I wanted, so I had to get the soundtrack too, the full version so I could listen to it at work. They all have GREAT voices, if they didn't it wouldn't have had such a big impact on people that normally don't get into musicals. They are a perfect cast for a perfect movie and WHY MESS with perfection. That's the bottom line, so all you negative people out there need to review your rating of this movie because it is Brilliant!",The Phantom of the Opera
1981,Foxy1984,"Worthwhile, Especially if you Loved the Broadway Musical",7,11 July 2006,"I must preface this review by stating that the Broadway musical version of ""Phantom"" is one of my all time favorite shows, so I hold any film version to high standards. If you are like me and love the stage version, then I'm afraid this movie will leave you slightly disappointed. The singing was adequate at best. Emily Rossum is not a professional singer, and it shows. Christine Diae is an opera singer, and Rossum's sweet little girl voice is too wimpy to get anyone's attention. Rossum's performance was the downfall of the movie. She had two 'looks' that she milked the whole time: angelic wide eyed adoration, and angelic wide eyed fear. Gerard Butler was really the shining star in the movie, but even his passionate depiction of the Phantom seemed not so good when paired with Rossum's one dimensional performance.Rossum is by no means a ""bad singer"", it's just that her portrayal seemed all too innocent and angelic. She failed to capture Christine's dark smoldering passion, and powerful voice, which is what attracts the phantom to her in the first place. It's true that all that is covered up by an innocent demeanor, but Rossum didn't look any farther than the surface. In this version, Christine is just a little girl who develops a crush on her 'bad boy' voice instructor. The movie did not take the plot any deeper than that, which is a big disappointment to me. Overall I would suggest seeing the movie, especially if you know and love the stage version, because it offers something the stage can't; subtle and profound character development through clever camera work and stunning imagery. The sets are spectacular, and you feel like you really get to know the characters. On stage everything has to be acted out ""big"" so everyone, all the way to the back row, can see, but in the film version, every actor's subtle expressions and half-veiled looks take on new meaning.",The Phantom of the Opera
1982,windycityguy,Excellent Film,10,2 February 2006,"I suppose I have been spoiled when it comes to this play - I first saw it at the Majestic, and then at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End. Both were fantastic performances, truly amazing.So when I first watched this film, it was with some hesitation. However, the movie was able to capture the pre-1900 Paris in which Phantom is set. Emily Rossum was brilliant in her role as Daae - she had the breathless naiveté required for the role without overdoing it.My only criticism is that the vocal quality seemed a bit...well, off. Butler's voice was too grating for the part, and a little too American for my taste. I kept thinking of Christian Bale in Batman Begins. The slight plot deviance from the chandelier incident went more or less unnoticed.If you haven't seen the play, go see it! And if you do, it is worth booking well in advance for seats in the front rows. Now, let's see about them bringing it to Chicago... :)",The Phantom of the Opera

1985,ginnyk2,Don't believe the critics!,10,26 January 2006,I had written a review a couple weeks ago after viewing the film the first time on HBO basically saying that I had not seen the film when it first appeared because I had seen it on Broadway with Michael Crawford and the critic's reviews were so dreadful that I thought I would be disappointed. That was such a mistake! I was in New York last weekend and saw the Phantom again on Broadway. I have to say that the film version is so superior to anything I have seen on Braodway. Gerard Butler is an extraordinary actor who brings such depth and feeling to the role. His voice is so perfect for the role. Emmy Rossum is a perfect Christine (what a beautiful voice!) and Patrick Wilson is the perfect Raoul. This film is a true classic and a joy to view. I don't know what the critics were thinking. What a masterpiece! I should add that this is the first time in my life that I felt strongly enough about a film that I have sought someplace to share my views.

Christine was OK and Raoul was passable. Cinematography excellent, costumes exceptional. The Score superb 10 out of 10 for the orchestra. Cannot understand why Minnie Driver not allowed to sing the Carlotta lines as she sings the end credit song.Schumacher adds his usual dark perspective to the direction, very Lost Boys in the feel.

Despite a few deviations from the original, that in my opinion could lead to confusion if the viewer isn't familiar with the storyline, I believe it to be fantastic! Emmy Rossum, what a talent! At her young age, she certainly has a bright future. Her skills as an actor are only surpassed by her beautiful singing voice.Gerard Butler, I was not at all familiar with his work but his voice was just the edgy touch this movie needed. Kudos for casting him in the role of Phantom. He's easy on the eyes too! Patrick Wilson, wow! His folks must be proud! Great voice, handsome face, and what a bod! Whew! Minnie Driver, an unexpected surprise! I only wish the film would have contained more of her own singing voice. She was great in the role of Carlotta. I love Minnie, but I had to remind myself that she was playing a role (very well I might add) and that my disdain was for the character, not the actor.I will purchase this movie on DVD and watch it many times!

It also seemed to portray Christine Daae (the main character)as an immature girl who couldn't choose between a psychotic opera ghost and a good man who treats her well. She appeared to 'love' the Phantom, and then when he did something evil she would hate him and fear him. The songs were good, and I liked the fact that all of the actors and actresses (besides Minnie Driver) sang their parts.

1997,businessmike,"Artists bring out, for all to see/hear/understand, the forces under which we live and struggle.",10,15 February 2006,"In that role of Artist, Gaston Leroux wrote a play of intrigue and business, barely touching on the sexual dimension in life. Several renditions of his book were brought to the screen and they, too, focused more on the horrifying effect of the human body when it is disfigured, especially the face. Because these movies did not focus on the sexual dynamic of men and women it became necessary to introduce music to the mix to stir those passions. Andrew Lloyd Webber, wanting to write a Love Story, wrote the music for the Stage Play and turned Leroux's initial work from Horror to Human Nature at its deepest and most profound level. The subsequent movie, made from the Stage Play, added the missing dimension of a woman's willingness to be drawn into darkness in search of something she does not understand but allows because it sweeps her away with its power. Looking for the intimacy she shared with her father through music made the young Christine prey to the Phantom's needs for someone with whom to share his passion, his music. In the movie version the actors add the final dimension. They show you with their expressions, their voices, their movements, what the undeniable forces of Nature look and sound like when basic needs have not been met. Christine is starry eyed, dreamy, filled with silly innocence and yet drawn to this man's power, his ability to make her swoon into his arms and be carried away to his bed. She both fights it and yet surrenders. The Phantom through his music is able to lure Christine with his words as Father and Angel. She has no choice but to surrender until Raoul, the well-bred suitor intervenes and breaks the romantic but misunderstood trance she is in. In the opera, Don Juan Triumphant, the Phantom, tired of the game, claims his prey, the innocent and frightened Christine. Raoul represents the intellectual evolution of man. He battles with the ""beast"" that wants to devour the innocence of a child and also the foolish notions that a young girl can have about her father. His role is that of a non-violent hero. This movie is a masterpiece, put into motion by Leroux and furthered by every Artist who touched it in any way.Barbara Garrison",The Phantom of the Opera
1998,Medication102,This movie is pure...well...genius!,10,19 February 2006,"I have seen this movie several times and every time I see it, I love it more and more. I have read the novel and compared it to the movie; the movie ultimately was better. But there are several things in the movie that made me say ""Why?"" Christine, in the end, chooses to leave with Rauol, a man who is so self absorbed his false ""love"" for Chritine will end up with adultery (My opinion). Christine's choice to leave a man who has never received a break in life really tells me that she is the type of person who truly has no morals or values. The Phantom is not a ""deranged sociopath"", but a confused individual who has gone so much and only asks for one thing, for the love of a naive young ballet student. The only reason Rauol loves Christine is because she is the star and is so consumed in the limelight. It is a pity and a shame because the Phantom is actually the good one inside and Rauol is the arrogant fool who does not deserve anyone or anything. Christine, you mad a mistake, and the consequences of your actions, the demise of The Phantom, the only person who truly loved you for the person you really arnt. Ironic, Rauol loves you because you are the star, you love him because you think he loves you, and the Phantom loves you because, well, lets just say I think he could do better (And he is deformed!)",The Phantom of the Opera
1999,chriscaglehead_101,cant stop watching it!!!,10,21 February 2006,"This is the best movie I have ever seen! I can not stop watching it! The sets are beautiful, the music memorable and the cast is wonderful!! Though I have never seen the stage show, this movie makes me want to rush out and get tickets. Gerard Butler plays a wonderful Phantom in my opinion, and Emmy Rossum was wonderful, she has a very beautiful voice. I found this movie very mesmerizing, and in the end I think you really end up feeling for the Phantom. The way I see it, The Phantom was a victim. I asked my friend if she thought that Christine should have stayed with the Phantom and she said yes. The thing I love the most about this movie would have to be the songs that ""The Phantom"" and ""Christine"" sing. I found that Gerard Butler has a very nice voice, but that only what I think...so get out there and see it for your self..and see what you think...I have one last thing to say..don't judge a book by its cover..and thats exactly what I think of this movie! I didn't think it would be very interesting...but I was very wrong!!",The Phantom of the Opera
2000,roseblj,This movie was so BAD I couldn't even finish watching it once!,1,23 February 2006,"I'm wondering was I watching the same movie all these people were raving about? The costuming and the sets were beautifully done, yes, and the music lived up to expectations, BUT.... In this movie Joel Schumacher couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag. The cast was all wrong for the parts they played, all except Minnie Driver who was an excellent Carlotta. Emmy Rossum's voice was too weak for the part of Christine, and every time Gerard Butler opened his mouth to sing I cringed.Why Webber would put his name on this rubbish is beyond my understanding. I saw Phantom of the Opera on stage twice and have read the original novel. This movie is no comparison. After the first 40 minutes of hoping that I could find something redeeming about this film and hoping it would get better, I simply had to walk away. It's so bad it STINKS!!!",The Phantom of the Opera
2001,hblackwell707,Excellent,10,27 February 2006,"Having seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage I was curious to see how the movie would turn out. I was not disappointed. The movie is just as beautiful as the show. Although the sensation of being there and listening to the music firsthand is missing, the wonderful close ups of the character's faces makes up for it. I cried just as much watching the movie as I always do when I am at the show. Gerard Butler was an excellent Phantom, and I am a big fan of Michael Crawford so he had some tough shoes to fill, but Mr. Butler is so dang sexy that I was swooning whenever he was singing! The music was just as beautiful and I drove my husband crazy by turning it way up so I could almost feel as if I were at the live show. Emmy Rossum was an excellent Christine, she is young and beautiful and has one of the best voices I have heard sing Christine since Sarah Brightman. All in all, a fabulous movie, one I will enjoy watching over and over.",The Phantom of the Opera
2002,msdory64,"Elvis move over, Gerard Butler is in the house",10,7 March 2006,"I have always been a die hard Elvis fan and I must say, I always will be, but no one has stirred the emotions or caught my attention the way Gerard Butler did in this wonderful and emotional movie. Mr. Butlers performance was perfect in every way; he sings beautifully, his acting is so natural and believable. ""He can place his mask on my end table anytime."" What sex appeal. I had to buy the book and read it just to find out what his name was and to find out what really happened to him. Mr. Butler brings the Phantom to life, showing his emotions and helping the viewer to understand him. He could have been a one man show in my book. Thank God for TIVO, I can watch Mr. Butler any time in that fabulous RED Outfit ""Masquerade""............... I have seen the stage play twice and it wasn't until I watched the movie, did I understand the play. Gerard Butler could just stand there with his ""Point of no return"" outfit on, and I would pay the price of admission. I watched the making of the film and I agree, they did everything right in casting the movie. Thank you Mr. Butler for such an outstanding and sexy performance. God Bless the imagination and TIVO. I think they need to make a part 2, there is so much more in the book. We Love ya Gerard...........",The Phantom of the Opera
2003,purplequilt,A must see for romantics,8,12 March 2006,I recently saw Phantom of the Opera and I just loved it. I usually do not like musicals per say but this one was great. The music was so beautiful.I was so smitten with the Phantom I would have fallen in love with him. He was mysterious and handsome in his mask. I have always been a sucker for a man in a mask. I can't wait to see more of Gerard Butler. He is great and will probably do great things in the movies. I hope so . Everything about the movie was fantastic . The costumes were so beautiful . I loved how the movie started out in black and white and faded to color during the story then back to black and white at the end. I cried at the end when I realized the Phantom loved her till the end. A must see movie for romantics.,The Phantom of the Opera
2004,jlip37,This movie is magnificent. It has what the Broadway show lacked,9,26 March 2006,"I almost missed seeing this movie because I was listening to some of the awful reviews it received. Saw the Broadway show three times and fell in love with the music. Although the voices on stage were absolutely perfect, and the staging was spectacular, the movie brings the viewer an up-close, heart wrenching love story with voices that are more than adequate. This DVD will one of the few that I purchase.Who is Gerard Butler? He was wonderful. The Phantom has evolved over the years from a grotesque, repulsive, almost inhuman, inhabitant of the dank areas of the opera house to a well dressed, sexy and sympathetic character inhabiting a rather romantic condo in the lower level of the opera house. I like it.",The Phantom of the Opera
2005,Em4192,A masterpiece (for the most part),8,3 August 2008,"First off, this movie is absolutely beautiful. It was the first portrayal of 'The Phantom of the Opera' I had seen, and I have been yearning to see it on stage ever since.The Casting: All of the cast had amazing voices and played their part very well. I loved Emmy Rossum as Christine and I fell in love with Gerard Butler's strong, powerful Phantom.The making: While the setting and scenery was extraordinary, it was still lacking a little. If you've only seen the movie once, you probably won't notice much wrong. I, having seen it numerous times, have noticed many silly mistakes which are very noticeable and become extremely annoying. Also, in almost every scene, the singing and the actors mouths don't match up.Overall: If you have never experienced The Phantom, this is definitely a must see. Those who have seen it on stage and have high expectations, may want to stay away.",The Phantom of the Opera
