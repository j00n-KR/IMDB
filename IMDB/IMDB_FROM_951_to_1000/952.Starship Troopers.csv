0,bkoganbing,"""We're In It For the Species""",10,7 January 2007,"Starship Troopers has become one of my favorite science fiction films because of the uncompromising way it looks at pure unadulterated evil.Make no mistake about it, the evolved arachnids are unadulterated evil and they are that because they view the rest of the galaxy as a feeding ground. There's no co-existing with them, understanding them, or dialoging with them. It's humans or arachnids, it's that simple. The society that evolved to meet the challenge understands that perfectly well. As Neil Patrick Harris so admirably put it, he's in the military for the survival of the species.Evil is a hard concept for the civilized mind to wrap itself around and those that do understand it, a lot of times tend to be monotheist in their religion and can't communicate it to nonbelievers because they wrap evil in a discussion of why their particular faith is the only method to combat evil. A better question to ask about the futuristic society of Starship Troopers is to ask is does the fascist society that evolved on earth the only way to combat the arachnids. The concept of citizen and civilian is an interesting one that the film brings out. One serves in society and gains the franchise to become a citizen by going in some kind of national service. We're a lot closer to that than one might think. Look at voting in the USA. We are so balkanized with one party districts that it is close to impossible to unseat and incumbent. The voter participation in general elections is low enough, but party primaries where the issues are really decided have a minuscule participation. All of the resources of the body politic are geared towards getting these 'prime' voters out and for your particular candidate. In a very real sense they are the elite citizens in our system.I do like the fact that their seems to be a complete equality of the sexes, no one has any hangups about people's sexuality and their ability to do a job.I liked the performances of the young people of this new world a lot. I'm surprised that Casper Van Dien's career didn't rocket off after this film and his appearance as Tarzan. This looks like it will be his career role.I liked Dina Meyer best however as Diz who is carrying a statue of liberty size torch for Casper. Casper was brave, but he certainly was a little dense in this film.It's probably a good thing that it took almost 40 years after Robert Heinlein wrote the novel for this to get to the screen. This could never have been done back in the day. The computer generated special effects are awesome.Starship Troopers for all the faults in the society that has evolved is about nothing less than a future greatest generation who rose to meet a challenge of pure evil and saved mankind.",Starship Troopers
1,Leofwine_draca,The ultimate sci-fi war epic,10,30 December 2016,"Being a massive fan of Paul Verhoeven's work, I was very pleased to be able to see this in the local cinema – where the BBFC kindly decided to award it a 15 certificate! The decision was later changed to 18, and its easy to see why. Along with ROBOCOP and TOTAL RECALL, this makes up the Dutch director's gore trilogy : science fiction actioners packed with as much extreme violence and gruesomeness as possible! Verhoeven has a bigger budget around this time, so nominally sets about filming a serious Robert Heinlein '50s sci-fi story. Instead the film turns out to be an epic, action-packed cartoon adventure ride, with cardboard characters and a whole lotta mayhem going on! Verhoeven also has time to satirise those gung-ho American characters but the whole thing is performed with such a love and sense of humour that you can't help but settle back and enjoy the ride.The special effects are out of this world and make STARSHIP TROOPERS one of the best effects films I've watched. The future is portrayed in a subtle way and seems real, even the battles in outer space. The aliens themselves are only CGI, but it's good CGI – especially those huge beetle bugs that crawl outta the ground to burn the enemy! The action comes thick and fast and is loaded with extreme gore. Numerous decapitations, people being impaled, burned, and all sorts of nastiness. The sickening 'brain sucking' climax really pushes things over the edge a la Peter Jackson. Verhoeven takes a moment to reference the British classic ZULU with a nail-biting siege attack, whilst a period at boot camp sees trainees being flogged, knifed, and having their arms smashed for failing! It's not hard to see the similarities to the Nazis, down to the uniforms and the trench coats, so you get to snigger as well as enjoy the action.The acting is the one weak spot of the film, with Denise Richards and Casper Van Dien absolutely terrible as the clear-cut, one-dimensional young, beautiful heroine and hero – but maybe that was the point??! Otherwise we have solid support from the always reliable Jake Busey (making his dad Gary proud) and Doogie Howser himself, Neil Patrick Harris, as a member of the SS! Old pros Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside are on hand to supply the toughness. The film goes on a long time without losing focus, although the ending does seem to be a little abrupt in retrospect. Nevermind – this is a humorous, gruelling, ultra-violent, sometimes sick, always exciting war film like never before!",Starship Troopers
2,SnoopyStyle,fun shoot em up or compelling neo-fascist satire,8,29 September 2013,"In the future, humanity is under the rule of a worldwide neo-fascist military dictatorship fighting an alien civilization of giant space bugs. Citizenship is gained thru military service. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) has low grades which leaves him joining the Mobile Infantry. Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is infatuated with him and follows him into MI. Rico is in love with Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) but she chases her dreams of being a spaceship captain. Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) gets into the highly coveted Military Intelligence.Filmmaker Paul Verhoeven has a trashy stylish sensibility. His love of sex and violence really works in this sci-fi schlock. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the empty-headed matinée idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. For a hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary. There is a neo-fascist satire to it all. Of course, some may love this for all the wrong reasons. I kinda love this for every reason. It's got the grotesque, the sci-fi, the battle action, the cheesy story, and I don't take any of it seriously.",Starship Troopers
3,Prismark10,Bugged Up,7,8 May 2018,"Director Paul Verhoeven subverted the subtext of Robert A Heinlein's novel which had right wing underpinnings such as the rights of citizenship and the right to vote not being open to all.Starship Troopers is set in a future where Planet Earth is at war with bug like creatures from another planetary system that humans have encroached. Earth is a militaristic society, the media conditions the population to support the ongoing war effort. We follow four friends from High School in Buenos Aires where they study aspects of their civic society and then make their way through the military.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) joins the infantry where he goes through basic training mainly to be neat his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) who has also joined up. As time goes on as Rico becomes battle scarred, he realises the difference between civilians and citizens.The action scenes in the film is intense with the bugs attacking and ripping up human body parts. Verhoeven has always gone for hard core action with all guns blazing yet the film is infused with satire.Verhoeven openly admitted he did not like the politics advocated in Heinlein's book and wanted to take a swipe at the fascistic elements of it. At one point in the film a character turns up wearing a Nazi uniform (without the Nazi insignia) and Verhoeven remarked that hardly anyone who saw the film noticed it!",Starship Troopers
4,nogodnomasters,HAS IT ALL,10,5 June 2019,"Sex, violence, nudity, big guns, war, bugs, satire, and Denise Richards. Truly inspirational. What else does a real man's movie need?",Starship Troopers
5,gavin6942,"Was Not a Fan in 1997, But in 2015?",5,3 December 2015,"Humans in a fascistic, militaristic future do battle with giant alien bugs in a fight for survival.Director Verhoeven says his satirical use of irony and hyperbole is ""playing with fascism or fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American society... of course, the movie is about 'Let's all go to war and let's all die.'"" This theme did not resonate well with everyone, and ""Starship Troopers"" polarized audiences and critics alike.I did not care for the film when I saw it in theaters in 1997. Re-watching it now (2015), I like it slightly more. It has some nostalgia value, because we have actors like Denise Richards who have faded away... and Neil Patrick Harris who has gone on to bigger and better things. The satire itself is still pretty flat, though... this is not Paul Verhoeven's best work.",Starship Troopers
6,lee_eisenberg,parodying the '50s to the extreme,7,5 April 2007,"When ""Starship Troopers"" came out, one of my friends told me that it bore little relation to the novel on which it was based: the novel had a plot, the movie was an excuse to show naked women. But one of my mom's friends said that although the movie did lapse into a video game, it had sort of an interesting story. When we finally saw the movie a few months later, we found it fairly interesting. You see, more than simply a silly action/sci-fi flick (but make no mistake about it, those two are certainly a factor), the movie pokes fun at 1950s sci-fi flicks, what with all the ""Know your enemy! Do your part!"" stuff. I'm actually not surprised that Paul Verhoeven made a good movie with this one, given how well he did with ""Soldier of Orange"" and ""Robocop"".So yes, the movie rips at militarism and jingoism (the essential elements of fascism), while also finding time to show the sorts of things that easily appeal to teenage boys: pumped up action and naked babes. Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey and Michael Ironside have plenty to be proud of in this movie. Worth seeing.",Starship Troopers
7,jboothmillard,Starship Troopers,8,21 September 2005,"Based on a 1959 novel, this high-action, ultra-violent science fiction film is great entertainment from director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls). Basically, in the distant future, giant bugs are overtaking the planet Earth, and only the mobile infantry stand in their way of total annihilation of the human race. Johnny Rico (Sleepy Hollow's Casper Van Dien) wants to become a soldier for them, just after finishing college, along with girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards). It hits Rico when she is to become a pilot, and possibly never see him again, but also his home town of Buenos Aires is blown up just after he was quitting, but don't worry, he goes back, and he is determined to help kill all the bugs. So you can imagine most of the film, after the tiny romance story, is mainly just sending troopers onto parts of the planet, where the bugs hang out, and all hell breaks loose. You also find out, that as well as the horrific crawling and flying bugs, there is also the disgusting brain sucking, possibly head of the bugs, which at the end is probably the best key they have to finding the way to defeat the hideous creatures. Also starring Dina Meyer as Dizzy Flores, Jake Busey as Ace Levy , Neil Patrick Harris as Carl Jenkins, Clancy Brown as Sgt. Zim, Seth Gilliam as Sugar Watkins, Patrick Muldoon as Zander Barcalow, Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Jean Rasczak and Amy Smart as Pilot Cadet. The action is almost non-stop, the special effects of the space ships and bugs are very good, and of course, the over-the-top animated gore is sensational, just a great satirical science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!",Starship Troopers
8,ccthemovieman-1,Skip The First Hour And You Have A Fun Action Film,4,15 August 2006,"The ""bug"" scenes - the giant alien creatures - were outstanding and made this film really watchable. Unfortunately, we had to wade through the first hour of this 130-minute to get to those great action scenes, and had to endure a bunch of young, immature and extremely annoying characters and actors.Look what you have: Casper VanDien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey.....oh, man, what a bunch of snotty, young and stupid actors. They all have chips on their shoulders and the dialog between them is so stupid, it could only be a Paul Verhoeven-directed film. No surprise there! Verhoeven's films seem to be on the sleazy side, to say the least.Along the way, you can expect to hear his atheist heavy-handedness, and this movie is no exception. There is a cheap shot at Mormons; a plug or two for evolution and the customary unrealistic PC baloney of tough women who slug men and take charge!! Puh-leeze, this is so sickening.Fortunately, the second half saves this from being a total waste of time with some fantastic futuristic action scenes that are jaw-dropping at times. It's hard to imagine this film is about 10 years old already but the excellent special-effects still make it fun. Just skip the first hour.",Starship Troopers
9,rmax304823,"""Kill 'em All!""",6,24 September 2017,"It's not clear just exactly what Paul Verhoeeven and the writer Edward Neumeier were trying to do with this movie. I gather Heinlein's novel was pretty thoroughly tinkered with. The movie begins as a mediocre satire of war-time training camp movies. There's the loud and demanding drill sergeant, stern but fair. There are two high school football players vying for the same young girl. There is the less glamorous girl whose love for the handsome hero, Casper Van Dien, may be hopeless but resolute. There are brotherly insults in boot camp. Plenty of grabass in the shower, which is gender inclusive, a nice touch missing from my own boot camp. There's the rich kid who's about to drop out and take a walk down Washout Alley before a girl restores his faith in himself.Someone mentioned the actors' teeth, as well they should. What teeth! Incandescent! Brighter than a tooth whitener commercial, they'd light up a room if the fuse blew. And the principles are impossibly perfect, as if they'd just stepped out of a cartoon. Denise Richards, in particular, has this cygnette neck atop which sits a face full of good bone structure and a pair of lips so plush and prominent that they seem to have been photoshopped from somebody else. That Richards shows no evidence of having any acting talent is almost beside the point.It's not very funny. Not really. But it's identifiably a send up of a training camp movie to anyone familiar with the genre. That's not at all true for the remaining two thirds of the movie, which is treated as a serious science fiction film about our men and women in action against a planet ruled by ""bugs"", by ""arachnids"", according to dialog, though the images we see aren't arachnids at all but various forms of arthropods ranging from cockroaches to, well, other things, all of them creepy and mostly deft and speedy. They've destroyed Buenos Aires and ""the Federation"" has launched a war of retaliation against them. They far outnumber our men and women in uniform (all of them American) and our weapons are of little use against them. Full of martial pride, we attack them nonetheless -- and get clobbered.Some of the dialog is ripped off from World War II movies like ""Sands of Iwo Jima."" ""Saddle up!"" ""Do you want to live forever?"" ""The only good bug is a dead bug."" (Well, that's been attributed to a Civil War general but you get the point.) Some of the scenes are familiar too. The glorious last stand. The hordes of Indians, I mean bugs, charging the lone fort, mowed down in droves, only to be replaced by a million more. The sacrifice of the side kick. The last words being gasped from the bleeding mouth.Yet by this time the movie has turned deadly serious. There's nothing funny about soldiers being torn in half and flung into the air while still howling, or about a battleground with a hundred human body parts lying around in swatches of blood. It's frankly thrilling. You really WANT our troops to win, even if the war itself is stupid.So, what to make of it? Let's put it this way. Pre-teen minds (and some older) will enjoy it all the way through. More mature minds may have to put it on pause halfway through and think for a minute.",Starship Troopers
10,Tweekums,Great action sci-fi,8,3 September 2008,"When I first watched this I thought it was just an entertaining rip off of Aliens, little knowing that much of the earlier film had been inspired by the book of Starship Troopers. It also feels a bit like a sci-fi version of Full Metal Jacket in the way the first half is about basic training and the second half is almost non-stop combat action.The film is set in a future where in order to become a citizen and gain the vote you must have served in the armed forces, to this end a group of students enlist when they finish school. Most of the first half of the film follows Rico as he undergoes basic training. He nearly quits after a fellow recruit dies due to a mistake he made, but as he is about to leave he learns that his home city of Buenos Aires has been wiped out in an attack from a distant world populated by huge insects.The action then switches to the ""bug planets"" where our heroes expect an easy victory over the supposedly mindless insects, unfortunately for them the planet is crawling with insects that can tear them apart and even attack ships in orbit. Later on they learn that Military Intelligence suspects that the insects are being led by a ""brain bug"" and are tasked with capturing one on a small planets where they had just suffered a major defeat at the hands of the bugs.While this film isn't perfect it is great entertainment, it also isn't as brainless as it might appear at first sight, I don't think it is a coincidence that some of the uniforms resemble those of the Third Reich. There is a slight let down in the fact that the main characters are a little too good looking and some of the acting isn't as good as it could be, it must be pointed out that this complaint doesn't include the excellent Michael Ironside who played the teacher who re-enlists to become the troops' Lieutenant. The CGI bugs are also excellent, it does look as though our heroes are really battling huge alien bugs.If you enjoyed films like Aliens and have yet to see this then I'd recommend giving it a go.",Starship Troopers
11,BA_Harrison,Would you like to know more?,9,25 January 2009,"Although Ed Neumeier's script relies a little too much on contrivance and coincidence to be wholly satisfying, Starship Troopers still manages to be a thoroughly enjoyable piece of comic-book escapism, whilst at the same time successfully satirising fascism and the futility of war, once again proving that no-one does ballsy, big-budget sci-fi with subversive undertones quite like director Paul Verhoeven.An outrageously violent adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's book (of the same name) Starship Troopers presents a future where the Earth's population is divided into two groups: civilians and citizens. In order to attain citizen status, which affords a person certain perks not available to civilians, one must 'do their bit for society'; for teenager Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), this means joining the military for a tour of duty against the nasty insect-like aliens that have been launching attacks on Earth from across the vast expanses of space.Packed with gung-ho action, outrageous gore, and CGI effects that still look great today, Verhoeven's film is a magnificent, non-stop barrage of bloody conflictboth in space and on the surface of inhospitable, bug-infested planetsthat effortlessly drives home the horror of war, whoever (or whatever) the enemy and wherever the battleground.Verhoeven's naive troopers are a likable bunch of characters, but the director doesn't spare his viewers any of the gory details when it comes to them being hacked to pieces by the vicious scuttling aliens: limbs are scattered in all directions, heads are effortlessly removed by flying creatures, soldiers are burnt alive by massive fire-spewing tank bugs, and brains get sucked out of their victim's skulls.As well as offering excellent satire, superb direction, stomach-churning gore, and stunning special effects, Starship Troopers also features pitch-perfect performances from its impressive cast (which includes Bond-girl Denise Richards, toothy Jake Busey, Clancy 'The Kurgan' Brown, feisty hottie Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris, and the always brilliant Michael Ironside), plus a magnificent rousing score from Basil Poledouris.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Starship Troopers
12,BandSAboutMovies,I still can't believe that they sold kids toys of this movie.,8,26 October 2018,"Originally an unrelated script called Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine, this movie licensed the name Starship Troopers from the Robert A. Heinlein novel. That novel is as militaristic and fascistic as it gets. This movie? Well, upon its release, many critics saw it as a celebration of fascism. How anyone came to that conclusion is an absolute moron. This is a movie that rails against it from its very first frame, building on the mega mobile awareness that Verhoeven only hinted at in RoboCop.There's no way to not reveal my politics as I write about this. I usually keep that out of these articles, but a constant source of worry for me is that our universe has done more than slide to the right; we've seen Nazi and fascist ideologies written off as ""some good people."" So when Verhoeven alludes to wartime newsreels and Triumph of the Will (the Mobile Infantry ad at the beginning is taken shot-for-shot from this film), he's doing more than just some satire. I have no idea how anyone can watch a movie where Doogie Howser is wearing full SS regalia and see it as an endorsement of militaristic ideology.In the DVD commentary, the director states that he ""evoked Nazi Germany's fashion, iconography, and propaganda because he saw it as a natural evolution of the United States after World War II, and especially after the Korean War."" Obviously, if we believe conspiracy theory, the Nazi powers that be became part of our CIA, NASA and military/industrial complex. We won the war and became the enemy. Verhoeven motto for the film? ""Let's all go to war and let's all die.""As manifest destiny takes mankind into the stars, they discover arachnids, called ""bugs."" While it's never outright stated, it seems like the bugs are several steps down the evolutionary ladder from humans and would have never attacked us if we'd just left them alone.On Earth, citizenship in the one world government is a privilege that only comes from military service. That's one of the reasons to sign up. You also get to be a pilot. Or impress the girl you're in love with. That's how Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) joins up, trying to win the heart of pilot Carmen (Denise Richards). Then there's Dizzy (Dina Meyer), who is the way better choice, but as she's more masculine, Johnny never sees anything in her until it's too late. They also have a friend named Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) whose psychic ability means he will be one of the ruling class.The film unfolds in episodic form where we progress from basic training to initial battles with the bugs to the first meeting with one of the more intelligent members of their species, a ""brain bug."" Throughout, commercials and military propaganda fill the screen, always ending with ""Do you want to know more?"" That's ironic - real, uncontrolled information does not exist and executions air live on TV at 6 PM. This is the government-controlled media empire that we are constantly spiraling closer and closer to.Every time Starship Troopers hints at the fact that humanity is doomed and that we're in over our head - like the disastrous battle on Klendathu - these messages nearly erase those feelings. And one only has to look at the climax of the film, where an army of masculine warriors gathers around a very female creature and celebrate the emotion of fear as people celebrate in a moment that should be the emotional feel-good close of the film. But it's hollow. And it's wrong. And the emotions that it makes you feel are false, put in there to teach you a lesson.""Come on you apes! Do you wanna live forever?""""They'll keep fighting and they'll win!""""These are the rules. Everybody fights, nobody quits. If you don't do your job I'll kill you myself.""Yet every single authority figure in this movie has been scarred by the very Federation they serve, particularly Rasczak (Michael Ironside, absolutely amazing in every film and beyond that here), who goes without an arm until signing back up for service, his stump now replaced by quite literally an iron fist.",Starship Troopers
13,Coventry,"You want to live forever? Well, you won't!",9,10 May 2021,"If ""Starship Troopers"" isn't the most epic science-fiction movie ever made, then I don't know what is! What is that you say? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? ""Star Wars""? Well, perhaps, but they aren't nearly as entertaining as Paul Verhoeven's extravagant, unhinged and excessively violent dystopian saga. This film is probably the most cynical, yet simultaneously the most straight-faced parody in history. Look closely at the FedNet propaganda, the Aryan lead characters and their costumes, the careless sacrificing of the Infantry forces... This futuristic battle set in 2197 is a replay of WWII, but somehow Verhoeven succeeded in making us root for the fascist party! I honestly don't think there is much to write about ""Starship Troopers"", except that it's nearly perfect and brilliant from every possible angle. After the already amazing ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", Verhoeven reached the ultimate in genius Sci-Fi. It's all there: the F/X, the humor, the cast, the bloodshed, the scenery, ... The only things you have to add yourself are beer and popcorn.",Starship Troopers

The script is pretty macho sounding, while having strong female characters near the lead position. Very good special effects. This is what attracted me most; well the stunning Dina Meyer doesn't hurt your eyes any. The acting is a little light, but the action will keep you occupied.

16,hitchcockthelegend,Would you like to know more?,8,4 March 2008,"Big square jawed macho beefcakes and sexy girls face off against giant bugs from space! Doesn't sound like a film of much intelligence does it? Yet here, Starship Troopers finds director Paul Verhoeven at his satirical best, because although he is given the audience all the violence and madness it craves, he is also crafting a biting commentary full of fascist leanings and pokes in the ribs of the army mentality that urges obliteration in the name of jingoistic fervour.The story is a simple and untaxing one, Earth is at war with a bug planet called Klendathu, the youth are urged to join up for the service to rid the universe of the insect menace. We follow a group of ridiculously pretty characters thru cliché ridden training camps until their respective lives hurtle towards the finale. Naturally there is a flowing love interest story, and sure enough Verhoeven milks the cheese factor for all is worth. The violence is savage, limbs are torn apart and body orifices entered in a way that nobody should ever have to suffer! Yet the violence and construction of said violence is crucial to the films heart. It's a film that the squeamish really should stay away from, but rest assured that for although it may seem violence for violence's sake at first glance, it's actually there fleshing out {no pun intended} a biting and snarky viewpoint from a very interesting director. 8/10",Starship Troopers
17,Theo Robertson,"Glossy , Entirely Dumb But Entertaining",7,23 May 2008,"Verhoeven's STARSHIP TROOPERS is certainly a film that doesn't stand up to repeated viewing . The first half consists of the most unlikely military recruits put on to celluloid . You get the impression that the recruits are taking part in a beauty contest rather than a military training camp , all those these bimbos and pretty boys totally fail to convince . Like ancient Rome they're joining the military to receive citizenship but why ? They all have perfect teeth which means this future meritocracy has a much better health system than we've got in present day Britain so is this authoritarian society so bad ? By the way if we're subjected to a one world government does this explain why everyone speaks with a similar accent no matter what their nationality or ethnic background ? Apparently main pretty boy Johnny Rico is Argentine but looks like he's stepped out of Beverly Hills California same as nearly everyone else in the film . So much for diversityDespite stepping up several gears in the second half of the movie the audience are still subjected to a complete lack of logic in the story . Roger Ebert has asked if the human race is capable of interstellar travel then why are they incapable of coming up with an effective insecticide ? A good point but why even bother with insecticide ? Surely it'd be a good idea to send missiles containing warheads of several megatons of explosive towards the bug colonies ? No matter how much you try to explain it away you're left thinking of what a ridiculous idea it is to send ground troops to a planet to engage in pitched battles with literally billions of self aware homicidal insectsActually I've just realised why , because if humanity nuked the bugs then we'd be left with two hours of THE OC IN OUTER SPACE with the last two minutes composed of a couple of large explosions and that would have made for an extremely boring film . Say what you like about the first sixty minutes of the running time ( And if you've nothing nice to say about it I'll agree with you ) but the second half of STARSHIP TROOPERS is very gory fun with Verhoeeven delivering the goods . It's certainly not a masterpiece of intellectual SF cinema but it is very entertaining as long as you don't think about it too hard",Starship Troopers
18,preppy-3,Basically just a war movie set in outer space,7,25 August 2011,"This takes place on Earth in the future. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem)joins the military Mobile Infantry to battle giant bugs who are attacking Earth. His girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) joins also but is assigned to Flight Troopers. The movie follows them through their basic training and the all out battles with the bugs.This was taken WAY too seriously when it came out. People attacked director Paul Verhoeven saying her made a pro-war film. These people obviously missed the satirical tone of the film. This is NOT a pro-war film at all. Verhoeven is showing war is hell--he's not promoting it at all. The battles scenes are violent, gory and very VERY bloody. Body parts go flying every which way during them. This somehow got by with an R rating--Verhoeven himself was surprised that they didn't request any cuts. Guess they liked the bugs. The story is a basic war story where a couple is broken apart but still reunite at the end. This time it's just done with starships and bugs:) The special effects are very impressive...but the bugs look pretty stupid to me. There's also some skin (male and female) in the infamous coed shower sequence.On the negative side the acting is pretty horrible. Van Diem is a VERY handsome man but just can't. Poor Richard is given nothing to work with and spends 90% of her performance with this WAY too wide grin on her face. Even Neil Patrick Harris (in a small role) is bad! However Patrick Muldoon and Dina Meyer are pretty good supporting roles. It's loud, silly, violent and a lot of fun! I give it a 7.",Starship Troopers
19,CinemaSerf,Who'd be a bug?,7,9 October 2021,"You know, were this film maybe twenty minutes shorter then it would be quite a decent sci-fi action film. Sure, the cast is made up of pretty/handsome lightweight acting talent led by Casper Van Dien (""Rico') but they do all gel quite well, providing us with quite a reasonable escapist effort. ""Rico"" is determined to enrol into the military to gain much sought after citizenship and to fight against the marauding Klendathan bugs. The story marries loads of typical gung-ho boot camp scenarios with some well photographed action scenes as our hero and his team of kick-ass buddies take on the gazillions of bugs intent on sucking out brains, tearing folks limb from limb and, generally, being a bit nasty! The dialogue is terrible, but that doesn't matter - this is a shameless piece of entertainment aimed squarely at folks who want to switch off their brain and watch a shoot-em up with loads of pyrotechnics, special effects and a bit of harmless eye candy. There are a couple of cameos from ""Doogie Howser"" himself (Neil Patrick Harris) - as a mind reading fellow clad in a rather SS-style uniform; Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside provide the physical (if not exactly cerebral) muscle and eagle eyed folks might even spot ""Blanche"" from the ""Golden Girls"" (Rue McClanahan) early on too. Never going to win any prizes for the script or the acting, but the effects were Oscar nominated and the action - after a rather slow start - proves to be pretty end-to-end, and enjoyable.

20,zardoz-13,Science Fiction As Propaganda,7,20 December 2009,"""Starship Troopers"" qualifies as just the kind of flashy, trashy, creature-in-space nonsense that you would expect from the crassly commercial Dutch director Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is the same guy who cranked out ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Basic Instincts,"" and ""Showgirls."" Elements from all those movies appear in ""Starship Troopers."" If you were hoping that ""Starship Troopers"" was going to be a new kind of ""Star Wars,"" get ready for a galactic letdown. Although set in a sexually liberated society that worships fascism with existentialism as a way of life, ""Starship Troopers"" bristles with clichés from those old democratic Hollywood movies making the rounds in American Movie Classics. A huge part of ""Starship Troopers"" is its metaphorical impact. The movie appropriates virtually everything from the sci-fi, horror, western and war movies of yesteryear. The bug villains can be seen as either Apache Indians on the warpath or Japanese soldiers. The film winks at its own sarcastic racism. The humans revile the bugs with the language that our white ancestors used to revile both the Native Americans and Japanese soldiers. At times, this handsomely produced hyper-kinetic space opera ridicules World War II era propaganda movies when it is not out to out blast the last epic movie. Despite its fabulous, state-of-the-art, CGI special effects, ""Starship Troopers"" is really just a live-action video game. Indeed, both dazzling to look at and exciting to watch, this Verhoeven film is as phony as a hologram. The chief problem that the filmmakers struggle with is unloading all the exposition. Like ""Dune,"" ""Starship Troopers"" has to tell its audience a lot of material about its futuristic society and its villains before the plot can launch. In the society of the future, you have got to join the military to obtain the right to vote. Only citizens can vote. You can only become a citizen when you have served a hitch in the military. Once again, despite its future setting, the military dresses in regalia that borrows much from the defunct Nazi storm troopers crossed with U.S. Desert Storm soldiers. ""Starship Troopers"" is like one of those parallel universe ""Star Trek"" episodes where everything is turned inside out.Meanwhile, instead of using light sabers, these warriors tote supercharged M-16 assault rifles that never run out of ammunition. You would think that a future world would have developed a more deadly weapon than a machine gun. Rich kid Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem of ""90210"") joins up to stay in close proximity to his sexy high school sweetheart Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards of ""The World Is Not Enough""). He enlists in the Mobile Infantry or the Marines, while she suits up as an officer who flies space liners. The parents of our protagonist try to warn him about chasing girls like Ibanez, but he refuses to listen until the day that Ibanez dumps him. He loses a Marine during a combat training exercise and is about to wash out when the bugs from the other side of the universe come a-calling. Allegedly, the Edward Neumeier screenplay is based on the legendary Robert Heinlein science fiction epic. Friends of mine who know the book backwards, forwards, and sideways claim that its resemblance to the film is marginal. ""Starship Troopers"" resembles vintage Hollywood war movies, such as ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" and ""Battle Cry,"" where the guys graduate from boot camp to combat. The biggest difference here is that both the guys and the gals endure the rigors of basic training. Not only does the liberal fascist military admit babes to the battlefield, but it also lets them shower with the guys. Basically, after an introduction to the grisly arachnids, ""Starship Troopers"" recycles all of those familiar war movie clichés. Casper Van Diem favors a young John Wayne, and the casting deliberately exploits his resemblance, especially when he delivers the famous ""saddle up"" line that Wayne relied on in ""Sands of Iwo Jima."" One of the biggest liabilities of ""Starship Troopers"" is its no-name cast. You identify with the heroes instead of the actors portraying them. In ""Star Wars,"" the no-name cast worked because the characters were special, but the ""Starship Troopers"" characters constitute a generic bunch of streamlined stereotypes. The last Verhoeven movie ""Showgirls"" infuriated everybody with its casual nudity and lurid subject matter. ""Starship Troopers"" succeeds in reverse. Verhoeven loosens tons of glitzy realism, vicious bugs that eviscerate humans, buckets of blood & gore, and nominal sex in the form of a video game. Moreover, he shoots ""Starship Troopers"" with a tongue-in-cheek question: Would You Like to Know More? The underlying comparison between this sci-fi movie and the recent wars in the Middle East is unmistakable. Nevertheless, this far-out but formulaic sci-fi adventure is nothing special, but it makes for lowbrow entertainment.",Starship Troopers

Along with ""Mars Attacks!"" this is the most misunderstood masterpiece.The movie is made as a kind of B-movie with a stupid story and cheesy dialogue's and some at times laughable bad B-actors. All of did was done on purpose. The movie is one big misunderstood satire on American society, just like Verhoeven did before with ""RoboCop"". The movie is filled with a subtle but brilliant fascist undertone and I'm not only talking about the army costumes and flags or the prop agenda like commercial brakes but also how the people behave. I truly pity those who don't understand the satire, for they can never truly see ""Starship Troopers"" as the masterpiece that it is.The movie is filled with some trademark Verhoeven gory scene's in which heads and other limbs are literally flying around. The use of the violence and gore like in all Verhoeven movies is nothing short of brilliant and is never overused. There are some impressive intense battle sequence's like you have never seen before.The special effect are wonderful (can I say best ever?), especially considered that the movie was made in 1997 when the special effects were not as good as now days. Not only the bugs look good and realistic but also the spaceships and the action is brilliant.Basil Poledouris his musical score is superb and one of his best ever.

22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Another great film by Paul Verhoeven,8,28 May 2004,"Paul Verhoeven has a knack for making entertaining films that involve sex, violence and action(not always the first, but the two last mentioned he always manages to deliver). Those three things, of course, do not make a great movie. He just somehow always finds a way to incorporate them into his movies, which are usually great. This is a science fiction action film, with social commentary and obvious stabs at America in general(but mainly the politics and their seeming obsession with solving any conflict by violent means). You'll see the typical narrow-minded(American) individuals who dehumanize(yes, I realize that they *are* aliens, but still) the enemy in every possibly way, you'll see propaganda, there's even a scene where a member of a debate refuses to even think the thought of the enemy actually being intelligent beings. As an action film, it reminded me a little of RoboCop, but nearly everything was on a much larger scale. There are several epic battle scenes in this movie, and they are very well-made. The action scenes are all intense, and capture war conditions pretty good. The special effects are also very well-made, and add to the intensity by giving us a chance to see some very gruesome deaths and alien/futuristic weaponry. The film also has several camera pans and angles mainly used to show human death and misery. I think that was a good way to show how pointless and grotesque war really is. The plot is very good, and moves along at a great pace; I wasn't really bored at any point in the film, and I've seen it four or five times now. The acting is mostly just below standard, but sometimes it drops several notches and goes to being ludicrous, and actually making the viewer snicker or laugh at what would have been a serious scene, had it not been painfully overacted. The characters all seemed fairly well-written and credible, though a few of them were stereotypes. The film also does have its share of clichés, but none of them ruin the movie. I haven't read the book this film was based on, but I doubt that it could present the social commentary much better, or done a much better job of mocking the general ignorance usually involved with war and the likes. If it does, I might just have to find it and read it sometime. I recommend this to fans of Verhoeven's other films, especially fans of RoboCop. If you're into social commentary and/or sci-fi action, you'll probably like it, too. 8/10",Starship Troopers
23,view_and_review,"""B"" rated gore and mayhem",3,7 January 2005,"This movie should've been called ""Bug Invasion"" or ""Jumbo Arachnaphobia"" or some other ""B"" movie title so that people would know before-hand that-that is what they are watching.I will concede that not much if anything in this movie is realistic, nor is it supposed to be. But is that an excuse for the horrendous acting, the almost laughable blood, guts, and gore, and a military that is actually worse in the future than it is today.If this was supposed to be a comedy I sure was getting mixed signals. One moment the movie is serious, and the next moment they do something absolutely asinine, e.g. shooting your partners brains out during training, turning your back on the enemy, celebrating unnecessarily during combat, sending a couple of thousand troops after millions of overgrown bugs, etc.The movie would have been better off going the comedic route instead of the semi-serious route it took. It was just one ridiculous event after another sandwiched between corny dialog and lackadaisacal attempts to make it all believable.",Starship Troopers
24,neil-476,I'm so shallow,7,9 May 2008,"I like this film a great deal, and I love Heinlen's book. This is something of a conundrum, given that the film, based on the book, adopts an entirely contradictory political point of view.But there's nothing to say that both points of view don't have some validity, and that it can be a good thing to listen to both and then make your own mind up.And it is, in my mind, a good thing to have literary works (by which I mean both the book and the film) which work on the twin levels of a) flash bang wallop entertainment and b) food for thought.Dropping down to a superficial level, the CGI bugs are great (in fact all the effects are extremely good), Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards are both somewhat vapid, Clancy Brown never really convinces me that he's the same Zim as in the book, and Michael Ironside is fine. I didn't understand the need for Dina Meyer's fixation on the Rico character (I had no problem with Dizzy Flores changing sex from being male in the book) and oh how I wish they'd had the powered armour of the book - running around with machine guns in an era of interplanetary travel (and against a foe consisting of teeming hundreds of thousands of individuals each of which required multiple shots to disable) was just plain stupid.But good fun, and thought provoking.",Starship Troopers

Signing up to Patreon to take part in Dan Murrell's Movie Club, I was pleased to see that this was one of Murrell's choices,leading to me finally joining the troops.View on the film:Revealing in various Q&A's over the years that being told they were getting cast because they look like airheads was not the most flattering thing to be told, the ensemble cast give pitch-perfect performances, with Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards playing up on their doe-eyed teen idol looks as recruits who never flinch in their blind loyalty to the final push,whilst crusty generals played by Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown bare the cost of various failed wars on their faces, but continue to love being on the march against a enemy who they have little interest in learning more about.Reuniting after making his script debut with RoboCop, the screenplay by Edward Neumeier dumps Robert A. Heinlein's novel,for a incredibly witty satire on Fascism, bringing the new recruits into the Starship where they have been taught since childhood to always be loyal and obedient towards, to the point where military officials shooting injured fellow generals is unblinkingly accepted as being done for the greater cause.Opening with a expansion of the fake TV footage of RoboCop via a newsreel introduction based on Triumph of the Will, The Dirty Dutchman directing auteur Paul Verhoeven reunites with his regular cinematographer Jost Vacano,and superbly builds on the militarism of the police and media propaganda themes and motifs of RoboCop, by taking it to the most extreme, blowing up the Creature Feature bugs with (spectacular) ultra splatter violence (a recurring motif of Verhoeven) backed by a rousing score from Basil Poledouris.Building on the militarism of the police in RoboCop, Verhoeven unleashes the authoritarianism of the army stamping anything which gets in the way (like the faceless bugs) of their rule, in Fascist uniforms worn by cannon fodder exposed by Verhoeven in the fake newsreel as being generational, whose thin trace of humanity is wiped off when they join the starship troopers.",Starship Troopers

Dina Meyer plays whiny girlfriend #1 and Denise Richards plays whiny girlfriend #2. One of them dies while the other survives so that she can whine some more. Michael Ironside is given the thankless role of commander. The handling of genres misses its satire approach and is squashed like a bug to a fly squatter.

28,Aaron1375,I got the point of the movie...but it still sucked to me.,2,29 October 2003,"Notice I said it sucked to me.  I am not going to bash people for liking this movie, but don't bash me for hating it.  This movie is a thinly disguised anti-war movie that mocks patriotism and such.  This movie is set in the future and the society has become more of a Nazi type government. Forget trying to analyze it, the science is quite bad so forget it.  You will just hurt your head, thinking how it is impossible to fly the distances portrayed in this movie.  In this movie they want you to join the military, and apparently you have to be a supermodel to join.  Come on people, there aren't this many good-looking people at a college, most people are average looking, but you have to suspend your disbelief.  The reason I hate this movie is that I can't stand the characters, they are all annoying and you almost crave for them to die, but then whom do you pull for?  The bugs? They have no personality.  So here and there lies the problem, the director purposely made this movie this way, you are supposed to hate the characters, I think I read where this was supposed to be what if the lead couple in the movie Grease became Nazis and fought a war in space.  So right of the bat this is going to turn off a lot of people whether they get it or not.  Many who enjoyed the movie didn't get it, but just like the violence and action, but I wasn't even overly impressed with the action.  The movie is supposed to be satire, but it wasn't funny enough or witty enough for me.  It played like a satire that took itself to seriously for its own good.  Don't however; dismiss the movie based on my review.  Many like it so give it a look see and write a review here.  Many people like its antiwar messages and think it is a great play on things, others just like the action so as bad as I thought it was you may find something to like about it.

29,Wuchakk,Satirizing Heinlein's sci-fi novel,5,31 December 2016,"Released in 1997 and directed by Paul Verhoeven, ""Stormship Troopers"" is a sci-fi adventure satire taking place in the 23rd century where high school kids are encouraged to become ""citizens"" by joining the fascist military where, after boot camp, they find themselves engaged in a full-scale war against a planet of malevolent insects. The protagonists are played by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris, Jake Busey and Patrick Muldoon. Michael Ironside is on hand as a teacher/officer while Clancy Brown appears as a drill instructor.Right out of the gate the film blatantly advertises that it's not a straight interpretation of Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi novel. No, this is a full-blown SATIRE showing how easily government and the influence of a biased media can make blatant fascists of any of us, particularly in times of war. Look no further than the Nazi-like uniforms of the good guys. If you get the joke, ""Starship Troopers"" is very amusing. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions throughout the first half. Verhoeven captures a uniquely enjoyable tone.Unfortunately, the film gets redundant in the second half with the soldiers constantly shooting bullets into the colossal-insect antagonists. And, since we can't take the story & characters seriously, the movie is unable to sustain attention at 129 minutes. It would've been more effective at around 90 minutes. But, if you can handle the over-length and redundancy, this is a well-done and entertaining sci-fi satire.The film runs 129 minutes and was shot in Powder River, Wyoming; Badlands, South Dakota; and Malibu, Agoura Hills, Long Beach, Fountain Valley, Los Angeles and Culver City (studio), California.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)",Starship Troopers

31,zetes,Half a movie,6,1 August 2000,"The first time I saw this movie, I walked in on a bunch of friends watching it in a small dorm room. I was bored, so I sat and watched it. I asked somebody how much I had missed, and I was told not much. The first image I saw was a gung ho soldier running towards a giant insect screaming at the top of his lungs, only to be picked up and ripped in half. All right!!! And the violence only got more grizzly and horrific and, thus, comic. The dismemberments! The decapitations! Disembowlings! Brain eating! Rule! After an hour and a few minutes, the movie was over, and I had a buzz. It was the kind of fun movie even a seasoned film lover can enjoy.About a month later, I went home and my brother had rented the movie. I told him that I had really liked it, so we sat down and watched it. After all, I had missed a bit of it. Or so I thought. The movie is about two hours long, and it is split right in the center. The second hour is what I saw: the ultra-violent bug warfare. I had missed the first half: the military training. Ugh!!! Sitting through the first half of that movie soured me entirely over the film's entirety. They spend an hour training to fight against human beings, then they spend the second hour not using any of that training. The first half has some sporadic violence and nudity, but it is not worth it (well, one thing I can;t argue with is that this is the movie that (for almost everyone) introduced Denise Richard's chest to the world). Overall, I can only give the movie a 6/10. That's how bad the first half is. I would have given it a 9 if it were only an hour long. I recommend watching only the second half of the movie.",Starship Troopers

And maybe if I'd seen this in 1997, it would've lived on for its staggering (for its time) special effects.The movie opens with a close-knit group of friends on the eve of high school commencement. Enlisting in the Federation offers a convenient path to citizenship, so the film follows our cadre of pretty teenagers as they enter boot camp and eventually find themselves swept up in a planetary war with the bugs (really big arachnids).When the bullets aren't flying, the film plays out like a high school drama. Casper Van Dien joins up because his trophy girlfriend (Denise Richards) does. And the unrequited lover (the much more attractive Dina Meyer) joins for Van Dien. But it turns it, Richards in love with her piloting career off in the galaxy, leaving the door open for Van Dien to finally notice Meyer. Add in the slice of Americana, from the big football game to prom, and you've got yourself ""90210 in Space"" (it isn't lost on me how overused that expression might be, but the shoe fits).To the film's credit, there are some rousing battle scenes (mostly during the bug war), and an impressive effects budget. And the film's anti-war satire was amusing, although a bit campy. Enough to elicit an ""Oh, I see what they did there"" reaction. It's the teen drama angle that really dragged ""Starship Troopers"" down for me. I didn't care about any of these people, and the film spends way too much time on them. For a Verhoeven movie, it's no ""RoboCop"", but it didn't leave me with feelings of disgust like ""Basic Instinct"", or (god forbid) ""Showgirls"".5/10",Starship Troopers

I guess this movie is also supposed to define unity and patriotism, as the setting occurs when world governments are overthrown and everybody exists under one world order. This movie is somewhat like War of the Worlds set in the future, with humans battling a swarm of very hideous looking aliens. There is carnage in abundance and intense fighting scenes, which make the film grabbing and riveting. The acting wasn't all bad as I thought the chemistry between the lead characters was touching and effective, giving the film a dose of drama that counterbalances the intense sci-fi action. The special effects were neat, giving a definite war-torn atmosphere and, like with many sci-fi movies set in the future in planet Earth, the setting is barren and almost lifeless.

It has several entertaining battle sequences and some neat army training aspects, too. Ultimately, it falls a little flat, though, with an underwhelming ending and a slightly slow pace. The political satire feels more tied to one's enjoyment than in something like, say, 'Robocop (1987)' but it also doesn't feel as fully formed.

And it is. Only it is and it isn't. Yes, there are plenty of breath-taking action scenes where the computer effects actually work and it really does look like the monsters are there.However, although Starship Troopers likes to come across as just another shoot-em-up film, it does have - believe it or not - some deeper meaning. It pokes fun at the media, propaganda and even allows us to catch a glimpse of a 'utopian' future which is only one step away from fascist (check out the eerily similar Nazi uniforms the officers wear).If you liked Robocop and the way it almost threw in some tongue in cheek social and political commentary with mindless action, then you should like this.

The box office took a hit but the following lives on. This was my first time seeing Starship Troopers and didn't disappoint. With special/practical effects that still hold up almost 25 years later, memorable characters, and an action packed script, I can easily understand why this film is adored by so many worldwide.

38,gbill-74877,A fun popcorn movie,7,22 September 2019,"I liked this one a little more when I first saw it, and it's still an entertaining film from director Paul Verhoeven, with some of the same look and feel as RoboCop and Total Recall. I liked the long setup with the young kids getting out of high school and joining different branches of the military, as well as the development of the romantic interests. I also liked the futuristic boot camp and the supporting characters that are brought in. You also have all the high octane battle scenes with giant swarming alien bugs, filled with campiness and gore. If nothing else, it's a good popcorn movie.I think where Verhoeven misses just a bit is that he seems to want this to be a fun action movie at face value, which means war heroes and kicking ass, and also a critique of militarism. The latter is there but the balance is a little off so it gets a little muddled, and we see quite a bit about military service, bravery, and camaraderie. Part of the point is that the state can whip its populace up into senseless wars which have senseless casualties, and at the same time, there can be tragic acts of heroism from its young people in those wars, whose lives and energy could have been so much better spent doing something else. Those are great messages, but I wish there had been more direct satire, like the fantastic TV show where the talking heads utter inanities (""Frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!""). One of the things that was interesting to me was that the people scurrying to their spacecraft looked like bugs, and the scientists brutally jabbing the 'brain bug' to study it was like the bugs stabbing the humans.Meanwhile, at face value, the film does have a lot of great alien bug action, but there are so many elements of nonsense and illogic that go with it that it's hard not to groan at times. The ground troops with those guns, really? Although if you want to give Verhoeven the benefit of the doubt, you can say it shows the idiocy of the military, as well as its willingness to lose 300,000+ soldiers (while reporting 100,000) ... but still, it just seems like it doesn't work as well as it could have in either sense. To me it plays like a 50's B-movie in terms of just how much disbelief you're going to have to suspend, but with substantially better effects, cooler/scarier monsters, and some toplessness tossed in on top of it.

It focuses around three friends who still remain friends, but drift apart as one becomes a pilot, one an intelligence agent, and one a grunt, yet it is predictable as one can see that these three people remain the focus of the movie (or two as the intelligence officer disappears when they join the army, only appearing every so often to remind us that he is still around).The question is, is Starship Troopers a pro-war film or an anti-war film. There seems to be arguments that support both sides. First we will have a look at the pro-war aspect of the movie. Starship Troopers no doubts glorifies war. The whole thing about joining the army to become a citizen is a very pro-war sentiment. The idea is that if one is willing to risk their lives for their country then one is entitled to become a citizen of that country. The main characters have been described as being Captain and Miss America, while the iceman is Captain America's side kick. These main characters are the typical glorified Hollywood heroes who cannot die. Even though there are times where is seems likely they will die, they don't, they are the heroes. The supporting characters around them such as Diz and Micheal Ironside, die in horrific ways, but these two main characters, who see the action, remain alive throughout the movie. It has been commented that if this movie was an anti-war film then the main characters would have died in a pointless way that does not forward the war. The philosophy of the society is also very pro-war, it is right to fight for what you believe in, and that violence is the only way to solve problems. The trailer also opens with, ""in every lifetime there is a cause that one should fight for."" Supporting the anti-war sentiments is the pure reality of war that is shown in the movie. In Starship Troopers we see the camera pan across battlefields littered with dead bodies. These bodies are been hideously mauled and ripped to shreds. We watch limbs get ripped off by the hordes of critters that come swarming over the hills, and we see loved ones die in the arms of their lovers. This movie is extremely violent and very blatant, it is not one for those who cannot handle the sight of blood, or scenes of mass carnage. Another anti-war sentiment seems to be the nature of the news reports. It opens with a camera man on the front-line and we are watching troopers getting ripped to shreds by the arachnids. This is a very 20th century way of reporting on a war where the journalists are right in the thick of the action. This seems to be an attack against the war reporting is conducting this era.Yet all of this blood and gore seems to serve a purpose, and that is as anti-bug propaganda. This propaganda is hammed up in the scene where we see children squashing bugs and a voice over saying ""and we should all do our bit for the war effort"". This may seem really stupid but in both World War I and World War II Germans in Australia were detained because it was for the war effort. South Australia has a large German community in the Barossa Valley and Handorf, and they experienced a lot of prejudice during this era. Another anti-war sentiment is the way the humans probe the bugs and the bugs probe the humans. When the bugs do it we say, ""yuck kill them"", yet when we do it we say, ""yay, we're probing the bugs!"". This exposes our hypocritical nature when it comes to war. They even comment in the movie ""they're just probing us as we are probing them,"" yet with us it is good and with them it is bad.I guess the most important point to consider is the director Paul Verhoeven. He is described as being a typical American Director which means that he gives us what we see and there is little in the way of thought behind the movie. I guess the possible statement that comes from this movie is, ""war is good if you are fighting for what you believe in, but if you do this is the consequence.""",Starship Troopers
42,slightlymad22,Great Guys Movie,7,8 January 2015,"Plot In A Paragraph: In the future, Earth has become a spacefaring Federation. While colonizing new planets, humans have encountered an insectoid species known as the Arachnids or ""Bugs"", with their home being the distant world Klendathu. The bugs appear to be little more than killing machines, though there are suggestions that they were provoked by the intrusion of humans into their habitats. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and best friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) attend high school in Buenos Aires. Fellow student Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is in love with Rico, but he does not reciprocate. Enlist in Federation service after graduation. However it is not long before training is over and the real war begins. I really enjoyed this movie, though it is pretty much a boys own movie. It was visually impressive and even if the acting wasn't always up to scratch (Denise Richards, Patrick Muldoon and Jake Busey I'm talking to you) I really liked seeing two bad guys from the Highlander movies on screen again Clancy Brown (Kurgan from ""Highlander"")as Career Sgt Zim and Michael Ironside (Katana from ""Highlander 2"") as Lt. Jean Rasczak. Neil Patrick Harris is not given as much to do, as one would hope, but he is his usual brilliant self when he is on screen. And he is the most talented actor on display amongst the younger cast members.It has a slightly longer than needed running time, that could have defiantly used some trimming (The love story between Richards and Muldoon was a complete waste of screen time as (whilst they are an attractive pairing) neither could act that well, and neither character was that likable. Dina Meyer blows Denise Richards off the screen by comparison. I'm surprised I have seen so little of her since (outside of her role in the Saw franchise and D-Tox) while Richards went on to bigger things (and of course Charlie Sheen) in her career. I noticed a lot of the uniforms seem inspired by WW2 German military and the SS uniform to say the least. Whilst the flag of the Federation has a symbol that looks like the Imperial Eagle from WWII Germany.Overall this is a great guys movie, defo not not one to watch on a date though.",Starship Troopers

45,eddie_baggins,A fun and over the top 90's Sci-Fi with great effects and spectacle,6,22 June 2020,"Budgeted at a huge $100 million dollars plus, its safe to say in retrospect not everyone got the vibe of Paul Verhoeven's big budgeted satirical take on Robert A. Heinlein's popular book of the same name, with many critics unable to stomach its seemingly intentional wooden acting, over the top violence and full-blown satire of the American military regime and gung-ho attitude but in the years following its initial release, Verhoeven's spectacle driven blockbuster has garnered a significant following of fans.Spawning a collection of direct to video sequels that are better off never thought about, Trooper's throws subtlety out the window as it introduces us to a militaristic future where mankind is waging war at home and across the galaxy against a race of alien bugs hellbent on colonizing Earth for their own purposes, with Verhoeven marching full steam ahead at all times as his flesh and gore-filled event rolls along without an ounce of care for stopping and smelling any type of roses, instead choosing to trample on them on its way past.Introducing us to the new world order through some news clips and advertisements (not dissimilar to those we saw in another Verhoeven satire Sci-Fi Robocop), Trooper's doesn't waste too much time on its set-up as we are then introduced to our films main players, Casper Van Dien's Johnny Rico (this man's jaw-line is hard to look away from), Denise Richard's wannabe pilot Carmen Ibanez and Dina Meyer's Dizzy Flores, all graduating students set on joining the fight against their buggy enemies.It's not unfair to say all performers here deliver their lines and inhabit their characters as if they are being fed lines of dialogue off camera, with Van Dien making his counterpart Van Damme seem like an Oscar winning thespian but mostly their stilted and unenthusiastic performances suit the films nature, a nature that is never too far away from a set-piece or moment of computer generated/proptastic bug attack.The films biggest strength and one that can't be denied is even in this day and age of computer wizardry much of Trooper's big moments still work thanks to some fantastically realized CGI work and molding together with some great creature props.Many films of the 90's era have aged terribly in these departments but Trooper's ageless space battles and limb-flinging wars have managed to remain entertaining and thrilling, offering up respite from many of the films moments of badly worded dialogue and uninteresting romantic interludes that could've easily bought the film down to dark depths of Razzie worthy notoriety.Final Say -Far from what you would call classy cinema or deep thinking sci-fi, Starship Troopers is still a whole lot of fun, with a bitingly self-aware examination of fascist military operations firmly in its sights at all times, making this a film that remains relevant and entertaining to this day.3 blind teachers out of 5",Starship Troopers

51,Anonymous_Maxine,An excellent sci-fi war film with an absolutely awful ending.,7,9 June 2000,"For the first hour, Starship Troopers is just amazing. The film is set up extremely well, the story is very well-told, and the military training scenes in particular are especially effective in communicating the situation of the human race as it is portrayed in the film. However, the film had what I like to call a ""hit by a truck"" ending. There didn't seem to be enough of a conclusion reached, the film just kind of stopped. This could mean that the film studio simply ran out of money, or that they are just leaving room for a sequel, but either way, it is just too abrupt.Besides that, it seems that the film as a whole (and especially the first three quarters of it) draws more from Orson Scott Card's classic science fiction war novel ""Ender's Game"" than it does from Robert Heinlein's novel on which the film is supposedly based. True, the characters aren't children, as they are in Ender's Game, but their activities are virtually identical.
Starship Troopers is definitely worth watching; the special effects are spectacular, the war scenes are amazing but also incredibly graphic, and even the relatively modest futuristic atmosphere is more convincing than the usual flying cars and alien-looking clothes (as in Back To The Future II). The film could stand a few improvements in acting and scripting, but as a whole it is a relatively satisfying science fiction film that, despite its disappointments, I definitely recommend.",Starship Troopers
52,jzappa,An Overwhelming Broad Satire On America's Self-Righteous Xenophobia and Militaristic Machismo,8,31 October 2008,"OK, look. Starship Troopers is not a kiddie movie. It's also not just a dumb go-for-broke action flick. If you've seen Verhoeven's past action pictures made in America, RoboCop and Total Recall specifically, you know what to expect here. And nearly everyone has seen RoboCop and Total Recall. Do you really think that a movie starring less-than-B-list actors playing roles with names like Johnny Rico is supposed to be taken seriously? Even a little bit? The film's biggest star is Denise Richards, that is if you don't count Rue McClanahan in a bit role as a blind biology teacher, for all those fans of Maude and The Golden Girls scattered all over the audience of Starship Troopers.I have not read the original novel by Robert Heinlein, but I know that it does not have the satirical approach that the film does. Verhoeven is a Dutchman who since coming to America has taking great pleasure in spoofing it. The film illustrates a country which unwarily evokes Nazi Germany, through fashion, use of propaganda, and iconography. Verhoeven's Earth is dystopic. It is xenophobic and militaristic in nature which he sees as a natural development in the righteous and victorious mentality of post-WWII America. The military training is deliberately brutal. Commanders intentionally mutilate recruits, and whipping is a means of penalty, which is to some extent moderated by the depiction of the future's technology which can heal such injuries in a jiff.Gender distinction is presented as having become less significant. Dina Meyers plays the adept starting quarterback of the high school football team who follows Casper Van Dien's hunky rebel protagonist through military training and into the front lines, as the military takes on both men and women to serve in combat. A particularly appealing and unabashedly Dutch bit is that the soldiers of both sexes shower and lodge together and by and large hardly think about sexual misconduct.With interstellar travel and a all-embracing galactic government, humanity has found themselves at war with an alien race of arachnids. Johnny Rico (Van Dien), his girlfriend (Richards), and best friend (Neil Patrick Harris) are all graduating from high school in Buenos Aires. Richards and Harris both plan to enlist in the military to become upper-class citizens after their term. Johnny, wanting to follow his girl, goes against his parents' ultimatums and enlists himself, but he finds that his grades are too low to join Denise Richards in Flight School, and is as an alternative assigned to combat. There, Johnny shows himself to be an exceptional leader, and is assigned head of his squad. He also meets an old high school classmate, Dina Meyer, who specially called for transfer to Johnny's division, as she has always been in love with him. Johnny comes to learn that his girlfriend is happy with her training and has become intimate with an old high school of his, hilariously named Zander, but that she will probably make the fleet her career, shattering Johnny's dreams.As both insect and human forces are massacred in extraordinary numbers, they are filmed and photographed by entrenched TV crews for viewers at home, further accenting the theatricality in the movie's spirit and the nature of the war of the future. Really, the humans are the invaders and the bugs the victims. When the bugs devastate Buenos Aires, they are not attacking Earth but acting in response to human migrants intruding on bug planets.Verhoeven truly directs this movie rather than filming it and influencing the actors. He really distinguishes it as its own beast. The story has a soap opera feel, almost like an old American war or religious epic by Cecil B. DeMille. He makes all the hero worship and self- righteous American military camaraderie not just satire but, in my eyes, broad comedy, way too corny to ever be meant as anything else. Even the music score by Basil Paledouris fits this thin-ice tone. Yes, its cavalier approach to all of its subject matter makes you much more detached and tired before the end that you should be, and that is its real fault, not that it's immature and stupid. Because, if you read between the very thin lines, you will find it is quite the contrary.",Starship Troopers
53,Vartiainen,Enjoyable in so many ways,8,9 July 2012,"I first saw this film when I was just a boy and back then I didn't even know that there was such a thing as satire, yet alone recognize it. And I still thought that this was a fun film to watch. I could appreciate its colourful characters, its humour, its blazing action scenes and its interesting setting. And when I grew older I started to notice its commentary on war, media and the social structure that seems to put more weight on killing and warriors than helping its citizens to live happy lives. And I liked that aspect of the film as well.For me this film is the best kind of cheesy fun, the kind that I don't have to feel ashamed of for liking. Because underneath all the corny action shots, the stereotypical yet likable characters and all the almost parodic lines of dialogue, this is an intelligent film. It doesn't shove it to your face that much, and I dare say there are many people out there that don't even realize that this is a satire, but it's there. But the fact is that at least for me this is an enjoyable action film even without all the political and social commentary. I could watch this just fine without thinking any of the underlying questions, but those certainly don't make the film any worse. Quite the opposite in fact.Is it a perfect film? No, it's certainly not for everyone as it is rather cheesy, corny and clichéd all at the same time. But there is a hidden face to it and it is full of dark humour. I personally like it, but it's not for everyone. But for those that like either good action films or clever satires, this film is certainly worth checking out.",Starship Troopers

Excellent direction!I love this story, and this film. It has been rated (though I honestly can not remember by whom, at this writing) as the most graphic movie ever made for the amount of gore and bloodshed contained therein. When I am feeling aggressive, or feel the need to BE aggressive, this movie definitely helps set that mood within me.But there is much more to this production than aggression, blood, gore and violence (though there is an extreme amount of violence). The plot is quite absorbing. While the acting quality does leave a bit to be desired at times, the plot and the action more than make up for it. You can't help but notice it, but the point becomes moot as the story progresses and the bloodshed commences. Set in a futuristic world, and adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's book of the same title, this production presents you with a World War 2-type environment, with characters of the same caliber. It definitely demonstrates much more than your average slasher-style violence and gore. It is so much more graphic than any slasher flick could ever be. Definitely NOT for young audiences. If you like sci-fi/action, or just lots of action and gore, this is the movie for you.

57,PWNYCNY,"You want interplanetary war? Well, here it is!",10,13 January 2009,"Unlike other science fiction movies with complicated and pretentious plots and subplots, this movie presents a simple, straightforward story about interplanetary war, with the emphasis on war. Two planets fighting it out. Two species vying for galactic supremacy. Humans vs. the non-humans. It doesn't get more direct than that. It's war and the earth is mobilized for action and action there is as those who answer the call of duty earn the highest honors and the admiration of all they protect. What makes this movie even more interesting is that the enemy is completely unlike the humans yet have the capacity to inflict great harm. There's no room for compromise. No room for negotiations. The two species cannot communicate with each other. There is no commonality between them. No third-party is going to negotiate a truce because there is no basis for discussion. Star Wars depicts war; this movie depicts a far more primeval scenario that sweeps away all the sentimental muck, leaving a much more compelling depiction of warfare, with no-holds-barred as the humans are out to pacify and even exterminate a life-form so foreign as to completely repulse the humans. For those with an aversion to insects, this movie may cause discomfort; for those who harbor a hatred for those six-legged denizens, this movie will provide the catharsis that will bring relief and joy as the humans systematically and mercilessly eradicate a menace.",Starship Troopers
58,dee.reid,"Mankind vs. giant bugs from outer space? Superiority, despite lack of knowledge of the enemy? Invincible suddenly becomes vincible in the face of danger? Does citizenship really offer everything that it p",10,27 March 2002,"The story of ""Starship Troopers"" is that it's set sometime in the future. The world has almost become a completely fascist military society in which everybody is trying to become a ""citizen"" of the Federation.  I think the message that the Federation is trying to get across to everyone is ""if you're not a citizen, you're not even a human being.""  I actually think that is a lower form of brainwashing by the government.  Little do the people who are new in the Federation know, is that an interstellar war is about to break out between humans and an alien race of insects that live on a not too distant planet.   I agree with several previous comments about this movie making fun of American patriotic war movies.  Being an American myself, I know I should probably disagree with all of this, but I don't because it's true but only to an extent.  ""Starship Troopers"" seems to me, to mirror what happened after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The bugs in this movie destroying a major Earth city reflects the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor.  After either event, people in both situations were becoming very eager to enlist in the armed forces to fight and get revenge for what the enemy had done to their beautiful communities.  This also brings me to another point.  Referring to the movie, how much did we really know about the bugs?  Why is it, that we would go to a foreign planet and fight an alien species that we hardly know anything about?  This says something about the military's role in these kind of situations.  This tells us about the importance of military intelligence in a war-time situation.  This is something that Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" will (hopefully) teach us about before sending our boys to a foreign land.  Another point I would like to bring to light, is the ""invincible"" attitude that the soldiers in the movie had towards the bugs.  It amazed me that Sergeant Zim(Clancy Brown) was able to give the recruits this image and then on the battlefield some soldiers went nuts and got themselves killed or chickened out at the last minute and got themselves killed.  It was not surprising though that the soldiers were easily overwhelmed by the monstrous bugs and that their large numbers were brought down drastically from 100,000+ to probably no more than 20,000 in one hour.  Of course, after the fiasco with first wave assault against the bugs, we got smarter and began to learn more about them and then learned the presence of a ""brain bug"" somewhere on the planet.  Almost like the Queen Alien from ""Aliens"".
I think that it is best to watch this movie with an open mind since everybody here seems to either love or hate this movie.  I loved ""Starship Troopers"" and it is Paul Verhoeven's third best film, with ""Total Recall"" being number two and ""RoboCop"" being number one. Rating: 10",Starship Troopers

It's got all of his usual calling cards, too, amped up to a feverish degree. Wanton, egregious violence, complete with Spaghetti-o gore chunks and rent limbs, tossed carelessly through the frame like so many croutons in a cooking program. Dialog so silly it would've been rejected from the Sunday funnies, delivered with all the passion and subtlety of a knot-laden tree trunk. Not-quite-there CG, featured prominently throughout, and blunt, cringe-worthy humor, smeared over every inter-scene segue. In many ways it's worthy of applause, if just for casting aside the rulebook and giving in to total, uninhibited overindulgence. It certainly isn't a boring picture (well, excluding maybe ten minutes in the early third act) so it's got that going for it, and the creepy-crawly enemy creatures are appropriately strong throughout - even when it would've been easy to turn them into mere cannon fodder for the final battle. The scale seems all wrong, though, with the lead constantly tripping over familiar faces despite a sizable chunk of humanity being involved in the military offensive, and I never really cared for a single one of them. Although it offers a few interesting underexplored subcurrents and an admirable knack for ballsy action, I usually found myself laughing at this one for all the wrong reasons.",Starship Troopers
61,smatysia,Good yarn in spite of the insertion of political commentary,8,18 July 2006,"Confession: I read Robert A. Heinlein's book ""Starship Troopers"" decades ago, so my memory of it may be a little bit fuzzy. At the time of its publication, RAH was writing good sci-fi adventure yarns for boys. But even in those, he slipped in some disguised political commentary. I don't recall any overtones of fascism in the book. What I got from it at the time was that a society under attack, at war, could not afford to be a wuss society, something the U.S. needs to internalize at this particular moment. I think that Paul Verhoeven is the one who has inserted this element into the story, most obviously the Nazi-looking greatcoat uniforms on the intelligence officers. As for the film, The CGI bugs were seamlessly inserted and looked quite real, at least on a TV size screen. It's gotta be hard to act when half of the stuff isn't really there.

62,jimbo-53-186511,Cheesy fun,6,22 February 2015,"In a futuristic world, Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and a select few college kids decide to become citizens in order to try to destroy a colony of bugs that are located on a planet far away.Anyone who is familiar with Paul Verhoeven will pretty much get what they expect here - there is lots of gore, a high body count, lots of gun fire and a bit of satire thrown in. All these elements are great and work well to make the film lots of fun and highly enjoyable. Before I continue on with the praise, I feel I need to draw your attention to some weaker aspects of the film....The start of the film was pretty cheesy; I wouldn't go as far as saying it was bad or boring, but it did feel a little pretentious and icky. As mentioned once the film gets going it is lots of fun, but the cut scenes between Richards and her commanding officer (sorry can't remember his name) were particularly dull and seemed to have only really been included to set up a crappy 'love interest' sub plot which was not only uninteresting and unwarranted, but also never went anywhere rendering a lot of their scenes pointless. Whilst I'm focusing on negatives, I think that the kindest way to describe Denise Richards acting would be to call it 'limited' - although she is easy on the eye which almost makes her poor acting forgivable.Back to the praise, if a mobile infantry spending 90 minutes battling a bunch of giant creatures sounds like your cup of tea then you'll certainly enjoy this film. Once the first 30 minutes are out of the way then there is never really a dull moment. Aside from Denise Richards, the acting performances are generally good with Clancy Brown being a notable highlight. This being a Verhoeven film will ultimately mean that it won't be for everyone and those that are squeamish are advised to approach this with caution. This is far from Verhoeven's best work (Robocop and Total Recall are both definitely superior to this film), but as mentioned it's enjoyable cheesy fun.",Starship Troopers
63,dwpollar,Splatter-fest for bug haters...,4,29 January 2006,"1st watched 1/29/2006, 4 out of 10(Dir-Paul Verhoeven): Splatter-fest for bug haters and those who like movies about killing bugs. But seriously, it was hard for me to get too serious about this unique sci-fi story about saving the human race from bugdum. I think that's why the Director, Paul verhoeven, played it kind of tongue-in-cheek at the beginning, but it eventually turned into an action gore-fest with the bugs killing, sucking brains, chopping limbs off, etc... The story began and ended being played out like a military recruiting commercial, where in this world, you only got considered a citizen with voting rights if you joined up. This was a world that had evolved to the point where it understood that violence and being the aggressor kept the species alive and that humans were not a whole lot different than bugs in this way. Supposedly, the only reason the bugs were fighting us was because we invaded their territory (doesn't this sound familiar, huh??). So, we enter a world that's always fighting but in this movie it just happens to be bugs. We follow the three main characters thru their military training, their battles etc... They are played by Casper Van Dien, the reluctant infantry man who just entered initially because a girl wanted him to. That girl, played by Denise Richards, becomes a top-notch flyer and Neil Patrick Harris is the nerdy one who enters intelligence to figure out how to fight the bugs. Despite the three of them going in different directions career-wise, they vow to stay friends forever. What a nice little setup for what lies ahead for them... battles against foes that they way under-estimate. These bugs are not only deadly fighters, but smart(which the humans didn't account for). The movie had an appealing approach, but it didn't seem to know whether to have humor or not. The humor came out pretty lame and the action became the main part of the movie, but once you've seen one human dismembered you really have seen it all. Despite the movie have an interesting and unique approach, in the end, the movie as a whole was not as appealing as it's parts.",Starship Troopers
64,davispittman,"Pretty good, with a few flaws",7,24 November 2015,"Starship Troopers (1997) is a fairly good action flick with good actors and cool science fiction visual effects. The effects was the best part of the film in my own opinion. The actors all did a good job, especially Casper Van Dien, he wasn't too bad to look at either. The movie's script and dialogue was alright, nothing to brag about crazily, but if you put in this movie, I doubt very much you're looking for good dialogue. As far as the action goes, which is most likely what you are looking for. The action was good, not great. I don't have many complaints for this one. One character dies that I was unhappy with, I wished they would've lived. Also, I didn't really care for Neil Patrick Harris's character, I would've been perfectly fine if they would've scratched him out of the movie. The creatures were pretty cool looking, especially the main leader of them all, that big blob thing. That was really cool to see. Overall I'll give starship troopers a 7/10.",Starship Troopers
65,hu675,Dazzling action packed science fiction film with elements of social satire.,8,2 May 2007,"In the future, where High School Students are encouraged to become ""Citizens"" by joining the army and serving their country. But little what they know, they are in Combat with futuristic insects.Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Showgirls, Total Recall) made an thrilling, action-adventure, science-fiction fantasy. Which is based on a novel by Robert A. Heinlen (The Puppet Masters). This big budget epic was an box office disappointment back in 1997, despite good reviews by the critics. The action-sequences are surprisingly sharp and graphic. The young cast are likable with strong support by Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside. This satirical, futuristic World War 2 gone gung-ho is bold, plenty of energy and comic-book style action.The original DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is a flip side disc. Side A is the movie with an optional commentary track by the director and screenwriter:Ed Neumeier (Robocop). Side B contains Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes footage, Original Theatrical Trailer and Screentests by the cast & effects footage. This was one of the most underrated films of 1997. Although it went on to be a Cult Favorite over the years. Probably the most memorable (although strange) thing in the picture that the Good Guys are portrayed as Fascists. This is not for the Sequeamish. Followed by a brief animated series and two direct to DVD films. (****/*****).",Starship Troopers
66,drystyx,Elements of RoboCop in all out no holds barred fun,9,11 December 2007,"This movie is a science fiction piece dealing with real ugly invaders from space, and these invaders are very powerful. They are giant insects who tear human bodies apart and are very hard to extinguish. Earthlings must deal with this problem. The correlations between this movie and ""Robo Cop"" are unmistakable. This could be called the ""Robo Cop"" of outer space movies. It is a non stop thrill ride with characters who are very likable and well defined. There isn't any weakness in script or in action. And the humor that is added in makes this very Robocoplike (is that a word?) We have a hero and heroine who do gain our trust and understanding. But we also care about the other characters, most of them a bit stock, but well explored, much like ""The Quick and the Dead"", which doesn't hesitate to poke fun at even the mightiest icons of our culture. All in all, this is action, humor, and a great ride.",Starship Troopers
67,fertilecelluloid,Mind-blowing sci-fi satire,9,18 February 2006,"It's not often that a mega-budget Hollywood blockbuster gets everything right. It's so rare I can't even recall another from the last twenty years. ""Starship Troppers"", based on the plodding but fascinating Robert Heinlein novel, is that rare exception, a totally engaging, entertaining, mind-blowing sci-fi spectacle that is also sharp, biting satire. It attacks American Imperialism while delivering nasty, gory, technically amazing set pieces featuring the slaughter of American soldiers by giant bugs. Yes, bugs! ""Robocop"" was director Paul Verhoeven's previous triumph, then, after ""Total Recall"", it seemed that he had lost his edge. Not so, of course, because ""Troopers"" manages to blend so many disparate ingredients so beautifully, it's mind-boggling how successful it it. The casting, though criticized by some, is perfect, and the black, vicious humor (with Verhoeven's trademark TV commercial parodies) is a great counterpoint to the grisly violence. The score by Basil Poledouris perfectly captures the jingoistic spirit of the satire and adds immense gravity to the complex, eye-popping action scenes. The film is a masterpiece. Not surprisingly, it bombed at the box office.",Starship Troopers
68,pensman,Starship Bloopers,2,4 April 2010,"No doubt Robert Heinlein would have hated the film. In the early days of SciFi, Starship Troopers was considered space opera: a western taking place in outer space, i.e., horse opera on other planets. And as pure shoot em up the movie succeeds. However, the director must have had every actor sign a non acting clause before being allowed to sign on as cast. I don't believe I have ever seen a film wherein there was not at least one character who regardless of the script was able to turn in a few minutes of actual acting. Not in this film. If anything could make it a cult classic it would be its perfection in not allowing anyone to turn in a performance. Watch if you must but only if you must. And the sequels were able to completely replicate the non-acting agreement.",Starship Troopers
69,dworldeater,Cool flick,8,13 April 2020,"Paul Verhoven was an immensely talented filmmaker that was great at blending big budget action with social commentary done in a sci fi setting. While his previous efforts RoboCop and Total Recall had it's share of tongue in cheek humor, Starship Troopers is more satirical in its approach then it's predecessors. The film shows the militaristic mindset with right wing propaganda and jingoism. Starship Troopers as a film is very campy and over the top, bordering on absurdity, but still conveys the message of the futility of war and pulls no punches in the grim reality of it's brutality. With a young cast, this has a 90210 in intergalactic war vibe. The youthful ensemble cast did really well actually and shows the loss of innocence throughout the course of the film as they are thrown in the meat grinder. This message is prevalent in the subtext, but is also a very entertaining film with lots of action, great f/x and lots of humor. But like the best science fiction it examines the human condition and where we can possibly go from here. Hollywood needs to stop remaking Paul Verhoven's films, so far there is no remake of this. Leave Starship Troopers alone and invest in another talented filmmaker who has some fresh and original ideas for a change.",Starship Troopers
70,caspian1978,The Future Axis of Evil?,6,28 July 2004,"Is it just me, or has the future of the world fallen to Axis leadership? It seems that the world has finally merged under one flag and government. While Star Trek was clearly a socialist society where nobody got paid but everybody worked together for a common good, Starship Troopers is clearly a future where Germany had won World War 2. The uniforms alone are right out of the Nazi war chest. No one is talking about there pay and you never see anybody pray to Allah! So, the future must be a Lutheran based, work for free, and kill you neighbor civilization. Straight out of school, the kids are happy as lambs to join the military. Wow! Not since Vietnam have the wealthy, good looking kids rushed into line to sign up for the war effort. The nudity in the movie is fun but wrong. Having the boys and girls showering together in the future seems fun, but adds to the question of what kind of civilization has the world become. Putting machine guns into the hands of young, 20 year-olds and younger to kill a bug like race of creatures far from home, adds another question to the mix. Overall, Starship Troopers is a fun roller coaster ride but can not in anyway be considered a great movie with other science fiction classics. The idea of a civilization with culture but with no ideas is unbelievable and cruel. It lowers the standards of the audience to believe in a possible future without any possibilities.",Starship Troopers

It still feels terribly relevant somehow for a weird sci fi movie about alien bugs.The biggest problem, I think, is how unfocused it is. Jumping all over the place to different characters and little infotainment pieces.

The acting is cheesy, the writing is at times stilted and awkward, the violence is so gleefully gory that it feels more akin to a low budget B-movie than a high budget blockbuster, but therein lies ""Starship Trooper's"" charm. This movie is not meant to be taken at face value. Everything you see is satire. ""Troopers"" tone is so genuinely gung-ho and pro-war that it feels much like a propaganda film made by both sides during the earlier days of World War II. The characters might be bullheaded, but they're always right; the mission that the Troopers are sent to carry out is undeniably just and true and right; and even when hundreds of thousands of soldiers die, these men never loose their courage in the face of their enemies.

It plays with many clichés, and also seems to have inspirations/homages to some popular flicks (TV shows from Robocop, starships from Star Wars, the trial from Superman II, the military training from Full Metal Jacket, Rambo being tortured...). It is like the opposite of Star Treck: instead of a world federation searching for peace and knowledge, it is a world federation looking for what all earth empires have been looking for throughout history. It may also be seen as a parody of many blockbusters' genres, such as high-school, war, and monster. Special effects worked well and the bugs and starships were nice. In this imagined 23rd century, while militarisation culture advances a lot (in a competent distopic exercise), USA-fashioned high schools are shown as the norm, and curiously sexism and shyness towards nudity seem to be both extinct. Although not a film to be taken seriously, I think some problems should be solved in order to have a higher level satire: some events appear suddenly without showing how they happened (what seems to be an edition problem); many reactions and acting are not minimally credible (such as characters being happy or relaxed after beloved people be murdered); gringoes do not fit to play Argentine characters; some action scenes just last too much.

77,framptonhollis,Satirical and Entertaining,9,16 November 2015,"Paul Verhoeven is, obviously, a magnificent filmmaker (even if he directed the universally hated ""Showgirls""), and he really knows how to make both a smart and fun movie!On the surface, it is an action-packed science fiction film. However, there is something bellow the surface, much smarter than your average sci-fi action flick. It is a wonderfully cynical and clever satirical masterpiece.In a style comparable to that of ""Robocop"", it uses fake news and propaganda clips to, essentially, explain to the audience certain plot points. But, it also increases the satirical element. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of satire BESIDES these news and propaganda sequences, but those specific scenes ARE the most noticeable satirical scenes. There's also a lot of satire in the training sequences. The satirical situations are really exaggerated, but still pretty clever in execution.Other than the satire, the film is genuinely fun and entertaining, although it is clear that the more satirical elements definitely increased the film's rating for me. While the special effects aren't the greatest (or anywhere near the greatest-at all), the film is still very well made. The sets may seem a little cheesy, but I, personally, really liked their look, so they weren't much of a problem in my opinion.The film also includes some surprisingly brutal sequences that highlight the horrors of war, which I genuinely didn't expect from this movie, especially since, most of the time, the film doesn't take itself seriously at all.While it isn't as openly satirical as Verhoeven's masterwork ""Robocop"", it still has tons of great, witty satire. Plus, it is a really entertaining action movie, so even if you aren't into satire, you still might really enjoy ""Starship Troopers""!Highly recommended.",Starship Troopers
78,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Realistic creature effects but has no charm,6,27 July 2012,"Director Paul Verhoeven is known for making some real dark satirical films that not only are new and different, but also leave a memorable impression. But like all human beings, there's always the possibility of messing up. This film in particular is not one of his greatest films. Somehow I just couldn't latch on to the characters that were involved with the plot. There was no charm with these actors.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) wants to join the Starship Troopers so he can become a citizen for his planet. And in this world, it is the only way one can become a citizen. The same goes for the characters of Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, and Neil Patrick Harris. That's fine and all that they have a main goal but the way they're persuaded to do it is another story. The new Earth is much weirder than you would expect.Each time the audience is placed in front of a screen, they are blasted with infomercials that deal with becoming a citizen by joining the Starship Troopers. Not to mention, even when the screen is speaking of death and showing the deaths to the public, the narrator still sounds happy. What is this? Are the authorities seriously trying to pull the wool over their eyes? Why does this seem like a dictatorship? Plus, these actors' characters follow these instructions like drones. Like it's no big deal that they're sacrificing their lives for the sake of the federation.The point of joining the military is to defend Earth of a ""Bug"" invasion. These bug creatures are really not what you would think of as a bug on earth but they are cool looking. They look like giant camouflage colored toothpick creatures that hunt in giant packs. There are a few other different bug aliens but the majority of them look all the same. And like any Verhoeven movie, the film displays the most atrocious gory death scenes. The ground was almost as wet as the floor in Dead Alive (1992); I couldn't believe the scenes I saw.Besides this though I could not find anything else to enjoy about it. The characters had no personalities and the acting was bland. It's not to say it wasn't good acting because they were obviously following the script but it wasn't fun; everyone acted the same. Basil Poledouris who made several scores to Verhoeven's movies didn't seem to really put anything into this one either. Nothing was fun with it either. That disappointed me too. Just the creature effects and bloodshed were the only standouts.For a science fiction film, it definitely gives the audience the creatures they want. However the acting, music and storyboard are so weird and bland that the ""bugs"" will be the only thing worth watching.",Starship Troopers
79,Kamurai25,"""A Bug's Life: In Space""",6,22 July 2020,"Good watch, will watch again, and can recommend, possible for a Bad Movie Night.I'll start by saying the movie definitely isn't good, it's infamous for being a bad movie that people still love. Granted it was 1997, but the cg effects were horrendous. The practicals actually weren't so bad, but there are very few shots to actually appreciate them. Again, 1997, this movie is weirdly dated with its perception of what the future would have been.For those that weren't familiar, this is most decidedly spurred by the popularity of Starcraft in the late 1990's, and that there weren't too many horde movies out there, at least not ones that weren't zombies. Clearly inspired by Starcraft's Zerg and Warhammer 40K's Tyranids, a bug by any other name.The world is amazingly crafted, and we only see the tip of the iceberg. There could have been an entire ""Star Trek"" style series set in that universe. For the parts written all the acting is sufficient, the cannon fodder acts at the level of characters that would be thrown away, the stars are clearly the stars, and there is some hierarchy in between.I honestly don't know how much better they could have casted this, but I imagine if the character work in the script had been better, then maybe they could have drawn a couple of names. There is a young Neil Patrick Harris, and Amy Smart, and Dina Myers was golden, but the other characters weren't exactly likable, and I can't figure out if it was the character writing or I just didn't like their faces. I get Denise Richards was a big deal, but her nose makes me remember the Grinch blooper where Carey bites off the mayor's nose, and even in ""Wild Things"" I thought Neve Campbell could do better.The large picture stuff is a good enough, and it's filled with enough action and well placed comedy that it'll get you through the movie.It's fun, please don't take it seriously.

81,Rob_Taylor,Denise Richards. I kept hoping she'd die in the movie.,9,18 December 2002,"There are lots of people that slated this movie for a number of reasons. Either it didn't follow Heinlein's book closely enough or the tone reminded them of fascist dictatorship and Nazism. I don't think these people really understood what Verhoeven tried to do, which was to point out the inherent flaws in such systems and try to get a little amusement value out of them.The ""news breaks"" are classic examples of just how propaganda worked in WWII, with one side villifying the other mercilessly. The woman laughing insanely while kids stomp on cockroaches cannot be taken to be serious in any way, unless you have no sense of humour, I guess.Likewise the uniforms in the film have been likened to Nazi uniforms. But a quick look around the uniforms of eastern European countries shows many similarities with those in the film. Are they all Nazi's?Getting back to the film.It's a war film set in space. What more needs be said. And a war film done infinitely better than John Woo's recent Windtalkers. The cast are reasonably unknown (at the time), with the exception of Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown and Neil Patrick Harris. And they all give good performances.....with one notable exception.Denise Richards. I kept hoping she'd die in the movie. Her acting expressions ranged from grinning fool to cheesy grin and all the way up to Cheshire Cat grin. I began to wonder if she'd had plastic surgery that had gone awry and fixed her features in permanent ""grin-mode"". I hated her so much in this movie that I won't watch her in anything else (luckily she hasn't done that much else).Patrick Muldoon plays the oily Zander pretty well. If it wasn't for Denise Richards I'd probably have found him more annoying, but next to her he was fine.Clancy Brown gets to ham it up nicely as Drill Sergeant Zim and gets most of the best comic lines and scenes, especially the knife throwing scene in boot camp.Michael Ironside reprises his usual tough guy role as Ltnt Rasczak with good effect. He also gets some of the good lines ""Pick up the General"" and deservedly so.Jake Busey (son of Gary) also does well here.This movie is pretty darn good. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close. If only Denise Richard's character had been ripped apart by the bugs....or better yet....she wasn't in it at all, that would have made it fantastic.It's worth noting that the score, done by Basil Poledouris, is fantastic and really enhances the mood of the film, particular in the action sequences. His offspring, Zoe Poledouris, sings a song or two in the movie which is not so good and best forgotten. But Basil's work is perfect again.Recommended as a good all-round action flick.",Starship Troopers
82,PredragReviews,'War makes fascists of us all.',9,11 May 2016,"""Starship Troopers"" is a glossy, tongue-in-cheek love triangle teen soap opera set in a future ultra-fascist military state during a war with an aggressive and repellent alien insect species. The action is over the top, extremely violent, yet it's so full of itself and it's own bombast, it's hard not to like. There is no deep message, no award winning acting. It is a propaganda movie of the highest cynicism, portraying war as all, and silently saying 'yeah, you love it, don't you?' The movie's plot also hints at a lot of ideas, obviously remnants of Heinlein's original book. The principal characters, all teenagers, live in an idyllic, yet fascist society that promotes violence as strength. That violence is directed outward, towards a common foe. The story follows the naive adolescents as they go through military training and then find themselves at war with giant bugs from space. Civil rights are granted only to those that survive their military service. The parallel with the insect society can't be a coincidence. As to Verhoeven's remarks about his ""satirizing"", I think that the Hollywood political correctness machine put the pressure on him. I mean, has he done anything significant since this movie? Though this movie doesn't delve deeply into the political concepts of the book, it still unfolds from those viewpoints and people who think it is deriding those concepts may be overreacting to the satirical moments in it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Starship Troopers
83,eric262003,Exhilarating Sci-Fi Adventure,8,1 March 2020,"Like a swarm of bees flying through the nearest honeycomb, sci-fi fans will truly enjoy ""Starship Troopers"". Under the direction of Paul Verhoeven, this bug stomping mission will likely have you excited over the graphic violence, epic battles and still manage to have deep-rooted philosophies if whether turning us into warriors is synonymous with us converting to fascism.In this epic battle for supremacy between fighters who live a world where fighting is mandatory and the only means of survival as they battle a slew of giant alien bug like creatures. We have an unpredictable world where anything is possible as we may choose to pick sides to see who will emerge victorious in the end. The men and women in spite of the situations where it can be grim still have time to maintain their immaculate figures even when the battles can become downright ugly. Though it was loosely adapted from a 1959 novel by Robert Heinlein, this movie feels like as though it was adapted from a graphic novel as the character performed here look the part. Then we have the giant insects, huge hideous monsters with tentacles that can penetrate through human flesh with ease. In addition to that they can summon giant asteroids from their home planet that could easily wipe out the human race. The background of the insects as to their Earthly invasion is never clear only just placed into the narrative to show how malevolent they can really be.The special effects like the bugs are truly out of this world, but the surprising trait that makes this movie stand out is the atmosphere is the tone. Most science-fiction movies tend to have that cliched world where the atmosphere is dark, cynical, and the world seems to be overly dependent on computers and robotic apparatuses. Even the more chipper science-fiction movies like ""Star Wars"" has quite an ascetic universe.At least Verhoeven tries to show that our future which may be bombarded with robots, computers and technological devices, the human race is still a significant part of our ever-growing planet and the human race isn't devolving and the characters are cheery and hopeful to carry on for another thousand years. Even through all the warring moments in the movie which includes the newsreels that may explain grim dark pieces of news while still taking matters in a laid-back manner. Their delivery of lines are utilized with a sardonic witty banter that shows through all the chaotic scenes, we can have some humour to make light of the situation even taking jabs at the fighters and the government that runs the world.At first glance, the movie looks like it was adapted from a graphic novel where the opening scenes focus primarily on the training sessions that lead up to the battle scenes. It's also complimented by a myriad of WWII propaganda promoting people to take part in the training regiments that will give them the strength and confidence needed to take down the enemy. Only difference, no soldier from WWII got their brains sucked out of their skulls from giant bugs.Though it may not have high-prolific stars in their cast, the effort put into their performance deserves an applause. Casper Van Dien lead the cast as rich kid Johnny Rico from Buenos Aires, Argentina (not to play race politics, he doesn't Latino in the slightest). Johnny's love interest Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) has aspirations of piloting her own plane, which inspires Johnny to join the infantry to impress her. It seems that issues relating to gender and race have been altered as men and women are not segregated from anything, even taking showers together in the buff. Johnny's world gets a lot more interesting as he's reunited with a former girlfriend named Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) and an instructor who's fair but firm Lt. Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside). The story may be simplistic on paper, but once the bugs start killing, the body count is overwhelming.The film succeeds in keeping it all R-rated and never hints at the film being made for the younger age demographic. Sure the images are impressive, though it may be recommended that if can't handle the grotesque dissections and the gooey green slime splattering on the soldiers, then maybe this movie may not be for you. Your stomach will never feel the same after looking at the carnage that's shown to you in this movie. It's an understatement to say that these bugs aren't ready for battle, they're claws can do severe damage that doesn't just kill, but mutilate.Once it gears off from a sci-fi adventure to a war film, it goes off kilter a bit. It never loses interest, There's a fascinating scene where the creepy crawlers enter a fortress where the troopers retreat. When the soldiers see the swarm, it pay a bit of an homage from the siege at the Alamo, only more macabre.It's refreshing that the future depicted in ""Starship Troopers"" has technological devices not as advanced like other sci-fi films. Sure the soldiers can fly to other galaxies with ease, but in battle they are still using warfare that seems still stuck in the 1990's. In mean no chemical or nuclear advances? Oh well best of luck to them.",Starship Troopers
84,pc95,Good Film and Great Fun,8,2 February 2006,"Borrowing heavily from better science fiction and action films this movie is actually a lot of fun....the acting is sometimes spotty and there aren't any real ""A"" list type stars or performances but the cast pulls together for the most part and that's kind of the point as its a movie about the group or the team. Casper Van Dien is basically a younger Emilio Estevez - and OK. Doogie's back with a smaller supporting role. Jake Busey actually is one of the better acts along with Dina Meyer. Patrick Muldoon and Denise Richards are definitely attractive and healthy looking but a bit back seat to some of the other performances. Then you have Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown for some big-guns support. So you have the most well known actors in light supporting roles - what they're best. So while there isn't any real strong performances there certainly is a cohesive feeling. The effects are actually pretty well done too, and the storyline with sort of the 40's type newsreels was campy and cheesy but intended so. Its a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously, but makes an effort to give a real show - and several excellent one-liners. The end product is great fun and definitely cheesy with some very good effects and great looking actors who, well try their best. Worth watching or owning.",Starship Troopers
85,philip_vanderveken,Barbie vs. Alien,5,11 July 2005,"I'm normally not a fan of Sci-Fi movies, but because so many people have made such a fuss about this one, I really wanted to see it. OK, not everything that I heard about the movie made me look forward to it, but there were some very nice comments as well. In the end I decided that I wanted to see it for myself, in order to form my own opinion about it.""Starship Troopers"" is situated in the future (distant or near I don't know), where high school kids are encouraged to become citizens by joining the military instead of staying inferior civilians. Johnny Rico joins the infantry, not because he fully believes that this is the best thing to do, but because his girlfriend already has enlisted in the army and he doesn't want to leave her behind. Their training is tough, but nothing can prepare them for what they are about to witness: a full scale war with gigantic and ferocious aliens that want to destroy the human race...If this movie had been written and/or directed by a German, everybody would have called him a neo-Nazi or at least a man with fascist believes. Not only does it use the idea of the übermenschen (people who are better persons because they belong to a certain race), the military is also clearly inspired by the German fascist ideology. You can see it in the organization, but also in the uniforms. There can absolutely be no doubt where the idea for those costumes came from as it is close to identical in every detail. But the director is Dutch and the writer is an American, so no-body seems to have a problem with that anymore. Now they say that it is an excellent way of showing a totalitarian, right-wing ideology. Can someone please tell me what the difference with Nazism is then?Another thing that bothered me was that everybody in this movie seemed to be perfect Barbie dolls. Every main character in it could at least apply for the title of 'Miss or Mister Machine Gun' with the perfect toothpaste smile and bright blue eyes. Imperfection doesn't exist, they are all smart and beautiful and eager to kill everything and everybody that doesn't follow the rules of the regime.Still, I must admit that not everything about this movie was bad. The special effects for instance were very nice. I admit that I looked with a lot of interest to all those ants, dun beetles and other alien life forms which didn't have to look human for once. They all looked mean and ferocious and were in my opinion the best thing this movie had to offer. But was that enough to save the movie? Certainly not. A movie with such a bad story and mediocre acting (at best), which so heavily relies on gore and special effects to save it, certainly doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece. I give it a rating between 4.5/10 and 5/10, only because of the magnificent special effects.",Starship Troopers
86,elliotjeory,I came for the aliens,7,28 June 2020,"Terrible corny actors but awesome special effects, at least at the time. Those bugs were terrifying as a kid and I think the film is aimed at teenagers but it's still an enjoyable sci-fi film and a remake would be awesome.",Starship Troopers
87,Luigi Di Pilla,Average Sci-Fi,4,21 May 2006,I saw Starship Troopers the first time with my friends in the theaters when it came out. Then I decided to buy it on DVD because of the great special effects of the insects and the combats. But after I watched it again and again I have to admit that the bum-bum on the insects until they have been killed bored me more and more. You know what I mean? The cinematography was very fine but the running time therefore was too long. Especially the first half was too slow paced with love stories. I think they wanted just present one by one the main characters of this average sci-fi. The story is empty without any emotions and it works perhaps more for teenagers. I have a great suspect that this one was promoted by the US army. If you enjoyed it you may like the better adventure movie THE MUMMY or EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS with similar special effects. Rating: 4/10. Too overrated on this site.,Starship Troopers
88,mjw2305,Well Executed,8,4 February 2005,"Starship Troopers, Kinda sounds like a kids film doesn't it, Well it's not! It's a pretty cool Sci/Fi Action movie, where Earth is at war with Giant Alien Bugs from across the Galaxy. Casper Van Dien takes the lead with support from Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey and many others.There is no Character depth, really basic plot, and a pretty Cheesy Script, so why is it that the characters are likable, the plot is good to watch and the script works? Put simply, it had to be done this way, take an idea like this too seriously and you'll achieve nothing. Starship Troopers sets out to be exactly what it is, All Action, great effects and fun to watch.If your after a movie that is just pure escapism, with some great violence, action and of course big Bugs, you won't find a better movie than this one.B-Movie Style, without the B-Movie Flaws 8/10",Starship Troopers
89,sme_no_densetsu,Technologically impressive but I'm not sold on the satire,7,22 August 2016,"On the surface, ""Starship Troopers"" is a standard sci-fi actioner about a group of soldiers sent to battle giant bugs on a distant planet. However, the movie also functions as a satire on fascism & militarism. While the intent of the filmmakers was admirable, the result didn't completely hit the mark.The first stumbling block is the cast. Featuring the likes of Denise Richards, Casper Van Dien & Patrick Muldoon, the emphasis is clearly more on looks than on acting ability. While I can understand that this supports the movie's propagandistic approach, it's still no excuse for having to endure their wooden acting. On the bright side, Dina Meyer is a capable lead and there's some characteristically strong support from Michael Ironside & Clancy Brown.The story isn't without its flaws, either. The characters' romantic entanglements wouldn't be out of place in a soap opera. With the cardboard cutout characters, this aspect of the story holds very little interest for me. The action-oriented parts of the film are well executed but the supposedly ironic glorification of war doesn't quite achieve its goal because of so many other movies that have unironically done the exact same thing.As for the good, the Oscar nominated special effects have held up surprisingly well and are still pretty impressive most of the time. Paul Verhoeven's past work proved him to be a talented director (especially of sci-fi) but its still surprising how successfully he got his actors involved in the action in such an effects heavy movie. Overall, the presentation is slick almost to the point of soullessness but the movie does definitely look good.Ultimately, your reception of ""Starship Troopers"" will probably depend on whether or not the satiric elements work for you or if all you really want is to simply enjoy soldiers fighting giant bugs (with a little T&A thrown in for good measure). I give Verhoeven credit for crafting a movie that's deeper than it initially appears even though the execution doesn't always live up to his lofty vision.",Starship Troopers
90,BrandtSponseller,"The negative buzz kept me from watching this film for awhile, but I'm glad I've seen it now!",10,22 January 2005,"Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm, largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insect-like creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.Starship Troopers is both a tongue-in-cheek satire of society and an intense sci-fi/action/war film filled with horror-like insect monsters and a healthy dose of graphic gore. That's a genre combination that will not please all viewers, especially if the tongue-in-cheek humor goes over their heads. For those more in tune with the genre melding, Starship Troopers promises a quick, edge-of-your-seat ride from the first moments to the last.The film can be looked at in three sections, with slight crossovers from one section to another. The first is focused on the social satire. The cultural differences of the future are given in mostly indirectly, and occasionally, the point is what hasn't changed, or perhaps what is currently (per the film's setting) in vogue as a retro element. The second and third sections could be seen as a sci-fi Platoon (1986), with the second section focused on military basic training and the third focused on wartime. Like Platoon, the basic training scenes show order and a clear sense of purpose, while the wartime scenes show comparative chaos.That the film could be compared to something like Platoon shows that although director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Edward Neumeier are aware that the material could easily be seen as absurd, they have the chops to make it believable and suspenseful at the same time.This is not to say that Starship Troopers is a rip-off of any other movie. The film-making here is highly original, and we could almost see the entire film as a computer-based CNN-styled collection of wartime newsreels of the future. It remains quick, witty and intense throughout. My only regret is that they didn't incorporate Yes' song Starship Troopers in the score somehow.",Starship Troopers
91,RNMorton,I hate spiders,8,21 January 2017,"Which might be just right if I were signing up for this inter-galactic war, because the bad guys are some of the meanest arachnids you've ever seen. The fun part of this movie is that while on the surface it is anti-alien, it is also a campy commentary on the sort of idiot blockheads who get turned on by war. So there are a few twists to this that make it a little hard to tell where the makers were really going, just the same it is rewatchable and features a number of fine performances by the young leads (like Meyers!) as well as some fun turns by Ironside and Brown. And while I'm at it I'll add this last line just to make it to ten.",Starship Troopers
92,lambiepie-2,Gosh-awful.,6,2 July 2003,"No matter how much one wants to look below the surface for a good film here, the bottom line is it came out gosh-awful.I say this because ""Starship Troopers"" had so much potential for it going in! A good director, a good book its based off, an attractive cast, a wonderful message. All blown to bits like the giant insects.I just didn't care. I was rooting for the insects at one point for the actors were annoying. There is action, but I am tired of 'acting and story' being compromised for 'action'. Understand, I LOVE action. I love seeing things being blown up and being blown up real good. But I also like story, characters I give a hoot about, I like good pacing, direction not a lot of plot holes and decent special effects. At points you can see where the filmmakers went to other popular sci-fi films to help them out of their mess. They DIDN'T need to! That's why this film is awful, that's why it doesn't work.This film is bad on so many levels. Not ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" bad...but bad because here you have SO much going for it and it fails miserably on everything its trying to get across. Even at blowing things up..and blowing them up real good.Pass on this unless you're severely bed ridden and all other sci-fi films ever made in the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Asia you've seen at least twenty times before.

93,MiketheWhistle,"Very deep meaning, if you think",10,9 August 2019,"I've never read the book and don't plan to, but there is so much in this movie it must be a good read. It kinda of reminds me of high school english class where we'd read and dig into the story. You have the military service being required to become a citizen which creates an interesting thought process for those in the US where there is no longer a draft. How would the US be different if one had to serve to become a citizen? I enlisted at 17 because I wanted to serve my country as my father, and his father, and my mother's father, etc had all done (including my Aunt who had the highest rank as a nurse). Then there's the combat and training that serves to create unbreakable bonds between the mobile infantry which I will tell you is exactly how it really is. There's the high school teacher who served and asks provoking questions with a desired effect or was it the desired effect? Then you have the pilots with one who feels he's better than the MI, and that too is generally true. Then there's the guy who showed leadership, made a fatal mistake, then showed grit above and beyond.
This may seem like just some cult sci-fi, and it probably deserves a cult following, but it is well worth watching.",Starship Troopers
94,sarastro7,One of the best sci-fi movies ever made,10,11 September 2006,"Starship Troopers is one of my absolute favorite sci-fi movies ever, and I also consider it vastly, vastly underrated. I'm writing this comment because I have just read the original Heinlein novel. In this connection, I also watched the movie again (for the umpteenth time). I enjoyed the book, but mostly because of how I could relate it to the film. Of course, the film takes it in a totally different direction, but I was surprised by how many details from the book are included in the film (the brain-bug, for instance, though it doesn't suck people's brains out in the book). Lots of stuff in the film, including some dialog, actually comes straight from the novel, and except for the overall angle, I think the film is actually a very valid adaptation of the book.Let's face it: some things in the book just don't work. There are no real love interests in the book (Rico does join up to impress Carmen, but he never has a relationship with her, or any other girl). There's no proper plot. The whole point of the book is to show the military training and endorse a social system of insane militarism. I don't know if Heinlein was serious in espousing such a system, but those Heinlein fans who like the book and dislike the movie seem to think so. If true, the novel is actually a Utopian novel, describing Heinlein's personal perfect society. A military dictatorship where you are only allowed to vote if you have gone through rigorous military service - a sure way for the system to make sure the few voters are indoctrinated to vote for leaders that will maintain that system! Heinlein reveals a view of human nature that is incredibly cynical, and says that only an iron fist society which keeps the barbaric human propensities sharply in check can possibly result in something resembling civilization. Humans must be coerced into believing in something bigger than themselves, and any ""softer"" society like for instance what we have today is ridiculously naive and doomed to failure. Well, we'll see about that.Also, in the book there is a sharp separation between the sexes. Although the best pilots are women, a spaceship is divided into two parts, a male and female, and (except for some top officers) they aren't allowed to mix. In fact, there are armed guards at the doors between the sections! This is crazy.I think Verhoeven's movie is brilliant. I think he made all the right choices in the adaptation of the novel, and the movie is *incredibly* enjoyable to me. Enormously funny, enormously satirical, enormously cool, enormously good-looking; in short, an enormous success. It is a movie whose star will rise to ever higher levels as time goes by. Of that I have no doubt.",Starship Troopers
95,mentalcritic,Verhoeven + Neumeier + Poledouris + Vacano = Pure Genius,10,11 September 2000,"Paul Verhoeven's greatest talent seems to be helming films that the US audiences want to vilify because they don't understand what the film is about. Hollow Man painted an amusing picture of what happens to those with subjective morals when the fear that constitutes their only restraint is taken away. Robocop presented a far more compelling version of the Christ theme than the Gospels (or slop like The Matrix, for instance). So Starship Troopers presents us with a chilling portrait of what we can expect our society to turn into if the education system we currently have is allowed to remain unchanged for long enough. Think about it for a second. In the world of Starship Troopers, Flores is ridiculed for expressing a difference of opinion in the classroom. As a child, I was subjected to treatments that are the equivalent of electrocuting your dog when he urinates on the carpet simply because school was too boring for me. It was little wonder that I found the journey of four high schoolers who grow up to be little fascists to be so fascinating and compelling. If Paul and Ed were any less subtle about this plot point, they would have put up those Education Department posters that say things like ""When I grow up, I want to be..."" everywhere. Only, given that this is a critique of our current Ritalin-crazed Western society, many of them would say things like ""When I grow up, I want to abuse children"" or ""When I grow up, I want to be Adolf Hitler"".This, friends, and neighbours, is the whole point of Starship Troopers. We are introduced to a heirachial insect society whose only fault is that they make no apologies for their natural killing instinct, then we throw them against a humanity that has become a globalised version of the facism we call child psychology today. And then we are left asking who are the good guys... humanity sure ain't them.Like most of Paul Verhoeven's American films, Starship Troopers seperates the intellectual men from the retards. Defensive idiots who cannot understand what the film is pointing out to them scream that it is vapid nonsense. Those of us who have been abused as children and can see the facistic direction Western education is taking as a result, however, find this film and others like it to be strangely prophetic. And if you're thinking that the future depicted in Starship Troopers will never happen, consider the fact that the Media-Net interruptions to the film (as well as much of the film itself) are almost exact copies of Western World War II propaganda films.I gave this film nine out of ten. The storyline could have been tighter, and the overall mood could have been a little more serious, but those are the only faults. The music from both Poledorises (Basil, and his daughter Zoe during the dance scene) is worthy of that much by itself.",Starship Troopers
96,mentalcritic,Separates the men from the boys in intelligent discourse...,10,8 June 2004,"I just read part of one comment in which the user, obviously not familiar with irony or subtlety, spends the better part of his comment telling us how impossible it is for a meteor to get halfway across the galaxy to hit a planet. We know this. That's the point. How ironic that a mere few years later, a similar disastrous event would prompt similar finger-pointing. It is hard not to see Ed Neumeier as a prophet after George Dubya hit Afghanistan with everything he had, ignoring the people who asked why he did so when the Bin Laden family is mostly in Saudi Arabia.You can stop reading now if you want to keep the story a surprise.But apparently, the media's ability to make people blame the wrong people for a heinous attack (or possible natural disaster as the case may be in this film) is not the only thing Americans don't get. Carmen gets a thorough vilification from audiences just for having the nerve to make a choice. Through connection, when Dizzy Flores dies, it is often said that the wrong girl died. Well yeah, that's war, friends. The wrong people die all the time in war.However, I don't necessarily feel that the film reaches the same dizzy heights as RoboCop did. All the right elements were in place, but there was something lacking in StarShip Troopers. Part of it is the money quotient. On RoboCop, money was very tight, and a lot of problems had to be solved creatively rather than by washing them away with the money hose. On StarShip Troopers, the money flowed freely, allowing the crew to throw in all the effects shots they wanted. Unlike some recent science fiction films I won't mention here, they didn't totally rely on the effects to carry the film.However, the story is simply too straightforward in structure to stand out. Contrasted with RoboCop or Total Recall, it just doesn't involve the higher processes of the brain at all. Whereas Total Recall managed to surprise the viewer in spite of the plot being given away well in advance by two distinct characters, StarShip Troopers has no real surprises, or even turns. It is literally a straight line from beginning to end. Given that the story is so linear, I think it says a lot about American audiences that they still didn't get that this was a satire.I've also read a previous comment that the film is a failure because it doesn't go out of its way to let the audience know it is a satire. I sure hope I never have that guy doing my taxes or editing my work. Like This Is Spinal Tap, one of the principal joys of StarShip Troopers is that it rewards the intelligent viewer by letting them work out that it is satire on their own. This is a primary ingredient in all of the best satires. At some point, the light goes on in the viewer's mind and they feel good about themselves because they didn't need any help to work out that it shouldn't be taken at face value. That is, of course, unless they're too stupid, or too Americanised.In all, I gave StarShip Troopers a 10. That is a score that any film which cons an audience into thinking a man like Paul Verhoeven would make a Nazi propaganda film deserves.",Starship Troopers
97,ElijahCSkuggs,Don't Miss Denise Richards' Award Winning Role As Captain Ibanez,10,30 June 2007,"Starship Trooper is without a doubt one of the most under-rated war movies ever made. In 1997 I turned 17 and this was the first Rated R flick I ever saw in the theaters. And boy howdy, this was one hell of a blast to watch. From the over-the-top violence and acting, to the sex scene and nudity. This could be the perfect first R rating outing for any 17 year old male.The story is about a group of young hopefuls trying out their future by joining with the Federal Armed Servies. This isn't any war, this war is against the Arachnid Bugs of Klendathu. They come in all shapes and sizes from flying bugs to gigantic lava spewing behemoths. The Earthlings are coming to Klendathu and the Bugs are ready! First off, this movie is pure popcorn movie awesomeness. It's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, with awesome battles, great special effects and a great story. With these attributes it gives Starship Troopers incredible replay value. If you're a fan of science fiction/action flicks this should definitely be apart of your movie collection.",Starship Troopers

99,hnt_dnl,Totally entertaining and re-watchable satire,10,21 May 2011,"Directed by Paul Verhoeven, STARSHIP TROOPERS (1997) is an anomaly of a film, but one of my favorites from the 1990s. It shouldn't be as good as it is. But it really is GOOD! Lacking the character depth or sophistication of Verhoeven's earlier sci-fi classics ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", I actually think that this movie is Verhoeven's most FUN movie! The characters are secondary. The real star is the satire, and this movie is mired in it!A by-the-numbers rah rah tale that follows bright-eyed, well- meaning, optimistic youth Johnny Rico (well-played by engaging newcomer Casper Van Dien) from high school to boot camp to war (mobile infantry), this movie has a timeless appeal that frankly very few movies of it's type can enjoy. It has a lot of action, humor, and believe it or not, drama and heart. Similar to ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", this movie is very satirical and makes not-so-subtle references to it's subject matter, in this case...WAR! The characters are sounding boards to showcase both sides of war sentiments (mostly the pro side). But ""Troopers"" still follows the trajectory of it's more polished predecessors in that it is a simple linear tale of the main character who must fight to attain his own individuality, in this case the young inexperienced boy who goes to war and becomes a man in the process discovering who he is and what he was born to do. By the end of the movie, Johnny Rico is a lean, mean, fighting machine and a strong leader.The future angle is a major reason I still love this movie to this day. This movie has a futuristic look that that is visually appealing to me, mainly because Verhoeven smartly avoids the pitfalls of most movies by not focusing so much on the technology itself and presents a feasible representation of what the future could be. Also, he does give the characters just enough personality and the dialogue, while simple, contains a lot of humor and bite. And the futuristic spaceship and mutant bug effects still look eye-popping and convincing, especially given when the movie came out. The sets and costumes kind of remind me of ""Star Trek (the original series)"" at times, and that is one of my favorite shows of all time!I also liked how the movie tweaks the usual ""girl waiting back at home"" and instead opts to have her be part of the action. Johnny's girl Carmen (played by the beautiful Denise Richards) also joins the service, but ends up as a flight officer and eventually dumps Rico to go career. Waiting in the wings for Johnny is Dizzy (played with confidence and energy by the gorgeous Dina Meyer), who enlists herself and gets assigned to Rico's marine platoon in order to stay close to him. Carmen is Rico's ideal girl who doesn't appreciate him enough, while Dizzy is the heart-of-gold woman who stands by him and brings out the best in him. I much prefer Johnny-Dizzy to Johnny-Carmen!Another big bonus for me with this movie is a supporting cast, which includes a pair of legendary screen baddies who are part of the good guys in this one! Yet they get to retain their tough guy attributes playing hardened, war-savvy soldiers. Clancy Brown (famous as the baddie in both ""Highlander"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"") plays Rico and Dizzy's tough-as-nails drill instructor and Michael Ironside (as the right-hand bad guy from Verhoeven's future tale ""Total Recall"") plays their disabled former high school teacher who returns to service as their company commander when they must go into battle. I also enjoyed the work of Rico and Dizzy's fellow boot camp marines played by Jake Busey, Blake Lindsley, Eric Bruskotter, Anthony Ruivivar.One main criticism of this movie is that it's too campy. But I think that misses the point. Honestly, I've seen way worse: ""Troopers"" came out the same year as ""Batman and Robin"" (Now THAT was a totally campy movie!). The actors might not be the best in the world, but I still think they did a great job selling themselves in their respective roles. Even the ""serious"" moments don't drag the movie down for me, and I found much of it to be involving and well played, like Carmen's breakup video to Johnny, the drill instructor and company commander tearing up Johnny's separation papers, and pretty much all the Johnny-Dizzy moments as they are a couple worth rooting for! Meyer especially was convincing in relaying Dizzy's deep feelings for Johnny.In summary, STARSHIP TROOPERS is a fun, fast-paced adventure story with an old-fashioned appeal that makes it worth watching...and re- watching!",Starship Troopers
100,sharky_55,Mission Accomplished,7,8 September 2016,"For some, Starship Troops is a wicked satire. For others, it is more akin to a wet dream. The world of the 23rd century is one where Ameri-uh I mean, Planet Earth, has mastered many things, including space travel, but has yet to nail down the art of international (interstellar, in this case) relations. There is a vague notion that the bugs might not be so hostile if the humans had not invaded their territory in the first place, but who wants to hear about that? The time for negotiations is over, and war beckons. At least that is what the military recruiters tell to the fresh-faced high schoolers. The strange thing is we can't even accuse the film of being prophetic. How long have we lived in a world where American soldiers can witness their buddy's head being blown off but be denied a drop of alcohol? Then again, not even this, released in 1997, could have predicted the frenzy of post 9/11. And so it rolls on and on. There is always another enemy of the country. Yesterday Iraq, today teenagers hurtling over to ISIS, and tomorrow, space bugs. Starship Troopers sees the eventuality of this scenario. The military presence has naturally spread to all other areas of the society, so it is not merely a service on behalf of your country, but also the first step in further excellence in other careers and pursuits (including the brief and disturbing mention of birth now being strictly regulated). Public executions grab all the ratings, and the general morale is that the only good bug is a dead bug. They've even got the kids in on it. Verhoeven intersperses his scenes with propaganda blaring itself at the imaginary audience, that somehow underhandedly manages to draw your interest without seeming naggy. But that is the essence of effective propaganda. It uses the repeated phrase ""Would you like to know more?"", the 23rd century's ""WE WANT YOU"" in big bold letters. These also double as well needed exposition, but it fits well in this frantic, post- information age. We get all the usual brash military types, and the training scenes are the familiar clash of egos that are the calm before the storm. Verhoeven turns up the dial to eleven as they get into the thick of all things action; the film relishes in every splat of alien flesh and blood, in frenetic B-movie style, and the tone see-saws deliberately between the juvenile ecstasy of war (see how their celebrations are like high-schoolers after winning a football match) and the trauma of loss. One minute they are brightly splattered in green and red, the next blood, the camera haphazardly snap-zooming into Rico's shocked expression and then pulling away from the bird's eye view. It's B- movie kitsch, and in the best way. It's so ironically engrossing we almost forget to laugh at the fact that the helmets leave half the face bare and unprotected anyway. The film effortlessly bounces from the overt terrors of war to that joyful feeling of excitement - they go from mourning Diz to hurtling back into the bug hell-hole in a split second, once again full of boyish bravado (even more literally this time, with another fresh band of kid soldiers). And there's something to grin about when the whole squad erupts into cheers at Carl's emphatic declaration. What is even more desirable than absolute annihilation of the enemy? Having them alive and fearing you, of course. It's an endless stroking of the ego. If the film does have weaknesses it manifests in Verhoeven being unable to disguise his irregular jabs at the content. It was of course a completely straight story from Robert Heinlein, so can we blame him for being unable to resist such opportunity? But the jabs are noticeable, unsubtle material that seems to fit into this world, but end up being delivered mechanically. Sure, we laugh when one recruit proclaims that it would cost an arm and a leg to study at Harvard, and thus he is joining infantry to pay for it, but we get the joke a little too quickly, and the fact exists if only to prop the one-liner up. We also snicker when a veteran proudly claims he is the man he is today because of his service, and then the camera reveals his three missing limbs, but it's such low hanging fruit it almost doesn't count. And the film is lengthy too, and not in the epic sense. There are stretches of fuzzy action that gradually slip into the same territory that Verhoeven seeks to mock. But I suppose he has set up the perfect defense. In poking fun he seeks to outdo what Hollywood could ever dream of, and to do so he has to tip-toe the line ever so slightly.",Starship Troopers
101,vip_ebriega,A second look: STARSHIP TROOPERS.,10,9 October 2008,"Review summary: The best in acquired taste. Thrilling, bloody, funny and wildly satirical. When I first saw STARSHIP TROOPERS (due to my curiosity when I saw bits of it when I was a kid), I praised the film but didn't nearly treasure it. I praised the film's wonderful use of special effects and the action scenes which really kicks into high gear. However, I did have a lot to complain about the excessive gore and graphic violence, not to mention this film feels like it would appeal more to 9-year olds and their life-long dream of kicking aliens' butt. But when I watched STARSHIP TROOPERS again last night, I found myself not just liking it as I did, but liking it even more. My jaws almost still dropped to the ground, but like it or not, this was the kind of film Paul Verhoeven wanted to make: a broad, ultra-violent satire of old gung-ho war propaganda, fascistic military actions and other modern cultural references (not to mention promoting violence as the ultimate tool for peace!). But best of all, it's simply one big bug movie and it delivers exactly what to expect: Big bugs that really rip you apart. This may be the best bug movie ever at the time. Would you like to know more? Like most of his films, Verhoeven presses the no-shame button without even the thought of apology. Not everyone will like what he's doing, but if you know exactly what to expect from the shameless Dutch director, STARSHIP TROOPERS is an acquired taste at best. Call it a guilty pleasure, but I know no guilt on this one. It isn't great motion picture (probably not one of the very best science-fiction adventures either), but one thing about the film is that it doesn't really aim for something so high. Like STAR WARS in 1977, this film never really intended to be a ""great"" movie in the first place; All it wanted was to make a movie about fascist square-jawed guys and muscular babes arming themselves with rifles and staving off a menagerie of outrageous out-of-this-world alien bugs, from mindless blood-hungry arachnid warriors to giant stag beetles that set fire on anything it catches. Not to mention an ugly brain bug that sucks the brains out of human heads like a kid sipping lemonade from a straw.Other than that, cultural and political references abound including a couple of short, hilarious advertisements that encourages citizens (Pardon me, civilians!) to join the Federation army. If you remember Verhoeven's ROBOCOP, you might easily be reminded of the hilarious commercials (including one where a scheduled execution of a guilty criminal is aired live on cable) and a dark, sadistic sense of humor. Not everyone will find his films a pleasure, STARSHIP TROOPERS mostly. There's enough blood and graphic violence here to fill a bathtub (No! Make that 10 bathtubs!) of blood and corpses. The actors, including relatively unknown Casper van Dien as gung-ho hero Johnny Rico, Dina Meyer as a steamy female fighter, Denise Richards as a tenacious ship pilot, Niel Patrick Harris as an ever-watchable psychic military scientist and Michael Ironside as a hard-ass heroic commander make a fine screen presence, albeit overshadowed by the film's greater aspects. The first half is heavily devoted to these characters and, save Ironside's professional commanding presence, none of them really have any higher intention than to look good. There's a love triangle (or love square) going on between the adolescent characters that does provide some dignity among the characters though. Still, what the heck? The last thing you want a giant all-out-war against giant bugs is a soap opera.Very few errors almost never harms STARSHIP TROOPERS as a wild and wacky thrill-ride. I knew this when I first saw the film back then, but re-watching it, with all the right expectations laid on the table, I was able to truly appreciate the film for all its being. Verhoeven, with an odd taste that he might have, never took the film too seriously. Somewhere throughout the picture, you could swear Verhoeven had a silly little grin on his face every time a soldier gets sliced in half, bitten apart or has his head sliced off by his Klendathu behemoths. Like the 9-year old that probably inspired Robert A. Heinlein to right a book about Federation soldiers-vs.-alien arachnids, Verhoeven has a lot of fun with his little toys. The great thing about it is we too get to play along. STARSHIP TROOPERS has to be the best guilty pleasure since INDEPENDENCE DAY. Come on! Any movie that encourages you to do ""your part"" on the war against alien bugs by stepping on cockroaches with a silly grin on your face has to be fun, right? Additional Note: I misinterpreted the satire when I first saw this movie. Usually, I really don't dig in to a film's message too deeply. Anyway, I have made the necessary corrections. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Starship Troopers
102,fmarkland32,Bug Killers,10,5 August 2020,"Johnny Rico (Van Dien) decides to become a citizen and join the Infantry after his high school sweetheart Carmen (Richards) decides to go career as a pilot, of course war with insects breaks out and all of a sudden Johnny rises through the ranks and realizes why he fights in this absolute 90s classic. Starship Troopers is one of those movies that can be enjoyed on a simple action level, but also enjoyed as being sort of disturbing, while the film is in fact a treat for the senses, it's honestly the subtlety that makes Starship Troopers so great. For instance, there is no question our protagonist joins for the wrong reasons. Mainly so his girlfriend doesn't leave him as well as her being a citizen and him being a civilian, but as the battle wages on even when reunited with his high school sweetheart it becomes clear Rico has left her behind and fallen in love with his new job. In fact Rico's new squeeze Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), best friend Ace (Jake Busy) and mentor Jean Rasczak (Ironside) by far become the only family Rico cares about. It is in fact the sequence where Carmen disapproves at the idea putting troops in harm's way and Rico's response of indifference is a sharp contrast, in that Carmen still has humanity and Rico doesn't. Of course let us not forget that the fight sequences are breathtaking, it's fun to see Ironside and Brown in mentor roles and Verhoeven is such a talent when it comes to genre movies. Starship Troopers is then pretty much one of my favorite movies that I watch at least once a year. A movie in the same category of rewatchability as Alien, Aliens, The Thing, Predator, Body Snatchers and The Hidden. (I Come In Peace and Pitch Black are honorable mentions, if I'm honest) as the very best in Alien rampage movies, and I consider this one to be one of my all time favorites. That said, avoid all the sequels.* * * * Out Of 4-(Excellent, must see!)",Starship Troopers
103,one9eighty,Clever and fun Sci-Fi/War/tongue in cheek/social commentary all rolled into one.,7,4 February 2019,"Humanity's ambitions and universal dominance is threatened by alien bugs whose crime is daring to exist. Those people lucky enough to be successfully drafted into the Earth's Space Militia set out to eradicate the bug presence. Unfortunately the bugs are tougher than they first appeared and are willing to fight back. The film follows a handful of young earthlings as they make their life journey in their respective military roles, heading towards conflict with the alien bugs. From school to the front line the characters grow and become the people they believed they always had the potential to be while fighting the menace from another planet.Directed by Paul Vehoeven and based on a book by Robert Heilein, this 1997 film starred Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Michael Ironside.I remember this getting absolutely panned in the 90's and still suffers some negativity these days - but you know what, I actually like this movie and think it's extremely clever in the way it mocks culture and politics, while wearing a neon bubble-gum disguise. With themes of ignorance, fascism, Nazism, brainwashing, war, violence, and displaced patriotism - it's a lot deeper than mainstream audiences ever realised, or perhaps still do.Lots of philosophical reviews have mentioned the Nazi ideology parallels but the film is also a critique on American Imperialism. America, represented by humanity in this film, is the good looking, capable, gun toting hero who writes the history. Anyone else is a bug and must be stopped out of existence.The film does well with its aesthetics and constantly reinforces the tongue in cheek satirical point of view with propaganda/ brain washing news bulletins which challenge the films audience but showing its rose tinted perspective. Costume design choices are on point; the heroes are often dressed in Nazi style uniforms with badges that look fitting to their uniform. Acting is robotic in places, but I believe this to be intentional; being a recruit in the militia doesn't require emotions, so they are rare to be demonstrated. It's amusing at times to see the young faces trying to be cool and hip young American's that you'd see in any given typical College movie - while at the same time being surrounded by the harsh reality of conflict and iconography that you'd expect to see if World Wars had of resulted in different victors. CGI and effects are generally tasteful, the main thing that looks a little out dated as I watch this film some twenty years after its release, is the space flight.All in all I have enjoyed this film any time I have watched it. It's easy enough to watch that you could just kick back with some popcorn and view it as a sci-fi action film - while equally, you could sit and analyse/ commentate the hell out of it due to the vast depth it has. 7 out of 10 from me.",Starship Troopers
104,rupie,need pooper scooper,3,29 June 1999,"""Starship Troopers"" is aimed right at the junior high male set. I wouldn't have seen it, but I was taking my son & his pal to the movies and, they chose this over ""Eve's Bayou"" and ""Washington Square"". Quel surprise! They loved it. What's not to love? It's got everything the male adolescent mind needs: space ships / giant, brain-sucking, limb-severing bugs / a coed shower scene / military training with live ammo / &c. However, anyone over the age of 19 will notice that the 'acting' is done primarily by magazine-cover hunks and babes who flunked the screen test for 'Baywatch', and that the dialogue seems to be by the writers for that show. As a matter of fact the whole first half of the flick (i.e., prior to the attack on the bugs) might be called ""Bay Watch goes Intergalactic""; instead of lifeguards we have space troops in training. This flick makes the average Schwarzenneger extravaganza look like ""The English Patient"" by comparison. So many reviewers are so taken with the post-modern, Neo-Nazi implications of the flick that they seem to overlook the fact that no one in it can act, and even if they could, the ridiculous dialogue can't be made to work. If you have a penchant for seeing giant insects blown up, or perhaps a campy interest in gong-show quality acting, by all means see it. Otherwise, skip this dog.",Starship Troopers
105,Bob-45,Buffy the Insect Slayer,8,10 December 2004,"Ah. Paul Verhoeven, the wonderfully subversive director of 'Robocop' has yet again mocked our sensibilities with 'Starship Troopers.' Where in 'Robocop' Verhoeven satirized technological dehumanization and corporate fascism, 'Starship Troopers' satirizes world fascism and militarism. Verhoeven has taken the militaristic gung ho of 'Star Wars' and 'Aliens' and turned it on its ears, creating what is easily one of the goriest action adventure movies ever made, all the while lampooning the foolishness of it all.After a bloody opening battle sequence on a faraway planet, 'Starship Troopers' flashes back to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to reveal how our heroes and heroines were suckered into their future military roles. Somehow, this seems appropriate, since the 'world federation' presented resembles NAZI Germany, right down to the uniforms and it's alleged many Nazis escaped to Argentina. Later, after a 'sneak' attack on Buenos Aires by the giant insects, vengeful humans stage a disastrous attack on the 'bug' planet. Director Verhoeven and writer Edward Neumeier brilliantly deliver the truth in a throwaway leading question by a reporter, that humans actually caused the aggression by invading planets already colonized by the bugs. This kind of misguided adventurism goes back in America at least as far as the French and Indian War. Nonetheless, it pretty much applies to one side or the other in every war in our history, including our present misguided operations in the Middle East. Verhoeven initially presents this in a kind of amalgam of World War II propaganda movies, Aaron Spelling soap operas and practically anything presently shown on the WB During the battle scenes, however, Verhoeven grosses us out with disembowelments, decapitations, burning alive and enormous puncture wounds during the mostly one-sided battles, with the bugs usually coming out on top. Ironically, the bugs are presented with superior battle technology, the result of adaptation, while the humans are pretty much stuck with 20th and 21st Century technology. After all, why would a civilization possessing starships be using bullets and not lasers? The most awesome weapon presented is nothing more than a mini nuke, such as the kind being presently proposed by the Bush administration. I believe Verhoeven was doing more here than cribbing from Jim Cameron's 'Aliens'. Besides making a wry allusion that the bugs may be in some ways to humans, Verhoeven was thematically commenting on the devaluation of human life. The federation was not providing leading edge weapons, armor or adequate air cover, because they really didn't care that much about individual soldiers. This should be pretty obvious by the bootcamp abuse, including Rico's ""administrative punishment"". 'Starship Troopers' were just so much cannon fodder. This is also implied in the sacrifice of Buenos Aires. After the starship is hit by the 'bug asteroid,' the ship's captain communicates that earth should be warn the asteroid is 'coming their way.' However, Rico's parents in Buenos Aires are not aware they are about to be hit, as this is made clear during his conversation to him by picture phone. Sounds like a 'communications failure' (Gee, where did we hear THAT before). The planets where troopers fight insects look like the middle of the Mojave Desert; in other words, uninhabitable for most humans, certainly not worth dieing for. The only things keeping 'Starship Troopers' from being totally realistic is the absence of Coke machines and Halliburton cheating the government.'Starship Troopers' is the 'bad boy' among science fiction war movies. It's a great antidote for the syrupy romanticism of 'Star Wars'. It has better than average special effects, music, color and action. Performances are not nearly as bad as you've heard, particularly given Verhoeven's intent. You'll discover this if you watch the deleted scenes; they create a more intimate relationship between Carmen and Rico. Including these scenes would have made us care more about the characters, but I don't think that's what Verhoeven had in mind. One piece of advice: save your snacks for after the movie. You've been warned. I give 'Starship Troopers' an '8'.",Starship Troopers
106,TOMASBBloodhound,Truly a rare breed.,9,27 July 2005,"It isn't every day that you see a studio let $100 million be spent on a film guaranteed to get an R-rating. Terminator 2&3, Troy and Gladiator are perhaps the only other films I can name that also match those characteristics. Starship Troopers was not a success at the box office, but it has done well in the DVD market over the years. It is a very good film with something for everyone, but it may be too gory for some viewers.Our story centers on a futuristic society here on Earth who is at war with a species of giant insects on a distant planet. Our main characters are mostly young people who grew up in Buenos Aries, where apparently the English language and mostly white people will come to dominate the landscape one day. The society in which they live seems to have two classes of people. Citizens and Civilians. The citizens are people who have served in the military or in the government. We are led to believe that citizens are the upper class, but our main character comes from a civilian family and they seem to have a huge house, so it might not be such a bad thing to be a civilian, either. You do have to be a citizen to go into politics or things like that, though.To impress his sweetie, our hero Johnny Rico enlists with her into military service. Too bad for him, because he only qualifies for the infantry, where life is tough and likely short in times of war. She is sent to flight school, and another of their friends qualifies for military intelligence. After an accident in training where one of his squad is killed, Rico plans to quit the military and go back home. However, he has no home to return to. The bugs have somehow sent a huge asteroid to earth and it obliterates... you guessed it... Buenos Aries. Now Rico decides to stay in the military to help wipe out these bugs. The rest of the film has a number of exciting battles and gory special effects to keep your interest.Starship Troopers is a cut above most sci/fi films. Not only does it look fantastic, but it has some deeper philosophical motives. There is more to it than just the battles between humans and insects. We get an in-depth look at this militaristic and in some ways fascist society. The basic training footage is exceptional, and the story is narrated by a series of helpful newsreel type snippets that are always asking... ""would you like to know more?"" I always did.Much has been made of the fascist nature of the society and the Aryan-looking cast. It didn't really bother me because Verhoeven's direction always keeps you focusing on the battles and the f/x. I'm betting the political issues of this film were a little more prevalent at the screenplay level, and glossed over more during filming. One thing that this film's satirizing of fascism keeps tripping over is the nature of the enemy they are facing. We've all been raised to despise fascism, but when it's humans vs bugs, you can't help but root for the humans even if they are fascists. Perhaps if their enemies looked more human like in Enemy Mine, it would have been harder to cheer for the Federation. But by the time this film was over, I was cheering right along with their propaganda films. I saw the film as a shoot'em up more that a satire.The fact that this film didn't make a profit at the box office guaranteed that a good sequel would not have been made. I've not seen part 2, but I've heard it isn't good. I would definitely recommend Starship Troopers to anyone, though. It works on many levels, and it's sure to be a cult favorite for years to come.One more thing about Denise Richards. The woman is too attractive to be anything more than a model. She looks so good that you can't even pay attention to what she's saying. As an actress, she'll always struggle, I'm afraid. Charlie Sheen must be the most picky man on Earth. I wonder what the problem was. Does she grind her teeth at night or something??? 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Starship Troopers

Not a single actor delivers a commendable performance. Everything about the film seems mechanical, including Verhoeven's direction. The first half of the film is about John Rico's life before he joins the infantry, and the second half is mostly one shootout after another.As an action picture Starship Troopers works. It's entertaining if you watch it once. There's even some of that good old wicked Verhoeven humour. But that's about all there is to it. There's nothing to take away from this film. It's not a typical Hollywood product, but by the end it sure seemed like one. By the way, when the brain bug was captured I thought of Osama Bin Laden.

108,carbuff,Big bad bugs.,10,31 May 2015,"Best. SciFi. Movie. Ever. I waited a long time to watch this because the trailer made it look like such a cheesy B movie. Totally wrong. Sure, you pretty much have to forget everything you've ever learned about physics, biology, etc, but that hardly matters, because this film is actually a very sharp and biting social commentary and satire cloaked in a SciFi story with halfway-decent special effects. Without a doubt, the movie is very campy (but that's part of the both the appeal and the satire), and if insects make you uncomfortable, then this movie might not be for you, since these highly aggressive (highly defensive?) multi-legged monsters could eat elephants. The film hits you over the head with many of its big ideas (not that they're dumb ones), but other insights only strike you after you've reflected a bit (assuming that you bother to do so). Unfortunately, in today's highly politically-charged world, I'd wager that many people will actually take this film at face value. The fact that this self-contained movie had sequels is worrisome, since any need to carry on this story is purely superficial and would almost certainly only dilute it's substance--this isn't a Godfather-type situation at all. I'm guessing that a lot of people simply weren't interested in any deeper messages, and the studio cynically exploited the great unwashed's desire for more bug splatter. So, in conclusion, this is really a great movie that's highly entertaining (two hours fly by before you notice it), with the added bonus of carrying some actual reasonably substantial intellectual weight.",Starship Troopers

Why, blow the sick bastards to hell of course!It is precisely that naive tone that turns people off from this film. I know, because it turned me off. I initially saw it when it first came out and when I was too young to understand the idea of satire. The first satire I really got was ""Dr Strangelove"" which I viewed years later. The essence of war is the same here - it is bloody friggin' ridiculous in every sense of those words. Director Paul Verhoeven has an unusual understanding (from the American point of view) of fascist propaganda since he himself lived through it as a boy so his presentation of it here really requires a mature mind to grasp. Yes, on one level this movie is a relentless gore-fest with unrealistically cute leads and an uber-right wing agenda. But that's the point. This film never steps back and says it's kidding, nor did the ads present the film as ""Director Paul Verhoeven presents a new satire on fascism."" It just threw you into the fray. Verhoeven's previous films, especially ""RoboCop"" were similar in that manner. Huge evil corporations that hunger for power and vilify to the fullest their enemies and even kill them (OPC from 'RoboCop') well here we have a government doing the same thing. The enemies are literally disgusting nasty bugs, not because that is realistic, but because that is was propaganda makes enemies of the state out to be. Hitler openly announced that the Jews, Poles, Gypsies and other ethnic groups aren't really human and should be killed or serve the Aryan ideal that he imagined. They were the bugs that are shown here.I was never a gore-hound and I'll admit that even the game 'Doom' scared me when I first played it (shhh you didn't just read that!) so I thought this movie was just more luridly violent shite. As irony would have it, it is, but to show you how ridiculous it all is. This film is best with two consecutive viewings an evening apart. First watch it and enjoy or cringe at the crazy violence. Then when you watch it again, be critical, and you won't be distracted since you know where the nasty parts are. Take note of how Verhoeven inserts TV ads, posters, images of the alien home planets, and even the dialog. They are not shown in completion, but just enough to show the ridiculous gist of each one. With the worldwide US led war on terror (with the enemy in caves! coincidence?) the biting joke here is all the more relevant as we try to rid the world of ""extremists"" and ""the enemies of democracy,"" and... well you know what I mean. 8/10Rated R for intense violence and carnage",Starship Troopers

It shows the absurdity and implications of a military-obsessed society.Starship Troopers is a well-aged cult classic and one of my favorite works by Paul Verhoeven. It's cheesy but full of violence, subtle comedy, and layered with meaning. Starship Troopers takes its source material and insinuations to its logical extremes.Action and gore are turned up to an extreme 10 in this film. Starship Troopers takes no reservations with showing blood, guts, and limbs being blown from people. Battles with the bugs get larger and bloodier as the film goes on. Practical effects and CGI hold up well in today's age.Some viewers may have reservations with the simplistic plot and wooden acting. This is a teen drama with love triangles and friendship in the context of sci-fi war. Yet, this is Verhoeven's intention. He's able to take the script and turn it to subversion of ultra-nationalistic ideals while making the movie feel like a propaganda film in itself.And we can see that in the people who enjoy this film while missing its points.And the themes hold up well even in today's world (writing this review in 2020). As time goes on, we can see that the underlying messages that Verhoeven was trying to communicate to us have only held true over time.5/5.",Starship Troopers

119,tomimt,Not as good as a satire as it is as action.,7,16 September 2006,"If you want to compare 'Starship Troopers' on an another film your best choice would be 'Robocop', because it is very similar in style to it. And it was also made by Paul Verhoven. But the difference here is, that ST forgets that it is a satire from time to time.There are some pretty good satirical elements in the film, like the propaganda war commercials and the full citizenship, that can be acquired only via military service, but when the action kicks in those pointers just seem to fade away into the background and the screen is filled with spectacular and bloody action. Not that it's a bad thing.The beginning of the movie is almost like a parody of a teen movies or TV-series but when the main protagonist enlist in the army the teen manners are rapidly removed from them. With the exception of Denise Richards who just is pretty but has no deeper character. Well actually none of the characters do, they all are pretty stereotypical in any way imaginable.But still as it is, 'Starship Troopes' is very good action film, if you just don't start searching any deeper message from it, as at least I feel it does lack a bit in the satire.",Starship Troopers
120,emm,A sci-fi semi-classic for the pre-millennium phase.,7,9 January 1999,"This one is hands down, the most visually stunning effort pulled off in a sci-fi movie, thanks to the minds of Sony. Bodies are blown to bits, bugs animate in fluidity and in mass hordes, meteors fly and rotate in outer space, et cetera. Among minor little details is the top of a huge ship nipped off by a huge asteroid. It has the richest looking colors captured on film. In other words, visual overkill!WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Being nitpicky over movies that are all show and no go, STARSHIP TROOPERS finally deserves more credit for some high-intensity action elements that rival a classic WW2 picture, and you can bet a wild number of young recruits who storm through alien territory getting sliced and amputated by these fierce creatures! Bloody well right! Some of the fighting scenes are a bit repetitive, but they are impressive enough to make your eyes glue to the TV screen. Try calling this a mass upgrade of Hollywood war films for a change!WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Enough of the rich, creamy taste for now. Some silly and disgusting things bothered me in viewing STARSHIP TROOPERS. Weird acting performances in the first hour are irritating, along with the excessive gore and nudity content. What needs to be understood is that sci-fi movies are meant to fascinate and entertain all types of viewers, and they include special effects. This is obviously where future science fiction is heading, but on the director's part, you'll have to live by the rules here. If it was toned down, this would've been better. Fortunately, things go uphill after the unwanted glitches and focuses more on the battleground.WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?The public service announcements are a nice touch to STARSHIP TROOPERS, a movie set in the future where all forms of communication is evitable. Carmen survives a bug's blade cut through the shoulder. End credits are a record-breaking 10 minutes long. And of course, two hours of fun. It's more than a doorstop for your DVD player not just in visuals, but in solid entertainment, minus the disadvantages. Still, it's no American epic like STAR WARS and its appeal belongs to the younger crowd. STARSHIP TROOPERS looks as though it could have a sequel in the making, and maybe develop a stronger following for its own good. The fact that it may not overtake the new STAR WARS film coming up will be a huge question, though.WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?Sorry, but it's time for me to go nighty-night!

Truth be told, STARSHIP TROOPERS is almost nothing but CGI with some live but cardboard-like actors hanging about, led by the always-wooden Denise Richards and Casper Van Dien. The viewer is never once made to believe he is watching anything other than an interstellar war, and in this way the film is right up there with the very first STAR WARS film, which successfully created a universe all its own. Verhoven and his production people have us believing what we are seeing at every turn, giant killer bugs included. I simply cannot imagine what this film must have cost to make, but the fact is STARSHIP TROOPERS uses CGI more effectively and believably than any film in the history of CGI-era films. I am not sure it can ever be topped, nor should it.",Starship Troopers
123,Bogmeister,Reach for the Stars and Destroy Bugs,8,17 August 2005,"In conclusion, mankind carries its need for pest control to harsh extremes as it expands throughout the galaxy. I finally reached that conclusion after seeing this film several times. When I first saw Starship Troopers back in'97, I was taken with its exciting depiction of the future - I'd guess 200 years from now - where-in young gung-ho soldiers, led by older scarred veterans, begin to wage war against giant interstellar bugs. This was a scale of combat rarely, if ever, seen on the screen, with the very survival of our species at stake. It was based on Heinlein's science fiction novel, which I read as a teen and which was written straight - serving in the military was the most honorable thing a person could do, as such an individual takes responsibility for the safety of the human race. If you're a left wing filmmaker, the idea of a military government is an automatic means of depicting a sly form of fascism. The fascism in this film ends up being directed at the alien bugs, as it turns out. As shown by the filmmaker, human beings themselves in this era have no problems with each other; no one looks suppressed or oppressed, everyone has their own opportunities. If you don't want to join military life, that's fine; you're not accorded 'citizen' status, whatever that means, but no one forces you into anything and you lead a comfortable life. Of course, we're shown a surface gloss of what life is like on Earth, but it seems very pleasant - when not bombarded by asteroids from alien bugs. But, it could be that, 200 years from now, a government run by the military may not be the same thing as we would be subjected to now. Verhoeven never shows any sinister signs that all may not be what it seems to be and citizens are somehow mind-controlled or duped.After seeing the film a couple of more times, a few bothersome details became noticeable and thoughts crept into my brain. Take these military outposts set up on bug planets - aren't they the most ill-conceived pieces of crap for an advanced military civilization? I'm not even asking for force fields which maybe no one perfected yet, but what about at least some extended roofing? Some futuristic version of barbwire? (I believe the sequel actually had something like this). And the grouping of the spaceships so that they all get wiped out together above a planet? There're two possibilities: the filmmaker threw aside such logic to depict cool carnage; or, you have a government bureaucracy far more sinister than what was first believed. This would be a government willing to sacrifice millions of citizens, including their own soldiers, for a long range plan of dominating a galaxy. You motivate the citizens enough into hating the enemy and your long range plan will succeed eventually. I don't really understand it all and maybe that's the whole point; it's never explained clearly how the war began - how & why did the bugs throw an asteroid on Buenos Aires and why weren't orbital defenses set up before this? No one knows except...hey, who is the head of our planet anyway in this future? So there you have it: certain filmmakers can throw together a real chaotic brew of futuristic paranoia disguised as a war picture. You check out the over-the-top propaganda in the recurring newscasts, dripping in dark satire, and it doesn't take more than one viewing to get a semblance of where the filmmaker stands. One thing from the outset that never changed for me: though I would start the film dreading those scary giant bugs, by the end of it I'm feeling sorry for them after the relentless onslaught by these fascistic humans. It's a human being galaxy, my friends; no bugs allowed.",Starship Troopers
124,innocuous,Not sure why so many consider this a B movie.,6,17 January 2005,"Several reviewers have relegated this to B movie status, which is beyond my understanding. The cast is fine, the FX are well above average, and the movie is reasonably well-paced. Plus, it feels free to kill off any character at any time...one of my favorite qualities of adventure and horror movies.The thing about this film that is hardest for me to swallow, though, is the complete lack of respect for the original novel. I believe that Verhoeven stated once that he read only a portion of the book because he got bored, or for some similar reason. That's a shame. The novel is actually an interesting discussion of social and political structures, much of it couched in the classic ""dialogue"" format employed by Socrates and the other great ancient philosophers. This aspect is completely absent from the movie.Overall, a good adventure movie with some wild FX and pretty good sound. I give this a **** out of *****.",Starship Troopers
125,moviesleuth2,Cheesy fun,7,9 June 2010,"This is one of those movies that should not be as fun as it is. The script is weak, the acting is all around awful, the storyline is clichéd (if intentionally so), and it's so over-the-top is ventures into self-parody (again, intentionally). Yet I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie...once I knew what it was trying to do.Three high school friends, Rico (Casper Van Dien), Carmen (Denise Richards) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) join the army after high school. Carl joins the special ops because he's a psychic, Carmen goes to flight school, and Rico ends up in the infantry because he's only following Carmen. Then war breaks out, and they all end up in this epic war against bugs who look like a walking pair of clamps.""Starship Troopers"" doesn't take itself seriously. That would be okay I felt that the actors were in on the joke. It's immediately obvious that the actors are taking this very seriously, and save for a Michael Ironside (as the teacher/captain) and Brenda Strong (as Carmen's flight instructor), none of them can act. Casper Van Dien is a pretty face, but he makes posers look good. Denise Richards isn't any better, but Neil Patrick Harris, who is no stranger to being funny (see him parody himself in ""Harold and Kumar"") is terrible in a dramatic role. But Patrick Muldoon is just AWFUL as Zander, Carmen's new interest. This is Jonathan Schaech in ""The Forsaken"" bad. The real surprise is Dina Meyer, Rico's best friend (and wannabe lover). Meyer is lively and energetic, and she's totally believable. We actually feel for her as she pines away at Rico, who is still head over heels for Carmen (this whole love triangle is strongly reminiscent of Betty and Veronica in the Archie comics).Still, I would be lying if I said I didn't get caught up in this whole thing. With more cheese than the dairy area at Wal-Mart, it's still kind of fun in a very silly way. That has to do with the skill of director Paul Verhoeven. The Dutch filmmaker knows how to tell a story, and that's what makes this movie enjoyable. He has a lot of fun parodying the futuristic fascist world that the story takes place in, although the first half hour (when we are introduced the the characters) is painful because they actually have to act.It's dumb, but it's a fun kind of dumb.",Starship Troopers
126,Peach-2,Wow!,10,31 July 1999,"I went to the theater one night to check this film out not knowing what to expect. Paul Verhoeven had made some pretty cool sci-fi pictures before and I wanted to see his latest one right away. When the movie started I was blown away, the film resembled Robocop in it's presentation, but this was not Robocop. This movie championed war, the whole of society in this film seems to be fascist. War to these people is the answer to everything. The film, like most of Verhoeven's work, doesn't hold back on the violence. The special effects are pretty amazing. Verhoeven has filled this film with attractive, young people. Most of the older people in the film are scarred or handicapped. This is a reflection of a war torn society, they may be young and beautiful when they go into the military, but eventually they are scarred and hollow portraits of their former selves. Verhoeven should stay away from erotic thrillers and stick to science fiction, his strength is there.",Starship Troopers

How many movies have followed a book and succeeded anyway? Not many in my opinion, most movies are better off being loosely based on the book. Ok, so I can agree to some points. It´s extremely stupid to run around like idiots with small, small weapons among big, big bugs. But it looks cool! The actors stink. That statement needs no further explaining. Starting a war against bugs a million miles away IS stupid. Especially when you can zap their meteors without having to attack them... But these flaws are just minor in my opinion. This movie is still very well done with special effects. It has action scenes that are pretty unique. It has a sick sense of humour which reminds me of Robocop. And finally, it´s good entertainment which is what this movie is all about. I rate it 7/10 since it achieves what it wants. Namely entertainment value.",Starship Troopers
128,Laakbaar,Heinlein would have hated this movie,6,26 August 2015,"This is a military sci-fi epic set in a future in which Earth is engaged in a total war with spider-like aliens. We follow Rico (who looks like a Ken doll) as he is joins the infantry, is trained, goes off into battle and gets caught up in a battle to destroy the enemy aliens.The film has certain characteristics that some will find hard to get past. They have been described in detail in other reviews, so I'll pass on most of it. A few points though...The worst problem for me was that the basic training, infantry life and battle scenes seemed so ineptly done, cliché and unrealistic. There was no grittiness, no toughness. Just pretty Hollywood puppets playing at it. For the love of pete, they ran into battle as a ragged line, shooting from the hip! Really??I haven't researched it, so I don't know why the movie was done this way. I have to wonder if they had any military advisers, and if so, why didn't they listen to them. Why was there little or no effort to show the military in a realistic light? Contempt?This wasn't just Hollywood's usual cliché take on the military, it was like they purposefully tried to parody the clichés. Was that it? Was Verhoeven trying to show how outdated Heinlein's world view has become? Was this a parody? The movie had this strange camp feel to it, an unexpected earnestness, an over-the-top quality. There was plenty of gore, of the cartoonish movie variety. Barbie and Ken being ripped apart by spiders. (Come to think of it, this probably explains the relatively high IMDb score.) Why did someone from Buenos Aires speak perfect idiomatic American English? Sorry, I just don't get it.The dialogue seemed wooden and cliché at times. I couldn't get into any of the characters at all. OK, maybe the problem was that they tried to fit too much in. This might have been better as a series.Having said all this, there were a few cool moments in the movie.I loved Heinlein when I was a kid. I bought his tough philosophizing and glorification of the military. I ate it up hook, line and sinker. Indeed, I loved this book and wanted to be a starship trooper. This movie has reminded me how much I was into Heinlein.I should have loved this movie, but I'm going to rate it fairly low for now. I'll reread the book and then watch the movie again.

The young lad who looks like a young Gary Busey (the one who gets a knife in the hand and plays the violin later) was very good and I really enjoyed his acting.The training and preparation for combat puts this film in with other war movies like Full Metal Jacket. It gives you a background about the characters and gives you an idea about the set-up of the federation.Doogie Howser (So I don't know his real name and only remember him from this 80's classic show!) is basically playing himself as the intelligence officer.I love this movie. The space and ground based battles are visually stunning and well put together. There is a story, the characters are fleshed out and made real.The bugs look great, they even have a structure like the human combat system.

What it IS however, is a complete disrespect to one of the world's greatest Science Fiction writers.I realize you can't recreate a whole book on the big screen, but this doesn't have much resemblance to the original storyline at all...they could have, at least, used some of the most important background story, like how the Federation doesn't give a hoot if anyone signs up! And how hard the ""weeding out"" process is, not to mention some of the ""boot camp"" story...oh, there is a boot camp of sorts, but it is truly stupid as a contribution to the story.

A mish mash of sexual suggestion and gore for the sake of gore.Oh well, they got some money out of this tripe...not much respect from Heinlein readers though...Heck, Killer Tomatoes was a better movie!**Additions** Well, I just read thru some more of the reviews here and really can't fathom how many gave this a 10 rating, heh heh. For those who wrote about this movie being something of a satire or commentary on our current society, all I can say is really? Most good movies strive to provide some kind of social commentary, weaving it into some recognizable dialog and...a story that at least makes you think. SST had none of that, instead using massive cgi to draw in the game boy crowd. Obviously it worked, with the high ratings far surpassing the lower ones.

Bugs hurling asteroids towards Earth, from another solar system? How? Where is this system? Are you aware of the distances? How can a bunch of bugs do it anyway? They can't even leave the surface of their home planet. And what do these billions of giant bugs eat on a planet that doesn't seem to have any form of vegetation or indigenous life, aside from the bugs? Why do humans fight them with WWI military tactics? Why would you have infantry on the ground when you can nuke them from the sky? Of course,people will say that this is not the point, that the film is tongue-in-cheek satire and that it's supposed to be seemingly senseless violence, in order to convey its message about a special kind of mentality that this future society fosters. OK, fine. But do they think this message is particularly clever? I don't. I did not see a single interesting idea in the whole film. There is nothing about human nature one gets to learn that one does not already know. There is no reflexive exploration here that is worth mentioning. Frankly, I think the film works better as a senseless action film, and as such it still fails colossally.

It's ads and info spots serving as comic timers, in between the explosions and limb removals. The satire get's lost in the run of the mill dialogue (but suprissingly long if inconsequential character development). Still a fun, gory, balls to the wall, action satire, and a strangely oddly important artifact of American culture. Anti-war films generally don't work because ""action argues for itself"", but Starship Troopers does mock it's celebratory slaughter (which perhaps the book took seriously, or perhaps not), by immersing itself so heavily in B-Movie shlock,it's almost impossible to imagine anyone taking this seriously. But the satire is really a loose excuse for me being a sucker for the kind of mindless violence than one is only really free to express when...squashing insects...a small violence we all do, often, without even considering it as a life, just a pest, a problem, or as these characters would say ""the only good bug is a dead bug"".

The genius of this movie is in its po-faced, exact portrayal of what a western propaganda movie would actually be like in this scenario. In fact the only real moments that break the straight-faced, dedicated parody tone are the actual in-film propaganda stings which makes it pretty clear to me that this film is one big indictment of the fascist American war machine sold back to Americans under the guise of a summer blockbuster. Or more specifically it's a parody of how western media portrays themselves. They'd never make a movie like this now. It even has a sort of almost unrecognisable subtle layer below that has strong females in powerful roles, and where many of the leader figures actually try and actively dissuade the characters from joining the war. Even the plot and some details are whizzed by very fast; the bug's dangerousness for example when the whole mission is actually an invasion to gain the resources of the planet. And who could imagine in a film like this that as punishment a soldier is strapped up in a public arena and lashed. Everything is amped up to 11 in the way that only a foreigner could elucidate on the sadistic excessive side of blind hoo-rah patriotism and brainwashing of soldiers. It's a perfect film to watch in these trying times, as tough as it is to swallow how little things have moved on since 1997. ""He's afraid!"" Says Neil Patrick Harris at the close of the movie.

His father is dead set against it, saying that he's doing it for a girl. Considering that the girl is Denise Richards (As Carmen Ibanez), you can sort of understand why Johnny's father isn't too pleased. However, Johnny is dead set to going ahead of his quest rather than going to college and remaining a civilian.Things don't go his way as he goes through training: his girl dumps him to go career as a pilot, his actions during an obstacle course causes someone's death, and then the bugs start some crap.Mind you, these are not your typical bugs that you stomp on or spray with a can of bug spray. These are some nasty ones, ripping you to shreds. They also cause the destruction of Buenos Aires, the capital of Earth (Don't ask). Rico is determined for revenge and goes to fight. However, the first attack is a disaster (Which is how the film opens). With a new plan in place, Rico comes under the command of his instructor, LT. Rasczak (Michael Ironside). With a whole new plan of attack, they come across even nastier bugs, including a bug that drains your brain.There is a lot of scenes in the film that smack of propaganda during WWII (Sort of ""Why We Fight"" for the sci-fi set).

141,AvidClimber,Starship Troopers — Glorious sci-fi action without being too serious about it,7,5 March 2013,"Starship Troopers is a science-fiction action flick that is also a little caricature of itself. You can't take it seriously, or you'll be missing the point, really. The bravado is exaggerated, the undertakings are epic, and the army isn't very bright.That being said, the future it depicts is an interesting take, and it was well exploited and presented.I love Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris, and Michael Ironside in their respective roles. They really give this flick all its flair. You want to slap some sense in Denise Richards' character and kick her co-pilot's ass, but that's what the director had obviously in mind. All in all, it's a nice cast.Now, this movie has a special dichotomy: most of the CGI are very well done, whereas some of sets especially when it comes to shuttles, interior or exterior, look a little bit on the cheap side. Maybe it's a question of bad design, but it's weird.Anyway, it's good entertainment, especially if you like sci-fi and action.",Starship Troopers
142,willcundallreview,A kind of good Sci-Fi,7,27 March 2014,"Rating-7/10Starship Troopers is a Sci-Fi film that borders on the utterly crazy, but it actually turns out well and with some good old 90's action scenes, makes for a cool feeling film too. The whole thing could be criticised much more but I didn't feel it deserved much at all and with the film having humorous parts as well as serious, it makes for fun and thriller all the same. I felt the film was safely kind of good, near being just OK than good but here is why I thought that about this movie.The story is fast when fighting and slow when not as it should be obviously, but sometimes the film can be maybe just a little slow and ruins any thrills we might get from the characters. I liked the action scenes and the fighting is interesting to say they face such strange creatures throughout, they seem to never know how to kill them properly though. The plot gets better as it goes on, I could feel it was slightly unreasonable as a film but nevertheless it is entertaining and fun all round.The cast are not the part of the film I would call anywhere good, most seem to falter in battle with wooden acting in the face of possible death, and over the top screaming when injured, the cast don't do such a great job. The main actor and hero Casper Van Dien try's his hardest to get it started but with so much bad acting around it is only a matter of time until it fails in this department. Not all the blame can go on them as I felt acting in such a crazy plot but being serious also must be hard.I enjoyed the effects a lot and when they are in space not only are the sets for the place extremely good, the entire effects system for the spaceships are fantastic to say it is in the 90's. Scripted averagely and directed the same they never pick up and although not bad, they don't help the film to it's final rating much at all. The creatures are also well done and better effects are known now but still you see the aliens in this and believe they are real(to say that if you are engrossed in the story).It's criticism comes from what I have already said, wooden acting, but also the film never gages your interest and although by the end you feel you have seen a Pretty Good movie, the movie fails to leave a legacy with you, but that was just me, certain some will love it more. I don't think anything else is wrong but I know some will find this ridiculous and stupidly made, form your own opinion on this, it's worth a watch.People who like Sci-Fi should enjoy this but it never takes that much of a dark tone to say it is a 15, much worse is around now and only at a 12 but Starship Troopers still manages to entertain and bring violence and gore that isn't fake. On that note if you don't like violence and gore don't watch it, it contains a lot and especially near the end, not loads of blood is seen but Alien guts don't make for a lovely sight.Overall a 7/10 from me and it was Safely a Kind of Good film that pleased me but not so much as to say it straight good. I know some will like this and I think it may have a cult audience already, it's the kind of movie you can love to hate or hate to love and divides opinion because of it's cheesy like themes and not great acting, nevertheless see it and see what you think, calling all you Sci-Fi fans especially.",Starship Troopers

Everything is comedy: the sassy homes people live in, the perfect looks of all the main characters and the dumb-ass dialogue. It a dream script for someone who really wants to have fun for once. But the best part are the commercials, introduced by Verhoeven in Robocop and taken to even greater lengths here. Fun, fast-moving and extremely entertaining.

146,HelenMary,more than just an action sci-fi gore fest - political and propaganda narrative too,6,30 June 2013,"Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein.The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the ""brain"" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.",Starship Troopers

148,kgprophet,The Way to Make Science Fiction Edgy,6,12 August 2013,"I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially cliché and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out.But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would allow anyone to look up other student's scores.Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.",Starship Troopers

To the point that I thought they were graduating college until something was said.Even a poor attempt to ""draw you in"" by having the opening scene followed with the dreaded ""one year earlier."" Is that ever how a good movie starts? They realized they had a boring movie and cheaply tried to add some excitement.Watching it 20 years later is funny because they were so off about futuristic stuff.

I love Starship Troopers, it's the classic humans vs aliens tale, which never gets old.Starship Troopers follows a very standard plot, humans vs aliens. What's so great about Starship Troopers is that we get to see the humans being out of their element, away from Earth. We follow four main characters, Rico, Carmen, Dizzy, and Carl, who all enrolled into the federation to gain citizenship. The plot is fairly cliched, but on purpose, as this is a satire. One fairly good aspect of the screenplay is the pacing; it introduces all of the characters and then gets straight to war.What surprised me the most was how violent Starship Troopers really is. The violence is entertaining when it has to be entertaining, and the violence is shocking when it has be shocking. Starship Troopers is also a great sci-fi flick, there's awesome world building and the futuristic technology is very creative. Overall, Starship Troopers succeeds in being both a war movie and being a sci-fi movie.Starship Troopers is a fun movie that keeps it simplistic. It doesn't try to break the boundaries of the war and sci-fi genre. It's just a great movie with likable characters and fun action sequences.",Starship Troopers

Their teacher Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) preaches the value of citizenship in the militarized state. Although Johnny is under Raszack's spell, his primary reason for signing up is to follow his girl friend Carmen who wants to be a pilot.

Johnny is out for revenge on the entire bug race.There are some brutal battles on the bug's home planet and at an outpost of the federation on Planet P before the MI captures the brain bug.The film came out in 1999 two years before the 9-11 attack on NYC. It is interesting to see where the writers correctly gauged the likely reaction and where they failed.The acting if not stellar is extremely well done. The story line of young people fumbling around with adult responsibilities is credible.

156,mnpollio,A deadening wall of noise and violence,3,21 April 2011,"Purportedly based on a Robert Heinlein novel, this is an especially empty-headed science fiction action flick from over-the-top director Paul Verhoeven.In the future, on a vaguely fascist militaristic Earth, high school graduates are recruited to join up in a military endeavor to combat races of giant, intelligent insects on a distant planet. And that is about the size of it. Anyone looking for anything of special relevance or depth is in the wrong movie.There is absolutely nothing wrong with having good dumb fun at the movies. Unfortunately, this effort is neither good or fun, just dumb. The film never really explains how these insects, which are planet-bound became a particular threat to Earth and felt that we were worth their while to antagonize. Verhoeven's attempt to instill the material with some irony seems to be in garbing Neil Patrick Harris' scientist to look like he is an SS officer and making the recruitment videos and the news bulletins reminiscent of Nazi propaganda pieces. Rather than amuse, it has the distinct impression of inducing unease. The film also never bothers to explain how so many diverse species of insects on this far away planet have decided to harmoniously come together and pool their resources to take on humanity.The battle scenes are marvels of visual effects, but after the first one they just seem recycled. The viewer has no stake in the outcome and they all begin to look alike - how many times can one see the same movements of identical looking soldiers being impaled on giant bug legs or have their heads lopped off by flying insects before it gets old hat? The characters and acting are so bad that they do not even qualify as stereotypes. They make the kids on the average episode of Beverly Hills 90210 look like studies in complexity. The ""human"" story is some foolishness about all American Casper Van Dien being stunned when his girlfriend Denise Richards joins up and leaves him behind. He naturally follows her into the armed services. Mopey Van Dien is pursued by gutsy fellow grunt Dina Meyer, while Richards' pilot gets to make goo-goo eyes at colleague Patrick Muldoon. Yawn! The second string leads Meyer and Muldoon come off better and seem to have some degree of acting talent, which means that the film will need to do something about it. If six-pack abs and a rock hard butt were indications of acting talent than Van Dien would be this generation's Olivier. There is absolutely no disagreement that he is easy on the eyes and rocks a completely gratuitous (but welcome) nude co-ed shower scene, but he is a hopeless actor incapable of even the tiniest bit of charisma. However, he is a veritable whirlwind compared to the tragically talentless Richards, who spends much of the film sporting a vacant stare, delivering her corny lines with a flat affect, and does not even have the excuse of getting naked at any point.Watching the film, it is difficult to figure out who is target audience of this film. The writing and acting gear the film towards children, but the graphic violence and the aforementioned nude shower scene would seem to skew the viewing audience older. Yet anyone beyond eighth grade would undoubtedly find the film silly, if not downright laughable. Director Verhoeven loves to push buttons and sometimes succeeds in coming up with something stylish - this is not one of those times. The film is never bad enough to become a camp classic, nor does it ever hit the heights of sheer dumb goofiness that would make it a great guilty pleasure. Instead, it just seems like a waste of time. If you are determined to watch it, do yourself a huge favor. Skip over the dialog scenes to the nude shower scene and watch that - then fast forward to the first battle scene and watch that. Those two scenes are the highlights of the film - further viewing would be irrelevant.",Starship Troopers
157,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Join the Mobile Infantry. See the Galaxy. And kill everything that moves!,9,27 June 2020,"A gore and testosterone soaked action masterpiece from Paul Verhoeven, the director of ""Robocop"" and based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein. ""Starship Troopers"" works first as a simple action-flick with superb battle scenes and military drama, and on the other it works well as a satire and is full of allegories and fascist symbolism. The film centres around a future where patriotism has been replaced by a sense of duty to Earth as a whole and where people are either a civilian, or a citizen, the latter being the more desirable and only achieved from service in Earth's military. In Buenos Aires, Rico, Carmen, Dizzy and Carl all join the military after graduating high school and join the Mobile Infantry, the spaceship corps and the Military Intelligence units. Earth is busy colonising other planets, and have encountered a hostile race known as 'Bugs'. When the Bugs fire an asteroid at Earth and decimate Buenos Aires, it's lock-and-load as the Mobile Infantry is deployed to the Arachnid planets in an operation that mirrors the US Marines island-hopping strategy in the Pacific during the Second World War. But they have underestimated the intelligence of the Bugs, as there is absolute carnage.""Starship Troopers"" has always been a guilty-pleasure of mine and a film that I consider as one of my all-time favourites. It looks class and the story is very exciting, clever and full of very memorable scenes. I spotted a few familiar faces while watching it again recently; Dean Norris from ""Breaking Bad"", Eric Bruskotter from ""Tour of Duty"" and Seth Gilliam from ""Oz"" and ""The Walking Dead"". Like in ""Robocop"", Verhoeven laces the film with satire and symbolism. The news-bulletins and recruitment videos are reminiscent of tropes he used in ""Robocop"" and are a brilliant feature.

159,Mcduff3601,I hadn't rewatched this since my younger years fearing it would be too cheesy for older me to watch... I was wrong.,9,19 April 2021,"I am blown away by how well this movie holds up after all this time. Don't get me wrong this is a solid B movie dressed up to look like a blockbuster. It has got some really cheesy moments but it all works really well. This movie is campy where it needs to be, cheesy and serious all at the same time.It's clear they used a LOT of practical special effects wherever they could, mostly in human body parts and blood. This is a very gory movie, which I tend to shy away from, but in the way it is used here it works well. I love some of the lines like ""they sucked out his brains!"" it reminds me of campy 50's sci fi.Despite this being a B(ish) movie they do a pretty good job at developing the characters. We see them as recent high-school graduates moving onto college or in this universe military training. We see them develop and grow as the story progresses. You end up caring what happens to these characters which for me is a mark of a well told story. Plus most of the human characters are used as cannon fodder against an unending tidal wave of baddies.I would recommend this to anyone who likes action/sci fi movies with a TON of gore. Think of a cheaper, cheesier version of Aliens but with larger outdoor battle scenes that give the feeling of scale.

160,ExpendableMan,Bad ass! Dark social satire meets high octane sci-fi action,9,13 June 2007,"Playing out like a mix of twisted social commentary and balls out war movie with the cast of Dawsons Creek as soldiers, Starship Troopers is a film that rewards repeated viewings. All too often, it is unfairly dismissed as a knuckle-headed action flick when in actuality, there is a hefty dose of intelligence, wit and humour lurking beneath the spilled blood, giant insects and shoulder-wielded nuclear missile launchers.Set in a near future, militaristic society, Starship Troopers adopts a similar vein to Paul Verhoeven's previous action classic Robocop. It follows the exploits of Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris), four school-friends who join the military after graduation and find themselves entering a chaotic world of insane violence as Earth goes to war with a race of giant insects. Their friendships are tested to the limit and as friends and allies drop like flies all around them, Earth's fortunes against this unstoppable arachnid menace seem bleak...To dismiss Starship Troopers as a single minded slug-fest however would be a massive mistake. Subversive from the start, the screen is bombarded with Robocop-style news reports on the war with the bugs featuring children stomping on cockroaches and truckers spouting ""only good bug"" rhetoric while thousands of the world's youth are marched off to die screaming. The heroes we are supposed to cheer on are all made into meaningless numbers, victims of a culture-wide brainwashing where war makes fascists of us all. Considering this came out in 1997, a full five years before the onset of the War On Terror and the questionable motives behind America's current ""peace through strategic bombing"" campaign, it possesses a remarkable degree of foresight.The cast meanwhile are not remarkable per se, but nonetheless, ideally suit their roles. Casper Van Dien's square-jawed ubermensch Rico is the sort of soldier who could have walked straight off a propaganda campaign. Handsome, white-teethed and sporting abs you could grate cheese on, he is an Aryan poster boy made flesh and his super-soldier behaviour is just the sort of thing the folks at home want to hear about in the newspapers. Denise Richards meanwhile works like his female counterpart; owning an award winning smile and curves a slinky could travel down, she is similarly built for recruitment posters: Join the Navy son! You might get immolated, but you'll also get to bone Denise Richards! All of which makes it sound as though Starship Troopers is more po-faced than a black metal festival but the opposite is true; this is a film rife with humour. Dark humour granted, but humour nonetheless, carried by cheesy grins and meaningless slogans that mask the Right-Wing polemic that has taken over the world. Furthermore, the action sequences are an absolute blast, filled with exploding space ships, giant rampaging insects and so much blood and guts it'd make a slaughterhouse worker queasy.This is a film that has been cruelly overlooked, but just like the director's Cyborg cop movie, each successive viewing reveals another layer you might not have noticed before. It might be set in a futuristic world of intergalactic travel where man is engaged in a vast war with an alien race, but nevertheless this is one of the most astute criticisms of military oriented society ever made. Anyone who's a fan of black comedy and eighties action movies will love this but fun as it may be to just crack open the six pack and invite your friends over, try watching it sober and alone, it's well worth it.",Starship Troopers

Lacking even a single moment of suspense or originality (many bits and pieces have been borrowed verbatim from the Aliens, Star Wars and Star Trek movies), this movie somehow still manages to entertain, which says a lot for the director and the high production values involved.  The CGE effects are pretty seamless, an accomplishment in any movie of this sort (the movement of the bugs reminded me very much of certain scenes from ""Jurassic Park""). 
Despite being a total rehash of every other movie of its genre (outer space action/adventure - this is not worthy of the name ""science fiction""), I enjoyed this movie and found it watchable more than once.

After reading a large number of other viewer's reviews, and actually taking some time to think seriously about the movie (NOTE - THIS MOVIE *NEVER* TAKES ITSELF SERIOUSLY), something happened.  My serious look at this very un-serious film somehow reflected back upon itself, and I finally ""got it."" 
This movie is a humorous, satirical parody -- literally, a parody of EVERYTHING it presents.  It's a parody of World War II propaganda films, a parody of high school (and relationships therein), a parody of every sci-fi and outer space flick since ""Star Wars,"" a parody of Heinlein's novel (and maybe the man himself!), a parody of violence in the movies, a parody of technology, a parody of the military (American or otherwise), a parody of soap operas and soap opera stars, a parody of our hopeful (and hopeless) visions of the future, a parody of fascist societies... the list goes on and on.  Literally *everything* presented in this movie is done so on the level of parody or satire.It's even a parody of itself, and ultimately of us -- Verhoeven is sitting back and laughing that we would go see his film, shelling out yet another (who knows how many millions) hoping to see ""Star Wars"" replayed yet again. How much longer can this genre last before we all ""get it,"" and let Hollywood go on to bigger and better things?If Heinlein had any sense of humor whatsoever, he would be rolling around in his grave laughing his tail off, not in anger.  And if WE have any sense of humor, maybe we can laugh at ourselves.  How many times have we shelled out money to see movies like this, only to whine about how bad they are to our friends or on some message board?  Do we really expect another *serious* ""sci-fi outer space action film?""  This genre is totally worn out, finished, kaput.  George Lucas had better pray, because his plan to finish the ""Star Wars"" series is going to flop.  There is nothing original that can be done anymore.I think I finally ""get it"" - and I'm revising my previous rating from 7/10 to 9/10.  This movie is brilliant on the level of satirical parody, and it is also funny and entertaining.  It invites us to take nothing about itself seriously, and even dares to invite us not to take *ourselves* seriously. How DARE YOU, Mr. Verhoeven! :-)",Starship Troopers
166,higherall7,Archie and Jughead in Outer Space!,8,3 January 2013,"This is an example where the movie is an improvement on the literary work from which it springs. I first became aware of 'Starship Troopers' while flipping through a book called 'DiFate's Catalog of Science Fiction Hardware'. This tome was co-authored by Vincent DiFate and Ian Summers. It described many things; among them being the 'Power Suit' that Johnny Rico and his fellow 'Starship Troopers' wear in the novel of the same name. There are also side, front and top view drawings of a couple of the items Johnny gears up with to fight the bugs.Now the 'Power Suit' is conspicuously absent in 'Starship Troopers' the movie, though a modified version of it does appear in 'Starship Troopers III'. There is no need for worry, however. The Science Fiction World of Robert E. Heinlein is so vividly realized the omission of the 'Power Suit' hardly seems worth mentioning.'Starship Troopers' easily ranks up there with the top twentyfive Science Fiction films of all time. An argument could be made placing it among the top five, because, as I mentioned before, it feels like you're looking at a real world and observing a real culture with its own specific quirks and idiosyncrasies. The fact that the film is undergirded with the literary imagination of Heinlein has a great deal to do with that, but the director has given the story subtle twists that make it more timely and comedic in its appeal.Before 'Starship Troopers' I had read 'Assignment in Eternity', a book of short stories and novellas, and was yet to read the novel 'Stranger in a Strange Land'. The last work considered by many one of Heinlein's masterpieces. But 'Assignment in Eternity' gave me a pretty fair idea of what to expect from Heinlein.When I got to the end of 'Starship Troopers' the novel, I felt like Heinlein was singing the praises of a society that valued its fighting men and its militaristic advance across the Cosmos above all else, and this short-sightedness made the novel something of a cultural curiosity to me. The director of the movie also promotes these values with a straight face, but rips into the vivid horrors of War with such pedal to the metal abandon no one has to tell you war is hell, nor is any character needed in the story to represent the Anti-War sentiment. That is left to you and the nature and the depth of your own moral reaction. Simply by asserting the rightness of military action the director makes you aware that something has been left out of the equation, as I felt when reading the book. Certain things simply do not fit, but where this makes for satirical comedy in the movie, you were simply aware of a culture that was filling its vacuousness with exploits of military valor.The novel was like 'The Red Badge of Courage' in Outer Space; a true coming of age story. I felt you had to take it on its own merits in spite of its jingoistic message at the end. The movie, however, is a different matter. Like 'The Maltese Falcon', seeing the characters personified by real people clarifies the themes in a more agreeable and satisfying way. The novel 'The Maltese Falcon' brings you to see the roots of Sam Spade's misogyny, but the movie is a somewhat more playful exercise in cat and mouse deception. Here too, with the film 'Starship Troopers', you get to see how Media and Education can culturally condition a whole generation of young people to throw their lives away in Outer Space without anyone questioning their moral or spiritual right to do so.The main characters remind me of Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica with regard to the level of their character interaction; slightly above that of a comic book as it was in the novel. But I more than recognized my own high school days and even some of my teachers in the scenes at school. 'Starship Troopers' is an exhilarating ride into the seduction of Military Propaganda and Fascism as patriotic show business.",Starship Troopers

Casper van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyers, Jake Busey, Seth Gilliam, and the rest of the cast was cool.

Don't They?,3,23 July 2009,"After watching this (admittedly technically adroit) mess you'll likely to feel as if your brain had been sucked out by one of those ugly bugs. In fact, the real brain killer is Verhoeven... once again! Yes, of course, all the gung-ho heroics and macho posturing are intended as a satirical view on fascism and the likes. But did anyone ever notice that good intentions don't automatically result in a good movie? Verhoeven's approach is predictably heavy-handed and obvious, but after a while it doesn't matter anyway, because he gets so lewd playing games of destruction with all his soap opera boys and girls (and bad bad bugs) that the mere sight of dismembered bodies and ejaculating fluids of all sorts shall give us, too, orgiastic pleasures. Exclude me from this carnage! If you wanna have fun watching bloodbaths, there are enough much better splatter movies out there. And if you wanna see a well-made violent sci-fi satire, watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" instead.3 out of 10 brain-suckers",Starship Troopers
169,ivanmessimilos,Satire about war and society,8,15 February 2021,"Paul Verhoeven is certainly a controversial director, known for his extreme violence and nudity. When he was accused of making his films excessively violent, he replied that he only filmed the violence of society. The first time (or the first few times) when I watched this movie, I thought it was a SF horror with a lot of shooting. Now, however, I see that this is pure satire and criticism of the policy that is forcing the war. I watch the film with completely different eyes. I think the film has aged very well, visually it looks beautiful (it has an Oscar nomination for effects) given the year of release, and the critical tone of the film is definitely applicable today. That's why I can say the film turned out to be prophetic. Glorifying war and violence, playing the card of supposed patriotism to recruit young people, giving greater rights to people who apply to fight, dividing people into classes, portraying people as a necessity necessary in every war, all this I could not even to see or understand about twenty years ago. The ""good guys"" we should be cheering for in the film behave and look at times like Nazis and fascists. Visually, everything is clear, the soldiers are beautiful, young and handsome people who fight against ugly and disgusting insects. The film even begins as a typical American high school comedy. We have a main alpha male who is an athlete, his handsome girlfriend, we have a love triangle, unfulfilled love, preparation for prom and plans for the future after high school. After that, everyone goes to the army, where we see first the training they go through, and later the battle itself. Throughout the film and almost every scene, even the smaller one that is seemingly irrelevant, we learn a lot about futuristic society (Want to know more? Yes!), their way of thinking, the laws, and in which direction they are going. In principle, this is not a quality film because of the one-dimensional characters and actors who are not so good, but I have the impression that maybe that was the goal. To watch various caricatures firing thousands and thousands of bullets in a bloody war against deadly insects.
P.S. The cast is awesome!",Starship Troopers
170,TheHande,Grossly Under-rated,8,24 June 2008,"In my view there is nothing sadder than a science fiction film that fails to find its audience. Starship Troopers is a noted departure from most space action and adventure flicks because of its underlying message which criticizes fascist ideals, even if it does so in a rather over-the-top manner.Paul Verhoeven always brings an element of comedy into his sci-fi escapades which makes films like RoboCop interesting even if they at first glance seem stupid and overtly violent. What I feel is most sad about Starship Troopers is the new lengths it took special-effects and was still ignored.The movie does have its weaknesses and I've always felt that the ending wasn't quite on par with the rest of the film. The gritty and dark under-current of this action-escapade is what makes it stand out and anyone who thinks they know what serious science fiction is about needs to watch this film before they can truly claim any knowledge in the field.",Starship Troopers
171,HenryHextonEsq,Fairly appalling fare; unlikeable and tedious...,3,21 February 2001,"I'm not sure I was particularly disappointed by Starship Troopers; my expectations were low; they were fulfilled, with a sense of familiar resignation. This picture showcases so many of the problems inherent in modern Hollywood cinema: there are no stars, charisma, interest or charm; just an empty posturing, cynically set to confirm the prejudices of much of the modern cinema audiences, in order to cash in at the box-office. This is a truly unimaginative effort; any chance of some intelligent treatment of some reasonable ideas (I suspect all originating from Heinlein's novel) is scorned by Verhoeven. It doesn't even work on an ""undemanding romp"" level, and indeed, frequently bores. I am not easily impressed by the special effects, as they are showcased in this picture; they easily date, and thus basing a film around them seems unwise; let's hope this film will be forgotten in a few decades time.Basing a film around special effects is one thing; basing a picture around the highly questionable political ideology of fascism is quite another. It is not satire; as at every turn, the audience is meant to warm to these characters who strive to further their ""Federation""'s cause. The values and ""characters"" are at no time questioned; there is no Winston Smith figure, just a nightmarishly bland world; there were many points where I laughed at these characters where I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended. It is a politically naive and one-sided view, with the use of such a faceless enemy a typical ploy to avoid any questions about the morality of war. The espousal of a militaristic rightist ideology often seems ridiculously overt and remains unquestioned at any point, really. The acting is universally of a mediocre standard; nobody acquits themselves with any subtlety; it's often one-dimensional. That Sergeant Zim, a cliched dillution of R. Lee Ermey's turn in ""Full Metal Jacket"", is maybe the most compelling character frankly says it all. Denise Richards shows as little acting talent here as the rest, relying on beauty and vacuous posing, devoid of any gravitas. The tone varies between that of a mediocre soap opera and a mindless patriotic action picture; thus, there is no innovation, interest here; barring perhaps the frankly absurd sight of one of the cadets leaping about, shrilly playing a futuristic violin...! Maybe, in conclusion, this film fails to entertain as it intends, because of the extent to which it wastes time on the bland and the facile. Crucially, I didn't feel remotely interested for one moment, in the supposed humans so sketchily depicted in this politically questionable film. Rating:- 3/10.",Starship Troopers

174,Alex-372,The Ultimate Satire and Splatter Movie,8,28 August 2000,"I just watched Starship Troopers on video last night, and I can't understand how anyone could think that this was a bad movie - I laughed throughout most ST, especially because so many scenes are so recognizable from other war movies (casting Eric Bruskotter as one of the recruits was a very nice touch after his appearance in the first season of Tour Of Duty).The acting was spot-on, if you take into account that this movie is satirizing every WWII B-movie and information film (and shampoo commercial) ever made (Triumph of the Will, the movie in which a dying Hitler Youth holds a speech and I can't recall the name of, etc.).And that's where the real horror lies, not in the fact that large insects are being dispatched gorily, but that before and leading upto the battle of Stalingrad, German troops were decimated from 330,000 to 91,000 (think about it); not in the perfect smiles and hair or the East German uniforms of drill instructors, but in the fact that movies using the same ""props"" were used to enlist naive youth to die in large numbers and have their privates shot off on remote strips of nowhere on the Eastern front. Or Hamburger Hill. Or Atjeh. That is where the real horror lies. Starship Troopers is a satire.About the movie.  [** SPOILERS AHEAD **]The entire movie is played as one long propaganda movie (you don't know where the real events end and the propaganda begins; in fact, it might all be propaganda).Some time in the future, the earth is or may be threatened by a species of insect, hundreds of lightyears away. Rico (Casper van Dien), a rich kid (who's parents have moved to Rio de Janeiro - described as a 'paradise in the Tropics' [catch the irony and doublespeak?]) wants to do something independent for once. His parents want him to go to Harvard, but he wants to enlist in the mobile infantry. The girl he has a crush on in High School (Denise Richards) wants to become a pilot and fly attack aircraft, along with Rico's rival and opponent on the indoor football field (flashes of Born On The Fourth Of July).As Rico enlists in training, the girl who has a crush on him (Dina Meyer) also enlists in the mobile infantry to be with him. Watch everyone go through Basic Training under the sadistic leadership of Clancy Brown, wearing an East German uniform. Watch them take communal showers afterwards (one naked girl even slaps a naked guy's butt on his way out of the showers - too cool).After Rico possibly gets one of his team killed in an life fire excrcise (Eric Bruskotter's helm is too large, he takes it off and _zappo_), Rico is ready to take the walk down ""washout lane"", as his parents in Rio are annihilated by a giant meteor, which may or may not deliberately have been knocked out of orbit (flashes of the ""Tonkin Gulf"" incident, as well as Hitler Germany taking artillery fire - ahem - from the Poles) by the bugs and headed towards planet earth.Anyway, they're quickly assigned to fight in the insect's distant galaxy.As the insects take their toll by bloodily hacking through the waves of troopers and spitting huge balls of fire into the atmosphere, their ranks are enforced by Rico's erstwhile civics teacher (Michael Ironside) (nobody is beyond national service), who has the best line of the movie after their leader is hacked to pieces by the bugs: ""Rico, I need a corporal and you're it, until you're dead or I find somebody better"". Needless to say, with the bugs attacking in full force, Rico quickly makes it up through the ranks in a similar fashion.This is a great movie, and I can't understand why people don't like it. It has humor, sarcasm, splatter, nude showers...The thing is, that Paul Verhoeven's movies have to grow on you. They don't immediately strike you as perfect (although ST is the best I've seen), but they grow into cult classics nonetheless - The Fourth Man, Spetters, Soldier of Orange, Robocop, Basic Instinct - all of them cult classics, but all of them have to have a little time to grow on you.Enjoy.",Starship Troopers
175,Alex-372,"""Live"" from the front",8,25 March 2004,"This is an observational movie about the nature of totalitarianism and militarism, hidden in a disguise of fantastic special effects and pretty youngsters. The theme of the movie is an analysis of the Warrior State, which is the same from the Angoni and Zulu nations to the British Empire. To quote sociologist William Blau, ""internal success depends on external success"". In order to be a successful citizen, to be allowed to vote, to stand for office, to marry, you must be successful as a warrior, a soldier. You must fight and win, in order to live, attain wealth, marry and study. The excessive militarism, the uniforms, the pretty and wooden young people, the propaganda infomercials from ""embedded"" FedNet reporters that are passing for news are just icing on the cake. If they remind you of Hitlerjunge Quex, Triumph Of The Will, Battleship Potemkin, or even current news networks, it's intended to.If anyone is in doubt that Verhoeven himself has nazi sympathies, they should see his Soldier Of Orange - but he certainly has a good time examining why these ideologies hold attractions for naive youths.Highly recommended, but keep your thinking cap on.",Starship Troopers
176,Ziya90,Better than one thousand ''Aliens'',10,20 January 2010,"I had watched the movie for the first time at theater in 1997 and have not forgotten it since that day. Then, I waited its DVD for years, now I have it. Critics, some people and also as I know, the director, Paul Verhoeven say that the movie has a lot of political, social messages, it is a satire. However, I am not interested in messages, I am an apolitical watcher and honestly, I cannot detect generally (I don't want it anyway), but I don't object to such sub-texts, it might be true. Fascism, militarism, anti-militarism, media, army criticism, it seems that everything is here. Starship Troopers is fun, fun and fun. Years years ago, I read it, a critic says where is entertainment, tell me? Arms and legs are disintegrated. He is right, but of course not this side of the matter is fun. The first half of the movie is interesting, but it is like the introduction, you see nothing yet. The design of the bugs and clash scenes are great (and unique) thanks to Paul Verhoeven. May be you don't emphasize the soldiers, but you care about them, you worry about them one each and you feel like you are there. When one of them is killed, you bother, you cheer, when one of them is saved. And as for adrenalin, excitement, you fasten on the screen while hundreds of bullets are spent, because it is extremely hard to get through. One bug is destroyed, but then starting all over again. I am sure that we won't see such movies in the future. Probably, this is because of Verhoeven's talent. The best bug designs so far are in this movie. In the second half, almost non stop action, except for action freaks, it might be excessive for some people, it is that great. I love it. My favorite scene is the sequence that they come to the station, this sequence deserves to be put in the cinema anthology. Each time, I am astonished when thousands of bugs appear and attack. As a note, the sound editing is brilliant in this part. Verhoeven may be criticizes militarism, but it does not mean that he does not care about action, just the opposite. By the way, there are two weapons in front of the station that look like tank gun, the most heavy armament of the soldiers. May be, this will make some people angry, but I liked these weapons. I am not interested in guns at all, I have not any kind of weapon and it won't, I just love gunfight scenes. I believe that even if he criticizes somethings above all, he cares about action, entertainment. When the soldiers hold their guns to the bugs, he zooms! He made this movie as it should be. In terms of style and content both including the atmosphere, the second half recalls computer games. I don't play computer usually and I haven't played its computer game yet, but I took a look at the game, so not so important, but this is a plus. The dead bodies are pretty hard-to-look-at, but it seems that set designers made great effort. There are many kind of bugs, the design of the bugs are well designed as I said, so interesting. Starship Troopers is not the best science fiction movie ever made, but the best action / science fiction after The Terminator 2. Lastly, I did not like Cameron's Aliens, it was a big disappointment after Alien. However, people love Aliens which is also according to them one of the best action movies, but the rating of Starship Troopers is one of the most bothersome ratings in IMDb history! It was pretty slow paced (may be after such movies, it seems) and the most important there was no gunfight, no battle between the team and the aliens. And aliens were passive? Cameron says that he created a war atmosphere in space. No, this one.",Starship Troopers
177,Christopher_Reid,Shallow but entertaining futuristic action,6,8 May 2021,"The problem with Starship Troopers is that the characters aren't that interesting. They're all 1-dimensional. As is the overall story. Earth is going to war to fight a bunch of bugs. There's a love triangle, some sacrifices, a climax but it all feels a bit flat.For one, the plot doesn't make much sense. The strategies used are stupid. Why on Earth would you have soldiers fight bugs up close if you can just nuke their planet? Or generally attack them from afar? If the bugs are intelligent, why do they have absolutely no technology or civilisation of any kind that we see?The special effects actually hold up pretty well. A combination of practical effects and CGI is used and much of it looks dated but it's still pretty cool. But again, the surrounding story is flimsy and nonsensical and the characters are interchangeable stereotypes. So while it's kind of scary and amusing to see people getting torn to pieces by the bugs (again and again), it ultimately doesn't add up to much.Whereas Star Wars or Star Trek give you some impression of a world in which the events take place, the world of Starship Troopers makes little or no sense. It's not believable that human beings in the future would have any difficulty defeating a bunch of big, mean, angry, deadly aliens, most of which can't fly and none of which seem capable of using a gun or any other tool.The movie makes vague attempts at some kind of allegory relating to fascism. Accounts are inconsistent as to whether the author of the book was ""far right"" or ""far left"" politically. In any case, the contents of the film have no depth or insight. The generals wear Nazi-style outfits. The Nazis weren't bad because of their outfits. In fact, the boots and hats look kind of cool. No, they were bad because they murdered millions of Jews. There's no parallel in this movie.They do perform tests on the bugs. But this is presented in an over-the-top humorous way. The bugs never show any sign of intelligence, empathy or willingness to communicate in the movie. There's the ""brain bug"" but it's just a big blob which sucks out people's brains. We never see it do anything smart. Maybe the idea is that the Nazis treated their enemies like bugs to exterminate or do experiments on, but that analogy loses it's power when you have literal bugs. Also, the bugs initiate the war by attacking humans first, killing millions. Needless to say, the Nazis attacked first. So any criticism of ""fascism"" falls apart - the humans are clearly the good guys in Starship Troopers.Still, the action is fun and it doesn't hold back in gore. The bug designs are quite cool. I just wish it had a more substantial story, more logically thought out, with more intelligent parallels to historical wars and more interesting characters who make interesting decisions rather than randomly ending up together by chance in each situation.",Starship Troopers

This movie and ROBOCOP, another Ed Neumeier collaboration, are as much about the power of propaganda as they are about their prurient elements. We glimpse the larger social pressures that lead to war and to greater evils such as conformity and personal subjugation to the movement - fine enough sentiments in wartime, but, we are reminded, it's not giant spiders from outer space who are taking away our liberties.

And then there is Starship Troopers. I'm not going to say that Denise Richards is a bimbo, but when I see her in a movie, I'm not looking for a true mind bender, though I will say she did enhance Wild Things for everything she was worth. Richards plays Carmen, who is joined by her two Buenos Aires friends Johnny (Casper Van Dien) and Dizzy (Dina Meyers) at the highest post high school institution in this Robert Heinlein future world, the world's army school. The world is threatened by bugs from deep into space who, for reasons that are never divulged, hurtling big rocks down on the world's cities. Earth's armies then load up in space ships, go to the planet and try to exterminate this, not civilization, they are truly bugs who have state of the art weapons but don't appear to have any way to communicate with each other, so I'll just call them a large colony. Science fiction, for me, has always been about ideas, putting futuristic characters into situations that are parallel to things we see in our own time. I have not read Heinlein's book ""Starship Troopers,"" but I have read some of his other works, and the movie does not hold the big ideas that his other books possess. I suppose Heinlein was championing a society where everyone needs to come together and the military ready, possessing the best of the best because you never know if something from the outside will want to do us harm. Or he just had an infestation problem. Paul Verhoeven directs one bloody battle with armies of bugs and armies of humans, each with unidentifiable parts, each get a little more boring and boring until the movie finally ends.

The violence in his other films is present here but its not gratuitous in my opinion. Surely not all of Starship Troopers is good. The action is much more interesting than the attempted love story or love triangle. In fact, the love story is very much a distraction. Paul Verhoeven is not a director known for crafting love stories and this part of Starship Troopers illustrates why. However, the action is so intense and exciting you'll forget all about the love triangle. Every battle scene with the bugs represents a highlight. One of the biggest battle scenes near the end of the film aided by very impressive visual effects is the best scene of the film and one of the best action scenes in a sci-fi film. In fact, the action is so good here I could compare it to the action in James Cameron's Aliens. Even though what I just said about the film, comparing to Aliens is a huge compliment, this is a vastly inferior film. WHY? Because Aliens didn't have a love story in it with a filmmaker that has no idea what the hell to do with it. Paul Verhoeven shows skill behind the camera during the action scenes. However, both Cameron and Verhoeven are two directors that feel very at home in action/sci-fi films. Anyone who has seen a Verhoeven movie, knows that in most cases acting is not a big strength. He is more interested in the look of the film than performances, so its no surprise theres nothing outstanding here. However, Casper Van Dien and Dina Meyer give credible performances. Jake Busey is funny at times. Denise Richards is actually ok here. Michael Ironside gives a solid performance and has the films best line. Starship Troopers is an entertaining film. Like I said, Starship Troopers is flawed but overall you will have a pretty good time watching it. However, If you saw starship Troopers on the big screen (like I did) it is a better experience than on TV.",Starship Troopers
187,mgruebel,Capture's Heinlein's irony to the tee,8,13 June 2015,"Despite being about man-shredding insects attacking super-jock humans, this film seems to have been a bit too subtle for the average movie critic. It is a masterpiece of irony, and captures the essence of Robert Heinlein's masterful SF novel, which at the same time pays respect to those who give their lives to protect others and showcases war's futility and dehumanizing horror.In the near future, insectoid aliens and humans fight over colonizable worlds. It's not really clear who attacked whom first, one suspects the humans are the initial aggressors. You can be a citizen of Earth only if you serve a very dangerous stint in the military, protecting our home world from the insect aliens of Klendathu. The film follows four naive high school recruits (the 'hero' infantry grunt; his love interest, a space pilot; a female infantry grunt who loves him unrequited; and his friend, the skunkworks military scientist). They go through boot camp, training, and brutal warfare where the smallest mistake instantly costs you limb or life.This was one of the early digital effects movies, and they are still great to see. In fact, the effects here are physically more realistic, despite the usual space sounds and such, than most modern effects, which seem to have abandoned all laws of physics. The effects are also there for the story, not vice-versa.The humans in this film are almost as unpleasant as the aliens: oversexed, perfect smiles, walking advertisements for a fascist military dictatorship. You'd love to punch them in the face. You root for the insects when certain humans bite the dust. Perhaps that is responsible for the moderate (ca. 7) rating on IMDb. The film paradoxically manages to condemn all-out war by glorifying it because in the end you have to ask: who is nastier, we or the Klendathans?One of the minor characters proclaims, while his hacked-off legs and crippled arm come into view, ""The infantry made me the man I am."" He says it proudly, and captures the dichotomy of serving humanity willingly by putting his life on the line, and yet the dehumanization and horror that war bring. The contrast between individual valor and bravery vs. the squalidness of the whole military-industrial operation overall.Pride and agony. This one's one of the best war films ever made, and richly deserves several viewings. Eventually even the professional critics will get it, so this will be a classic in the year 2050.",Starship Troopers
188,hoytyhoyty,Masterpiece of satire!,7,15 August 2014,"Paul Verhoven's heavy-handed style is only good for some things, but this was one such thing.With this film he finished saying what he started to say with RoboCop. All the manifold little digs at right-wing laissez faire capitalism and how closely it resembles stalinist communism. The buy-in from the peons who are sure they are on the winning team.A myth persists that this film started off as a serious enterprise, then gradually got pared back into satire - as though it were actually possible to make a film this way. Oh well, some people really are that gullible it seems.No, this film was conceived from the ground up as the most biting kind of satire. And it's fairly obvious that Verhoven shares my view of Robert Heinlein's writings (similarly, Oliver Stone shares my view of Jim Morrison and the Doors).It must be pointed out that Heinlein's book is not as 'bad' as this film - the humans of the book are marginally more likable and marginally more sensible. But I still rooted for the bugs - and in this film, you are quite clearly meant to.Visually it also knocks you over the head with Verhoven's naive use of primary colours, and it was a film that pushed CG to the limits too - and for once it paid off. The critters be amazing.GO THE BUG!!",Starship Troopers
189,loza-1,"""Come on, you Apes! You want to live for ever?""",10,7 September 2005,"First we have the novel, then the board game, then, nearly a decade after Heinlein's death, we have the Hollywood film.Based on a controversial novel which earned Robert A Heinlein a reputation - quite unfairly, in my opinion - as a militarist and a fascist. The basic idea is an ultra right wing one: that before you are allowed to vote you have to do something positive for society - in this case, serve in the mobile infantry. One can see the point of those who propose this idea: there are people who do nothing but soak up the benefits of living in a welfare state, take more out of society than they are prepared to put into it, yet have the same number of votes as a national hero. However, I think that the practical result, which is neither dealt with in this film, nor in the novel,would be feudalism mark 2. People make the mistake of thinking that because Heinlein uses this kind of society as a milieu for his novel, that these are the views he held in real life, and also forget Turgenev's analysis of art - that it is the artist's job to ASK questions, not to answer them.The film follows Heinlein's novel fairly loosely. The novel is dedicated to drill sergeants everywhere. The line ""Come on you apes! You wanna live for ever?"" is an actual quote from a real NCO just before his men went into action. Although a drill sergeant is included in the film, the emphasis is taken off him and some of the important drill of the novel like ""there are only two sizes of uniform: too big, and too small"" are lost. Nevertheless, the special effects are utterly superb,and the characters are pretty well-drawn and acted by the youngish cast. Denise Richards has a wonderful smile.What got me most of all about this film was the attention to detail. Not once did I see something that made me say ""that shouldn't be there"" or ""he shouldn't have said that"" or ""that's a mistake."" So this is a quality product. The film has scenes of violence, but there are not too many of them to make the film tedious.All in all, if the late Robert A Heinlein ever got to see this film, I think he would have approved.",Starship Troopers
190,thefan-2,"""Zulu"" in space",5,29 April 1999,"It takes place in a future where you have to go through some sort of government service in order to qualify for citizenship.  The non-citizens (called ""civilians,"" I think) live lives of incredible ease and luxury, however, while the citizens go through hexapod hell, so I'm not sure what point, if any, was being put across.  Plus, the goverment service leading to citizenship is completely voluntary and you can drop out at will with no consequences except hurt pride.Anyway, the cartoonish nature of the scenario makes it clear that this world is no more real than Gotham City.  The point of the celebrated co-ed shower, I think, is to reinforce one of the movie's themes, which is that women and men are absolutely equal.  The most violent games have co-ed teams, the military is completely gender-blind, and so on. That was one point of the co-ed shower, anyway. The other was to shows lots of boobs 'n' butts, obviously.  Something for everyone.The movie has a plot of sorts.  It also had a two-dimensional but readily identifiable cast of characters.  One game you can play with this cast is guessing which ones will be killed in action.  Not too many surprises there.It is *exactly* like an old-fashioned cowboys-and-indians movie, or an old good-Brit-Colonialists-versus-bad-black-Africans movie, where one wave of the seemingly numberless bad guys rushes in as soon as you've filled the previous one with bullets.  Only these are just insects, so nobody gets offended except the entomologists in the audience.The best thing about the movie is the relentlessly cheerful attitude that carries it along through all the carnage.  If there's any message, it's that it isn't so bad to have your brains sucked out by a giant beetle grub, since you'll be idolized as a savior of the human race later on, and you were, after all, trying, just a tad obnoxiously, to win the heart of the hero's one true love.",Starship Troopers
191,Doc_Who,A war movie full of lots of Generation Xer's!!!war for gen Xer's,10,4 January 2000,"This movie is full of today hottest Generation Xer. It feels like a soap opera with the war as a backdrop. But this movie is primarly a big special effects war movie for the actors. The movie at times plays like a propaganda movie about the horrors of war. It shows the viewer life before the war, life for the people during the war, basic training etc.. The movie was directed by the same guy who gave the world""Total Recall"". The special effects are great especially the outer space battles and all of the bugs!!This movie is almost 2 1/2 hours so be prepared to take a while watching this sci-fi epic!!",Starship Troopers
192,Idiot-Deluxe,Bursting with action and cringe-worthy cliches.,3,23 August 2016,"NOT one of Paul Verhoeven's best efforts.This movies a real mixed bag. On one hand it has lots of great action sequences that feature some really good looking effects, which are often incredibly complex and fill the screen with an amazing amount of activity. Then on the other hand this movie packs an unimaginable amount of the most cringe-worthy, cliché-ridden dialog you're likely ever to witness from a single movie (barring Ed Wood movies), you'll hear actors a plenty spout out lot's of angsty verbage that's intended to sound macho - but generally just sounds forced and juvenile. That's a pretty accurate word to describe much of the acting seen in this movie, juvenile, though ""meat-headed"" would also be perfectly fitting and I'd be willing to bet this movies quite popular among WWE Wrestling fans and those who still eat macaroni & cheese on a regular basis. Just listen to it ""Starship Troopers"" the very title of the movie is VERY childish and generic sounding, as if a 3rd grader came up with it one day and told his daddy. This is one of those unfortunate movies that feels as if it's sapping/lowering your IQ while your watching it and that's primarily due to the typically terrible dialog you're constantly hearing from a less-than-convincing cast, which is filled out with a bunch of pseudo-tough-guy actors. Note: You may notice that none of these actors ever appeared in an action film of this budget ever again. Why is that? The star, Casper Van Dein is primarily a direct-to-video actor, but he did reprise his role as Johnny Rico in, gasp, ""Starship Troopers 3:Marauder"". That's right, this over-the-top Sci-Fi trash spawned at least two sequels (which I've fortunately never seen) of which I'm sure are of even lesser quality than the original, the sequels probably look more like a SYFY-original movie (cringe) and we all know how good those are. Sharknado anyone? First Show Girls and then Starship Troopers, hmmmm........... it would certainly seem that Verhoeven had hit a rough patch in the mid-90's, but rest assured he'd dig his way out of it with several quality movies afterwards; though his best work (Robo Cop and Total Recall) were well behind him by then.Note: If machine-gun fire is the -only- thing that matters to you, then factually speaking Starship Troopers is the best movie ever - as it holds the record for the most blank ammunition ever used in a movie.A good joke. Starship Troopers currently boasts a 7.2 rating - Oh my!!!",Starship Troopers
193,extravaluejotter,A Guilty Pleasure,7,17 December 2006,"There's a lot of Robert A Heinlein's original book that never made it into Ed Neumeier's screenplay for ""Starship Troopers"", but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The idea of human soldiers battling giant insects had ""Waiting for CGI"" written all over it, so Heinlein's Cold War-era novel had to sit around for many years before it went into production.The plot is a basic ""Pretty Young Things V. Space Monsters"" affair enlivened with a sprinkle of socio-political comment. Director Paul Verhoeven uses the same news-clip technique that he used in ""RoboCop"" to give us background information in the style of public announcements. In tone, these public information elements of the movie hark back to Heinlein's era and the time when people believed everything that they were told by their governments. Verhoeven uses these scenes to make points about intolerance and political control, but they don't get in the way of the action. The cast do a good job with what they're given and while there are no outstanding performances, there are no particularly weak ones either. The story trots along at a good pace and the action scenes are still jaw-dropping almost a decade after the movie's original theatrical release.I'm not normally a fan of CGI-heavy productions but ""ST"" is a rare exception. Paul Verhoeven understands sci-fi and has done a lot of work with model effects before, so he manages to integrate the real actors with massive puppets and CGI monsters pretty convincingly. Verhoeven does gore very well too, so the action scenes are extremely bloody in places. It's easy to enjoy ""ST"" as a Big Dumb Action Movie, although there is a slightly unsettling subtext as well. Everything from the production design (check out the uniforms) to the style of the public information broadcasts contain references to the totalitarian regimes that dominated the Twentieth Century. Despite what was left out, I don't think that Robert A Heinlein would complain too much about this impressive adaptation of his book.",Starship Troopers

195,sam_smithreview,another great sci fi film that will be remembered for a long time,8,24 April 2016,"Starship Troopers was made in the craze of all the sci-fi films. and gladly so! Because like a lot of them, it is also very good caliber of story, dialogue, acting and world design. Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm, largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insect-like creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.Starship Troopers is both a tongue-in-cheek satire of society and an intense sci-fi/action/war film filled with horror-like insect monsters and a healthy dose of graphic gore. That's a genre combination that will not please all viewers, especially if the tongue-in-cheek humor goes over their heads. For those more in tune with the genre melding, Starship Troopers promises a quick, edge-of- your-seat ride from the first moments to the last.Paul Verhoeven was a master at making Sci-Fi films which worked both as perfect mainstream popcorn cinema and as very intelligent social commentary on the direction - he felt - society was headed. And despite the fact that the over-the-top satirical elements and highly political undercurrents in Robocop and Total Recall were only appreciated by a few critics at the time, those two films became huge hits at the box office: because they also offered great action, amazing special effects and overall great entertainment.",Starship Troopers
196,Phroggy,Subversion Strikes !,10,15 March 1999,"I won't comment on the excellent cinematography, but this movie seemed to me one of the most satiric of all times. The way it tricks the viewer (well, except the pop-corn-munchers who gave ""Independence Day"" a ten) to cheer through the trappings of war movies just to get him face to face with the reality, the ugliness of war is disturbing and brilliant in that it gives the viewer a mirror image of the way he, too, can be tricked (Gotcha ! Could almost shout Verhoeven). The character are shallow and the love story pathetic ? But they are not CHARACTERS, they are ARCHETYPES, taken from any war/action movie anytime, a bit like the toys in Joe Dante's ""Toy Soldiers"" (whose only way of expression is military clichés). In fact, inside the movie, they are the brain-washed by-products of their fascistic society (See what they call ""education"" ?) Anyway, Verhoeven has acted as a true terrorist and destroyed the system from within. No doubt the Independence Day crowd hated it.",Starship Troopers
197,tom_koopa,"It's a horror movie, with a second layer...",7,5 May 2009,"This isn't just another movie about mankind battling aliens and saving the galaxy. Sure, it's the main plot; but this movie also has a lot of (dry) humor. It's pretty obvious at some parts, but there is also a somewhat invisible 'layer' in this movie.What I mean is that you can make several similarities with propaganda used to recruit soldiers for wars in the past. This movie ridicules that aspect, and it makes the movie quite funny. But it also acts as a warning on how easy we can be fooled. How easy we follow something without knowing exactly what we can expect in the long run.Starship Troopers entertained (and disgusted) me in a good way. The effects are well done and the acting is okay enough. Nothing to write home about though.A solid sci-fi action ride. Watch it if you are bored and you'll get a kick out of this film. I give this 7 out of 10 stars.",Starship Troopers
198,flapdoodle64,Blueprint for 21st Century USA,10,2 January 2008,"I saw this film in a theater back when it came out in '97 and saw it as being a clever and thought-provoking satire/social commentary. I recently watched it again and found 'Starship Troopers' to be so chillingly prescient that I cannot get it out of my mind. While it functions (well, I might add) on a superficial level as an exciting action/scifi romp, this movie leaves you with plenty to think over.The basic premise is that after being 'attacked' by a so-called an inferior civilization, all governmental functions, media, information, and public life on Earth become subordinate to the military. Of course, an early bit of dialog suggests that those in power assumed their authority in some kind of coup prior to the alien war. Moreover, the film frames the alleged attack so that a reasonable person would rightly question who the real aggressor is. Finally, the film suggests that Earth's treatment of enemy prisoners amounts to behavior that Americans once would have labeled torture.If we aren't currently living in a government that is deliberately patterning itself after 'Starship Troopers', then we might as well be. The fact that this film came out 4 years before the false flag operation of September 2001 amazes me beyond words. I would recommend this film be mandatory viewing for every high school and undergrad student in the U.S. before too many of our younger generation forgets what life was like before the bloodless coup of 2000.",Starship Troopers
199,schroederagustavo,One of the Most Misunderstood Films of All Time,10,5 August 2019,"So, I hadn't seen this movie in about 15 years or so, back then I was about 10 years old and I remember thinking this was some kind of awesome action movie about space marines fighting disgusting alien creatures. And it is, I think that even in 2019, Starship Troopers, purely seen as an action movie, succeeds. Most of the effects hold up remarkably well, especially considering the film came out in 1997.But I couldn't help but notice that this film was definitely going for something more, something deeper. And then out of curiosity I read some of the reviews of 1997 and how bad it was initially received. Some critics even called this a pro-fascist movie and I couldn't help but wonder if they had seen the same movie I did.Starship Troopers is definitely a fascist movie, but not one that promotes this ideology, but rather satirizes it in a brilliant way. The performances by the actors in this movie, the even lighting especially at the beginning of the film definitely give it kind of a TV movie kinda vibe. And it works so well, because what Paul Verhoeven was going for was kind of like the 1950´s instructional/propaganda videos and it's actually something that is directly referenced throughout the film. You get this great commercial to join the war against the ""bugs"" with children involved as soldiers and a lot of things like that.I think this movie may have been a little too clever for audiences and critics at the time, I think a lot of people missed the point and failed to look at the film with the sarcastic point of view that they should have used. I think the movie is clearly a satire of a culture that's blindly driven by hate and violence, propagated by politics and the military. I like that it's never really clear why the humans are at war with these creatures, but in the end, in that wonderful ""It's afraid"" scene, I think it becomes apparent what Paul Verhoeven was trying to communicate with the film. Since we never explicitly know why the humans are at war with these species, we can maybe assume that the government is just there the colonize these planets or to exploit their resources.Johnny Rico is a character who starts out living pretty naively, along with Denise Richard's character and also Neil Patrick Harris. Everything from the way they deliver lines to the actual lighting of those scenes, alludes to brainless, naive young adults who think that war is all fun and games. There's a fantastic scene near the opening of the film, where they're in a classroom and the teacher, played by Michael Ironside (who is one of the best parts of the movie), is talking about how violence is pretty much engrained in the constitution and how it solves pretty much all problems. He then asks Johnny Rico if he believes in this. His answer is he doesn't know. And of course, by the end of the movie, Rico is completely gone, his transformation into a mindless commander in the military, complete. And he even says the same lines his former commanding officer used to tell him.Anyway, I think the overall message of the movie is perfectly summarized in the end, in another one of those propaganda videos, we see that now Denise Richards is the new captain of the ship, Neil Patrick Harris is literally dressed in some kind of SS uniform and is conducting weird, seemingly painful experiments on the brain bug and of course, Johnny Rico is now a commanding war veteran, completely blinded as to why they are at war with these creatures. A fantastic picture about a society blindly driven by violence.",Starship Troopers
200,rooboy84,A good sci-fi,6,17 March 2002,"Starship troopers has subletly. It moves at quite a fast rate and the work gone into the effects on the giant bugs is beautiful. Although I thought the camera angles weren't that good, the action is great and you'll probably think different about bugs again. The downside though is weak acting, as I think they over-do it a bit. When it comes down to it I really enjoy watching this movie and it'll be a good one to watch when you have nothing to do.84%",Starship Troopers
201,hbs,stupid but attractive movie,6,9 August 2000,"I read a review of this film that claimed that it was full of subversive humor -- this shows the danger of contemporary criticism. You say something like this and then the auteur comes along and opens his mouth and blows you away. In this case, it was the commentary track on the DVD version of this movie, which shows that Verhoeven and Neumeier are so stupid that they can't understand the Heinlein novel on which this movie is based. Heinlein wasn't a profound author, but he always had something to say (at least in his pre-pornographic adult novels), and he must be spinning in his grave at what they did in this movie.Another thing that is very disappointing is that the novel had some of the coolest weapons around -- things that would have made the Terminator movies look like a gun control fanatics hug-in -- and instead they give the soldiers in this movie BB guns and football helmets. And Doogie Howser is in the movie, and he's as bad as you remember from TV.On the plus side, though, there are a lot of good-looking people in the cast, and you get to see most of them naked. They cut out the only scene with Denise Richards taking off any of her clothes, though, so you'll have to rent ""Wild Things"" (which is an incomparably better movie) for that. And as stupid as the plot and dialogue are, it's still fun to watch them shoot bugs.When you watch the movie, remember: ""War makes fascists of us all"". That's what the director and screenwriter say over and over and over again in the commentary, and it sounds just as moronic the 10th time you hear it as it does the first. Anyway, that was their point, so forget about the idea that there is anything intended that isn't patently heavy-handed in this movie. Maybe you should rent ""Wild Things"" instead, or ""Congo"".",Starship Troopers
202,eschetic-2,Is to Heinlein what film of I Robot is to Asimov,4,30 May 2016,"""Tweens"" who thirst more for bright colored if shallow action/battle scenes and the occasional (you should pardon the expression) flashes of skin in their sci-fi rather than actual battles of wits and ideas should have a bright shallow good time at Paul Verhoeven's attempt to make Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile page-turner into a 90's genre action satire.STARSHIP TROOPERS was one of Heinlein's few pieces of speculative fiction in which he let his 1920's naval officer persona (a promising engineering career was cut short by medical problems - TB? - more than a decade before Pearl Harbor) with its predictably pre-fascist presumptions creep through his usually more disciplined analytical facilities. The ""red scare"" years of the 1950's and the wave of early xenophobic science fiction that it engendered spawned the novel but couldn't make it filmable, at least then, but the more cynical (not to mention sexually open) 1990's made the idea of treating it as an enormous satire seem tempting. The only problem being the utter uncertainty what it was the film maker was attempting to satirize; Reagan era ""might makes right"" national policy? Overzealous military apologists, recruiters and trainers? It's difficult to tell from the film director Verhoeven made if he was satirizing or promoting these ideas, which may have limited the film's commercial success. It's pretty clear that in his original novel, Heinlein was promoting them.Perhaps Verhoeven was aiming at the then recent wave of Jean-Claude Van Damme exploitation films. Pretty boy Casper Van Dien as the high school football hero incompetent in any other role who miraculously becomes a successful military leader bears more than a passing resemblance to Van Damme's 1992 UNIVERSAL SOLDIER...right down to the requisitely kinky stripped-to-the-waist flogging scene. That really may be the only way this big budget CGI extravaganza makes sense. The ridiculously imposed ""happy ending"" certainly doesn't. The film might have been a bit more believable had it been told from the ""Bugs'"" perspective (as presented, can anyone really believe they could be defeated short of an inter-galactic ""Raid"" commercial?).Whatever its other virtues, STARSHIP troopers provided an interesting training ground for Neil Patrick Harris, the best actor in the cast, giving a performance as the ""smart"" classmate who winds up in a command position in military intelligence indistinguishable from that he would give years later in TV's ""How I Met Your Mother."" All this lack of respect for Heinlien's novel and the film Verhoeven came up with notwithstanding, anyone not familiar with the later science fiction novels of the Nebula and Grand Master Award winning author should not be put off by this ""one swallow"" anymore than viewers of the spectacularly unfaithful film of Isaac Asimov's definitive ""I Robot"" compendium should be put off from that master's robot novels and short stories. The films simply are not representative. As Heinlein got older and he was less and less constricted by the right wing ethos he had grown up in - and his earliest publishers demanded - he posited some of the most challenging and forward thinking ideas of the science fiction and social universe, unburdened with the sexism, mindless racism and imperialism which one would have expected from a retired 1920's naval officer.Even in its worst shallows, this brightly filmed, excruciatingly silly STARSHIP TROOPERS has hints of the challenges Heinlein would later toss up for readers. It makes one wish a first tier director would tackle some of the writer's later, greater works.Hints of Heinlein's lack of sexism were at least honored by director Verhoeven in his insisting on a universe where men and women serve and shower together in a military which accepts that disciplined soldiers seeing each other naked will not automatically result in their raping each other. Viewers familiar with Heinlein's work (especially his ""Time Enough For Love"" and ""Friday"") may be amused that this film of STARSHIP TROOPERS, in order to create some ""romantic interests,"" has transmuted one or two of the characters in Heinlein's all male cast into women. The entirely straight but imminently rational Heinlein might not have bothered to make the sex-change.",Starship Troopers

You can actually say what you want about Paul Werfen's films but they are never boring and there is always a moral in it without the message being thrown in our faces. And even if you can not just watch the movie sit back and relax and you have two hours of great entertainment or you can seriously take a look at the topic seriously and think seriously about what is said and done there and there is something for everyone there. Of course, probably most people will be overly concerned with the image because many people have a problem with people getting shot in front of the camera, but I have a problem with it if the movie has a stamp and is no more brutal than a Disney cartoon. At no second boring a still very current message with very fresh ideas effects that are just wonderful and probably will look so good in 20 years. Who has not seen this movie has clearly missed something",Starship Troopers
206,Filmdokter,So much more than a B-movie sci-fi film!,8,6 April 2021,"You can look at (and enjoy) Starship Troopers as a B-film sci-fi action film. And it certainly is. The action scenes are great, especially the first arrival at the bug planet (great score there). But this is a Paul Verhoeven film. And he used the B-film sci-fi as a vehicle to express his thoughts about a fascist regime (as a kid Verhoeven witnessed the terror of the Nazi's in his hometown of Rotterdam) and the ideal American Dream life (funnily enough the all American characters all live in a future Buenos Aires). This film is a typical Verhoeven flick and therefore enjoyable for much more then just the action. It's darkly humorous, satirical and has more hidden messages then you would expect from this type of film.",Starship Troopers

209,Endless_01,A military satire with great action moments.,7,12 July 2019,"Starship Troopers is one of the first films to present a satirical perspective set in massive conflict with science fiction, or perhaps, but without a doubt it is one of the first to stand firm and continue to provoke debate in the 21st century. It is an intense film, with fantastic scenes made up of massive battles with incredible scenery, good effects for the year and a convincing action and at the same time parodical but always manages to stay firm.It is an action movie with certain humorous touches, it tries to express a narrative of action and war based on a conflict between aliens and humans, placing a good amount of subliminal messages in what is its development, mainly a kind of glorification almost ridiculous towards combat, however, that is one of the main points in which the film manages to highlight. At first these messages were passed by head, but analyzing it we can find an entertaining film, funny and with a solid satire representing the madness of the military world. Of course, it is not a film without flaws, its structure is usually a little rough, the performances are also not the big deal, along with the dialogue and the script is somewhat simple, but even so, it is a film rather entertaining. It is not something that is going to win an Oscar, but it is something that has managed to win a certain cult over the years.",Starship Troopers
210,gattonero975,Brain Bug,7,4 July 2020,"Well this is the one that started it all. And what a collection of stars and future stars in the making and working together for the first time. But this time I'm going to start from the bottom and work my way to the top. let's start off with actor Brian Tochi, a great character actor who's been around for a long time some people may remember him from the Revenge of the Nerd movies he was the nerdy ""Takashi"" or the voice of Leonardo of the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles. he's been around for quite a while he started his career as a child actor appearing in one of the original Star Trek episodes! so it makes me wonder why at this juncture in his career he would take a role in this film as basically nameless extra!? He will simply credited as a male Trooper and to tell you the truth I didn't see him for nothing!
then we have two real military personnel who are now actors and I'm talking about military correspondent Dale Dye and Sergeant R. Lee Ermey. Dale was credited as a general but I don't remember seeing him and Lee Ermey was credited only as a voice on a speaker when the soldiers were getting their weapons.
next we have former President Gerald Ford's real son Steven Ford and a thankless role that that made him practically invisible among The Ensemble. but I was happy to see that one of my favorite actors who only had a brief 10 to 15 second cameo bit, really stood out. I'm talking about Timothy Omundson. he was the ""Psychic"" and one of the commercials to promote the war against the bugs. with his striking clear blue eyes and devilish looking appearance he stood out immensely. and how ironic that he would be here later on a TV show as one of the main characters call Psych!
real life amputee actor Robert David Hall has a nice Cameo bit role. that is used the full effect. Actress Amy Smart was seen briefly as Denise Richards friend and co-pilot but too bad they didn't use her more and as I said she was just seeing briefly But she look very cute in her uniform. another actor named Matt Levin, who like Timothy Omundson, has strikingly intense clear blue eyes, had a nice bit role as one of the Troopers named 'Kitten'.
actor Marshall Bell had a very brief appearance as a cowardly General and is so in shock what happened to his platoon he can no longer function. actor Dean Norris had a very nice role as the commander of the Troopers. Also actor Clancy Brown had a very great role as one of the stern but kind-hearted Sergeants. Golden Girl star Rue McClanahan had the role as one of the teachers at the school but I didn't even recognize her with all that weird makeup they put on her!? But it was nice to see her name in the credits. Old Reliable bad guy Michael Ironside has somewhat of a dual role because at first he's presented as one of the teachers and later it turns out Denny's the commander of the Roughnecks I don't know how I felt about him and his role it's like he was good but then again it's like he wasn't maybe it's because he always playing so many bad guys that we finally see him in a kind of a good guy role it kind of threw me off haha. there is even a young Seth Gilliam who many know him from the Walking Dead's father Gabriel, he has a nice role as a gun-ho roughneck Trooper. Gary Busey's son, Jake, is cast here as a big comical goofball kind of reminding us of his dad. Neil Patrick Harris is cast as a citizen who is recruited as a psychic and I would have been some nice potential there but we don't see him too often almost to the very end of the movie too bad they didn't use him more or had more scenes with him.
no I come to the love rectangle of Patrick Muldoon, Denise Richards, Casper Van Dien and the lovely Dina Meyer. Four very attractive leads. it was very interesting the way they made this where Denise is attracted to Patrick well Casper is attracted to Denise and Dina is attracted to Casper. Casper only joined because Denise joined and Deena join only because Caspar joined but Denise, Casper and Dina were spared a untimely death had they remain in Argentina. It was sad though that Dina did ultimately die but she felt it was worth it because she finally ""got together"" with Casper so in a way she thought it was worth it.
so like this film it is not a great film but it is a good enough film to be checked out",Starship Troopers
211,andre-71,superior action film with a hidden message,10,12 April 2002,"I would like to mention the two things I thought to be not so good or even questionable. First, the idea of using biting commercials to introduce the audience to the tune of the movie has been used in the RoboCops before. So, this appeared a little outworn. Second, the anti-military message is kind of hidden behind the catching support story. If you don't pay attention to a few short key dialogues, you might get the impression of this film being a glorifying war hero movie. But if this and a lot of gore is no problem for you, this film is one the most outstanding SciFi movies out there! I love to rewatch it.",Starship Troopers

The plot of the movie comes on strong because this is true war, and in war you lose when you win.Character development is awesome for they build the individuals up so you either cry when they die (you know you did and you know when too, don't lie) or you cheer when they save the day. Thats how you build a strong cast, make them memorable.The CGI and special effects were wonderful and other than a few scenes, its really as good as I described. Check it out if you want something really good to watch The highlight for me was when Ace asks why learn knife throwing when you can pull a trigger and Zim embeds a knife in his hand and says you can't pull a trigger if you can't use your hand, good stuff 10 out of 10",Starship Troopers

But Perfect Teenage Beverley Hill billies taking on... GIANT INSECTS?? 
I hoped the characters would all be eaten by the giant cockroaches, they were that forgettable. The insects had far more C.G.I - created charisma than all the characters put together! Take for example the girl who flew that giant ship. She was severely miscast as a starship pilot, she was more suitable being a cheerleader. This whole flick reeked of one bad cliche after another. For example: Boot camp. Boot booted. Booted by the Bugs. Booted by the ex girlfriend (who bares her breasts for no significant reason what so ever). Boots.But scenes of human teen soldier grunts running around like headless chickens, firing those puny little guns at 20 foot tall cranes on multiple legs? And what about the ships above the planet?

MI, Mobile Infantry, is sent on D-day-like suicide missions to eliminate the bugs. The effects in this movie are really cool, with bugs looking and moving very realistic, and with gorgeous space fights. It's strange this movie got made in 1997... the effects of today are not as good.The characters are all morons, but that's the way it's supposed to be.

This film is made in the same style as Total Recall and RoboCop: a satire that parodies modern social elements and raises the question...what would it be like in the future? This film is intentionally cheesy and resembles that of those silly science fiction comic books, with the giant bugs in space, the army recruiting, tasteless violence...all making for a brilliant satire that also references a lot of well-known movies while it parodies society and it's rules, as people generically sign up for an army they have no understanding of.The best part about this film is that how a sad moment happens, someone mourns for a minute, and then they're back to normal again.

The music score is OUTSTANDING, and the Special effects are the best ever put on the silver screen. this movie is 100% pure eye and ear candy. It has some good looking babes in it too.

224,vovazhd,Solid space military adventure,6,17 January 2008,"Starship Troopers is a loose adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's Hugo Award winning science fiction novel. The film mainly uses science as a background to a more direct military/action story. When an alien race known as the Arachnids attack the Earth (through the peculiar method of shooting an asteroid), the Earth retaliates by launching an invasion at the Arachnids' planet. The film focuses on the character of Johnny Rico, an infantry soldier that climbs the ranks while killing the aliens. A fascist and militant government is obviously the target of satire, but to what extent is unclear. No wonder the film was controversial upon release.The acting is decent but often cheesy. Same goes for the dialog. The standards are reminiscent of older ""B movies"". For all their flaws, the characters are actually pretty likable. It is disappointing to see Rico transformed into a senseless killing machine (much in the shadow of his former school teacher), but that is an important part of the movie. The special effects are good, but largely inaccurate as far as science goes. I must admit, the arachnid design is excellent. Most of the ideas are pure fiction, but work out anyway.Starship Troopers is not as much a science fiction film as a futuristic military film. It was enjoyable to watch despite numerous technical flaws. The underlying message is intriguing, even if you disagree with it. If you are a fan of loose science fiction (like Star Wars), futuristic or action films, then this one is worth watching.",Starship Troopers

Endless war(s) so people forget all about racism and cultural differences. Strangely, they have the freedom to choose their careers but then it seems a lot of rights come only with citizenship (e.g. having a baby).It definitely deserves 10 stars as an all-time icon as an satiric, futuristic, military and sci-fi film.

227,jofitz27,Superb space action movie,9,16 February 2005,"It's the future. Americans live in Beunos Aeris, Argentina, and are currently under a rule: to live, have babies, etc. you must be a citizen. And in order to be a citizen, you need to be a member of the federation (i.e. signing up for military combat) and, apparently, that is the way for Johnny Rico.He's cool, confident and envied- he's got the money, the girl and the friend qualities to make him irresistible. His parents insist on him going to Harvard, but he insists in the total other direction- in other words, having his hormones get the better of him by following beautiful girlfriend (Denise Richards) out into space. It's a daring move, and not one soon forgotten.Straight to the facts- categorically speaking, this movie is not excellently great or well done (like Star Wars) but it is simply irresistible. The acting and script are clunky, and it has the feel of a nothing space TV show. But it is hugely likable and enjoyable, and as soon as they get booted off into space, everything picks up a notch, in some cases in rather gory and graphic detail.The relationship between Dizzy and Rico may be rather unnecessary and short lived, but that can easily be forgiven; as soon as the bugs and the guns come out, you won't really care. A note, however: why are these armies, in such futuristic times, with colonies in space, resorting to hand-to-hand combat with only world war II weapons to fight with? As said before, though, it can be forgiven. The action sequences are nothing short of awesome, and the rare nudity tends to spice up this picture, though that is not really necessary. I cannot think of a better book to film adaptation. Offering both interesting political questions and stunningly lively space combat, Starship Troopers is one not to be missed.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",Starship Troopers

You can remove every line about the structure of the society (which is effectively 1-2 minutes of the film) and nothing about the movie changes. It doesn't become more or less entertaining.The stances the characters take make total sense when the entire planet is under threat. The same types of decisions happen in real wars. Look up the enigma code breaking and letting troops die because to save them would have let the enemy know their code was broken.The movie is a fun and entertaining action movie about soldiers in ground war with aliens.

229,kellyadmirer,Exciting anti-war film,8,25 July 2001,"I fall into the ""this is a brilliant anti-war film"" group.  Director Verhoeven uses the skills honed early in his career as a maker of war film documentaries to undermine the entire genre.  There are also some decent performances, particularly by Busey, Ironside, Harris and the bugs.  Denise Richards looks fabulous, even if she sometimes looks a bit disengaged, vapid and unrealistically clever, which is perhaps understandable considering some of the cliches she is forced to spout (""Take care of yourself, Johnny.""). This film makes a statement along the lines of ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" but may confuse viewers because it does not downplay the undeniable glamour and excitement of combat, like most bad anti-war films.
To see where Verhoeven is really coming from, watch for the massive signs of military stupidity (fleets of ships repeatedly orbiting within range of the bugs' plasma rays, frontal ""attack a la ruse"" assault tactics, repeatedly taking the enemy for granted through sheer arrogance - ""We just thought we were smarter than the bugs"") and, most of all, the fantastic and ultimately unnecessary carnage and disfigurement.  The casually brutal treatment of the ""thinking bug"" by the scientist at the end really says it all.  The film does show the excitement and thrills of combat, which may mislead some into thinking this is some kind of glorification of militarism, but that is just part of naturalism in a sci-fi setting.  Not showing it would turn the film into a polemic that nobody at all would watch, and the excessive violence, after all, strengthens the underlying point.I read the Robert Heinlein book as a kid, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I think that this strays no further than most other film adaptations, which is to say that it has little to do with the book.  Some of the liberties taken with the adaptation are rather sly.  By never showing a single bug with a weapon or any technology at all (the plasma rays appear to be a natural bug process!), while portraying them such a threat, heightens the sense that militarists should think twice about throwing their weight around against the ""weak.""  Imagine if, in addition to being so naturally ferocious and deadly, the bugs actually had comparable weapons?  The ineffectiveness of most of the weapons used (sending grunts into battle with the equivalent of peashooters - another sign of military stupidity) underscores the futility of purely military thinking in general.  The repeated Nazi imagery (the command staff shown after they capture the main bug looks like it just stepped out of Rommel's Afrika Korps, and the massed formations of troops and settings appears straight out of ""Triumph of the Will"") suggests where militarism ultimately leads while also hinting that the brutality and senselessness exemplified by Naziism is an ingrained part of the human experience that must be recognized, accepted and fought when it appears.It is a bit cartoonish in places (Denise Richards runs around as if nothing had happened after the bugs spear her in a coyly subliminal scene; characters die in mock-heroic Nietzchean fashion; everybody spouts over-the-top jingoistic dialogue; impossible coincidences abound; and how can there be any debate about the bugs being intelligent if they can successfully attack orbiting spaceships and perform the fantastically complicated task of diverting asteroids to attack Earth?), but effective.  A solid effort that apparently was too subtle (in making its point, not in terms of showing the effects of war!) for its own good.",Starship Troopers
230,Luv2Spooge,It's probably one of the best films of all time but with a message like 1984,10,1 August 2021,"I find it ironic how everyone is praising this film as anti-patriotism or even calling it right wing fascism. While I understand this was Verhoeven's direction, but in hindsight now with what is happening in the US and the world, I think this film actually promotes militarization, patriotism, etc... Why? Because the world as it is today, proved the satire of this film is actually correct.I've quoted much from this film, and the book, to counter a lot of this woke culture, just from Rasczak first classroom session. He hit on some very key notes on reality such as how the ""social scientists"" have brought our nation to ruins and it was eventually saved by our veterans. That is actually happening right now.Furthermore, Rasczak taught true American value to Rico by telling him ""Making up your own mind is the only true freedom anyone has."" Much of this is actually down right truth. The most compelling of course is his statement on ""naked force is the only true authority in the universe."" We are seeing all that play out today, even voting, though is exercising force, can be cheated in election fraud.This film is a masterpiece, like 1984, and speaks prophetically of human beings eventual failure due to social politics of the globalization and woke culture.

First, he goes through boot-camp facing Drill Sergeant Zim, and even through the tough training, he gets quickly enamoured by recruit trainee, Dizzy Flores, a tough, rugged military lady who can fight like a man. Johnny then makes it up the ranks as squad leader, and had dreams that his second love interest, pilot trainee Carmen Ibanez (not knowing yet about Rico's love for Dizzy) informs Johnny that she is going to have a full-time career in the Federal Service fleet, wanting to be a fleet ship commander. Then, everything is stripped when during a live-fire exercise, he accidentally kills teammate Breckenridge, gets flogged 10 stripes with his demotion to private, and decides to leave the boot camp area. But then, word spreads out that a bug meteor from Klendathu impacted Buenos Aires into a fiery holocaust with millions of people dead. Johnny decides to re-instate himself as a private to fight in the war, even with strong resistance from Sergeant Zim. Fleet battle station Ticonderoga is the main action point for the first offensive against the Klendathu planet, or Big K. The fleet flotilla does make a massive assault despite bug batteries firing plasma. But then, the arachnid soldiers on the planet were ready for the Fleet soldiers, with over 100,000 casualties for the Fleet after the 1st attack.Sky Marshal Dienes resigns after the failure of that 1st offensive and a replacement sky marshal sets up the 2nd attack. The Zegema Beach attack is a much better success as the Fleet fighter planes bomb the arachnids dead on the ground, and then the MI (mobile infantry) comes in to kill off the remaining arachnids, including a tanker bug.A major then informs Johnny that a distress call on Planet P is serious, breaking their rest break during his love scene with Dizzy. On P itself, Johnny's rank is raised to sergeant as the Mobile platoon finds Port Joe Smith, abandoned with bloody baths of dead soldiers. They find General Owen locked up in the port's command post, take him out, and realizing that an arachnid ambush is coming, the platoon makes a counterattack that would soon fail, but a rescue ship saves their day.Regrettably, Dizzy is badly wounded by a rogue arachnid as the platoon retreats on the rescue ship, and later dies, making Johnny swallow his pride.Now, the last offensive in the flick focuses on getting back to Planet P to capture a brain bug that may be responsible for the failed Klendathu offensive. Well, fortunately, even though the Fleet offensive sustains heavy losses and Carmen and his pilot instructor escape from an escape pod from the Jolly Roger command ship that gets destroyed by bug plasma, right into Bug City, they could not escape one arachnid, but Johnny finally rescues the two out of the way. The brain bug is finally caught, but it was a close call for Carmen and Johnny.",Starship Troopers

Using Robert Heinlein's, fifties era science fiction vehicle, ""Starship Troopers,"" which on its own account is replete with fascist references, Verhoeven plays the modern audience for the idiots they are.I've read reviews by professionals who decry this film as pro-fascist dogma. Its no wonder.  Modern day viewers only recognize fascism when it is pre-introduced with the obligatory, ""fascism is bad"" warning, followed by fascism's defeat and glowing oratory confirming its malevolence.  DUH!  When the dummies don't see these elements, they determine the film must be pro-fascist.The gist of the film was to provoke a little thought on what type of society we had become in order to defeat the bugs.  This wasn't a B-Movie, ""hey we kick ass"" film.  I get the meaning Paul.  Its too bad the ideologically challenged audiences, do not.",Starship Troopers
233,tyranid_slayer,A great modern sci-fi,7,4 June 2007,I recently borrowed starship troopers off a friend and sat in and watched it. I'd didn't know much about it but decided i'd give it a try.So i watched it and it was probably one of the best sci-fi's since star wars or blade runner.The film is about the humans in a war against massive bugs which is quite different than you everyday sci-fi.The film shows the battle scenes against the bugs and a lot of human and alien gore which is always good. The best performance was from clancy brown as the bad-ass sargent.The movie will hopefully be remembered as one of the best sci-fi's in history.,Starship Troopers
234,acdc_mp3,Never has a blood bath been so much fun.,10,2 February 2021,"I saw this movie back in 1997 not knowing it was based on the Heinlein book of the same name. I went because the commercials looked interesting and I do love a good alien killing humans story. It's a movie you will either love or hate. I can't see any in-between with it.When I saw Paul Verhoeoven was the director, I was happy to see he brought the ultra-violence and the tongue-in-cheek campiness that made Robo-Cop such a fun movie to watch. The movie is a rollercoaster ride where body parts of soldiers, bugs, and god knows what else get thrown around.Where this movie succeeds though is the use of CGI. I absolutely hate CGI in most cases, but considering this was in the early days of CGI, I thought they did a fantastic job weaving it into the live action. I just watched the movie again last night and I really watched closely at the CGI and I still think its the best use of it for the past 20 + years.The casting of characters is another quality thing this movie has. I found myself liking every single one of them, even that conniving and self-centered Carmen!In summary, this movie has held up and is still an extremely fun movie to watch. If I stumble across it while channel surfing, I am watching it again and again.Come on, you ape. Do you want to live forever? Watch it.",Starship Troopers
235,Denver53,One of the most puzzling films I've rated,5,13 November 2000,"Like the recent (and, at this time, ongoing) election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Starship Troopers is a movie that is hard to define because it isn't sure what it wants to be.When we saw this movie in its initial theatre run, my wife and I walked out afterward feeling like it was one of the worst movies we had ever seen. It was especially disappointing to me, because I am a sci-fi fan and had enjoyed Heinlein's book. I knew the movie would be different. Still, the extreme amounts of gore (both human and bug) put us off, and the mixed messages (War makes us fascists! That's good! No, that's bad!) were confusing.The ""propaganda"" segments that appear from time to time in ST are very clever and at times laugh-out-loud funny. The movie itself that appears in-between is much more inconsistent. I have since had the pleasure of listening to the DVD commentary track of Starship Troopers, and the director notes many times that the movie is a reflection of AMERICAN society and our alleged willingness to use power when we can't get what we want fast enough through other means. There is some truth in that, but I'm not so sure this wasn't a movie about the fact that all humans can lose their individuality and concerns over individual rights when faced with an outside enemy that threatens the status quo. The question is, if it works during war, is that bad? And after the war, can you go back once you have taken those first steps? The movie never answers those questions.There are several moments in ST where a character or a news cast notes that it was the humans who infringed upon the bugs, not the other way around. But that is quickly overlooked in the face of the differentness of the bugs and the way the bugs kill (not through impersonal technology, but by using their own bodies). I would have liked to have learned more about the bugs, but the film chooses instead to spend more time with the young cast, showing the effects of war and the furthering of fascism.Ah, the cast. All pretty, almost all interchangeable. Perhaps that was intentional as well. In a movie where individual desires and differences are overshadowed by society, perhaps having an overwhelming presence among the actors would have been distracting.In the end, ST wasn't about the bugs, wasn't about any single member of the cast, and wasn't about whether a fascist society is more effective or less effective in fighting a war. I'm not sure what it *was* about, other than a few ideas that are brought up but never fully explored. We have ST a 5 because it sits on the fence instead of taking a side.",Starship Troopers

237,Xophianic,"The more you watch it, the more you'll like it...",8,2 February 2000,"This is probably the dumbest movie I've ever enjoyed. This movie reminds me of The Fifth Element in two ways. One, it's a good movie that you may not like when you first watch it. And two, the movie is better if not taken seriously.First, let me get the bad things out of the way. The biggest thing is that the acting was really bad. Casper Van Dien (Rico) is probably the worst actor in the entire picture. The plot itself is a little predictable and the quick way in which they are resolved is a little corny. (I also think that the Drill Sargent Zims becoming a private was a useless plotpoint, one you probably won't even catch.)But this movie is still very funny. It is a little bloody, but still enjoyable. The enemy ""bugs"" are very cool, and the battles scenes in the movie are some of the greatest futuristic battles I've seen. Most of the characters, although badly acted, are still pretty cool. (Especially the ones who survive for a longer time than the others)I'd say go out and rent it when you're in the mood to have some fun.

238,MadReviewer,An Insult to Filmgoers Everywhere. Horrendous.,2,16 April 2001,"The novel ""Starship Troopers"", while not Robert Heinlein's best, still had enough elements to be the basis for a great movie . . . and possibly a great sci-fi franchise.  Well, too bad Paul Verhoeven didn't read the book, because this piece of rancid garbage is one of the worst excuses for a big-budget sci-fi extravaganza ever made.The actors couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag.  All they manage to do is look good, and to pleasantly spout trite, vacant, rah-rah dialogue.and are impossibly beautiful. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards might as well be store-front mannequins, because that's how well they act and that's how much you care about them in the film.  You actually root for the bugs to kill all the humans after awhile, because that's how unlikeable all the characters are.  Only Michael Ironside manages to make any sort of positive impact, but it's not nearly enough to save the awful dialogue spouted by every other witless character.The movie also makes no logical sense at all.  The story seems to have been cribbed straight from a Western (Troopers are cowboys, big evil bugs are Indians), except the situation doesn't work in a sci-fi setting.  Put it this way -- if you're landing on an alien planet, does it really make sense to land on the opposite side of a mountain from an alien base, so your soldiers can be bushwhacked by aliens while crossing over the mountain to get to the base?  Why not simply land next to the base in the first place? For that matter, why land at all?  Why not just hit the base with tactical nukes from outer space?  There's at least a good half-dozen situations like that throughout ""Starship Troopers""; yes, the movie is science FICTION, but there's enough plot holes in this movie to drive a fleet of Mack trucks through them.The effects and battle scenes?  Phenomenal.  It's just not enough to save a stupid movie with stupid characters and slow, plodding, stupid direction. Read the book, but don't watch the movie.

Many just missed the boat...er starship. It flew right over their heads.Some disliked it because it was unsubtle - from stage like overacting to bright primary colors in set design - this was not a morally, visually grey film like the 'Alien' series - nor was it meant to be.Many people disliked it because it was a perversion of Heinlein's classic novel. This is true, though, arguably a straight adaptation would neither have been possible, nor watchable. And the essential theme of the book is preserved.And still others disliked it because it was mismarketed as a SF action film ala ""Aliens"", which it clearly is *not*.But, I think the reason it failed to connect with mass audiences is the less obvious fact that it makes fun of them - and people just don't like being made fun of.

Although Starship Troopers has these themes along with the prediction towards a very fasist future, it is also a kick ass action movie. The combat scenes are incredible, pumped up by the believable effects, solid direction from Verhoeven and the score by Poledouris. Sure it's also basically a teen drama, but who gives a s**t?

243,darrenbjones,"Brilliant gorefest over the top sci-fi spectacular, smart action film and Dina Meyer.",8,4 May 2020,"Starship Troopers occupies a unique position. Based on a book it doesn't really follow, it is on one hand an indictment of overt militarism, a horrible warning about the horrors of war and yet, one of the most epic and inspiring recruitment movies ever made.Starship Troopers follows the rich boy Johnny Rico as he follows his girlfriend into the military as an act of rebellion against his parents and boring, entitled lifestyle. His baptism of fire, failures and ultimate successes is chronicled here as he eventually rises to Lieutenant atop of the corpses of friends and allies in a war to defend humanity against an intelligent race of insects.
It's a celebration of militarism, machoism, warfare, explosions, nudity (for both sexes) and gore that really doesn't make you want to join the military while at the same time making you really want to join the military.
The plot is sped along by news breaks that fill in valuable backstory without having to introduce new characters to do so, giving you a rounded view on the militaristic society Earth has evolved into.
Citizenship offers you the chance to go to college, enter politics, get a great job and even get a license to be able to have children and the 'easiest' way to get citizenship is to offer yourself up as cannon fodder for the military.
The three main characters each get drafted into one of the three brands of the military. If you're a genius you get moved to the elite military intelligence division, ""next time we meet, I'll be saluting you"" days the recruitment officer. If you're smart then a career on the space ships of the navy/airforce, ""we need smart people like you"". Everyone else is dumped into the mobile infantry, ""which made me the man I am today"" explains the proud officer with his missing legs and cybernetic right hand.
It's brilliant, it's funny, exciting and thrilling. If you're looking for cheap thrills and a no brain spectacular then this is the film for you. If you're looking for something more layered then again this is the film for you.

244,cyberknight,"Wonderful Background, Weak Story",10,27 July 2005,"""Starship Troopers"" uses the same cyberpunk social background as ""RoboCop"", but set far in the future, with space travel made possible and easy. There is an interstellar war going on, but that's absolutely irrelevant, it could be a street fight or, say, a useless battle in some ''third world'' country. The way the human society is depicted is wonderful, evil. At times, you may think it's exaggerated, but then you watch the TV news and finds out that the ''real world'' can overdo it, anytime.Unfortunately, the story plotted on that background is not good enough for it. Stereotypical characters were expected, but they are not involved in the story, they are just thrown in and move along it. The result is a total lack of empathy from the viewer, you watch it and simply don't care if the characters live or die (seriously, at certain points, you even pray for them to die horribly!)Although it is above average most cyberpunk movies, ""Starship Troopers"" trusts too much on visual effects, when it should have had a better (or maybe longer) story. Maybe the lack of a hero (or heroes) accounts for that. The story succeeds to show the unspoken division of castes of the society, but fails to show the consequences of it.Anyway, the cyberpunk background is great and, even though the story is not all that captivating, a careful view can show up many truths about the nature of human ''civilization''...Finally, for those looking just for action, the movie can be also very thrilling, because it just seems to be another ''hollywoodian'' production, but no character is safe there, anybody can be a victim of the giant insects!",Starship Troopers
245,MinorityReporter,Modern Science Fiction and its really good,7,15 August 2005,"Not many directors have the privilege of making a cult classic. Paul Verhoeven has directed two. First he directed the Razzie winning Showgirls and now he has directed a modern Science Fiction classic in Starship Troopers.But where does Starship Troopers' popularity come from? Is it because of brilliant actors? Or perhaps because of a brilliant intricate story? Well I'm going to have to throw you a big fat NO on both counts. The actors in the film are mediocre at best and the story is pretty much simplicity in its rawest form. The actors are, however, good enough that their roles seem real so I guess you can say that they play their roles of a lifetime. The story is as I said simple but that is not necessarily a bad thing because the effects are very convincing. Now I know that effects doesn't necessarily make a film good but in some cases it does and this just happens to be one of those rare occasions.Casper Van Dien who is probably best known for his guest appearance in Beverly Hills 90210 does his part without being offensively bad or brilliant. He is simply passable which is enough because the role doesn't crave a brilliant character actor. Dina Meyer, also a star of Beverly Hills 90210, is decent as well. These two have a love scene in the movie and I for one thought that their chemistry was very good which helps the viewer to sympathize with their love and situation. There is nothing worse than chemistry not working between lovers like in the otherwise good Troy where Orlando Bloom proves once again that he cannot act because the chemistry between him and co-star Diane Kruger is non-existent. The fact that two of the main characters have both been in Beverly Hills 90210 becomes charming rather than annoying because of their chemistry. Denise Richards still cannot act but at least she looks good which is pretty much what is demanded from her in this film so again it works. Jake Busey isn't a very good actor but he seems likable as the side-kick and best friend of the main character. Neil Patrick Harris is only in the film very briefly but he does a decent job in the scenes he is in. Clancy Brown repeats his character from The Shawshank Redemption except he has morals this time around and he steals every scene he is in. Michael Ironside is pretty good as the role model character because of his undeniable screen authority.As I said previously the story is simple and I also said that it wasn't a bad thing because it works. It doesn't seem unbelievable and it has no pretentious elements. It is all about the characters and how they change in extreme situations and as seen previously in my review they are all decent enough to make it work. You follow the characters all the way from High School, through boot camp training to heavy combat and it is very well done in terms of story telling and character development.The effects are what really makes the film good because the actors could have been the best in the world but without convincing effects it would have all fallen flat on its face but the effects were made by Phil Tippett the guy who did many of the effects for Jurassic Park (and who subsequently directed the disappointing second installment in the Starship Troopers series) and he does a wonderful job in bringing the bugs, spaceships and what have you to life. Even by today's standards (2005) the effects are believable.All in all a good film 7/10",Starship Troopers
246,Targe,Very layered and smart commentary on Heinlen's work,8,13 July 2010,"I am amazed more people do not get this movie.You do realize that the officer uniforms are straight out of Nazi Germany, right down to the upside down Luftwaffe insignia on their caps?? The boot camp was right out of Waffen SS (German special forces in WW2), they really did train that brutally hard, and worse, sicking starving dobermans on soldiers armed with knives to teach them to fight with everything they had for survival. A knife in the hand is tame in comparison.They INTENTIONALLY used very pretty no-name stars, and then chopped them up into pieces in gory scenes, to amplify the shock value.I mean COME ON, Doogie Houser as a Nazi Gestapo styled intelligence officer? How sick is that? That is frikken BRILLIANT!!! The capital, Buenos Aries, was chosen because that's where all the Nazis ran to after world war II! The movie openly mocks modern propaganda and militarism in our society and media, comparing us to the coming disaster in Germany in the 1930's. The soldiers themselves are modelled after the US in Vietnam, with weapons that shoot a bazillion bullets but do jack squat. The aliens come at them in hordes of 'bug waves' reminiscent of the wars in Vietnam and Korea.The reason for all this Nazi symbolism is a direct commentary on the original author of the novel Starship Troopers, Robert A. Heinlen, who many believed held very fascist and racist views on society and controlling your population.Other gems: The music is top notch.The propaganda commercials are HILARIOUS, and so on the mark.The spaceships are the BEST ships ever designed in an movie, they really looked and functioned as I would expect near future ships to look and work, really felt like they were flying them, no stupid starship enterprise here! This movie was brilliantly written and executed, and I am so depressed by the millions of idiotic movie goers who had no idea what they were being shown.",Starship Troopers
247,Sorpse,great cheesy awesomeness,9,17 February 2013,"Awe man where to start with this one. The film is ultimate cheesy goodness. The plot, dialogue, and a few of the action scenes are goofy as hell and make it hard to take the movie seriously at times but then you get awesome alien killing action and the overall tone of the film feeling like a parody of modern war films. All of the war propaganda and the whole reasoning for the war seemed to share a lot of similarities despite the fact that these are alien bugs we are fighting. I suppose the message would be that war is war no matter who the enemy. Back to the cheesiness tho since this seems to be where the movie really gets it personality. Spoiler time! Dizzies character constantly made me laugh. The way shes always trying to hard to get her man and making obviously jealous faces and denise richards. This was, well, cheesy and then when she passes you feel bad for her character but cant help but laugh at her passing words. Another part that had me constantly shaking my head was how each character ""coincidentaly"" continue to run into each other no matter where they go, its incredibly unbelievable but its easy to get over because in a money like this, it kind of fits. One other noteworthy part would be the stupid football play they do where buddy does the funny looking flip over his opponents and then they decide to use it in combat, you all know what part im talking about, its comedy. Now going hand in hand with the cheesiness is the awesomeness, and by this i mean the battle scenes against the aliens. These scenes are incredibly gory to a point that its almost surprising and unexpected. I loved every minute of it. Starship troopers is a badass sci fi, alien war movie that has to be seen to believe. Check it out.",Starship Troopers
248,L. Lion,idiotic,2,22 April 1999,"There are two scenes in this movie that felt like they had some integrity - the prom scene, and Neil Patrick Harris' scene at home with Casper Van Dien and the ferret. The projection of a clean, good looking Archie at Riverdale High in the 22nd Century (in Buenos Aires) was kind of fun to watch. The rest of the film is pure idiocy. That doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed as such, it just means it's idiocy.The computer effects with the bugs are superb. No argument. The problem is just about everything else, especially the human characters. They never do anything that looks or remotely feels like they are preparing for a war. The sets look cheap, and the basic training compound, especially the basic training exercises, looks like a superstars competition from ABC in the 70's mixed with some beefed up version of summer camp. Once the troopers get into combat they are hopelessly underequipped. If your enemies are soldier bugs that try to chop you up with their pincers, wouldn't it be a good idea to be in a TANK? Or wear personal ARMOR? If you _have to hit_ the nerve casing in order to kill a bug wouldn't RPG's and ROCKET LAUNCHERS seem to make more sense than a submachine gun? One squad of the colonial marines from James Cameron's Aliens would have wasted every bug on Klendathu and been back home in time for breakfast.Did anyone notice that Klendathu was on the other side of the galaxy when they showed the location of the bug planet? That's what, about 75 THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS away from Sol? Did anyone notice that the bugs attack Earth from this distance by HURLING ROCKS at us? 75 thousand light years they hurled the rock? If they hurled it at the speed of light it would have taken 75 thousand years to get Earth and need to have passed through the core of the galaxy. Now that's what I call aiming! Denise Richard's ship almost got whacked because it almost ran into the rock? What was it, a stealth rock? You may not realize it, but space is kind of a big place. Like REALLY BIG. Trying to convince me that the Rodger Young barely escaped a near miss with a rock that scrapes off the communications pod... well, if you are going to try to tell me they hurled a rock thousands of light years, I suppose you can't expect me to quibble that on the way it might 'scrape' the Rodger Young.A lot of people have written about the fascist undertone of the society which was played up very strongly in the novel but actually only touched on in the film. I guess the concern about the totalitarian state displayed negated people's concern over the fact that we were fighting bugs that were hurling rocks and chopping at us with their pincers. I say we send in the cast of Excalibur on their horses next time! Armored knights with magic swords chopping bugs! Or heck, why not from the Monty Python version!

254,lwjoslin,OK book transformed into socko movie,9,25 November 2002,"""Starship Troopers"" is that rare example of a novel improved for film, its dramatic possibilities developed, its cinematic potential fully exploited. Robert Heinlein's book has numerous flaws that make it, not slow or dull, but half-baked.  It's often talky, going on at length about military red tape, political theory (especially the rationalizations of the ""only vets can vote"" idea that's kept this book much-discussed since 1959), and descriptions of Johnnie Rico's arduous efforts to become, first a soldier, then an officer. The book is also underplotted, with characters like Carmen and Carl simply mentioned from time to time, while playing no real part in the story. The film tightens up the plotline while maintaining its structure: like the book, it begins with an action sequence.  The novel's hit-and-run raid on an inconsequential alien planet becomes, in the movie, a disastrous raid on the ""bug"" homeworld of Klendathu.  Book and movie both then drop back in time to the point when Johnnie, Carl and Carmen join the Mobile Infantry, then follow their careers through the escalating Bug War.  Important characters Sgt. Zim and Lt. Rasczak are both in the film, the latter composited with Mr. DuBois, Johnnie's school teacher in the book.  But the movie brings both Carmen and Carl into much greater significance to the story.  ""Dizzy"" Flores, a minor character bumped off in the novel's first chapter, is given a sex change and an expanded role as a soldierette with a crush on Johnnie. A handsome flyboy with eyes for Carmen is created from scratch for the screen, giving rise to the inevitable wartime romantic triangle. Another major departure from the book has to do with hardware.  Whereas the book's troopers are encased in robotic suits of armor and deployed via individual capsules, the movie's soldiers wear much lighter body armor and are deployed via landing craft.  Why?  I can think of three probable reasons:  1)  Encasing the soldiers in exoskeletons and pitting them against bugs would've amounted to a battle between armies of arthropods; the human element would've been greatly diminished.  2)  Similarly, a totally-helmeted cast all look alike. Telling the players apart would've been impossible. And an actor must act, which is much harder to do with his face obscured. For this reason, the knights in movies like ""Excalibur,"" ""Henry V,"" etc., all doff their helmets just when they need then the most--in jousts or duels or battles--so we the audience can see their faces.  3)  The movie cost 100 million bucks as it was!  The producers were no doubt uninterested in seeing it cost another 100 million.  The movie's cast of mostly unknowns (other than character actor Michael Ironside; Denise Richards has since gone on to greater recognition) was likely an attempt at budget suppression. All told, ""Starship Troopers"" is director Paul Verhoeven's triumphant return (after the regrettable ""Showgirls"") to the turf he staked out so well in ""RoboCop"": violent, hardware-oriented SF in a futuristic setting, enhanced by Phil Tippett's special effects, scored with Basil  Pouledoris's music, and spiced with dark humor.  Fast-paced and funny, but blood-soaked, so be prepared.",Starship Troopers
255,yortsnave,The ultimate teenage male fantasy ...,10,28 August 2000,"Robert Heinlein wrote many 'juvenile' science-fiction works; ""Starship Troopers"" is one of them.In Heinlein's stories, the young hero is usually strong, always intelligent and independent, perched on the cusp of manhood. He resists the expectations of his parents and strikes off on his own. He perseveres through incredible hardships and becomes part of a great endeavor where people create their own destinies, much like the first pioneers of the American West.Some sort of conflict or struggle is always involved; the young man learns to fight and defend himself like a seasoned soldier, becoming a man in the process. The girls/women he meets are also strong, intelligent, and independent--worthy comrades.This movie is very Heinlein-ian. The teen-aged hero is handsome, confident, strong, independent, intelligent, morally upright, and athletic.  He goes off to war with his friends to fight and triumph over an absolutely-evil foe. There is no question that he is on the side of ""right"". He gains maturity and wisdom, and perseveres in the face of death and destruction. His comrades are likewise heroic, and the women are all beautiful and as strong as the men.For those of us who were NOT strong or confident or handsome or athletic in high school (probably most of us), this movie represents an enduring fantasy that many of us carry around inside. ""Starship Troopers"" is a comic book come to life, where we always score the winning touchdown and our girlfriends are always the prettiest.",Starship Troopers
256,ComradWinston,Perversly Prolific,10,6 June 2020,Comparisons to Dr. Strangelove are spot on. Starship Trooper's brilliance is similar to the Colbert Show's in embracing the absurd. What's so perverse about it though is that this obscene world is so agonizingly normal. A casual viewer could call it a fun action flick and it's certainly that too. That exactly is why it's a masterpiece.,Starship Troopers
257,Osmiumos,Do you want to know more?,7,9 November 2021,"Brilliant popcorn entertainment. It's like they set out to make the best deliberately cheesy, biggest budget B-grade movie ever. The acting is hilariously bad, the writing is sometimes brilliant (newsreel and recruitment adds) and sometimes horrible, the movie is both deliberately and accidentally funny. This is a classic, a cheesy guilty pleasure. More blood!",Starship Troopers
258,The_Other_Snowman,"They'll Keep Fighting, and They'll Win!",9,11 August 2013,"This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways ""Starship Troopers"" works.As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, ""Starship Troopers"" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- ""They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!"" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads.Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre?In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.",Starship Troopers

This movie had good action too. This is one of Paul Verhoeven's best movies. The acting is great, the music is great, the script is great, the cinematography is great, and the sets are great. What is there not to like in this movie. Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite Directors. I think Dina Myer looks hot in this movie. Neil Patrick Harris also stars in this movie.

I remember expecting a really bad movie based on reviews and what some friends said of it, but I was curious about it since I like sci-fi and war movies. Starship Troopers isn't an awesome movie, but it is really entertaining. If you want to see a movie for good acting, see a Coppola or Scorsese film.From what I've been told, the movie does not follow the Robert A. Heinlein novel very closely. Most of the characters are from the novel, and the overall plot is similar, but the details are quite different.
I've heard that one specific scene that was in the novel, but wasn't made in this film, disappointed a lot of fans when this movie came out. It was described as a scene where the mobile infantry drop down to a planet from space in their ""mech"" suits. This sounds really interesting, I guess I'll have to buy the book.I would recommend this movie If you like sci-fi, action,or war movies. It is corny and comic book like in some parts. It is also very violent, not a horror movie like violence, but graphic war violence.I rated this movie 7 out of 10.",Starship Troopers
262,JamesMitchell451,Did I miss something?,5,21 September 2013,"Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it ""A jaw-dropping experience""(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or ""Massive, hilarious and thrilling."" (Gregory Weinkauf, ÜberCiné) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species"" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a cliché, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.",Starship Troopers
263,JamesMovieGuy_117,an excellent sci-fi satire that's rather under appreciated,10,6 July 2018,"A group of futuristic soldiers are sent to a planet to attack bug-like aliens called Arachnids after a meteorite hits Earth. Loosely based on Robert Heinlein's novel of the same name, the film goes with a satirical approach to highlight the militaristic fascism of soldiers attacking aliens.The film is directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeir, who previously collaborated with each other for the sci-fi classic Robocop. What Robocop is for yuppy consumerist culture, Starship Troopers is for the war on terror.There's an excellent use of satire with an information based advertising system which shows hilariously cheesy propaganda against the bug like creatures. The film follows Johnny Rico who joins the military to become a 'citizen' and also to impress a beautiful girl. However, another girl is also attracted to Rico and she joins the infantry with him, which creates a love triangle between the characters. This storyline is intentionally hammy and it's all done to satirise how youth is a cog in the machine when it comes to military recruitment.This is an excellent sci-fi satire that's rather under appreciated although I believe it has become increasingly popular over the years.",Starship Troopers

Also I believe that the fighting scenes, though not totally bad, were too redundant.The space scenes were really bad and the spaceships, not necesarly ugly, were a bit dumb, a lot actually, nobody knows how to fly a ship (except for Carmen & Zander obviously).And I just want to know what happened after the movie, yes, we won, but i want to know how it happened.Those who liked the book but not the movie because they're not the same, you may kiss my ass, the rest of us don't care about that.The script was totally silly with simple lines for plain actors (some of them), so improving the script and making a better effort in the casting would have been right.So, it deserves something between a 6 and a 7, like 6.5, but you'll like it I guess, like I did.PS: Buenos Aires has no mountains, thats the major goof i've found (or cared).",Starship Troopers
266,uroshnor54,Pretty Good,9,29 July 2014,"I avoided Starship Troopers for a long time for two reasons:1. It was directed by the guy who directed Robocop, which was a bit too violent for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not morally against the level of violence and bloodshed in Robocop and I'm definitely not saying it should have been censored. It just wasn't for me. 2. The book was okay but it wasn't awesome. I mean, there are better science-fiction books out there, like the Dune series and the Foundation trilogy. I'm not much of a fan of Robert A. Heinlein because he seemed to be more concerned with preaching than telling a good story. I'm sure that even his fans wouldn't say Starship Troopers is his best book. Out of the four that I've read (Starship Troopers, Friday, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) I'd say The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the best.But I saw a bit of Starship Troopers on TV and decided to rent it and see the whole thing. It was actually pretty fun. I know quite a few Heinlein fans hate it because rather than being a direct adaptation of the book, it's a parody of a militaristic fascist society, which kind of implies that the book supported fascism. I know Heinlein was not a fascist. I'm not sure if he ever affiliated himself with any political party, but I think that by the time he wrote Starship Troopers, he was a libertarian, which is about as far from being a fascist as you can get.Still, it's a fun movie. It's got a lot of action. It's suspenseful. The Klendathuan bugs aren't quite as awesome as the xenomorphs from the Alien series, but they are good enough for a movie like this. I'm afraid I must give it 9 stars instead of 10 because, well, I just don't like Denise Richards as an actor. She's almost always smiling in this annoying way. I would have given the movie 10/10 if Carmen was played by an actress more like...let's see, what actresses were about the same age in the second half of the '90s? Maybe Reese Witherspoon. I don't know. You might be a bit disappointed if you're expecting it to be as good as James Cameron's Aliens, but I'd say Starship Troopers is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action movies.",Starship Troopers

He completely misunderstood the satirical aspects of the movie. Paul Verhoeven deliberately hired soap opera/Beverly Hills 90210 kinda actors to portray the stereotypical aspects of a fascist regime where people are forced to submit to a certain idea, look and behaviour.
The underlying criticism of superpowers intervening in foreign countries, forcing democracy and a western way of living when it often is better to live and let live, as is hinted in the movie, is also completely overlooked. I mean, come on, the Vietnam War anyone?

We meet a few kids just out of school who decide to join the military. We meet Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who is trying to win over his girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) who also joins the military. We also meet his best friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). Once in military training the friends seem to have no idea what they're up against. Johnny is sent along with his troops to fight the wide-scale war against the giant alien insects on the planet Klendathu, bent on conquering and destroying the human race. Hell bent on winning the war against these disgusting bugs, all three friends continue to fight. But as mangled bodies fly, and the bugs seem to get smarter, the humans have to start finding new ways to defeat their foes. And that may mean finding the leading ""Brain"" of this insect race, something beyond what anyone could imagine.Starship Troopers is a modern classic. It's action packed, gung-ho, gruesome, flashy, and definitely one of the most exciting action movies of the 1990s. There are so many awesome things in this movie that it's hard for me, and many other fans of this cult classic, to name them all. The special effects on the bugs are really well done, and the same goes to all the rest of the action. All of the different bugs looked very cool, and were constantly a menacing enemy. However I don't exactly understand how this race of giant alien insects could ever take over the human race. Sure if there were colonies of these bugs, like the ones on Klendathu, that got to Earth they could surely dominate us. But how are the bugs technically a big threat when they're on their own planet? How are they ever going to get all the way to Earth to destroy the humans without any technology? Maybe I'm just thinking way too far into it. This is an action/sci-fi movie after all. And there were far more things I enjoyed about this b-movie rather than disliked.Now let's talk about the acting and the story, you know...the secondary parts of the movie. Casper Van Dien gives a good lead performance, actually it's probably his best performance if you count some of the crappy movies he did after this. Cough* Shark Attack *Cough. Denise Richards and Dina Meyer are both good as the two girls in a love triangle with Johnny Rico. There's almost always a little sappy romance thrown in b-movies, and some actress has to show her boobs. This is a Paul Verhoeven film after all, let's not forget that. In my opinion the best three performances here come from Neil Patrick Harris, Jake Busey, and Michael Ironside. Jake Busey kicks butt and takes names, Michael Ironside gives a particularly strong performance. And Neil Patrick Harris, well, Neil Patrick Harris is just awesome in all his movies and shows. People are starting to notice him even more nowadays by casting him in the Harold and Kumar series. For an action movie the performances were pretty good in Starship Troopers.The alien insects were awesome, the action was cool, the performances were dead on, and the basic story just worked. Starship Troopers is a really good action movie that has it's share of shooting, blood, gore, brain-eating, and severed body parts that only make it more memorable. One thing I also forgot to mention is all the hilarious propaganda used in the story. Propaganda encouraging people, even little kids, to join the army and die a painful death in order to protect the human race. This shows that a movie doesn't have to take itself so seriously all the time, it just has to be fun. That's exactly what Starship Troopers is. I give it a 4.5 out of 5.",Starship Troopers

Whatever weak message was in this film wasn't well thought out enough to stretch out over this film's (deep breath) 2 HOUR PLUS RUNNING TIME. And since the film wasn't advertised as a parody, but instead an actual film with something us grown-ups call A STORYLINE, I spent the entire length of this film clawing at the arm-rests of my seat, desperately wanting to find some way to get my money back.And I must be the only man in the world who thinks that Denise Richards is scary looking.

272,JAM-31,Great sci-fi war film!,10,12 December 1999,"I loved this movie.  When I first saw the trailer I couldn't wait to see it. Sure, we must put aside our logic to enjoy it, however, it is not just a sci-fi B-movie gorefest.  The movie is significant.  It is very close to the films we made during WWII, that glorified war, and dehumanized the enemy (this time, they REALLY dehumanize the enemy!)  I guess that the main point (what is said on the DVD director's commentary, anyway) is that war makes fascists out of everyone.  It has many cliche's of the old films; the heroic, disillusioned young boy who learns to fight after he loses it all (BA destroyed, Pearl Harbor-like), the cowardly pencil-pushing General, the bullying drill sergeant, the red-neck recruit, the courageous soldier who dies gloriously in battle, and of course, the attitude towards the enemy--""Kill 'em all!""The special effects are awesome, and the production design is fantastic. Everything is very sleek and utopian looking, from the uniforms and starships, to Johnny Rico's home and school.  The bugs are creative and scary looking.The movie's shortcomings... well, the obvious.  Why are their guns so ineffective?  Why didn't they just firebomb the bugs in the first place? What do the bugs eat?  Forget about these questions.  I think the real reason I liked the movie so much is because it appealed to the ten year old kid inside of me.

It was long, but didn't drag on. Instead, the length allowed for some serious character development and essential background information. After watching it I felt like I had seen an entire mini-series on television. You could tell that it came from another medium due to its intricate attention to detail and interwoven story lines.The violence is substantial and constant toward the end. Aside from the three main characters, no one is spared from mutilation. Every death is a bit heart wrenching as each character has concrete personality, albeit sometimes hollow and clichéd.The Sci-Fi animation sequences, which dominate the movie, range from awesome to awkward, which is pretty typical for a 1997 film.Starship Troopers fell short in a number of ways though. First, it could have expanded on the theory of ""smart bugs"" and gotten a little more creative. Instead, we are just left to believe these gross giant insects simply get smart by sucking our brains out. Hmmmm... Also, the concept of citizenship through military service, which I understand is a key component of the book, was all but left out.

Even though his parents, especially his father (Christopher Curry), object it and order him to go on vacation. He refuses, and joins the military.He joins his beautiful girlfriend (Denise Richards), in military training. However, after taking an exam, he is assigned to Mobile Infantry, while she is assigned to Flight School. He is also joined by his best friend (Neil Patrick Harris, and his female football team mate, ""Dizzy"" (Dina Meyers), who tries to make him forget ""Carmen"" (Richards).Now, after not being the best soldier-in-training and making a huge mistake resulting in the death of a fellow soldier, ""Rico"" decides to stick with the service as things begins to heat up in the war.This movie reminds me a little of the ""RoboCop"" films with the fiction television broadcasts and TV commercials in the start of the movie. It then goes to straight out action movie.One thing you will notice immediately is the special effects. They are perfect if you ask me. The starships look very realistic, and the ""Arachnids"" are amazing.The ""Bugs"", as they are nicknamed for obvious reasons, look incredibly realistic. Their skin and movements really make them look like the real thing. And they are perfectly blended into the scenes. In fact, the special effects still hold up about 11 years later.I thought the cast was really good. Even when the lines were a little poor. Many had really good chemistry together, especially the main performers. But, I think Harris was trying too hard to act ""military"" when he rejoins the story near the end.Another thing you can't help but notice is the costumes. I can see many of the outfits in the battlefield. However, Richards looked horrible in what I think was a dress uniform she wore in one scene. The jacket looked too big on her, which was by design in the shoulders. Even the hat looked horrible on her.There is a lot of action in this movie. Lots of explosions and gun play. However, despite the ""Bugs"" being explained in the movie as intelligent creatures, I just did not see any intelligence in their attacks, if any. To me, the ""Arachnids"" appeared to be defending their homeworld from invaders that had no reason for their attack.I don't think that the movie did a clear explanation as to why the ""Arachnids"" are attacking the humans. It felt to me that the audience was left to assume the reason for their attack.I also found some weak character development in this movie. We get people who are introduced to the audience, but their relationships with main characters are not really explored. We do get how they are connected with the main players, but we get no depth into their relationships.One thing that parents of young children should be aware of is that this movie is pretty violent. If your child is of an age that can not understand that the ""Arachnids"" are not real, then you probably might not want to have them see this movie. Also, some of the things seen are pretty graphic, and should not be viewed by really young children due to how graphic some things are.For some reason, the majority of the blood comes from the ""Arachnids."" You will see some major injuries, but the amount of blood that pours out is not as much as you would expect -- especially when an artery is sliced.This movie is not for people who don't like gore, even though this is pretty mild. I also would not allow younger kids to watch this one.Despite the minor problems, I would put this in your top three selections to rent if your first one is unavailable. Or check it on On Demand like I did.",Starship Troopers

Of course the film is set in space and the ""enemy"" is one what can all get behind, bugs. The film gets off to a semi-slow start but ratchets up that action to a near non-stop pace! This film is not for the little ones, there is lots of gore. As far as gore goes it is a tour-de- force! The special effects such as the space scenes. the bugs, the animatronic bugs and the gore are top notch. Especially notable are the space shooting bugs, the flamethrower bugs and the RPG nukes the troopers use. Casper Van Dien, Jake Buesy and Dina Myers all turn in great performances. If you are planning to work in the special effects industry this film should be considered required viewing. This film gives you plenty to think about on many levels and while not following the book closely it rises above to make its own statement.

Sega generation, and the modern media's absurdly fascist pro-government propaganda, from the Web-like 'click here to sign up and kill' enlistment ads to the good guys in uniforms obviously based on the Nazis.

279,anderbilt,Read The Book Too,4,16 January 2016,"""Starship Troopers,"" as shown by the many reviews here, is a movie which is either greatly enjoyed or highly loathed by those who have seen it. The question of the difference rests on two matters, whether the movie is clever satire or not, and the larger question of whether a movie based on a book is obligated to stick to the book's ideas or not. For ""Starship Troopers"" the movie has very little in common at all with the 1959 Heinlein novel by that name. In the marketplace of ideas, words mean things or ideas have no meaning. Words mean things, and the authors' words in a book which carry a story, an idea, should be what we discuss when a major title by a famous author is the subject. In a perfect world, when people encounter the flashy, colorful, cartoonish and violent film ""Starship Troopers,"" they would take that occasion to spring off to their library or Kindle to read the Heinlein novel of the same name, and then reflect on the differences between the book and the movie. Robert Anson Heinlein was born prior to World War One, and the mechanical engineer found his career as an officer in the U-S Navy cut short by a physical disability. He turned his writing skills, scientific knowledge and imagination to the field of science fiction beginning in the late 1930's, and until his death in 1988 he published a wealth of short stories, novellas and large novels. His output included the many stories of his Alternate History timeline, and controversial novels including ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" and one called ""Starship Troopers."" Fans of Heinlein would consider him as important or more important than Ayn Rand, as a voice against the corruption of collectivism and the enslavement of free men. He explored and shared his real life military and political experiences in a twice-released volume called ""Expanded Universe"" (which fans would highly recommend to anyone.) Like Rand, he is held aloft by those who love him, and those who admire while disagreeing with him; he is vilified by those who detest his ideas, and write him off as a jingoist, a simplistic scribbler of boy's tall tales, a hack. Like Rand, he uses his fiction as a platform for ideas and ideals, uniquely American, and the stories often are a pessimistic projection of how Man is likely to screw up a good thing. Look at the time when Heinlein wrote the book. He knew the WWII veterans we call ""The Greatest Generation"" today, he knew the Korean war veterans who gave their all for a war that ended in a stalemate. His book shows us a world where the future breakdown of society offers the chance for the greatest stakeholder in freedom, the veteran, to take charge of political leadership and policy as post- service veterans who attain the highest form of citizen franchise. Civilian non-citizens abound in that society, free to pursue riches and fame and personal fulfillment without the weight of political power and responsibility, presumably protecting those higher seats of power from the corruption they actually fall prey to. Until recently our own society required an honorable service record of those who run for Congress or the Presidency; the low voter turnout numbers in most elections today show that the majority of us are already happy to leave our policies and leadership in the hands of a small plurality of decision makers. So exactly HOW different is the Terra of ""Starship Troopers"" from the USA of today? Not very. Yet, the need to destroy the central ideas explored in the book have resulted in the bright, glib, ""satirical"" film of the same name. While the book would ask us to think rationally about many things, the movie would warn us away from the book by telling a different story, of a post-""Rollerball"" world where the young and able-bodied are lured by marketing to take part in a hideous war to serve the Hitlerian Oligarchy. We are shocked by the visuals, urged to react emotionally, to never think about that world or its issues. Paul Verhoeven takes the anti-corporate vibe of ""Robocop"" and the sci-fi veneer of ""Total Recall"" to bring the look and feel of the science fiction genre and leave the viewer with the impression that another great science fiction ""gotcha"" has happened to the dumb capitalists and fascists again. Nothing of the sort has happened, though you wouldn't understand the full nature of the direct intellectual attack on Heinlein's ideas if you hadn't also read the book. If Heinlein HAD written this kind of story (and he was no stranger to satire) this probably would have been a vastly better movie. Its failure in Verhoeven's hands presumably would then have been no greater than Mike Nichols' failure to adequately capture ""Catch 22."" Since Heinlein had no connection whatsoever to the content of the movie ""Starship Troopers,"" I have no way to judge it as satire or science fiction, it seems to fail miserably on both counts. If you REALLY want to see what Heinlein was telling us about Man in ""Starship Troopers,"" see James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and watch the space marines travelling with Ripley to the xenomorph's planet. Heinlein could have written them. If you want to see anti- corporate satire consistent with Heinlein's ideas in ""Starship Troopers,"" go see another Cameron film, ""Avatar."" But DO NOT see the movie ""Starship Troopers."" I find the value of this movie in its CGI work and some interesting aspects of Verhoeven's approach to production design. So it's a 4.",Starship Troopers

I had never thought of it that way. Heinlein, in his own day, was often called a fascist for his frequent use in his novels of virtuous military governments, genocide, and torture. Anyway, Heinlein always rebuffed his critics by saying he was just a Libertarian and a patriot. Now, this movie comes along, adapting one of his most popular books, and turning all of the heroes into a bunch of obvious Nazis. The truth is that Heinlein's stories were all over the spectrum, but always seemed extreme. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he would have liked this rendition of Starship Troopers. But my first instinct was that this movie was an embodiment of his critic's claims.There are lots of cool explosions and stuff, too.

The only interesting bit in the film is, of course, the shower scene. It's the usual coy camera shot above the waist only. For most pimply adolescents this has the bonus of the girls' breasts visible during the banter. And, of course, the boys' fabulous pectorals - the only thing a movie multiplex dweller can aspire to. The terrible sexism of the shot was not the girls proudly displaying their tits, which turns the boys into soaped-up droolers, but the clearly visible (and listed as a goof) boxer shorts on one of the boys. I hear it is fairly common in New Zealand sports clubs that men shower in their underpants. Personally, I can't think of anything more disgusting.

It milks every cinematic- formulaic emotion to the absolute hilt... and beyond. It fails miserably on every score except one: the prurient appeal to extreme violence, which permeates it from its inner core to its outer (arachnoidal) exterior shell.Here's the core of my disgust: I kept waiting for the obviously over-the-top asides from ""Federal Central,"" internet-style ads (meant as propaganda), to be revealed as a gigantic hoax put on by evil global-political dominators to reduce the population of a crowded planet (ours) by shipping much of it off to outer space to fight a fictitious enemy, and then secretly eliminating all of them. The Starship Troopers, that is. As a nefarious side-effect, this would cement their control of Earth by making everyone believe they had to group together under these dictators, subservient themselves to them, to better fight a hated enemy they believed would destroy Earth entirely.Not exactly an original idea, but wouldn't it have worked well here? But it never came; there is no relief. Zilch. Nada. Zero. This cesspool of a film believes in its own juvenile claptrap to the point where it becomes absolutely real, completely unending , and forms a living cinematic Hell for all of us. No relief. Ever. The very concept is completely nauseating to anyone with a mind of greater capacity than a bug. (Sorry, I just had to say it).I'm ashamed to admit that the violence factor got my interest enough to give it a two, rather than a one.One question: What is Neil Patrick Harris doing as a hired actor (with a completely unbelievable role) in a movie so horribly bad?

Probably a little different than the serious piece of sci-fi storytelling and future sociological admonitions that Heinlein had intended in his novel, but that's what movie adaptations and cover songs are for: a reinterpretation or re-envisioning of the original work.Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Ironside's performances set the camp tone (with decent support from Dina Meyer), and Van Dien, Richards, and Busey providing serviceable framework characters.Verhoeven seems to make either gold or lead.

289,smoothrunner,Opposite effect,8,13 September 2016,"Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"", along with his ""Double Star"", ""Between Planets"" and ""Orphans of the Sky"", was one of the first books that began my acquaintance with the Science fiction genre. Then, at the first reading in adolescence, ""Starship Troopers"", as I now realize, had an opposite influence on me to that conceived by the author, although it caused an intense inner dialogue. Perhaps it is due to its peculiar ""extremist"" philosophy, conjugated with an idealized description of an army life and the nuances of the officers' service, I've remembered this book among hundreds and thousands of others which I've read at the same period. Although at the time it was seen by me more like an action adventure, and not as political manifesto of the author. Over time, of course, the book is perceived quite differently, and I fully agree with and support the decision of the publisher, who refused to publish the ""Troopers"" for young audience, because instead of novel of professional science fiction writer, young readers would've received novel of an unprofessional philosopher. Although, I must stress this again, at my teen age book had the opposite effect on me than what was intended by the author.The irony is that the same story has happened with the adaptation of ""Troopers"" by Verhoeven - what the director intended as a vicious satire on militarism in general and in particular on Heinlein's book, which was almost forgotten, served as the book's advertising. Despite the different tones, narrative styles and incorporated ideas, in an artistic sense I would call the book and the movie to be equal. If the book is more sincere and deep, actual science fiction and social modeling, the film is more social satire, caricature and propaganda poster on the verge of trash. It is difficult to say which is better or worse, because they are completely different art expressions. And although to me either Heinlein's idealistic military meritocracy and Verhoeven's leftist pacifism are equally unsympathetic, I can not help but admit that aesthetically I like both the novel and the film - each in its own way. That, of course, does not negate the madness of the inflated to absurd ideas underlying both works. Actually, I would advise to watch the movie to those who are able to separate the ideological background from the artistic value of these works. After all, the movie has a fascinating story, there are intense action, beautiful actors, love melodrama, as well as an original, colorful cartoon aesthetic and political satire.",Starship Troopers

292,jpcjcpd,Disappointing....but not terrible,5,20 May 2021,"I generally try to avoid comparing movies to the book, simply because different mediums have to take different approaches to convey the message.It has a completely different focus - the book is less about the actual combat and more about society and what drives us as a species to fight. It is also rabidly anti-communist and depicts different approaches to ""service"", patriotism and governance. Even the root story that fighting is more about your unit and buddies over loyalty to a government is lost. This is the first appearance in modern lexicon of powered armor in combat (one of the major points of the book) and it is no where to be seen.The movie loses all of that and just focuses on the training, relationships and combat and does so in an over the top way that makes it less dramatic and more comical. B movie level story and acting.All in all, if there is nothing compelling on, its worth a watch. It's just disappointing in that it could have taken a more serious tone but instead has the original ""robocop"" feel and comes off campy.There is lots of lost potential in adapting a book of this quality. It misses the point of the communism allegory and throws all the science out the window. The federal forces are depicted as facist and their tactics are moronic. There is no powered armor, no drop capsules, no redeeming story line, no depiction of Sanctuary, no discussion or depiction of asymmetrical warfare and lost is the apathy of the listless teenager that didn't know where his life was going until he ""accidentally"" signed up.Read the book.

293,mhajs,"Silly Verhoeven movie, horrible follow-up to his previous movies.",4,20 March 2006,"*1/2Starship Troopers is a big let-down from director Paul Verhoeven. It's not even a good science fiction movie, it's very silly most of the time. The movie doesn't open very masterfully, but it turns out even worse when it gets to the point that it intends. The story is about a society divided into two groups: citizens and civilians. In a futuristic world, citizens usually have more privileges than civilians. The very first scene of the movie describes perfectly what's the main difference between the two classes. So far so good. What does it take to be a citizen? You have to join the military forces.This is a perfect example of a movie which begins interesting (although you feel very unsafe about what's going to happen next) and self destructs completely later on. The characters (although I loved Clancy Brown!!) one more stupid than the other, go on a voyage to a military system where they'll begin training. When they hear of an alien threat that may destroy the planet Earth they go on war with the aliens. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards look like two children on a mission to save the world, how fun!! It wasn't their performances, I guess, but their roles which dragged them down to kiss the floor. The aliens themselves are actually quite interesting. They're pretty huge bugs with deadly arms & legs which will give the movie a little sample of gore. The special effects are also stunning! But the main problem here is the alien planet itself. It's just a simple desert with lightened skies and sand everywhere. Before watching this movie, I always thought its story was told on earth.Science fiction movies which explore other planets must be innovative. They must show us something completely different than everything else we once saw or learned in order to be believable as a place light-years of distance from where we are. If a science fiction movie can't deliver that, for me, it's just lack of good imagination. Starship Troopers can't decide whether it is a serious movie or a humorist one. Those commercials are just plain stupid, giving a funny mood to the movie, taking away its credits of being a masterpiece.Paul Verhoeven is a great director though. Working with him may be very fun, because he's a really crazy man on set. He directed some classics before like RoboCop, Total Recall and Basic Instinct. I haven't seen Showgirls yet, but since he won the award for worst director for that movie (at the Razzie Awards Ceremony), I don't surprise myself so much by knowing this movie was just so uncreative.

I must say that when I saw it at the theater I really didn't get that it was a satire, I thought it was just another action science fiction of which I think I was rather spoiled with at the time of its release. Is it just me, or did they make more sci-fi's in the late '90s compared to now? Whichever way around, I also do believe you need multiple viewings in order to understand what kind of message this film is trying to communicate. To me it becomes more clear for every viewing. Not only do all the military people wear clothes that look like Nazi-uniforms or with upside-down Nazi-insignias on them, they are also all grey or black. It's like they are robots, without emotions - at least some of them. Carmen Ibanez for example, the only real human emotion she shows proof of is when she throws up from disgust in dissection class. In this perspective it's just good that she doesn't show much acting talent, I bet she has been directed to be like that.I'm not the first one here who has noticed, but the movie also has become topical in a quite chilling manner after the 9-11 incident. The asteroid that hits Buenos Aires can by what effect it has in the film easily be seen as an allegory to the planes flying into WTC, and the resulting ""war on terrorism"" in Afghanistan and now Iraq (Klendathu and Planet P anyone?). After three viewings I believe the claim that the asteroid was sent by the bugs is nothing more than propaganda from the Federation in order for them to have their war machine up and running. How the hell would the bugs send an asteroid across the whole galaxy like that without any technology whatsoever? And the brain bug they capture in the end can be viewed as a representation of Saddam Hussein. When and if they capture him he will certainly be afraid. My rating: 10/10.",Starship Troopers

302,Doc-134,Fighting an Enemy Related to Us,9,31 March 1999,"When I first saw ""Starship Trooper"", I loved it, but I did not realize that it was based on a masterful science fiction novel by Robert Heinlein. I liked the film for its unrelenting, 'cheezy' action and humor. I was so overwhelmed by the visuals and the laughter that I experienced, most of the films message drifted right on past me. Later on, at university, I was in an English course where Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" was one of the primary texts. By actually reading the book, I was able to develop a new understanding and appreciation for the film. The book is quite a bit different than the movie, but the film retains the novels important underlying themes. Director Paul Verhoeven has a good eye for this. He adapted Philip K. Dick's short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" into the full scale movie ""Total Recall"", a wonderful and welcome addition to the genre of science fiction film.I have already mentioned that the film is funny and entertaining in its own right, but that aside, I would like to talk about it on the level of the novel which inspired it. It is important to uncover how the film complements the novel's themes and ideas.""Starship Troopers"" is a very good account of the making of a soldier. People, when they enter into the military, seem to lack a sense of individuality and have a desire and need to be part of a close-knit group. This is surely the case with out protagonist Rico (Casper Van Dien). What gives him his meaning in life is the psychologically well-oiled military machine to which he is attracted.Rico is the hero of the story, but yet most of his personal life is kept under wraps. We know that he loves Carmen (Denise Richards), but other than that, we know very little about his personal likes and dislikes. Throughout the story, he does not change, perhaps because he can not change. He remains static as a character symbolizing how 'nice' it is to be a soldier.""Starship Troopers"" depicts the human unit as being like machines. They are pitted against the Bugs, which in themselves are a representation of machines. Even though different anatomically, the Bugs represent an efficient organization which replaces immediately what it has lost, just as we would do in our own military. People are essentially fighting an enemy that is the same as us. The huge insects and monsters symbolize an opponent related to us, but they also represent a horror of the universe in that they are as unsympathetic, unrelenting and as pervasive as we are. If we think about this in terms of our own 'real' battles on earth (WW I and II, Vietnam, etc), I think this says quite a bit about us as humans.",Starship Troopers

What is a give away are the even more cheeky faux advertising intersliced with action including the 'censored' signs.",Starship Troopers
307,alafolle,Hmm...,5,11 September 2000,"On the surface, ""Starship Troopers"" is a slick homage to old-school sci fi monster movies and 1940's war movies, with enough sex and gore to satisfy modern audiences.  It's a reasonably entertaining action movie.  There has been much disagreement, however, about the deeper meaning of ""Starship Troopers"" (like most of Mr. Verhoeven's movies).  If taken at face value, it plays like an ode to global fascism, so we can only hope that it was not intended to be taken literally.  It does not, however, succeed as a satire.Verhoeven's concept of satire involves taking all the worst cliched excesses of a movie genre, throwing them on the screen, and raking in dough from the masses who take the movie seriously.  This is deeply cynical, manipulative, and irresponsible.  True satire distinguishes itself from its target by exaggerating its negative aspects, providing a clear message, winking at the audience with self-aware humor and causing us to laugh at the target of the satire.  Apart from the hilarious phony war newsreels and some very obscure in-jokes, ""Starship Troopers"" plays it straight.  The good guys win by sneering at death, and blowing up everything in sight.  The movie upholds all the bad values that Verhoeven thinks he is satirizing.The clever trick is that the beginning and end of the movie make it seem that the whole thing might be a propaganda film for the movie's fictitious quasi-fascist global government.  This is too clever.  It is too subtle, and most people don't seem to get it.  Unless you figure this out, the movie plays not as a satire of war propaganda, but as actual straight-faced war propaganda.  Militaristic types and soap opera fans who see ""Starship Troopers"" take it as just another 100 minutes of sex and violence upholding their view of the world.  Verhoeven is more than happy to take their money, I'm sure, but a movie with a message needs to sell its message to the audience, not merely reinforce everyone's existing views and turn a profit.Verhoeven's earlier films like ""Robocop"" managed to successfully mix over-the-top action with serious political statements.  Now he just peddles trash like ""Showgirls"", ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Starship Troopers"" and tries to pass it off as art.  I ain't buying it.  This was a moderately enjoyable sleazy B-movie and nothing more.",Starship Troopers
308,WilderMovieReviews,It is a great film and in the category of action Sci-Fi one of the best.,10,19 March 2012,"Starship Troopers is a great Science Fiction movie. It is based on a book by Robert A. Heinlein. In the future, mankind is exploring the universe and encroach upon the territory of alien bugs and war begins. The insects are only responding to a threat of their territory and are trying to fight off the invaders. The clever use of insects as the aliens makes this film stand apart from other space movies.The cast is great. It is made up of great actors, many of who at the time were relatively unknown including Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey and Denise Richards, mixed with established stars like Clancy Brown, Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Ironside, taking minor roles. The star of the movie is hard to choose between Dina Meyer, Casper Van Dien (both of who suffered injuries while making this, Casper broke a rib and Dina suffered a concussion) and the bugs! However I am going to have to say the bugs are the stars. The use of real and CGI in this film is great. The bugs are a formidable foe and a very creative one. They are numerous and relentless. Cleverly the use of different species of bugs makes for some great surprises.The battles are epic and bloody. This is not a film for the squeamish, every battle is like a futuristic opening scene to Saving Private Ryan. People die in horrific ways, bodies and limbs are ripped apart and even main characters don't always survive, something I always appreciate in a film as it keeps the viewer guessing.But it is not all about war, there is a good amount of comedy and even romance in this movie. It is a great film and in the category of action Sci-Fi one of the best.",Starship Troopers

Even though I love to read, I haven't read the novel either because the author just isn't my cup of tea...but in any case, why was it necessary to send troopers Physicaly to the planet's surface? Why not just nuke the planet from space? Maybe this was explained and I simply missed it because I wasn't paying that close attention--this is a very bad movie, did I mention that? So can any of you tell me why people had to fight the bugs?Just wondering....",Starship Troopers
310,KnightLander,"""Everyone is doing their part. Are you?""",7,20 June 2005,"Never before has there been a film like ""Starship Troopers"". I remember watching this movie years ago and enjoying it, and, watching it now, I love it even more.Extremely loosely adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi classic, the film details the futuristic adventures of marine Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and his platoon of ""starship troopers"" as they wage war against an army of deadly, gigantic bugs. Sound simple? It is. But that's all part of the fun.Paul Verhoeven brings something to this film that only he could bring: a feeling of utter and completely enjoyability. There's your typical Verhoeven sex and outrageous violence/bloodiness - which just helps add to the film's black comedy feeling.Speaking of which, the film is hilarious. Depending on what you expect from the film - if you're expecting ""Platoon"" in the future, you're apt to be disappointed. Sci-fi fans will feel like they're in heaven, while laughing their - cicadas - off at the same time.The cast is terrific. Casper Van Dien plays Rico with determined perfection; Denise Richards and Dina Meyer are Rico's babes; Jake Busey is Rico's frequently troublesome/annoying pal; Clancy Brown is a flawless Sgt. Zim and Michael Ironside is a great Rasczak.Edward Neumeier's outrageous script is a major improvement over frequently master author Heinlein's depressing, pointless novel. Basil Poledouris also provides an energetic, adventurous, and heroic score.Also worth mentioning is the outstanding special effects, by master Phil Tippett. The bugs are almost always extremely realistic and expertly designed. Excellent.There has never been and likely will never again be a film like ""Starship Troopers"". With Paul Verhoeven's trademark direction, the cast's fitting performances, Edward Neumeier's flawlessly entertaining script and Phil Tippett's outstanding special effects, what more could you want?",Starship Troopers

The graphics for the most part still hold up today, the acting is very 90s but that doesn't make it unenjoyable at all.

312,gbghykwg,When you order subversion on wish.com,5,17 August 2021,"This movie is based on a book that's basically straight fascist propaganda. Verhoeven apparently tries to subvert the message, but fails tragically. The few satirical elements are great in isolation but they they don't fit to the story at all and feel like they were added as an afterthought. In the end the fascists win and nobody has to learn anything. Just why?It's still 5 stars for its high production value, exciting gory action, and a very special kind of humour that is rare in such movies.",Starship Troopers

314,shawny11_2001,Morder-day Satire at its Best,8,13 February 2006,"Granted, I am a huge Heinlein fan, and at first I was incredibly disappointed with the lack of continuity with the novel, but as I've gotten older, and more jaded mind you, this film really makes a lot of sense. (I was just a lowly freshman in high school when it first came out...so the satire didn't make sense).Satire is a powerful tool (see Jonathan Swift), and when used properly, can comment on anything and everything, and all at the same time. Starship Troopers does that perfectly well, with the pro/anti-war movements, politics, the military, teenage angst, and overall, the impact that propaganda has on us too (its in all the little blurbs that interrupt the film). Verhoeven is truly a master at portraying satire, while Ed Nuemier writes it perfectly, with a great blending of action, sex, and a bit of suspense. Basil Poledouris' score, with the massive amounts of bass (oh how I love THX sound) and marches are what top this off. The marches are fantastic, and the subtle references to satire (see the last propaganda scene in the movie and you'll understand completely) top off this flick. Enjoyable, fun, and a downright riot are what describe Starship Troopers.",Starship Troopers
315,jeffchan,A great SciFi film on second viewing,10,19 November 1998,"Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is far from perfect, but on second viewing this is one hell of a rockin' flick.  I enjoyed it better the this time since the amazing special effects and highly-stylized mood were *less* of a surprise.  The flow of the story, seamless and brilliantly-crafted effects, pace and look of the film really drew me in.  The work's overall integrity helped me suspend belief and join the fantasy that we're space soldiers on a mission to exact revenge on giant, vicious bugs.  Not everyone may like the style or politics, but they're so well presented that watching them unfold is a genuine thrill-ride.The Science Fiction would have been very different if they'd found a way to show Heinlein's armored power-suits.  The resulting creature effects and battle scenes and perhaps the movie in general would have had a very different feel.  This is probably the biggest letdown since the suits were central to the book.  Yet the social issues, love interests, and gung-ho space adventure come through loud and clear.  On the merits of clean flow, story and effects, this is one of the best movies yet made.",Starship Troopers
316,Jimmy Jimmereeno,Very misunderstood,8,19 February 2000,"As has been said in other reviews, you can't take this movie seriously. It is full of terrible acting and cheesy one-liners. And hopefully it was intended to be like this. I really want to see a DVD with a director commentary. Anyhow, this is a very in-depth story of young people who sign up for the military of the future. It is total satire of military politics and World War II propaganda films. Even excessive gore(which should be expected from Paul Verehoven) is humorous in places. I say in-depth because the story follows the flawlessly beautiful plastic teenagers from high school graduation to military enlistment to boot camp and finally to war. Most sci/fi movies would drop a space ship of people on a planet with aliens and watch them all die. This is a smarter, funnier movie than I thought I was going to see. Fans of the Robert Heinlen book say it's really different from the book but as a stand alone movie it is very good.",Starship Troopers
317,TermlnatriX,an uncompromising satire,9,23 May 2008,"The beauty of rewatching films (8 years for this one) lies in picking up on certain things you have overlooked on your first viewing. Well, in the case of Starship Troopers I would recommend every single one who saw it and thought it was ""merely a bug shoot-em-up in space"", to give it another run. This is a misunderstood classic; Paul Verhoeven's hour. And I don't know whether it's truly a good or a bad thing that the people deeply misunderstood what Verhoeven was trying to say. Maybe that only proves Verhoeven's little ""Would You Like to Know More?"" inserts as evidence of massive brainwash that occurs in the media (in the film) and in modern day world. This is an uncompromising satire of American imperialism and a vision of a future that's becoming more real each day, not in the sense of conquering planets but countries. I simply love Verhoeven's detail-orientedness. Such small details as a whole colonization of Buenos Aires by Americans, to metaphors which include bugs as the ""enemy"". What about those uniforms that Jenkins wears towards the third act which uncannily resemble a Gestapo officer? Yes folks, this not only touches on imperialism, but contains major fascist overtones; full allegiance to the state (I swear allegiance to the flag... ring a bell?) This is a misunderstood masterpiece, and its' core genius lies in the fact that it's masked so well as a ""brainless"", violent, shoot-em-up bug film in space.BIG Kudos to you Mr. Verhoeven.",Starship Troopers

Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics.It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory.I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today.The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand.

On the surface its a mindless action film with vapid yet attractive characters who seem oblivious to the seriousness of their situation. Underneath the surface you have a harsh criticism of a militaristic society that struggles to justify its existence by engaging in continuous warfare. The ""would you like to know more"" segments dole out war propaganda yet under analysis also spill out quiet truths. Some interesting facts revealed during the movie were that there was no need to attack the bugs at all, the bug planet was on the other side of the galaxy, and the ""bug meteor"" attacks couldn't be attributed to the bugs themselves. By the end of the movie you are given more propaganda snippets which contrast starkly to the reality that you learn during the movie, and you realize that humanity is doomed to defeat and destruction, and it was all avoidable.Interestingly, the movie ends on a high note, with patriotic fervor.

320,NikTesla,The quintessential military grunt recruitment movie.,1,5 September 1998,"RAH mst still be rolling in his grave after this hack job.I was hoping that an RAH novel would get decent treatment at the hands of a director that is, by and large, good at his job (witness Robocop and Total Recall and forget Showgirls).Unfortunately I was sadly mistaken. This movie bares little relationship to the book except the title and the characters names. It was turned into a unhappy mix of soap opera and gungho Marine recruitment advert (begging the question: just how much did the military pay PV for this thing).Gone are the power armour suits, the other battles that the Troopers are involved in, the training in different conditions, the different casts in Bug society. In comes a needless love story, brain sucking aliens and more blood and gore than a slasher flick.We have seen it before in Hollywood's sojourns into Science Fiction books. For example, take the movie War of the World (and bury it in the middle of a volcano PLEASE!), Dune and, more recently, another one of RAH's books, Puppet Masters.I was left feeling nothing for the characters that had much appeal in the book. The movie characters reminded me of cardboard cutouts, no matter how tasty they look (Denise Richards being a case in point). The trite ending left me cold. Another ""kick their ass to hell and no more problems"" ending that seems to permeate movies, even when the story says otherwise.Unfortunately Hollywood seems to be relying on special effects to pull people into a theatre now rather than a coherent storyline and characters you can feel something for other than a twitch in the groin.If I had been involved in the production of the movie, my name would have been replaced by the venerable Alan Smithee. Thankfully I wasn't involved.Rest in peace Robert.

On the one hand it's full of actors who would have been at home in a soap opera, with a shallow sci fi action plot. On the other hand, it's great!It's as if Paul Verhoeven was the only person involved in the production of the film that knew he was making a satire. Either that or he wanted it to be subtle and he made it too subtle for much of the audience.The ""good guys"" (i.e. planet Earth) are made up of an abhorrent fascist society that praises might and power above all else. It's almost understandable that the alien bugs are trying to wipe us out. Still, the film powers through and makes it look like the good guys are actually fighting for something that is worth fighting for.Ultimately this is a film I watched in the cinema on first release and I come back to it every couple of years. For me at least it has stood the test of time and Verhoeven's vision shines through. Take the film for what it is and you'll have a lot of fun with it.",Starship Troopers

This is one of the most unimaginably stupid movies I have every had the displeasure of watching. I can only reason that this movie has more than two stars because of a particular scene which was probably many internet fanboys' first exposure to nudity back in the 90s.I don't understand how people can defend this film as nuanced satire with a straight face. Worse yet, how they can claim critics simply ""didn't get"" the satirical wit. There is absolutely no satirical wit in this pathetic excuse for an action movie. The fascist, pro- war symbolism is overbearing and obvious and in no way compares to the multitude of truly great films which have echoed the anti-war sentiment. This movie is not clever, nuanced, or even mildly interesting in its plot or motif and I fear for the intelligence of people who claim otherwise.Then they call this science fiction. I've never heard such slander against the genre. Science fiction is Blade Runner, 2001, The Prestige. When are the people who sort movies by genre going to learn that science fiction is more than spaceships and lasers? No, this is nothing more than a cheaply made, poorly acted, action movie with some banal symbolism thrown in for good measure.But at last, many review this film from the perspective that it is simply good ol' brain dead fun. Brain dead it certainly is, but only about as fun as watching paint dry. Don't make the same mistake I did. You will never get back the time lost watching this drivel.",Starship Troopers

They're the best in the business and some of their best work shines here.In movies like this, there usually are problems with character development and dialog in movies like this. Even though there were SOME problems, it was written well enough to be a very entertaining movie. Instead of aliens with big heads, weird guns, and just happen to speak English, here's a movie that takes a mostly harmless species on Earth and turns it into a frightening, verbal-less, enemy.The only problem I had, which a lot of people seemed to have had, was the idea that you could take down these massive and bloodthirsty creatures with weak armor and machine guns. This is a sci-fi movie where energy weapons would've been much appreciated. I personally wished they had made tanks to storm the ground with. They would be heavily armed and big enough to take down even the most ferocious bug.Besides that, being the worst flaw, it really wasn't a bad movie.",Starship Troopers

I, for one, dismissed it as a silly gore-fest when I saw it in the theaters, but now, watching it again, I see that it's much more than that: it's a very subtle satire. Maybe it's the effect of the times we live in now, but it seems so obvious to me now, I can't imagine how I missed it to begin with. Starship Troopers is, and always was, a jab at jingoistic flag-waving militarism, and more of a rebuttal than an adaptation of the original Heinlein work on which it's based.In the future word that Verhoven creates, people aren't citizens until they've served in the military, and perfect-looking soldiers are sent into hopeless battles to fight an enemy whom they don't even understand. Throughout the movie, we follow three different youths as they take divergent, but similar paths in service of the earth military fighting in the War against the Bugs. And at the end of the movie, when the space marines finally capture the 'brain bug', Neil Patrick Harris' character exclaims that ""it's scared"" to whooping shouts of joy from the assembled marines. It's this scene which best illustrates the dichotomy between the magnitude of their struggle and the meaninglessness of it all that gives the movie it's very subtle sense of irony amidst the over-the-top presentation. And it's this subtle jab which drives home the message of the movie that was missed by most of us the first time around - that, at the end, nothing has really changed, and the earthlings have basically become the same as the bugs whom they've fought so hard against.",Starship Troopers

But, this film is just too American.Its meant to be in the future, the world is run by a single government which is based on the American system (a sky Marshall instead of a president). To move things about, they put the seat of government in Geneva and base the film in Buenos Aires. They are about as Swiss or Argentinian as the England Cricket Team are. This is fooling no one. Bung them in Southb America, make a few names sound Spanish and hey no-one will realise we have cast the entire film out of Americans, set the whole thing as if its an American government and, oo, have an all American cast.

I'm a Sci-Fi buff and think this is entertainment in the tradition of the 1950's, with upscale graphics and a very unique Recruitment Poster twist.  Hey guys and gals... the whole movie was goof on a futuristic recruitment promo.  Don't you get it?The acting was campy and well directed.  The most superificial survive and the truly brave and committed perish.  Remember that no good deed goes unpunished.  Kind of like real life.And those bugs...

Combine this with the initial arrogance of the earth's military and deficiency in weaponry and you have a splatteringly exciting creation.  Come to think of it, wouldn't insect spray have been a great weapon of choice?So please... stop comparing paper to disk.

The film is a tedious and moronic teen comedy set in outer space. That's the gist of it. The late 90's saw the rise of the teen horror film a la Scream, I know what you did last summer and final destination. Starship Trooper merely emulates this to a tee, in a much stupider and more boring way, using a sci-fi bug hunt as backdrop instead of a slasher.All the teen actors are really REALLY bad. Casper Van Dien and his love interest laughably so. The movie looks cheap, plastic -looking set, terrible costumes...

Paul Verhoeven, a Jesuit scholar and former director of Dutch soap operas, claims that none of his early efforts were intended to be ""art films"", but they were regarded that way by most Americans, who think anything foreign is art.

It is pure fun but it also shows a very good look at the way the army manipulates young people to join by disguising war as something patriotic and something to be proud of. The real gems in this movie are the action scenes and the aliens themselves. The battle scenes capture a sense of epic scale ( the siege on the outpost will instantly make you think of Zulu ). Through the course of the human-arachnid war we see the relationships of the soldiers develop into brotherhood and how they all end up staying close together through the conflict.

This might also be the misguided attempt of some kind of a fascist dutch guy who misses the good old days of the 1940´s.

Wooden, uncreative writing, equally stiff acting, even bad satirical propaganda. I have nothing good to say about this movie. It's campy, but not in a good way.",Starship Troopers
335,motorfocus82,Movie and book,10,21 August 2012,"I'm giving this ten out of ten, and I think the 'why' will be complicated, because if the collected opinions of this review board are any indication, my opinion will make no sense.I saw this for the first time as a teenager soon after its release on video. I thought it was fun and exciting and hilarious in the way it cheesed on the propaganda. I still hold this opinion, basically, although if I hadn't read the book, I'd probably have given the movie maybe a seven or eight.But I did read the book, while in Iraq. My appreciation for it has only grown in the years since, and that's quite a thing because I really loved it when I read it. It's on the Marine Corps recommended reading list (I'm Army, and just got to it by word of mouth. I didn't associate it with the movie for a while in any way).After exposure to the book, the satire of the movie goes from being hilariously overblown upon an ignorant viewing, to something much more relevant ideologically. The book's perspective on merit, values, respect and entitlement do not lend themselves to the medium of film except in the most emotionally dense way possible, so it's no surprise that the movie didn't touch on this stuff. In loyalty to its idea, Verhoeven does no justice to Heinlein, who's other works include such culturally seditious classics as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land, and ST the movie paints with a simpleminded brush that can't be seen as a criticism of Heinlein's views on lack of sophistication alone. But where Verhoeven does do justice to the book is in the simple fact that he uses an engaging story to present a point of view without compromise, just like Heinlein did. And it is a liberal point of view, complete with the opinion that conflicts of interest all have their root in misunderstanding, complete with an inherently evil establishment of power, complete with the apotheosis of victimhood and empathy, shown here by being mostly devoid in the society as presented. This movie compares interestingly to RoboCop, another piece of Verhoeven brilliance with an uncompromising worldview.ST is not subtle satire: It's so bombastically blunt that it takes an incredibly low level of intelligence to take the film on its face and anyone who does so is the perfect argument for why Heinlein thought limiting voting rights might be a good idea. It's just right THERE, Nazi Melrose Space for the viewing free of anything remotely resembling a need for critical thought in order to criticize. It has Doogie Howser in an SS trenchcoat, for Christ's sake. You can just look at the thing and tell aesthetically that it's ridiculous. Verhoeven is not stupid and did this on purpose, and had to do so, because he had to know that any more subtle criticism of militaristic government would be lost on most viewers. And yet, still, people take it seriously as military propaganda.One more part of the book thoroughly ignored was Heinlein's take on the future between the year he was writing and the unstated year of the book. It was the late fifties when he wrote ST, not long after the birth of rock and roll and the explosion of teen-oriented pop culture. His take was that increasingly poor parenting and excessively soft perspectives on authority would create a world where juvenile delinquency was rampant. He should have added one more thing to round out this picture and become a prophet: An all-encompassing dumbing-down of culture. Look at politics, look at ideology, look at the fate of religion, look at consumerism in all its glory. The book has a limited readership by nature. It's a book, and we don't read much. The movie made the mistake of being too sophisticated for its audience. That doesn't mean that it's terribly sophisticated, just too much so for American moviegoers. But it reaches a unique sort of perfection for anyone approaching with an active mind and a sense of humor. There's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying it with your brain turned off, so long as you remember to turn it back on.",Starship Troopers
336,mfredenburg,Heinlein is rolling in his grave!,1,4 April 2007,"I am a long-time Heinlein fan and have read Starship Troopers.Being a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Robert Heinlein had a lot of respect for military service as a way to serve humanity in a cause bigger than yourself. Starship Troopers, the book, was built around the theme of service. It is a pretty controversial book in that Heinlein makes the case that only those who have served in the military, i.e. served a cause bigger than themselves, should be enfranchised with the vote as they have demonstrated themselves to be responsible enough to think about more than just themselves.You won't get any of that out of the film. Instead you will get mindless action and violence that portrays the military as incompetent and fascist.(Combined-arm tactics - what's that?)The betrayal of Heinlein is so complete that it cannot be a mere accident. Clearly the writers and director of the Starship Troopers movie despised Heinlein's views. Disagreeing with Heinlein is their right, but it is both scummy and unethical of them to use Heinlein's name to convey a message that is the polar opposite of what Heinlein believed. Perhaps if you go to this movie looking for some good mindless action and some pretty faces you won't be disappointed; as I was, but make no mistake you are not seeing anything truly related to the book this film was allegedly based on.",Starship Troopers

ST takes a different approach to viewing a movie that you will have to find out yourself. Forget the Beverly Hills 90210 cast and enjoy the movie for what it is...entertainment.

This is the dumbest, poorly acted film ever and the idea that it is still smarter than the audience is just film buffs being their usual condescending selves.I get the satirical pokes at fascism. But there was no indication that this movie didn't intend to be taken seriously on some level. It was marketed to be in the same category as Independence Day or Aliens, only it clearly had a weaker script and actors to work with. This is not a big budget B-Movie, that was intended to be enjoyed for being bad. I can appreciate and have fun with the likes of Sharknado for being what they are. That's not what's going on here.Total Recall and Robocop were intended to be enjoyed at face value, just in a warped and twisted future setting, and Verhoven intended the same with this. The level of effort that went into the special effects alone make that clear. Wouldn't surprise me at if the hokey recruitment advertisements were added after the fact because they realized what a horrible film they put together and needed to give themselves a creative excuse.This film is just Running Man.

It is not satire - it is stupidity, pure and simple. I read the original Heinlein novel as a boy in the 60's, and then reread it before I saw this flick - obviously, there is no comparison. Although the book is not anything I ever raved about, it is far more cohesive than this movie - and presents the casual acceptance of militarism much more powerfully than the ""Itchy and Scratchy in Outer Space"" show that Verhoeven shat out on the screen.

Starship Troopers takes those quotes and blows them up to a bizarre format, making a carpet of bubbles of the well-known clichés.Bubbles and soap are the keys to the third layer of fun: have a look at the actors, their filmography, and the screamingly funny way the characters develop, or rather, don't. Apart from Michael Ironside, who - nicely fitting the role - probably understood very well what was going on, most of the actors seem like they actually live it. Starting with the soaps they are used to, they go so plain with the story you'll have a hard time telling whether it is genius or stupidity which allows them to act this naturally.I think this is an incredibly funny movie. And it certainly has its artistical and political message which, like with most of Verhoevens works, often isn't seen because it is concealed by the warping mirror Verhoeven wants us to look into.It's about media, manipulation, and how war changes people at large.

The battleships, bugs and battle scenes look really great, and very seldom can you tell they are just computer graphics. The storyline is good, not just focusing on the war - I always enjoy war films that include basic training in (Full Metal Jacket, Jarhead etc.), and it also has tales of romance and friendship, which break up all the gory violence nicely. The gore in itself is actually very good, showing how brutal the troopers' battle is. BUT, after watching 5 million different people get ripped in half, their brains sucked out and bashed to bits, it does get just a little repetitive. Really I think Verhoeven could have cut some parts of the battle scenes out as the violence does get a little tiresome. It is a good film though, which I thoroughly enjoyed.",Starship Troopers

However, the message it delivers clouded by the painfully bad acting. Denise Richards has no business in film - her timing is terrible, she delivers her lines like she's reading them off of her palm, and she shows all the emotion of a hooker turning a trick. Toss in Van Dien's wooden performance and this movie sinks like a turd.

356,warren-1976,"Miss it, and you're missing out.",10,21 December 2006,"Starship Troopers is one of those rare films, that is substantially more than the sum of its parts. The shame is, that most don't see past the enjoyable gloss, and see it as simply a mindless action movie.So what sets it apart? For one, it contains the biting satire, grim humour and violence of Paul Verhoeven and Edward Neumeier's previous science fiction collaboration, Robocop. Starship Troopers can be seen on one level as a tale of lost innocence, and coming of age. On another, it is a satire, based around the idea of a somewhat controlling alternative form of government, that frighteningly works. (To simply call it fascist, is an easy dismissal, and misses the point, I believe) It is nothing extreme or outlandish, except in the left wing world of Hollywood, where script writer Neumeier was vilified somewhat for adapting it from Heinlein's novel. It is simply a thought provoking tale, dressed up with the fun of action and adventure.In many ways it is a shame that the film veered so much from the original novel, yet it does succeed amazingly well in its own right. It is perhaps better to simply view them both as differing takes on similar issues.Starship Troopers isn't for everyone. You have to enjoy over-the-top violent action, and dark humour. If you can, there is a lot to gain from watching Starship Troopers, with far more depth than you would otherwise expect beneath the surface.To top it all off, it would be criminal not to mention the outstanding special effects, most especially Phil Tippet's work on the Bugs themselves. You will rarely see such convincing scenes of destruction in space, and war against an alien foe. Unlike many films, the effects are done selectively and cleverly, so that almost nothing will date in Starship Troopers, unlike many of its contemporaries, or even far more recent films.Starship Troopers is a fantastic ride if you just want straight action adventure. On top of that, if you take it tongue-in-cheek, you'll often find yourself coming back for more.They'll keep fighting! And they'll win!",Starship Troopers
357,nadeeshantennage,The worst depiction of formulaic science fiction concepts.,3,1 May 2018,"'Starship troopers' is a film in which basically you would be able to see shooting sequences.
Quite honestly the action packed shooting and charging sequences are the only interesting strains about the flow of this film.
The script in itself is so malnourished and in my opinion adapted science fiction concepts in the worst ways imaginable.
You gotta watch a movie like this to understand how cinematically brilliant are masterpieces like ' Arrival (2016) by Dennis Villeneuve and how masterfully such science fiction strains could be used in films to deliver a rich story instead of using science fiction elements just to charge a film with the necessary momentum in a vague attempt to keep the audience invested.
But, believe me when I say that nothing about this awful film would be fascinating.
The characters are written so badly with lack of emotional complexity and even scenes where it feels like they deliver the dialogues just because they signed up for the film and gotta do their job.
None of the acting performances are convincing enough to keep you invested in the storytelling and after the first quarter of the film which is the only thing that I found as interesting in this big bore of a film; very soon the film would manage to exhaust you visually with back to back badly executed plot points, high octane shooting sequences, and pretty bad visual effects in some scenes.
Afterall, this film could have gained the potential to be interesting if this only had a stronger script instead of the unconvincing, shallow execution of interesting science fiction elements which must have been adapted with a rich story.
Afterall this film belongs in the category of films that are 'so bad that they become unintentionally comical'.
So, go on and watch this for the guilty pleasure of it and to see how badly a film maker could adapt science fiction elements into a film with a shallow script to ultimately execute it to destruction.",Starship Troopers

It's just a commentary about fascist like society, racism, value of human or any life in such societies, media manipulation. If someone only looks at the story and the special effects, it's pretty straightforward (simple) and a B movie. Nice boys and girls go to the army, become infantry, pilots or spies (in this case telepaths). The war begins, they each find their place.. or die. This is a very comic like movie, the characters are not deep. The real worth in this movie lies in the context in which the story is presented. For example about the media which presents the enemy as stupid, evil animals, conditions the kids to be ideal soldiers from the young age. Creates the picture of the idealistic society with everyone smiling and standing united against the evil invaders. The way the humans disregard and evaluate the enemy (a pest that must be eliminated), make experiments on them causing several pain and injury, death is resembelling the Nazi, Japanese war crimes during the 2nd world war. At the same time, human life has also few value: the mobile infantry is thrown into battle situations where they are cannon fodder. So human life is also seen as a cheap weapon which is expandable.

However, a few minutes into the film, I realized that all the glitz was there for a reason. After I realized that, other layers of meaning became apparent. Starship Troopers turns out to be surprisingly deep and satirical film which brings up several interesting philosophical questions. Why do states go to war? What form of society is more productive, a democracy or a totalitarian state?. The hero's in the film dress like Nazis and watch US style war propaganda on television. Is war propaganda basically brain washing? Men and Women are equal in this militaristic utopian society... however freedom of thought has been subverted. They are taught by the state in school that Might = right. Strength = Morality. Religion, Ethics, Pacification = Weakness which is therefore immoral behavior. The film paints a bittersweet image of the future which forces us to analyze our own past and look at it in a different light. Our are schools basically the brainwashing branch of our Capitalistic society. Are we taught lopsided history lessons like the students in the film? Does a society based on aggression need to keep it's war machine churning even if the enemy doesn't want to fight, or didn't want to fight in the first place? WOW. I've seen the movie a dozen times and I am still finding new layers. Starship Troopers is probably the best picture any of its actors will ever be in for a long time. The acting was great at some parts and darn cheesy at others which is what you expect from a film made by the same guy who made Robo-Cop.

However he must graduate from school. He has four main friends Carmen (Denise Richards), Dizzy Florez (Dina Meyers) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). While friends they each have their own unique talents and interest. All four enlist in the military or the Federation. Rico and Flores to the Mobil Infantry, Carmen to the Fleet Academy and Carl to Military Intelligence.They each go off to their respective training elements to gain the knowledge and skills they will each need to succeed. Rico becomes a Squad Leader but during a live fire exercise one of his squad members is killed. The end result he receives disciplinary punishment. He receives 10 lashes. Which makes no sense to me in a society so educated can fly to the stars and communicate anywhere with no time delay they use lashing as a form of punishment. In the meantime Carmen is on her spaceship. She has just made a course correction which is more efficient. Some individuals feel this was a mistake on her part because it put her ship in direct line with the asteroid that eventually struck earth and destroyed Buenos Aires. That's just nonsense how was Carmen to know that was to occur. When it did occur, in my opinion she responded coolly and confidently. Her actions saved most of the ship and preserved her shipmates. Naturally her Captain should compliment her. Most pilots will tell you that flying is hours of boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror.Eventually the Federation realizes the mistake of landing directly Klandanthu the Sky Marshall resigns and a new one is appointed with a different plan. While on Klandanthu Rico was severally wounded and was listed as KIA ( killed in action). When he was actually placed in a rehab tank so the wound is leg could be repaired. When he gets out Ace Levy, Dizzy and Rico are assigned to the Roughnecks. Sort of equivalent to Army Rangers or Marine Recon.It's while in this group that Rico is first promoted Corporal, then to Sergeant and eventually Lieutenant. It is at that rank that he rescues Carmen and is responsible for capturing a brain bug. The bug responsible for controlling all the other bugs. I'm not about to get into the mind of Heinlein and state what the bugs represented. The book is great read and the movie is a great movie. Make of each what you want. The movie is out on DVD and if you subscribe to Netflix and stream it you can get the movie that way as well.",Starship Troopers
365,ryanmoynihan,Hilarious And Frightening All At Once,8,21 September 2020,"Satire has never been so on the nose and clever all at the same time. There are lines of dialogue and scenes that clearly criticize the US military and colonialism. And yet I can see many pro-military people enjoying the movie as nothing more than a scifi action popcorn flick. I can even see many people watching this movie, understanding the ideas and themes fully, and still agreeing with the characters and systems within the story. I suppose thats what makes Starship Troopers just as unsettling as it is funny. It describes a future not totally unlike our present, just in much sillier circumstances and terms.I love the rigid tonal shifts from tragedy to fun and back to tragedy again. The propaganda segments that break the story apart help these shifts feel natural because theyre like brainwash for the characters. The way they act, their motovations, all make sense given the world they live in. Of course they see the war as black and white and of course they seem to be getting off on the idea of killing. Their schools and places of work and households have normalized violence and authoritarianism their whole lives.It's pretty genius how they packaged such anti war and anti military commentary in a fun action movie. In one minute I'm laughing, smiling, having a good time and in the next I'm deeply uncomfortable. Can't say I expected that rollercoater of emotions from a movie about killing bugs.",Starship Troopers

368,Mendelovich,Totally unexpected,10,1 January 2000,"I must admit that I had the ""luck"" not to hear about this movie and not to know about the director's identity. I did not see the beginning and only knew the Hebrew name of the movie. I stayed the whole length almost perplexed. The lack of ""stars"" didn't diminish at all the quality of this film. The plot was very ""Total Recall"" like (which I did notice during the watch) and this is a very good formula for success, in my opinion. The quality of the animatronics lacked a little, but the ""fire squirting insect"" was a success. The plot does not have great importance, because it is totally incongruent, but the beauty in sci-fi movies doesn't lie in the plot, no? Even so, I loved the dedication of the hero to the girlfriend and his devotion to the mission. I loved also the item of insects chosen as foes, because it made the movie very politically correct (no one admires insects) without diminishing the fierceness of the battles- the insects were the most competent warriors I have ever seen.To conclude, it is a well done movie, which decided to leave plot to other genres and to concentrate in what sci-fi movie lovers like: stunts and imagination.",Starship Troopers

370,mozart827,"Average, but not great",5,18 October 2000,"I am only going to comment about the second time I saw this movie. With a second viewing (following a re-reading of the book which is one of my three all-time favorites), I was majorly disappointed in this film. I won't go into the more common complaints of the film (like, why no powered armor?). But there are a few points I would like to make. Why did they combine the characters of DuBois and Razceck(sp?) from the book? Why is Rico such an obnoxious and unlikable jerk? The movie could have been a lot better if it was done in a first-person narrative like the book and not make Rico out to be so annoying. The captain of the ROGER YOUNG was an idiot and Carl was a totally different character. I do like the addition of female MIs and the new types of bugs. However, Denise Richards' constant smiling annoyed the heck outta me. Casper Van Dien's performance left much to be desired. I did find the effects great, however, and all-in-all the story wasn't too off the mark and it was a lot more coherent than some other recent sci-fi films (i.e., the atrocious BATTLEFIELD EARTH).",Starship Troopers
371,Jozinek,This is just what I needed to love Paul Verhoeven as a director even more :D,9,15 October 2019,"This movie is a somewhat satirical sci fi action film set in the far future where humanity is locked in a vicious conflict with a rivalling extra terrestrial insectoid species. How is this film ""somewhat satirical""? Well, like RoboCop it has these kinds of ads, except here the ads promote patriotism for planet Earth whilst showing extremely graphic details that resulted from the supposed ""patriotism"" that many went out to fight for, rather than for 80's style household products that are shown in the cyberpunk cop thriller. This reminded me of WW2 enlistment posters such as the famous ""America needs YOU to join the U.S. military"" with a picture of Uncle Sam pointing directly towards whoever looks at the poster, or those Australian enlistment posters that advertised war as some kind of an adventurous getaway whilst also including some small details on what going to war was really like.After each ad, it even says ""Wanna know more?"" As if it urged people to further find encouragement to enlist. Satire was also shown at the boot camp with the drill sergeant, him being a caricature of typical drill sergeants: strict, demeaning and aggressive. The drill sergeant in this film is all of these things x100 which I absolutely loved. There's also the mockery of how pointless war is, since one of the great threats presented in the film are these meteors that are supposedly ""bug meteors"", when in reality they could very much just be ordinary meteors that come from an asteroid belt near the arachnids' planet, and some of them come near Earth (one of them managing to hit the planet and cause millions of casualties), yet the humans blame the bugs for them due to their lust for war; therefore making up reasons for conflict and brainwashing the public into supporting it. The irony is that because of this they send millions of men and women to die in a war that doesn't even necessarily need to be fought. I thought it was an excellent touch, and because of that it made it far more than just some generic sci fi action film.Another nice bit of social commentary in this movie was the way to earn citizenship, now of course in many societies today, citizenship is earned through finding work, being a law abiding member of the society you live in as well as living there for a certain amount of time. However, in this film's universe, citizenship being earned through hard work is exaggerated to the point where the only way to earn citizenship is by joining the military and fighting in a pointless and deadly war, if not then you'd just be a ""civilian"" (who in the film is downgraded as less courageous and willing to fight for humanity). This could be satirising the high requirements for citizenship in some societies, and like the other social commentaries this film made, I found it pretty damn funny.So, aside from the brilliant satire in this film, it also has many other positive aspects too: the practical effects are marvellous just like in RoboCop (Verhoeven never fails to impress with his excessive graphic detail :D), the CGI for the time is actually decent (although not as good by today's standards, it really does look cutting edge for the late 90's, and it was more than good enough to keep me engaged in the high scale battles), the sets are just beautiful: a futuristic university in Buenos Aires, a giant Starship that would almost blow Star Trek out of the water, a futuristic boot camp etc. Also the actors did brilliantly well with what they were given, they were so expressive at times that I almost felt what they did just by watching them.Check this out 100%, and don't forget to check out Verhoeven's other works such as Total Recall and Basic Instinct (I know I will some time or another :D).",Starship Troopers
372,vladthelad8666,Truly unique movie.,10,9 April 2020,"If you've never seen ""Starship Troopers"", or don't know much about it, watching it for the first time will shock you. Paul Verhoeven really has a unique vision on directing movies and it shows. Over the top gore, and by that I mean, they just don't hold anything back on the blood, guts and flying limbs. It's spectacular. Some of the characters, may be considered to be more on the goofy side, but that doesn't take away from the seriousness of the story they are trying to tell. The propaganda just oozes out of the movie, and some critics have had some strong words about those aspects of it, yet it doesn't bring the movie down. Actually, It plays really well if you don't take it very seriously, and then the movie becomes even more enjoyable.It is very clear that Paul Verhoeven made a social commentary first, and a sci-fi movie second. Patriotism is probably the biggest tool that is used to manipulate young people into joining the military. All they are told, is that these ""bugs"" are a threat to humanity, when the truth is really blurred, and its hinted, that humans actually initiated the conflict, and now millions of people are paying with their lives. The movie has some solid twists, and manages to throw a love story in the plot, a love triangle to be precise, and it may as well be the weakest link. We've all heard the story, about how the test audience hated the female protagonist so badly, that they wanted her removed, and to be extremely honest, she is mildly annoying. On the other hand, Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Ironside all give solid performances. The visual effects are brilliant, and more than hold up after 23 years. The mix between animatronics and CGI make the arachnids feel very much alive and they always pop out, when they have screen time.A lot of people haven't read the book, but both the movie and the book stand on their own, personally I haven't had the chance to read it, but the movie is a must see for die hard sci-fi fans and casual movie goers.",Starship Troopers

A colony of insect-like bugs launch an attack on a future Earth which is in a totalitarian militaristic state.The irony is of course that both sides are equally as vicious as the other - the bug race being an almost unstoppable force as per the humans who have an equally vast army and attitude themselves. This makes for an equally unstoppable force wanting to wipe out the alien bugs. The intelligent humans are sent off to military intelligence and/or commissioned as officers while the more athletic i.e. stupid, are used for the front line.Propaganda clips in the Earth media also add to the feel of an extreme right-wing state and the pressure for young people to join the fight against the bugs - you can't obtain full citizenship unless you enlist.Anyway all good action to boot.

375,robertandrews-44556,"""The only good Bug.....is a DEAD Bug!""",10,23 December 2018,"When I was in high school, I rented Robert A. Heinlein's novel, ""Starship Troopers"" from the school library. It soon became one of my favourite books. It tells the story of a young soldier, Juan Rico, as he joins a futuristic power-armored military unit 700 hundred years in the future and soon finds himself fighting against giant spider-like alien insects called the ""Pseudo-Arachnids"" in an intergalactic war. The book did give me nightmares, due to Heinlein's descriptions of the Bugs (which, to me, were reminiscent of certain scenes from classical sci-fi films like ""Them! (1954)"".Shortly after completing the book, I rented the the film, which was directed by Paul Verhoeven. Man....was I in for a great surprise!At the time, the film was unlike anything I had seen before. Sure, I had watched the Alien films a number of times, and loved Verhoeven's RoboCop and Total Recall, but when I first watched Starship Troopers the first time....I was totally on the edge of my seat.Yes, the film is a big, dumb action movie with monstrous alien Bugs battling young actors who look like supermodels....but it was Verhoeven's direction that truly made it memorable.The hilarious satirical political undertones intertwined with the fascist commercials in-between the gory mayhem will keep any moviegoer entertained. And although Verhoeven's take on the story deviated a lot from the original novel (apparently he found it too boring to finish), he still gave us a fantastic action blockbuster that never fails to be entertaining and thrilling. And though I loved the book, as mentioned, I agree with Paul that it may not have made a very entertaining film if it was followed closely. I love both versions of the story.The Bugs in the film are menacing and vicious. However, I still find their novel counterparts much more creepy. If you have ever seen images of the infamous lost ""King Kong Spider Pit Scene"", then you can have an idea of what some of the scenes from the book would look like.To keep it short, I love this film, and am very happy to own it in my growing movie collection.10/10",Starship Troopers

377,Chronus,Starship dummies,5,18 January 2000,"I read Robert Anson Heilein´s novel, and though not a great novel, its story is intelligent and realistic - a la Heinlein.  It´s terrifying to see its adaptation to the big screen - a.k.a. Starship Troopers The Movie. Experiencing this movie is not far from experiencing first hand a horror situation.  This movie is one of the most ridiculous  pieces of...junk ever made in Hollywood. Special effects apart, this is one example more of the Verhoeven type movie.   This dutch director, apart from the cold and realistic Robocop and the infamous movie starring Sharon Stone and M.Douglas, has no big credits on his behalf. His stories are weak, silly, the way he tries to portray the future is pure trash, a bad satire, a bad joke. This man has no grasp for science-fiction, no grasp for social tendencies and scientific rules.
  Ok, the aracnides are fantastic, the special effects are great, but what about the story? What about characters and character? Is this dutch director expecting us to believe a story where its characters, after knowing they have just lost their families, smile when they know they are to be reinstated in the Army? Or smile when they are promoted, right after seeing so  many of their colleagues die horribly? Or are we to expect and believe that our society has the tendency to decay so much as to watch an execution, LIVE, in a holoscreen?   And the worst is that Heinlein´s novel is entirely different from this trash. The social criticism and speculation imbedded in it were simply laid to waste. Who does mr. Verhoeven think he is when he (or his screenwriter) distort a novel and a story by an all-time master of science-fiction? I mean, why was there a need to distort the real Starship Troopers? Do they think they can outbest a master and a genius like Heinlein?  The actors chosen for this movie suffered a great setback in their careers - at least the young ones.   Michael Ironside is the best thing in the entire movie - well, he  and the Aracnides.   The other actors' acting range from ridiculous to simply silly. They just played the way they told - or knew, I suppose.  If I knew beforehand, I would have avoided this movie like the plague. It´s awful, a true nightmare.

378,Aronnax,misunderstood masterpiece??,10,29 May 2000,"Well, maybe not masterpiece. But Starship Troopers is one of those great films that grows on you the more you see it.Verhoeven has said his life was changed by witnessing the violence of WWII up close and personal. On the surface Starship Troopers is an homage to those gung-ho WWII (propaganda) movies, but Verhoeven shows what those movies NEVER showed: the horrifying, grisly reality of war. The casting emphasizes his point: he takes barbie and ken doll actors, sets them up for a fun adventure fighting bugs, then literally rips their arms and heads off! The only problem is the characters are still gung-ho barbie and ken dolls at the end, with some well placed smudges and bruises. Had they been burned out human wrecks I think people would have gotten what Verhoeven was going for. But maybe that would have been too much.I also think this was misunderstood because the 'heroes' are, in a sense, the bad guys! A reporter makes a comment half way through the film that the bugs were harmless until humans invaded their territory. The opening TV news show even says that the conflict started when Mormons opened a mission on the bug planet (this is something I missed first time around.) But again, the relatively lame ending soft pedals this theme, so by the time Doogie Houser shows up wearing an SS trenchcoat, torturing the poor Brain Bug, people tend to laugh and dismiss the deeper meaning.Starship Troopers also has some of the best FX ever! The bugs are flawless. Notice how the dead humans resemble squased bugs! The 'Alamo' sequence is breathtaking, especially on the big screen. Same with the big battle scene, with hundreds of orbiting troopships discharging hundreds of landing ships, while plasma blobs shoot up from the planet. We even follow one of the landing ships to the ground (while others get blasted with plasma), then watch the soldiers run out and over to a cliff, where huge Tanker(?) bugs literally fart out the plasma blobs that are destroying the orbiting troop ships. It's an mazing sequence. The music score is also great.I know a lot of people who hated this film when it first came out. But I think it's because they took it at face value. This is a film that really comes together on second viewing. If only the ending weren't such a thematic cop out...",Starship Troopers

Starship troopers doesn't have a dull moment in the entire movie and it will keep you on the edge of your seat right up til the end.  This is what i call an action packed movie, full of special effects and enough gore to repulse even the most die hard gorehounds.  The cast is terrific with upcoming names such as Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer and Patrick Muldoon, what a great idea to put up and coming names in this, rather than a bigshot moviestar who would only steal the spotlight.

Is it trying to show how pathetic we are? Is it to show that as the human race, we will conquer all? Is it a subtle nod at WWII, showing us as the Nazi party? I seriously don't know; I like to believe this movie is much smarter than it looks and feels, but still to this day, I don't know how to feel about it.I enjoy it, to say the least. It's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen; once I watch it, I could watch it again straight after. Surely that signifies a very enjoyable film, no? However, once it's over, my mind switches to discovery mode. I want to know what the movie is about and what it's truly saying. The media and news reels within the film remind me of the WWI and WWII propaganda, and the whole movie seems too bubbly and ""go get 'em"" to truly say ""this isn't a serious movie, and it doesn't mean anything."" Surely the director is trying to say something with Starship Troopers. I find the acting to be rather terrible, but I still can't help but feel it was all done on purpose! The SFX and music are top-notch; the best special effects I've seen for 1997! The script is full of cheesy one-liners, and in a way, is pretty bad; but this again, seems so right. Maybe the director has directed a bad film, and everybody is looking into it a bit much, but I doubt it. I know a bad film when I see it, and Starship Troopers isn't one.I suggest you watch it; you'll either love it or hate it. The whole ride is exciting and philosophical, two things that don't often mix well. I really hope there's something deep and clever I'm missing with Starship Troopers, as in the end I don't want to find out that it was just suppose to be a big, funny, comedy bloodbath. I always feel kind of weird once I've seen it; I just wish I knew what it was really about... or do I? 5/5",Starship Troopers
382,thelastjedi_good,An examination of the political favorability of war packaged as a silly action movie,9,24 July 2017,"It came out in 1997, but if I didn't know better, I would think that Starship Troopers was a response to the George W. Bush presidency.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) grows up in a futuristic world that values nationalism and military service above all else. Pressured by his girlfriend, his best friend, and his favorite high school teacher, Rico joins the army for peacetime service. While he is in boot camp however, the earth is hit by an asteroid and the nearby planet of Klendathu is blamed for the attack. This thrusts the army into war with the inhabitants of Klendathu. These inhabitants happen to be giant and extremely lethal bugs. Rico and his friends suffer great losses in this meaningless and bizarre war against the bugs.The film repeatedly shows the viewer how a manipulative government can use nationalism to do practically anything. Rico and his friends are seduced into military service by a complex government system that teaches young people that service is the only way a person can truly be a first-class citizen. This message is spread through media propaganda, the school system, and peer pressure. The message is somewhat rejected by an audience member, but the film's characters buy into this manipulation earnestly. Our characters walk into the buzzsaw of war with such honest excitement that a reasonable viewer doesn't even know how to feel other than mildly disgusted.When the earth is hit by the asteroid, the government again uses its ever-powerful propaganda machine to blame a colony of totally unintelligent insects for this ""attack."" Paradoxically, the government argues both that the ""bugs"" are responsible for the asteroid tragedy, and that all bugs are also worthless and totally unintelligent. If the bugs are unintelligent, how could they send an asteroid to earth? The answer is obvious to the viewer: the bugs had nothing to do with the asteroid and are being used as a political scapegoat. But, none of the characters in the film question this paradox. Instead, they unite under the maxim ""the only good bug is a dead bug"" and seek bloody revenge.The parallels to the September 11 attacks and the 2003 Iraq invasion are uncanny. In both cases, one could say that the government used the outrage and fear of the people in the wake of a tragedy as an excuse to invade an irrelevant place, resulting in massive losses. Maybe Starship Troopers was Verhoeven's attempt at a warning against a growing culture of nationalism in America- or maybe it was just chance that the film came right before the war. Life imitates art, I guess.In the military, the soldiers are absolutely dehumanized. In the film's first act, live rounds are used in boot camp training exercises, resulting in the death of a private. This man is not mourned at all and the film continues swiftly without much change. This shows how little the government cares about these soldiers. As the people in charge brush over this tragedy, all the other characters quickly forget about it as well. As the film goes on, this practice of ignoring/forgetting the loss of soldiers only intensifies. In their first battle with the bugs, we see scores of soldiers brutally eviscerated, but the surviving soldiers proudly celebrate their minor strategic successes shortly afterward without even a thought for their fallen friends. This juxtaposition is repulsive to the audience, who can see the extent of the brainwashing that the soldiers have undergone.(SPOILERS follow in this paragraph) Verhoeven's approach to this anti-war film is very unusual. The way I see it, the film intends to at first make its audience feel repulsed by the brutality of war and later make the audience accept the violence. By making the audience accept the violence, the film can show that even a reasonable viewer of the film can easily be subject to the same brainwashing as the characters. In the first few battles, loss and celebration are directly juxtaposed against each other in order to make the characters look like ignorant monsters with no empathy, but in the final battle, the pacing is laid out differently in an effort to get the audience themselves to legitimize the violence. In the film's climactic battle, two major characters are brutally killed: Rico's role model Lt. Rasczak and Rico's love interest Diz. Both characters have been established and developed well up to their deaths, and the audience reacts strongly to their loss. Both of these characters die early in the film's final battle, and their deaths are followed by 20-30 minutes of intense action, in which the humans finally begin to have major successes against the bugs. The audience is engaged through all of this, and feels pride and relief when the humans have their ultimate great success. By the end of the film, most of the main characters are reunited as heroes. At the film's final moments, Diz and Rasczak have been seemingly totally forgotten both by the characters and by the viewers. In essence, the viewer has become just as ignorant and apathetic as the characters.Completely ignoring the political subtext, Starship Troopers is a perfectly good action/war movie. The characters are intended to be somewhat shallow and stupid, but at the same time they always appear to be honest, and the viewer finds himself rooting for them at every stage of the movie. The effects are impressive for the film's era and the action is executed very well.In total, Starship Troopers is both a solid action movie and a weighty piece on the ills of nationalism. I would highly recommend the film to anyone who can stomach some extreme violence.",Starship Troopers
383,north-julie,highly entertaining,9,16 April 2006,"The book of Starship Troopers was written a long time ago by Robert A Heinlein. Its a great tale of epic battles and one young mans crusade through the military ranks. The film shares many similarities, but has jettisoned the 'skinnies', a race of subhumans who are also at war with humanity. The film focuses on the war between humanity and the bugs, a race of spider like creatures living many miles away. Because of this streamlining, the film is a modern classic. Cut into two parts (training and fighting) Starship Troopers deserved much more than the feeble US gross it achieved.Starring a bunch of relative unknowns, this is a bombastic action epic that batters the senses with fantastic images of war torn landscapes and huge warships. Casper Van Dien is Johnnie Rico, the square jawed hero, Denise Richards his beautiful girlfriend Carmen who wants to be a pilot, Dina Meyer the girl with the huge crush on Johnnie and Doggie Howser the hilarious scientist with the even more hilarious quavering eyebrows. Michael Ironside is the metallic armed teacher cum warrior who watches over Rico at the beginning and then end of the movie. And there is also a dashing young pilot who wants to steal Carmens heart.....Yes thats right, Starship Troopers copies the Titanic method of plonking a love story onto the back of the epic storyline. However, Rico and Carmens romance is short lived as they part ways, so it doesn't put a dampener on the film.Rico and his buddies are put through a rigorous training regime by the improbably named Clancy Brown. Training involves showering in a giant unisex shower, having your hand stapled to a wall by a knife and being shot by cardboard laser firing soldiers. Rico causes the death of a fellow pupil, threatens to walk out, yadda yadda yadda. Carmen is off learning how to fly her giant spaceship while Doggie Howser feeds a cow to one of the bugs. This first half of the film is great fun as it builds up the characters. None of them are especially great at acting, and Casper Van Diens jaw does seem to do most of the acting in his scenes. However, its when the evil bugs destroy Buenos Airies that things get nasty.Yes thats right- Buenos Airies. One element from the book that didn't need to be kept. None of the people in the film speak Argentinian yet when that city is destroyed everybody gets angry and goes off to war.The first battle scene is spectacular. The giant spaceships hover in space being pummelled by giant bursts of sticky blue emissions that appear to be coming out of some giant bugs bum-holes. Dropships take the troops down to the planet, and then the troops meet the bugs (but not until they have fired miniature nuclear weapons at targets no less than a hundred meters away). The humans get slaughtered by 'superior tactics' which translates as the bugs simply having more legs than us humans. The humans reply by invading the exterior planets of the bugs solar system, and an incredible last stand style battle in an abandoned fortress is the highlight of the film. Giant tank bugs fire well, fire at the fortress while millions of bugs charge towards the fortress and then STAND STILL. Up above flying green bugs manage to decapitate half of the infantry while Johnnie Rico single handedly kills the bugs, fixes the radio system, pulls half of his commanding officer out of the mouth of a tank bug, causes the death of Dina Meyers character and shoots one of the flying bugs in such a way that it crashes into the admiral of the fortress.....yes this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and its all the better for it. Other noteworthy things to mention follow- Jake Busey plays Ace, a character who seems to always have his eyes shut to a squint. Rico jumps on the back of a tank bug and defies gravity by being able to stand on it without support, fire into the bugs back, drop a grenade into the bug, jump off and survive without barely a scratch. All of this takes place while the bug is moving at around fifty miles an hour. Doggie Howser catches a gigantic brain bug, the captain of Carmens ship is cut in half BY A DOOR, a man has his brain sucked out of his head by a bug with a straw.....Starship Troopers contains some of the best special effects ever devised. The spaceships are perfectly realised and the bugs are lifelike. The shot of hundreds of bugs converging on the abandoned fortress is mesmerising, as is Casper Van Diens jaw. There is humour, with a cameraman taping one of the battles and then being ripped apart. An Asian officer attempts to beat the entire bug army on his own, Michael Ironside loses his legs. Its all fun, as is the movie.One thing is never really explained. WHY are we fighting the bugs? The bugs planet is able to shoot giant asteroids towards Earth because of its 'gravity well.' What does this have to do with the bugs? When the humans invade the infamous Planet P, they capture a brain bug to find out why the bugs fight. They fight because we have declared war on them! A minor gripe yes, but surely something could have been done about our motives for this war.A great film with fantastic effects. its just a shame that it wasn't a bigger hit, and that it inspired the mediocre sequel.",Starship Troopers

But for me it's my guilty pleasure, when I was younger I was in love with Dina Meyer, and she looks amazing in this movie. Michael Ironside being his normal grumpy ""bar steward"" self.
When you actually think about this film, it actually opens up thoughts of why do we as humans think we have the right of dominance over everything in our sight - we don't. You could draw parallels to many historical events, if the masses had rose up against their 'masters' then their would normally be mass slaughter on one side or the other.
But enough of the intellectual aspects, it's just real good fun, realistically a B movie that deserves an A+.
If like me you have the novel by Robert Heinlen, then don't rush into this thinking you will see a faithful adaptation, apart from humans vs bugs, their really isn't much of the book in the movie. If their were to be a proper transference from page to screen then it could end up being the next Star Wars, but until that time comes, sit back, open the popcorn and settle down to be thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes,",Starship Troopers

Verhoeven even admitted that he never read the book. Apparently, there is a movement afoot to make a much more realistic adaptation of the book.If you've read the book, then fair warning... This movie basically steals names from the book and then writes its own story. For example, Dizzy Flores is a very minor male character in the book who dies in the first chapter. In the movie, Dizzy is a major female character who becomes a love interest for the protagonist. By the way, the protagonist in the movie is Johnny Rico, an Americanized hero -- young, tall, white, American male. In the book, Juan Rico is a working-class Filipino.",Starship Troopers

This is a movie that keeps the blood flowing and the heart pumping, with its nonstop action and astounding special effects. It takes place around the 22 century and is about a group of high school graduates who join the federal army to fight a viscous race of giant bug like aliens. If you watch and listen closely enough you will notice that it supposed to be a bit like the second world war(Which is another good point to this masterpiece) They even do a couple satires on old World War 2 movies. Probably this films only bad side is the acting. A couple actors like Michael Ironside bring some life to their character but most are two dimensional.

389,fx-23112,The most underrated film,10,7 May 2016,"I am not sure that I have ever seen another film before that presents and criticise so well the all human nature. Which summarily can be told as ""conquer or submit"".I strongly believe that if a person, a nation, a society, a civilization, or a specie, lose its will power to conquer others, it is finally doomed to be submitted to others. Being a master first of all means that at least you are not a slave. What I love in the Starship Troopers is that it shows in a unique way both that the war is a waste of human resources and how unethical might result to be, but also how necessary for your own survival is to rule others. In that film humans are no better than those alien bugs, but also they are no worse. They both just trying to dominate the other side for reasons that goes too deep to explain.So Starship Troopers is an epic tribute to the nature of war and at the same time is one of the strongest satirizing war films. Even more is satirizing not just war, but mainly using a war as a reason to satirize the core of the human nature. It is both militaristic and anti militaristic without presenting a simplistic nationalist or a simplistic leftist point of view. We all know if it wasn't the USA it would be the USSR or if it wasn't the British empire it would be the German empire, and so on if it wasn't the French it would be the Spaniards or the Dutch. There always be an enemy and if you don't fight him, he will fight you. Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is a philosophical paradox that in this story judges humans for their fight of their own existence. It is like doing the right thing, for the right reasons, but you can never win without doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons. Paradox!Other popular films with similar subject, like Avatar or Independence Day, they are not even close to the full perspective of ST.Surely is one of the most underrated films. It should be in top 50 at least.",Starship Troopers
390,DunkD,Would you like to know more?,10,22 February 2001,"This is one of my favourite films, and gets better with each watching.I have read a lot of criticism of this film and would like to discuss some of it:1. - The actors can't act and are impossibly beautiful. This is true, and the whole thing has the look and feel of a squeaky clean soap opera. This seems to be the intention of the film. All the sets are scrupulously clean. Even the alien's planet is relatively clean and well lit. This is the only performance I have seen where Denise Richards *hasn't* made me cringe - because she is meant to be inane.2. - The film supports fascist ideology. - I don't believe that the film supports any ideology particularly. As far as I can see it satirises it quite cleverly through the smooth and cheerful characters, Neil Patrick Harris' Goebels uniform. The characters are comfortable in their world, and even when at war on another planet they are in their own world. No one questions anything, including the fact that they don't question anything. They are all too tied up in their own pathetic lives to even glimpse at the bigger picture. This film is ABOUT propaganda more than it is propaganda itself. Just look at the snippets from TV/Internet with the slogan ""Would you like to know more?"" You never get to know more. The only character in the film that gets to know more is Neil Patrick Harris' character, and he answers questions with ""That's classified!"" The final scene of the film brings into question whether the whole film was a piece of propaganda littered with commercial breaks. The film is postmodern! Is it a film, or a film of a TV show, or recruitment propaganda, or something to show parents?3. - The film glorifies war. - Again I think that satire has been mistaken for support of an idea. The film has every cliché from every war movie going - the hyper-brutal drill-sergeant; the assault course; someone dying tragically in training, making everyone else wonder if they are tough enough to go on. When the characters get to the war zone they find themselves out numbered and out classed by the enemy. Numbers beat brains and technology (except in the end the humans (perhaos) prevail because of brain and technology) and we are treated to plenty of starlets torn to pieces.I like this film a lot. It is great sci-fi. The effects are excellent. The story is more complex than it appears to be at first glance (like a lot of Verohoven's movies - RoboCop, Total Recall, Showgirls even) and has lots of little asides which add to the feel of the thing (the aforementioned web-casts particularly). If you like nothing else, the scenes of millions of bugs attacking the troopers are amazing spectacles.If you would like to know more, watch Starship Troopers, and don't forget to keep your sense of irony and satire. This is not a film to take seriously. And don't take yourself too seriously while watching it!",Starship Troopers
391,NBK-2,Bad acting with exception of Denise Richards in an incredibly stupid but entertaining film!,7,12 August 1999,"Yeah, that about sums it up. The acting in this film is not very good, but it's not the worst I've seen. Casper Van Dien is the one who has most problems with his role, Dina Meyer made an Ok job, but Denise Richards made a good job. I don't quite know what I like about her, but she's got something the others hasn't. The film itself is about the world in a distant future where our worst enemy is killer-bugs, and our best weapon a bunch of bugbashing forces. I mean, the scriptwriter must have smoked some grass when he wrote script. I like the idea of boys and girls showering together though, but I don't think that will happen. The news that comes up quite often is brilliant. really cool with this ""Do you want to know more?"" s**t always coming up in the end.

Finally, feel free to enjoy the movie, it's not bad, but for all you giggling in glee thinking this an attack on US Imperialism and the stupidity of it, I've got to think you're as stupid as the military in this movie. Things like this, and the ""intellectual"" reviews are really simplistic and incapable of anything but superficial thought.

394,blackwolf14016,One of the few times....,9,31 May 2003,"One of the few times a movie is better than the book it's based off of. Maybe it's just cuz I saw the movie before I read the book.
I first saw the movie in 1999, on HBO or some other channel. I loved it, partly because of the cool Aliens, and partly because of the gore (I was 14 at the time). Now when I watch it again, the gore doesn't impress me as much (de-sensitized generation X-ers :) ) but now I watch it for the action and story, which are pretty good.The movie is pretty much a typical Sci Fi Alien-Blast-Em-Up. There's also a love triangle romance involved, but it's not too 'intenseive'. The jist of the story is that a group of Aliens blows up a big chunk of Earth, and we send troops to kill them all etc.The CGI aliens look pretty good by 97's standards, and still fairly good today. Unfortunatly we don't see too many different types of them.The acting is pretty good all around, though not spectacular. But most of the actors/actresses are 'unknowns' so they did pretty well for their first feature length movie.The plot is good but slightly flawed; there's not much backstory behind the Aliens or the UED. Also, I could have done without the Romance.WARNING: This movie is very gory, especially for younger viewers. There is also some nudity.That's basically all there is to say; this is a typical 'popcorn' movie that you watch with your buds to see the aliens get blown away. If you don't analyze it too much, you'll have a good time.OVERALL: 8.5/10James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston",Starship Troopers

The effects are superb, it's tightly paced, not too demanding yet it does have war connotations underneath if you scratch the surface.There are some unintentionally funny moments, Rico's interview, and a bizarre funeral service.I think that many see this as a guilty pleasure, like 'Demolition Man' but i strongly recommend it as a good, solid piece of sci-fi.",Starship Troopers

399,eskdale56,Eye candy and not much more....,4,6 September 2002,"Hey, Casper Van Dien and the rest of the cast certainly provide plenty of eye candy for this film, however, I don't see much more in it.  First, we are given no indication of why these ""bugs"" are attacking humans...it would have been nice to supply more of a premise than the three or four lines spoken by a reporter about how the ""bugs"" resented human encroachment...just before the bugs kill him.  WWII movies could get away without supplying the premise for why we were fighting WWII, because it is to this day universally known why, but I'm afraid that the WWII formula won't work in the Starship Trooper context, we need a plot including the premises for why this war started in the first place.Next, let's look at the credibility of some of the things seen in this movie--Reporters standing in the middle of a combat mission?  When was the last time you saw a Geraldo Rivera-type standing in combat uniform in the middle of an actual battle ground in a hot war?  The Earth appears to have been politically united and science moved forward enough to get humans across our galaxy...yet the best weaponry we have are hoards of combat infantry armed with machine guns?  And in terms of realistic warfare, we saw infantry without armored support, without air support and apparently only armed with a total of two grenades (which were used by Rico and Diz respectively to kill two big bugs). Eventhough conventional weaponry seems to have been the choice of this film maker (and I guess Heinlein) we see no weapons like the bazooka or surface to surface missles, mines or tanks. There is one shot of what looked like a light anti-aircraft gun in action...why is the weaponry so primitive given the backdrop of intersteller space travel?  Even now we are experimenting with particle beams, lasers, biological warfare and things more sophisticated than a machine gun, for sure.   Apparently, between now and the time this movie is set, we forgot a lot of science, except how to travel across our galaxy.   Maybe they needed a formula for bug spray?There are loose ends in this movie too--we needed some exploration of the difference between citizen and civilian...seems like some new definitions were being applied here, which again, were minimally or not at all explained.One cannot help but notice the symbols used that so strongly resemble those adopted by the likes of the Nazis, Falangists and other fascists.  Given that it seems the earth is being run by fascist types, one might like to see in this movie an answer to the question ""Just what exactly is back on earth that the troopers are defending?""  It doesn't seem like democracy and freedom play much of a role in this new world--one that is hardly explored by the movie-makers, but I could be wrong since the moviemakers never told us what was happening on Earth, other than Buenos Aires was destroyed and that there was some kind of federal council sitting in Geneva (perhaps an apt venue for a fascist dictatorship given evidence of Swiss complicity with Hitler, but I digress).I could write reams on what I observed that is wrong with this movie. I'll refrain from saying anything more other than to comment that if you want a movie with no plot, with really no beginning and no end, with minmal character development and growth, no premise supporting its existence, showing you illogically waged warfare with lots of action, then this is the movie for you.I for one would have skipped it had I known what was in store...but at least Casper and the other members of the cast were pretty to look at.

The special effects have not dated and are still jaw dropping compared to alot of movies released in the late 90's. This would also turn out to be the last great violent film that Paul Verhoeven would make. Like Robocop and Total Recall before it, the film has extreme violence but it also spends the first hour building it's charcters so that when they are picked off by the bugs in the film's second half you really give a damn.

I agree with Leonard Maltin (the professional movie critic) that everything is directly modeled on WWII battles and WWII movies.The enemy is irrelevant, and characterizing the enemy is not important. That is why we never get any explanation for why the bugs are attacking us, how their weapons work, etc.The movie is extremely gory to make the point that ""war is hell"", and war consists of a lot of ""blood and guts"".  It is also making the point that our tolerance for violence is constantly accelerating.  In this future world, it is no big deal to get stabbed through any part of the body, it is even a part of military training.  Pain is of no concern, you simply call for ""Medic!"" and get on down the road.The movie does not try to be cute or funny.  The viewer does not have to listen to the aliens being called all sort of combinations of cuss words by the heroes.The characters are realistic. They sometimes do the right things for the wrong reasons and vice versa.  At times we are not sure who is good and who is self-motivated.I also liked the shower scene.

I expected the usual no-plot action movie which takes itself far too seriously in its bid to emulate Star Wars. However, upon actually viewing the film, I found it not only to be a great, not to mention gory action movie, but also hilariously funny too. After a brief introduction which outlines the 25th century scenario and the relationships between the three main characters as they graduate high school,and join and train for the military in bids to become 'citizens' (so they have rights to vote etc.), the film cuts between the main action (mainly fighting, but with the added extra of some surprisingly good interaction between fairly well developed characters) and a 'computer information system', which the film uses as a method to inform the viewer on some of the more important background information. The film portrays itself as all out action, but I also found some of the scenes remarkably satirically amusing, which is probably intentional. It is also surprising deep, as the soldiers quickly learn that the alien 'arachnids' outclass them not only physically, not mentally as well, which reminds us that man may not rule the roost forever. Overall, then, I strongly recommend Starship Troopers. It has enough gratuitous violence to please the action fans, but has enough besides this to entertain most.",Starship Troopers

You will never see a better movie at explaining what it was like for World War II era Germans.

Heinlein's book, you're probably going to hate this movie. It keeps a few details and a VERY general plot line (more of a story concept, really) from the novel. The rest bears much more resemblance to Leon Uris' ""Battle Cry!"", a gung-ho, patriotically themed WWII story about a squad of U.S. Marines in the pacific theater of the war.Whatever satire existed in the original novel (frankly, I found it little deeper than the movie), it exists here in a funny but ham-fisted way. If you can laugh at humor that the director smacks you upside the head with... so be it. I've found the manner in which this ""satire"" is presented as entertaining as the satire itself.In addition to the Battle Cry elements, there is a ""teen movie"" element, with your sappy romances and petty jealousies... which I tolerate for the sake of viewing Denise Richards in her heyday, young and hot, unblemished by the hand of Charlie Sheen...But, I digress.It's a perfectly viable movie for some pretty mindless action. Verhoeven is not a ""realistic combat"" kind of director. Another reviewer describes the soldiers as having the ""Tactical acumen of sheep armed with assault rifles"", which is not only pithy but very apt. Napoleonic tactics, really; you're standard massed infantry charge with a dose of light artillery and some naval bombardment. Very un-Napoleonic, however, is the lack of cavalry or anything like it. Despite this being an ""advanced"" future with space travel, etc., no armored support is used. There are no aircraft, rotary-winged or otherwise, providing close ground support. There is a single appearance of aircraft that bomb a herd of these ""bugs"" with something like napalm... and then leave. In the novel (the only aspect of the novel I really approve of), Heinlein describes each soldier as a self-contained, self-mobile unit, able to fight with a modicum of effectiveness even singly or in small numbers.And don't be fooled by the rating, Denise Richards remains clothed. Dina Meyers has a brief scene of nudity. I advise against watching this movie on television to to VERY heavy editing. Really, what's the point?

The cast consists of people who were at the time fairly unknown, but nevertheless do a good job and are entertaining to watch. The fairly unknown, but very goodlooking cast, together with the futuristic scenario of the story created a kind of ""glossy"" feel to the film, that boosts the Sci-Fi value at least in my experience. Thus ends my summary of a highly entertaining Sci-Fi action movie... ...but only later, when I watched the movie again at least once, I started noticing more and more things that made the movie even more interesting. Because underneath he simple, but entertaining film there's a layer of ethical discussion and reflection. I also know now that the film was based on a book with a fairly strong political undertone. Although I am not the only one who at first didn't notice this in the film too clearly, I now like the film only even more for it.**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Society as it is in this film raises ethical questions, besides the fact that ethical discussion is literally present in the story at some points.

I mean the writers came up with the most vicious creatures in the galaxy, a fictional space army and give them a brutal war against each other. A lot of credit has to go to the special effects, nothing looks fake at all, and thats especially good for 1997. This movie is already good, but after you watch the sequel (horrible) it makes it look even better.The story starts out as a normal futuristic high school guy with a nice high school sweetheart when things change in an instant and they are suddenly driven towards the army and battle gigantic limb-picking brain-licking creatures. Enough with the spoilers, just go and buy it, its a very interesting tale to watch. A work of art, enough said.",Starship Troopers
411,Craig JS,"Guns, Guts, Gals......what more could a guy ask for?",6,9 August 1998,"Paul Verhoeven has decided that movies about societies scantily clad (Showgirls) are not his forte. And rightly so has gone back to excessively violent SCI-FI/action films. After watching showgirls 5 to 26 times its refreshing (ahem).Starship Trooper's concept, alien bugs that hurl meteors at us is so far beyond reasonable thought to try for realism. So Thankfully it doesn't even bother. Visual sight gags and dish water weak plot keep pace nicely with the excessive violence creating a nice comic book feel. It almost allows us to be fooled into thinking that we are watching art. All this being said it takes a predictable Hollywood approach and focuses on the fun that can be had with special effects, heaving bosoms and the loading politically correct bad guys with as much lead as they like with out the possibility of getting some random minority rights group ticked. Its an enjoyable film (if you are a guy) and definitely worth a look on DVD if you some how managed to miss it until now.",Starship Troopers

413,myrddyn,Where's the Heinlein?,3,10 August 1998,"The box in which the video came said ""based on the novel by Robert Heinlein"".  Fortunately, Oregon has a basic Statute of Frauds, and the video store refunded my rental price.   The movie ""Starship Troopers"" lacks the book's character development, plot, motivation, terrene form of government, time line, character interaction, and literary merit.  Instead of a government run by responsible veterans ""simply because it works"", the movie proffers an out -of-control fascist regime.  This brain-sucking obliterates Juan Rico's personal development; that very maturation process is the cornerstone of the book. His rise as a responsible human being, culminating in his passage through the rigors of officer's training, is simply impossible within the context (I can't call two threads a ""fabric"") of this movie.   So, let's start from scratch -- assume that the Heinlein hook wasn't on the box.  ""Starship Troopers"" still has no discernable character development and little discernible plot.  There is simply nothing on the emotional or intellectual planes to get me personally involved with the movie.  The special effects are excellent, but I can get equal impact from a fireworks display on the 4th of July.   However, this does not make a watchable movie, any more than a pyrotechnical display and a naked assistant make a great magician.  When I come to see prestidigitation, I'm hardly satisfied with the distractions.   I'm disappointed that Hollywood can't seem to recognize a good story even when it bites them.  ""Dune"" was overdone, underacted, and missed the mark somewhat.  ""Enemy Mine"" was a forgettable hack job.  ""Starship Troopers"" is a waste of good pyrotechnics.",Starship Troopers
414,myrddyn,Saw it again; still no substance,3,2 November 2000,"Before you ask, seeing this again was the price of maintaining a long-distance friendship.   I still can't figure out what Paul Verhoeven was trying to do with this picture.SCIENCE FICTION ? Decidedly not.  We're supposedly 200+ years into the future.  Think back to the weaponry of, say, the US Revolutionary War.  Compare it to current weapons.  Now make a leap of similar magnitude beyond that, and what do we get?  Heinlein postulated MI in powered-armor suits, dealing death in a dozen ways as personal as a punch in the nose.  Verhoeven has our troopers still fighting with machine guns and hand grenades.  No ""smart"" weaponry whatsoever, not even hand-held energy beams, and communication systems that are still blocked by canyon walls and bugged with static.  Food service is still slop served with spoons from a heated aluminum tray.  Bathing is still bar soap rubbed on by hand under a shower of running water.  Finally, how did only 200+ years of immigration wipe out the genetic heritage of Buenos Aires?  I see no influence of the original natives, only Carmen bears Spanish features, and nobody shows any of today's huge mixed-Japanese population.THE HORRORS OF WAR ? Forget it.  First of all, the technical and continuity errors left this a slapstick affair.  Second, to get me to feel the horrors, you have to engage me in the characters.  The shallow formula characters continuously reminded us that they're only cardboard cutouts of people.  Even John Wayne got better character depth. Third, you have to engage me in the plot conflicts.  Verhoeven needed to decide whether or not he had time to work on relationship tension -- four lines to work out a deep emotional attachment just doesn't cut it, and merely exposes the development problems.  As for the war itself, we never get any real tension of battle or long-term planning.PARODY OF WAR MOVIES ? Perhaps.  War action scenes with stupid tactics even at the squad level (""They can spit napalm: let's bunch up!""), one technical error or discontinuity after another ... and after that's established, we have to suspend belief in *those* ""world rules"" whenever there's a mano-a-mandible close-up (note the changes in pace of battle and troop reaction time).  Even then, some great foreshadowing and set-up opportunities go by unharvested, and the utterly superfluous shower scene defeats its own purpose.SPECIAL EFFECTS ? Nah.  The formula stuff in action films gets standard-of-the-art computer simulation; the day-to-day details are incredibly cheap.  For instance, when Rico is recovering from his leg wound, they give him a huge floatation tank, some cute wound-knitting creature, but force him to breathe through a gas-can hose and lie inconvenienced for ""three more days"". At first, I wondered why their established Name Actor (Neil Patrick Harris) was shuffled to a peripheral role.  I finally figured it out: if they hadn't, Dr. Doogie would never have let them get away with all the errors in human physiology.  With Carl out of the way, we get the classicly hilarious brain-sucking scene and Carmen's Polyanna attitude some 5 minutes later (when she should be bleeding heavily while Rico radios for a medic).   Overall, ""Starship Troopers"" erratic, sloppy, and ill-planned.",Starship Troopers

416,clay_thompson,An Excuse for a Movie,3,16 June 2006,"Some years ago Edward Neumeier developed a script about a war between Earth and a planet of highly intelligent spiders. The relative strength of the script is unknown by me, but I do know he could not sell the script. Somehow, he became attached to a movie based upon Robert Heinlein's controversial novel, ""Starship Troopers."" When Heinlein wrote the book, he had been writing novels for a younger readership that were called, ""Juveniles."" His editor was horrified at some of the sentiments of the book and refused to publish it. Heinlein literally took the book to a publisher across the street who was delighted to get a work from a best selling author. They published the book and Science Fiction's highest honor - the Hugo award for best novel.The political sentiments expressed in the novel have been called Fascist, among other things. Technically, Fascism is an economic system and not a political one. Nevertheless, the objectionable part of the book was, for the most part, background material and not the purpose of the book. There was also hand to hand battle with the ""Bugs."" In the book, the Mobile Infantry, the military group portrayed, did battle in personal armor, not in platoon sized transports.Verhoeven's vision was Hollywood at it's worst. Verhoeven decided to view the movie through the lens of the invasion of his boyhood home, Holland, by Nazi Germany. In doing so, he robbed the book of its heart and soul. The heart of the book was the growth of Jonny Rico, and the relationships built among him and the other members of the Mobile Infantry, and it is almost never dealt with.In the run up to the movie, there were several clips that spoke about Heinlein's wish that he had actually included women in the Mobile Infantry, but I am convinced that he would have grieved over the emasculation of his story. A writer of his caliber, one of the three grand masters of Science Fiction, deserves better.When I watched this the first time, I could not help be reflect on the usage of Verhoeven as direction. They used a director whose vision of life was was diametrically opposed to that the of the original writer. Verhoeven owed him more. I wish he had read the novel.",Starship Troopers
417,Fractalizer,Underrated and Misunderstood,8,5 March 2002,"This comment contains major SPOILERS.I have read and heard the most diverse comments on this movie, including ""trash with bad acting and script"", ""good popcorn movie"",  and ""tries to be smart but fails"".What these comments had in common is that in my opinion they all missed the point completely.First of all, the casting of soap stars, the at times wooden acting, the lurid presentation... all this is totally intentional and it requires considerable skill from cast and crew to pull off in this way. Maybe they weren't skilled enough though because some viewers apparently still thought that they were watching substandard quality? While Starship Troopers can certainly be enjoyed only for the effects (cool CGI spaceships and trademark Verhoeven OTT gore) I think that maybe it shouldn't because that would mean ignoring its important message.As for those who were able to acknowledge that the film has in fact message and meaning but complained about it trying to constantly hammer home a point - yes, this is partly true, but I found it most intriguing how the picture works on much more subtle levels as well.An example: Basically the viewer realizes during the first few minutes of the movie that it is set in a weird kind of fascist utopia. It is not made hard for the viewer to disagree with this world order. Just think of all the blatantly jingoistic propaganda in the ""TV ads"" the story is interspersed with.So you watch for almost 2 hours, constantly thinking ""why are they fighting this pointless war""....... and then the bugs kill Diz.OK, this is highly subjective, but at that point I kind of started to hate those bugs myself. Why Diz?? You just don't want her to die at this time in the movie.Anyway, _very_ shortly afterwards the militaristic organization that because of my emotional involvement I was now half-willing to accept as a necessary means to an end shows itself from its worst side: Colonel ""Doogie Howser"" Jenkins enters the room dressed like a Gestapo officer and talks about ""mere numbers"", not interested in the loss of his friends. Seeing what this initially likable character has developed into was just spooky! And finally, the end sequence with the capturing of the ""brain bug"". I just felt sorry for the poor thing and was disgusted by the cheering humans.But after Diz's death 10 minutes earlier I had been manipulated into wanting to cheer _with them_! Despite everything I had seen up to then!So watching in disgust as the brain bug was subjected to various bizarre methods of ""examination"" AND knowing that I had almost crossed the line of allying with its sick torturers I just felt.... weak and guilty.ST's odd mixture between SFX-rich space flick and cynical satire on 1940's war propaganda movies might be awkward in places. But it demonstrates how people can be manipulated to align themselves with ideas they don't originally agree with - by doing exactly that with the viewer! This I find quite remarkable and the strong anti-fascist message that is the result kind of makes this a serious film.For me this is one of Verhoeven's best, second only to Total Recall, and a solid 8/10.(No, I haven't seen his Dutch films.)",Starship Troopers
418,bmattingly,Don't Let Plot get in the way of special effects...,3,23 February 2001,"This movie had no plot, except of course to kill alien bugs in allpossible ways.

419,isabelbutic,Maybe too subtle for its own good,10,7 April 2004,"I am extremely dismayed by the amount of imdb users and newspaper critics who did not see the satire in this film. Some thought it was ""Yeah! War!"" and were either condoning or horrified. Others thought it was purely a sci-fi extravaganza that was as deep as a puddle. A few users understood it for the anti-fascism work or art that it was. Once that level of understanding is established the Barbie & Ken actors, cheezy jingoist slogans and gratuitous violence make sense. Users may sneer at those who misinterpret the intent- but really, only if one has taken both upper level undergraduate english and history courses in which they are exposed to various examples of satire and militaristic propaganda can one more easily discern the director's intent. Those individuals defensive of people in the military please take note that this film is not lampooning the rank and file infantrymen but the ""powers that be"" that convince young men and women to bravely risk their lives for ""ivory tower"" strategists. They are not depicted as sheep, but products of their roles and the situations in which they are placed which necessarily shape them into willing pawns of those who outrank them. I would argue that this film is a critique of how well intentioned, highly impressionable youth are transformed into ""black & white,"" ""us against them"" thinking war mongering fascists.
Maybe spoilers?The violence inflicted upon these sympathetic youth scream out that the society depicted is wrong. THe fact that baby faced Carl turns into Nazi-garb wearing, sacrifice his friends, get spider guts splatterd on him on TV type of guy should tune viewers in that the director thinks Carl turned evil. Also the maniacal look of characters in the news broadcast should indicate that 'all is not well' in this fictitious society. Additionally that the ""other"" is so ugly but the main characters are so pretty but vicious demonstrates that the director, screenwriter or whoever want viewers to understand that there are no absolute good and bad guys. Each specie had their endearing and disgusting points. The arachnids were responding to what they perceived as an attack. Thus they responded in kind. The humans- oblivious to the arachnids' sentiment- reacted to the attack against them.  But the brains behind ST are trying to illustrate how issues are not as ""good guy vs. bad guy."" There is enough blame to go around twice and then some. The humans were not right in colonizing the arachnids land, but the spiders were not right in retaliating with an asteroid.But maybe those in charge were a little too good at disguising their kritik as hollywood fluff.

One wonders if we'd pursue the slaughter of the alien hordes with the same gusto if they looked like Ewoks. Somehow I can't picture propaganda videos of children and mothers stomping on guinea pigs...Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers was essentially a glorification of combat, and made much of the whole idea of the ""just"" war, while Joe Haldeman's excellent ""The Forever War"", published around the same time, painted war as ugly, dehumanizing and ultimately pointless.

I appreciate people who hate this movie because of that.As a sci-fi movie, this purposely hits all the tropes in a delightful way. This movie had me smiling from ear to ear and I can appreciate the intentional campiness of it all.In 2020, I feel the special effects hold up really well, especially when you consider this movie is over 20 years old. The CGI is remarkable, mixed with practical effects.You can tell that Paul Verhoeven has a dislike of military and the similarities with Nazis is clear. It probably stems from him being alive during the WWII period. That said, the political undertones didn't feel to overbearing for me. And I'm conservative leaning in ideology.This is probably in my personal top 5 sci-fi movies of all time. I can put this on and just about any time of day and enjoy it. The soundtrack is even impressive. I love the small propaganda commercials.

The world's best and brightest go off to fight a war against a species that will definitely fight to the last mandible!

It should also be mentioned that this movie contains the best CGI I've ever seen, as the bugs interact with the humans in a terrifyingly seamless way. Far superior than anything else to come out in 1997, this movie along with Robocop and Total Recall elevates Verhoven to an elite level of sci-fi director, no matter what other projects he's been involved in.

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.""-Joseph GoebbelsHermann Goering said that if you want to start a war, you only need to tell the people that they are under attack. The masses will join in the cause and pacifists and dissidents are deemed to be ""unpatriotic"". It is of course helpful if an important building burns down ,or better yet explodes, to get the masses mobilized. When you have a mighty army and a militaristic culture, then all you need is a flash-point to start a war.Early on in Starship Troopers such a flash-point happens. A giant meteor hits civilian population and the media decides that ""bugs"" have started a war. Constant media coverage,imbedded journalists and largely compliant public thirsts for war. Continuous war mongering and fear mongering will keep the people in check. Talking heads and intellectuals are outraged that the government hasn't attacked the bugs already. Attack Klendethu now!

The whole movie is filled with this kind of irony. Some, or most, viewers, might be offended by the fact that all the characters we follow are happily growing in a society governed by this kind of totalitarian ideology. I'd say those viewers are forgetting an obvious mitigating factor : the bugs. Do you think a happy-go-lucky bohemian democracy could produce troops eager to kill those myriads of bugs ? No, you kill bugs you are happy. Simple. Yet, the movie can be a drag to watch. It's still a standard sci/fi-action affair regardless of your affections to Heinlein phylosophy and the fact the director treats the material with a sardonic smile ( most of the dialogs sounded intentionally corny to me ) don't help much.

It was so horribly messed up that I can't give a 'non-spoilers' review, but rather just highlight some of the wonderful problems I had with the movie. These are just the ones I can remember.Spoilers follow, but nothing critical to your enjoyment (or rather lack thereof) of this movie.To begin with, the premise of the aliens hitting the earth with an asteroid was a bit sketchy. I mean, that's a heck of a job for bugs to see an asteroid, calculate its orbit, and somehow launch a projectile in order to change its path with enough precision to hit a planet. Sure, earth may seem big to us people, but in, say, the volume of the solar system it is an immensely tiny speck. But, lets suspend disbelief for this. Now, conveniently, this asteroid not only hits the earth, but it hits *land* on a planet where three quarters of its surface is covered in water. Then, to top it off, it hits a MAJOR POPULATED CITY. One in which the main character also conveniently has family. Right. Very likely.Next, we have the human's approach to the bug planet in their fleet. All the ships bunch together, and they get wiped out as much by the bugs as they do from running into one another from being bunched together. Space is really big folks, spread apart so you don't kill yourselves! Anyway, this, again, is forgivable. Until they do it AGAIN, on their second attack!Now we get to the actual combat. Why, oh why, did the powers putting together this film decide to abandon the high tech machinery such as cybernetic exoskeletons from the book in favor of simple ground troops? Again, they can be forgiven for this- until they show that they DO have advanced weaponry, and don't use it to effect. They wiped out huge piles of bugs with their air strike, yet they only thought to use the air strike once. They have miniature nuclear warheads that can do massive damage yet they only bring a couple along. With the technology demonstrated in the movie, it would have been possible to annihilate the entire planet without even setting foot on the planet- just drop nuclear bombs from the ships safely in orbit!This leads up to my favorite part of the movie. There is a scene in which Pretty Young Face # 3 (Denise Richards) must pilot a battlecruiser after stereotypically showing that she's the best hotshot pilot ever. For some reason, they don't notice a giant asteroid bearing down upon them as they are traveling in the opposite direction, and a suspense-filled scene follows in which she barely turns the ship out of the way in time, and saves the day, but not before they loose their only means of warning the earth about this impending disaster. Sorry, but I have a few problems with this. First, how do you not *notice* an asteroid like that? Second, why do they loose all communications from this collision? You're telling me a vessel like this, which must survive in the vast empty environment that is space doesn't have a redundant set of antennas? Finally, the entire scene is completely impossible. Both the ship and the asteroid are traveling in OPPOSITE directions at interstellar velocities. Even if they were traveling at, say, merely the reentry velocity of a space shuttle, both would be moving at 8 km per SECOND! The asteroid would have flashed past and destroyed whatever part of the ship happened to be in the way- not the heart-stopping, nerve-wrenching slow turn more fitting of a submarine movie.The only thing in this movie that was vaguely interesting were, at the time, the advanced computer graphics. Now, there's nothing left holding it up. Well, maybe one thing. I suppose there's the shower scene for all the teenagers who aren't old enough to rent porn.",Starship Troopers
438,Hellmao,Bugs and mirrors,9,20 October 2005,"An alien race threatens mankind. The bugs are coming and they are ugly and dangerous. After heavy fighting for freedom the planet can be finally saved. Sure, the whole thing comes in the jacket of a state-of-the-art action movie. It is not about insects from outer space, however.There was a lot of fuzz about Heinlein's book and what Verhoeven's adaptation displays in the movie. Doesn't it promote militarism? Is this gory over-the-top violence really necessary? Some protagonists behave kind of odd and bad, and the wrong ones die. People even were concerned about the uniforms. Good guys in Gestapo-outfit? It is an amazing complaint since the key to this movie is the human world that ""Starship Troopers"" describes.Good looking kids engage in sending stupid messages to each other during the class, while the teacher explains that brutal force is the strongest power to solve problems. It's a global community in which coming from Buenos Aires does not mean any Italian or Latin roots any more. There is no place for love in this indifferent world, where men and women sport together, take a shower together, fight together and die together. ""Citizenship"" has to be earned in battle, since the only real defender of human values is the soldier. It is a world with an obsession for guns and competition, in which telepathic skills are contracted immediately by the secret police. They are convinced of their own superiority, think big and consider individual human life a very limited value. These guys wear fascist-style uniforms because they are fascists. That's the whole point. Welcome to the United States of Earth.Starship Troopers contains some wonderful ideas, presented with the whole range from subtle irony to rough rudeness. A map points at the rear end of the galaxy to locate evil. TV soap stars are casted as leading roles and they also act like in a soap. Most of the teachers are mutilated. When Rico battles the first tanker bug, they look pretty much alike and his size compared to the bug is quite the same as a real bug's size compared to man. Later, a traumatized general will be speaking the magic words: ""They are like us"" . Final victory is apparent when the enemy is found ""afraid"" and has been made possible by ""a drill instructor who captured a brain"" . This is not about bugs, but men. The strange thing is, many people still just don't get it. This statement does not mean any disrespect to the perception of anybody who does not understand this movie. Me, I don't understand most of Frank Zappa's compositions, and I don't understand most of the exposed work at any Museum of Modern Art. But I can clearly see the touch of genius in this cynical and inventive movie called ""Starship Troopers"".",Starship Troopers

440,DeadpoolX,Best satire since Dr. Strangelove,10,23 July 2003,"Starship Troopers is a subtle and insidiously subversive movie that proved frighteningly prescient in the wake of post-9/11 uberpatriotism.  Both Heinlein's book and Verhoeven's film are valid and interesting political statements at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Heinlein's novel was criticized as fascist at the time of its publication, and for all his obvious talent as a writer I'm inclined to agree.  The movie is as much a sendup of the original novel as it is a satire of jingoist American politics.  It really is a shame that despite the squeaky-clean heroes plucked straight from the soaps, the Mormon extremists, the multiple-amputee mobile infantry retirees and the propaganda shorts masquerading as news, the vast majority still seems to regard Starship Troopers as a stupid action movie and, for some reason, absolutely refuse to consider that it might be something more.10/10",Starship Troopers
441,wwc-johnb,A good space opera that is antiwar and also anti-pacifism,7,26 February 2006,"After scanning the comments on this film, I can't help but think that most reviewers missed the point. Yes, this film is antiwar. However, it is definitely not a spoof/satire/tongue-in-cheek! This is not a Naked Gun or even Dr. Strangelove. The antiwar message is presented from the perspective of the warrior, who sees and must live with the horror of war. The warrior's perspective is clear throughout this film, with references to duty, honor, country (planet?); unit pride; acceptance of responsibility; and acceptance of a dirty job that someone must do. Heinlein makes the point that citizenship should be something that is earned by those who know what it costs to defend freedom. This is clear early on in the movie when Rico defies his father to join up and defend the planet, while his non-citizen father thinks that it is better to just go on vacation.Several reviewers also suggested that this society of the future was fascist. Yet there is no reference to a police state, forcing people to join up, or even punishing wrong thinkers. In fact, the parents are openly against the whole thing and are never punished. Instead, they continue to live comfortable lives (at least for a while).Overall, this is a good space opera with a complex message. It is also a fair story about growing up and facing responsibility.",Starship Troopers

444,Straff,Surprise!! Surprise!!,7,22 October 1999,"After I'd finished watching this film I was stunned. I thought I was going to be treated to a special effects bonanza and nothing else, but I was never so happy to be wrong. And before everybody starts to shout, yes it is dependent upon the effects, but there is a lot more in there as well.From the outset of this film there is a certain amount of ""tongue in cheek"" about it. The film-makers have realised that they can't make the film to serious and as a result do something a bit different.They make fun of certain aspects of the film, especially the military of todays society and their particularly ""gun ho"" attitudes. The film makes you think about the social structures of todays society when it comes to war (you may not like to admit it to yourself but it does), and it mixes all of this in with subtle humour that keeps you amused throughout.The above block of text gives off the impression of a boring movie, but there is a lot of action. Oh yes, theres a whole load of action. There is never much time to dwell on what has just gone on because you have to pay attention to the next attack from the bugs etc. There is never a dull moment throughout the film, its great.Sadly though, there is your bog standard smelly lump of Hollywood cheese. The typical c****y romance lines are there and it kind of lets the film down a bit.This is not one of the greatest films that has ever been produced, but it is definately worth watching. You can switch off and relax, you don't have to study every single line that gets spoken, or feel as though you have to guess who done it and how, which is no bad thing from time to time.I think everyone who watches this movie will enjoy it, but if you don't then don't blame me.",Starship Troopers
445,Melvin-8,Let´s see.......,10,10 August 1999,"A movie done by Verhoeven(Total Recall), Ed Neumeier(Robocop)and the Special Effect Masters of ILM, Sony Imageworks and Boss Films.Well I expected a great Sci-Fi movie with great War-Scenes. What I got to see was one of the best Ati-Warmovies of all time(nearly comparable to Apocalypse Now).Ok some blame the movie for its violence but strangely those people who blame ST for the violence say nothing when Spielberg uses it in his Propaganda-Movie ""Saving Private Ryan""(c´mon not all germans were Nazis in WW 2).""Saving"" was much more violent and strangely you felt sorry for the bleeding GI´s but wanted to cheer everytime a german got killed.Not in ST. Actually you feel sorry for the Brain in the end. In ST the audience finds out more and more throughout the movie that the bugs reacted in Self-Defence and were not responsible for the war.(Check out the Audiocommentary on the DVD!)This movie was made for 3 kinds of people:1.Intellectual : They realized that the Fed-Net spots were nothing but ""copies"" of CNN spots shown during the Gulf War(which leads us back to the Propaganda by the medias used nowadays).You´ve got to realize that the US more and more has become a fascist Nation(anti-Islam, anti-Black, anti-Jews).That´s something this movie showes: The perfect World in ST can only exist as long as there is an enemy(like in the US:""fighting Irak is boring let´s go get some Jugoslawians"")2.Gorehounds: They got to see violence, guts, people melting and so on... OK let them have fun as long as they get the bitter tone of the film.....3.People who think that everything in this world is Perfect: Often those people are the ones who underrate movies like this one or they just don´t want to hear the critique on their homecountry.I liked this movie a lot because the filmmakers tried not to abuse my Intelligence like ""ID 4"" did. This is not a movie you forget when you leave the theatres....well as long as you are a ""Number one kind of guy/girl.""Speaking for me I am a mixture of 1 and 2 (yes I love Action-Flicks and even more if they have an intelligent tone).",Starship Troopers
446,Raoul-16,an unmitigated pile of crap,1,31 May 2000,"As soon as I remember who it was that told me this movie wasn't actually as bad as it looked in the trailers, I'm going to wring his or her neck.  I wasted nearly an hour of my life watching the 2nd half of this film last night, and I'm still retching.  This was truly putrid filmmaking at its worst.  The ""big payoff,"" as has been more than adequately noted in these reviews, is the fact that this movie is actually a satire and that humans can be the bad guys.  Fine, but so what?  I need the director of ""Showgirls"" to tell me that?  Hey, folks--here's a little observation: the category of ""satire"" does not raise a work of art above criticism.  Just because it's not supposed to be ""good"" in any straight/conventional sense doesn't mean it is absolved of the responsibility of being a good satire.  A brief overview of any of the spate of horrible Zucker Brothers-clone movies churned out over the last decade (or even some of their own later films, for that matter) should prove conclusively that is is very possible to make a bad satire, and this is an awful one.  It is neither funny nor profound, and I would even argue that this is that worst of possible satires--a completely insincere one which pretends to mock the subject matter it in fact sensationalistically exploits for sales and cheap shock.  I will admit that I liked ""Robocop"" and even ""Total Recall,"" but Verhoeven's direction is getting lazier, sloppier, and more contemptful of his audience with every film, to the point where he now clearly no longer cares at all whether he is insulting that audience's intelligence or not.  This film is utterly pointless, thin, devious, corrupt, banal, and cynical--in the worst sense.

They are just fictionally set in the future.The treat, instead being humans in the same country, are portrayed as aliens which are insect like who live very far in space. With all that said, you just need the common enemy and the trigger to ignite the war.And oh boy, war we have. In all the glorious gore, action, sfx, practical effects and outstanding music that the 90's could bring, backed by a 3 way romance that guides the plot.Despite the fact that i have seen many movies about most of the actors featured here, their more iconic roles, for me, came from Starship Troopers. Great acting, directing. The plot is not complicated, but guides the well written scenes from point A to point B in a pace that is satisfactory to explain whats going on.I said the plot is very basic, while it is true if you see the movie at face value, it makes you actually think how different society would be had the axis had won the war if you are familiarized with the real history. So the plot has double meaning, the visible that guides the movie, and the invisible one that makes you wonder.I think this was Paul Verhoeven jewel (Robocop/show girls), its the only film of the franchise he directed, Starship troopers would never was better than this.

However as mentioned the film has many layers to it and the deeper you go the better it becomes. At first it just seems to be a bog standard teen high school movie with the ""teenagers"" all actually being in their mid to late 20s. It's like High School Musical with no music but retaining the typical teenage angst. We're told at the start that Democracy has failed and it appears to be have replaced with a worldwide military dictatorship. The war with the bugs is introduced and the theme of human superiority rears its head. Underestimating the enemy is a general theme which harks back to the Vietnam wars, French and US, but once the mistake is realised then it's assumed that better weaponry and inherently superior human intellect will prevail and the human race will be dominant which echoes the Nazi philosophy about racial purity and genetic superiority. A negotiated settlement is put forward by the more enlightened but is dismissed as offensive. The ending is left open-ended as Verhoeven anticipated a sequel or at least hoped for one with an increased budget. Hence the continued Nationalistic rhetoric and the emphasis on better weapons with the lack of people to use them meaning that kids are now enlisting. The parallel with the use of children as soldiers in some wars is obvious but here is all part of doing your bit! As a pure Sci Fi movie it's poor apart from the special effects with average acting and a seemingly average script which appears superficial.

As an action movie, its good, pure fun. The special effects blend amazingly well, to me the most important part of it. Take a look at Gladiator and you can tell the difference between a well done blend job and a hackneyed take. Verhoven didn't need to pay his actors much, so all the money could go there. Everything else pretty much adds up the satire. Who else would take these actor and put them in these costumes? Doogie Howser the SS officer, the machismo talk and glamour faces...As for the nudity, we as an audience are the only ones who care, as an American audience most of all. The carnage is the same as the Wild Bunch and westerns, we watch violence and blood and gore. If you didn't like this one, well, if its more graphic then its safe to say its more realistic too.I'm usually a purist about movies following books, though considering Heinlien it fits. Increasingly conservative in his own politics, this is the spirit that he wanted, though perhaps not portrayed this way. And if Verhoven mocks it, well, someone should. Duty and responsibility are fine things to promote, but Verhoven wants to warn us about what happens when any one group takes control, and its closer to reality than Heinlein's vision.Calculated and over-the-top, but a well crafted and fun movie.",Starship Troopers

This is my favorite Paul Verhoeven movie to this day only rivaled by Hollowman.
The effects of this movie look great. Especially considering this was made in 1997 where making something made with CGI look like it isn't from a Playstation 2 game was exceedingly hard.
The bugs in this movie blend so well with the backgrounds that I didn't even notice the CG most of the time. The action is stellar and exciting. The funny scenes, while never getting a laugh out of me, made me adorn my face with a smile more often than not. The world it creates is intriguing and interesting. The movie is very cliché ridden throughout most of it's running time, but that is kind of the point. It potrays all of the soldiers as glorious heroes and the bugs simply as the enemy without ever delving into why the bugs are antagonizing humanity. Maybe we intruded upon their domain and provoked them into acting. The presentation of this future gives us an insight into what we as an entirety can become if we just focus on trying to eliminate the enemy with any means necessary and every attempt to comprehend the cause of and reasoning behind why we started the war in the first place are replaced by defending war cries.

461,KelticKarma,Its AFRAID !!,10,4 October 2002,"One of my favourite films, this one.I love the way Verhoeven approached the idea of Man v Beast. Our ""heros"" are beautiful, white-teethed Americans, firm of body and morals; our villains are decapitating stick insects, cockroaches, and giant maggots.
Yet who are the real heroes ?The white-teethed Americans are vacuous, shallow thugs. They are thrust into a war with the Bugs, whose planets, we are told, have been invaded by the Americans. The Bugs are justifiably annoyed. I couldn't help but laugh at some of the ""Nazi"" parallels drawn by other reviewers. What Verhoeven is putting across in this film is not a polemic against Nazi ideology, but an attack upon American Imperialism in the latter part of the last century. He is satirising American crusades against other countries, whose inhabitants are portrayed in the American press as no better than Bugs. Had Verhoeven wished to attack Nazism, he could have given the good guys German accents; he didn't, he gave them American accents. The ""Nazi"" symbolism as commented upon by other reviewers is not Nazi symbolism at all - it is totalitarian symbolism, full stop. It is right-wing, ""bomb them back to the stone age"" American totalitarianism.Why do I believe this ? Check out the scene where American kids are encouraged to stamp on cockroaches by an overly excited parent. Check out the high fives.Verhoeven has done a mighty job here. He has made a film which has great action, great cinematography, very cute women (and boys) and yet the film still manages to take the mickey out of the New Order in a very funny and effective manner.10/10",Starship Troopers
462,beckwith10,A Masterpiece of Satire?,10,15 February 2009,"Starship Troopers is now 10 years old ... I've always admired the film since first seeing it in the theatre upon its release in '97. I should mention, standard sci-fi is not my genre of choice, though I'll certainly watch sci-fi movies if they've an interesting idea to offer. In any case, I recently got a hold of a Starship Trooper DVD and have been revisiting the film. I've come to the conclusion that the film not only holds up well (indeed, it seems almost prophetic as I watch it now after that eight year debacle called the Bush administration) it is also a remarkably witty piece with a powerfully satirical, highly critical subtext on the themes of militancy and fascism that ring ever more true and clear now. The film's critical perspective of film history, specifically the propaganda films of World War II which the film takes as its touchstone, provides a sly and clever commentary, if not deconstruction, of cinematic tradition that it rises above. It also, needless to say, succeeds wonderfully as an inventive action film, made with technical care and attention to detail, including the cheesy dialogue (The only good bug is a dead bug) and its B-list casting. Starship Troopers is an intentional simulation of an assembly line B-film, though the sensibility behind it, pure tongue-in-cheek, is anything but that of a B-film. An argument can be made it is, yes, a masterpiece, and worthy of canon status and certainly archival preservation.",Starship Troopers
463,gri666,"Loved the book, loved the movie!",10,16 March 2008,"Totalitarian human society fights a total war with huge alien intelligent bugs, what else can you ask for?Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct) this movie represents for me everything I like about Sci-Fi action movies: space travel, war, realistic cruel society, alien race. The society in the movie resembles Nazi Germany but rather mockingly: the news broadcasts look like propaganda, soldiers are sent to death without much thought. However I think that in case of a war with an alien race this is the kind of society humanity will need.This movie is based on a novel by R. Heinlein, which I recommend to read even if you've already seen the movie. The movie covers a rather small part of the book, and the book is just so much more interesting!What I didn't like is that they didn't dress the soldiers in muscle power magnifier suits with jet engines like in the novel. This raises the question why didn't they use tanks against the bugs. The novel provides an explanation: those suits are better than tanks. But anyway, for year 1998 the special effects and computer graphics look just great.Definitely one of my favorite movies.",Starship Troopers

It starts out with a group of high school friends deciding to join the military in order to become citizens or follow their crushes around either way they wind up in the military fighting the forces of bugs that are threatening their way of life. It sounds a lot more stupid than it actually is.My favorite part of the movie is the beginning, where they're catching you up to speed through website new reels. They explain the threat and the war without making you feel like the writer thinks you're stupid and you can't figure things out.It's a campy kind of movie, but it's cute. I hear the sequels leave much to be desired but we'll see.",Starship Troopers
465,GeorgiaDixie,A Very Entertaining Film,10,19 January 2015,"I thoroughly enjoyed Starship Troopers, having read the book beforehand. While it is different from Heinlein's original novel, Starship Troopers is a very good action-oriented sci-fi film that most people will enjoy. You can watch it as pure entertainment, which it does a very good job at; or you can watch it and analyze the underlying themes, plots, and the attempts it makes at being more like the book. Either way, you won't be disappointed. All of the main actors do a decent job and Michael Ironside does a superb job in a significant supporting role. The special effects are quite good and the director (Verhoeven) keeps the story moving along at a fast pace while still allowing the audience to get to know and care about the characters. There is a large amount of violence in this picture, so you won't like the film if you can't stand a good bit of blood and gore (both human and alien). This violence, however, just makes the mood of the movie seem more realistic with the ""down on the ground"" feeling of war that this film attempts to impart to the viewer.",Starship Troopers

The action scenes were great, with flawless computer animation (how Titanic beat it for SFX I will never know) and enhancement supported by what can only be described as gore-laden prosthetics. I thought they could have left the love story out, but that's Hollywood.Very watchable, and a nice change from the Alien movies - this is WAR, not some isolated pit-fight! I love the Alien movies, but Startship troopers just has a lot o' lead, heads, and bodies flying left, right and centre! I thought the Mobile Infantry could have used better weaponry (apparently in the novel that it's based on, the MI has powered armour with assault cannon and missile launchers etc.) to battle such a foe, but I'm just being technical.If you want a nice beer & pretzels movie to yell and scream at, then this is it.10 out of 10",Starship Troopers
468,Alêx,Cynical science fiction war movie,10,19 May 1999,"This movie is based on the novel by Robert Heinlein which describes polemic a prosperous fascist future. The humans are united, there are no social, religious or racial differences. The energy problem is solved. A murderer is arrested, sentenced and executed in one day. There is no regime but a military oligarchy. The sole problem is some extraterrestrial bugs which were able to throw asteroids at Earth.Verhoeven took propaganda movies from the second World War and translated them into its primitive structure. He thought, the result of this would clearly reveal the cynical character of the film. This cynical character shows how primitive and bad fascist ideals are and how stupid people are who believe in them. It is as well the reason that the violent scenes you see somehow don't matter. You see these scenes, but you have the feeling that they are far away. I'm usually not interested in violent movies, but here I can make an exception because it shows what fascism really means and what you can expect if you join the army.But there's one problem. The significance and the message of a movie does not depend on the intention of the makers, it is decided by the majority of the audience. I suppose that some of the viewers think, admittedly unintentionally, that fascism is ok, but it isn't. So, it's a dangerous movie.

The history was probably changed after the second world war, we know this because ""Hirosima was destroyed"". Only those can vote who were soldiers of the federation. (And there is logic behind this.) There is only one nation: humanity, this provides the multinational feeling in the movie. The story presents a bit idyllic picture of the future: there is order. The only thing can be strange: the uniforms of the military. They actually look like the Wold War 2 German officers. But you can get used to it.The characters are everyday, the main character is not the best guy on Earth. Finally you can forget about the American cities: the first half hour takes place in Buenos Aires. Rico is ""only"" the team leader of the local football team, bu the's bad in maths, no special psychic abilities. He makes mistakes. So not like the average StarTrek character.

Beneath the surface, this is a very intelligent film, with subtle nods to what our world can and might look like. This film has lots of action, a little nudity, love stories (Barely), space ships, guns, football, soldiers, and good old fashioned camaraderie. About the depth of this film and how it's actually a very intelligent viewing: SPOILER ALERT!!!For example, the nude shower scene. People say it was just added in to show some boobs and entertain an audience of men. Simply not true. This scene shows how in future world, one does not need to feel embarrassed about their body. Guy and girl can be in front of each other, nude, without any sexual emotions propping up. They had a job to do, got sweaty doing it, and needed to shower. So they did. They were even able to carry a group conversation while doing it, without sex coming up at all during the conversation. Also, subtle hints at a fascist, communistic type of future. For example, the license necessary to have a baby, the need to serve in the military in order to obtain citizenship, and even foreshadows our media and political banter of today's world, especially in the scene where two politics debate whether or not there really is a ""smart bug"" on live t.v. The propaganda ads that pop up all throughout the movie. The list could go on and on. END OF SPOILER, BELOW IS OVERALL RATING \/Overall, this is a fantastic movie in many different aspects. I hope you enjoy. I give it 9 out of 10 stars. (I'm biased because I'm a 90's kid and this is clearly a 90's movie, so consider this when reading my review.)",Starship Troopers
477,Evil_Chihuahua,"Good Futuristic War Film, Would You Like To Know More?",7,15 January 2006,"Out of all the Sci-Fi's of the 90's, this one would have to be the boldest. While there were many films at the time like this one, Starship Troopers took a different direction. While many films (including the pathetic Starship Troopers 2) jump straight into the story so we have to learn about the characters as the story goes along, this one takes about 45 minutes to an hour to get into the action, allowing us to learn about each character.The film is set in the future and follows a group of friends who join the army, which is pretty simple. One of the friends, Rico (Casper Van Dien) has a lot of potential, but during a live fire exercise, one of his team-mates is killed after Rico orders him to remove his helmet. Since it was his fault, Rico is punished and decides to come back home. Unfortunately, his home town (and family) are destroyed by an asteroid, which was ""sent"" by a race of giant alien bugs. Rico, with nowhere else to go, reenlists and , with his buddies, is sent off to war against the bugs on their home world.The film is fun, gory and very entertaining, with OK acting and great SFX. One interesting thing about the film are the advertisements and spots that pop up every so often such as asking people to ""Join the fight against the bug!"" and to ""Learn your Foe!"", each one ending with the phrase ""Would you like to know more?"".Starship Troopers is a great film to watch on one of those lazy Saturdays, or if you have your geeky friends over.",Starship Troopers

481,mark.hudson,Subtle satire as was Heinlein's book but on slightly different lines,10,24 May 2008,"Just wanted to register another 10 score to add to the many excellent defences of this fine movie. Of course it's a satire on multiple levels so congratulations to Verhoeven and the entire film-making team for doing this so well, yet also succeeding brilliantly at the shoot-em-up thrills and coming-of-age story aspects (which latter I thought were non-trivial despite some probably deliberate clichés).It seems to me that Heinlein was more ambivalent than Verhoven about fascism, although far from unaware of its dangers. The contrast isn't too surprising, since Verhoeven grew up in Holland not long after World War II and appears to be a thoughtful, essentially empathetic type of person, whilst Heinlein was heavily drawn to playing with theories on an intellectual level. However, Verhoeven's apparent preoccupation with the lessons of the Nazi era may have obscured some of Heinlein's themes.Heinlein was an adult by the time of the war, lived in the US, and never served in the European theatre, so the war's emotional effects on him were different.The heart-rending nature of the screams of the dying arachnids is another of the subtle features of the satire - you may not notice this during a first viewing of the relevant scenes.Apart from that I've nothing to add to earlier reviews except no one seems to have mentioned the comparison that strikes me between the battle scene at the fort, near the end of the film, and at least one major scene in ""Zulu"". Surely this implied analogy is also intentional and part of the film's message.",Starship Troopers

I think it was extremely entertaining as well as funny. The effects were great (okay, giant bugs cutting people in half!) and the storyline was relatively well done.Even though the story of love between working class dude Johnny Rico (the delish Casper Van Dien from Sleepy Hollow) and smart girl Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards from Wild THings and The World is Not Enough) is cliche, it satisfies the romantic requirement needed in almost every movie these days.

483,Matthew Chong,Almost a modern day Nazi propaganda film,6,5 January 2001,"Paul Verhoven's crudely Neo-Fascist and fast-paced war show is an entertaining test of your new home theater system.  Almost like a modern day Nazi propaganda film in most areas, it celebrates the triumph of the Master Organism, Man, over the vermin bugs and their socialist system.To qualify as a True Citizen, our heroes must prove their mettle by serving the Federal Reich, in the face of the gathering hordes of unter-life loitering towards the East (at least on the 'space maps' depicted in the movie).  From kids to Citizens, the heroes and heroines transform from model students and join different arms of the Federal Wermacht.The rich kid star athlete discovers the purity of hard  work and earned respect, his brainy sweetheart finds her true calling in the Fleet/Kriegsmarine, the genius geek becomes a decision-making leader in the honourable trench-coated Gestapo.  Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown provide the  craggy experienced soldier-types who impart wisdom and courage, and teach our heroes the meaning self-sacrifice and of reaching the goals, whatever the costs.The inferiority of the Enemy is proven by the instant improvisation of our saviours in the heat of battle, and the folly of the commune-based hierarchy is shown up with the capture of the 'Superbrain' bugs/commissars.  As a 'great leader' once remarked on the eve of Barbarossa:  ""Kick the door in and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down"".This flick won't try to question the meaning of life nor make any attempt at pushing the boundaries of human relationships, but its good subversive fun, especially if you've always wanted 'them vermin to come git some'.",Starship Troopers

I like the likes of Total Recall, Robocop. They were all my favorite action movies. I heard this movie was directed by Paul, so I decided to give it a try. This movie was not bad as most of the critics said, my vote is 6 out of 10.The Special Effects in this movie was terrific, it should have won an Oscar for that. The scene showing all the spaceships flying around was incredible, and I also wondered how they did the landing scene on Klendathu with millions of soldiers scattering all over the place was also amazing. Lots of explosions, guns, spaceships, you name it. This movie is definitely a must-see for every action-lover. The only complaint was that the weapons were less advanced than I thought it would be. Why did they use huge automatic weapons instead of ray guns. And where were the artillery, planes or even tanks. I think the commander was disqualified to send a bunch of mindless soldiers to their deaths. If he wanted to reduce casualties, he could just send planes to bomb the hell out of them.The violence was on par with Saving Private Ryan. However, the cheesy characters couldn't get our sympathizes. Seeing bunch of soldiers getting decapitated, dismembered and incinerated, I laughed out loudly for their idiocies.The plot was mediocre. But what do you expect? Is it always the same thing for those human-vs-aliens movies. Independence Day, Mars Attacks, Stargate, you name it. The acting was cheesy as hell. I hated every single character in this movie except Sergeant Zim, he was kinda a flesh-and-blood sergeant. And Clancy Brown delivered his best performance since the Shawshank Redemption. Others like Caper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, and of course, the most despicable actress: Denise Richards. She couldn't act, please stop hiring her. Anyway, if you're looking for a more substantial action movie, go watch Terminator and Robocop instead. This was definitely enjoyable.

485,jswraven,"Not good, not bad",5,14 June 2001,"I read ""Starship Troopers"" by Heinlein when I was young.  I always imagined what a great movie it would make.  Paul Verhoeven single-handedly destroyed my vision. In response to those of you who think the plot is 'unoriginal'--the book was written by one of the forefathers of science fiction.  The reason the plot looks unoriginal is because so many have copied it!  (Read some books by Heinlein, Asimov, or Bradbury and you will notice how much Hollywood has 'borrowed' over the years--in fact, I think they're making a movie version of 'Fahrenheit 451' right now...) Anyhow, Verhoeven butchered the book.  Yes, he grew up in WWII Europe, so he had to throw in his own violent/naziesque view of war (hence the bad tactics and the nazi uniforms).  He's a also knows what sells (hence the ultra-violence and the pointless nudity). If you liked this movie, you probably liked 'Independence Day"" too, and that's okay.  If you hated this movie for the above reasons, READ THE BOOK! It's great, the weapons are better, the armor (Murauder suits) are way better, there is a whole other race of aliens involved... it's much better.

Considering this is a Heinlein novel (I've read about six times already), one might think these people are deep, characterized, and bow down to the will of Mr. H. Naaah! Casting was probably the last things on the screenwriters job. Paul Verhoeven had it made by 1994 after making RoboCop, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct then forever soiled his career with Showgirls and then this! 'Starship' has the consistency (and lunacy) of those weekend morning/afternoon sci-fi kiddie shows like Andromeda or Cleopatra albeit this is 1000x more violent. Not for little kids, the scenes of soldiers being impaled, torn apart, and shredded by the life-like (almost cartoonish) bugs with low moron tolerance will make any child have nightmares for months.

487,MrHarley,4 star grade B SF flick - ZERO star adaptation of the novel,2,16 September 2009,"Starship Troopers would be a typical grade-B SF flick if it DIDN'T attempt to claim the mantle of Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein. Weak script, lots of action, little thinking, and superb special effects. If the movie had been titled ""The Bug War"", or ""Spaceship Troopers"", I would have given it four stars. Not an utter waste of two hours of my life, but definitely not worth the money unless you managed to snag a free Redbox rental.The problem is this movie perverts the original author's intent. I've seen poor screen adaptations, but this is different. They actually quote scenes from the novel in a way that utterly warps what Heinlein intended. Instead these scenes are a deliberate a send-up of novel and show how a clever director and script writer(s) can utterly twist the original author's intent. This was done deliberately, as the message of the movie, which is a send-up of jingoism and right wing propaganda, is the opposite of what the novel is about.Starship Troopers is an excellent book, which actually examines war and violence, military virtues, and responsibility. There is a right wing element to it, though anyone who believes it is fascist does not understand fascism. The movie instead makes a parody of all these major themes of the actual story. Those of us who grew up reading Heinlein hope that people will be motivated to read the book, it is classic SF for a very good reason. We don't want people to mistakenly think the movie is at all related to the book.Read the story, compare it to the movie, and you will see what I mean. Just imagine what Harry Potter fans would say if Voldemort was portrayed as an antihero, Dumbledore an ineffectual boob, and Harry an egotistical little snot. Oh, and let's remove Quidditch entirely since we don't like sports for our wizards (i.e. no power armor). You couldn't even make a post about the movie, anywhere, without being flamed to death. That is why people loyal to the novel post about the movie. That is why I am writing this review, to warn anyone watching the movie to please give the novel a chance. The novel is vastly superior, very nuanced if you read it thoughtfully, but yet it can be read as a light action novel, if that fits your mood. The novel is what GOOD writing is all about.",Starship Troopers

The first thing in the film is a Armed forces propaganda mini movie, By the way, watch for a hilarious one later in the movie involving soldiers letting kids play with their guns, which was just hilarious it had some pretty good lines in it that I had a good laugh at, and the first act played like a sci if edition of Dawsons Creek, in the chapter selection section it was called ""The ago of innocence,"" and they were pretty innocent and pure, then the scenes in the camp happened, I expected a cheap Full Metal Jacket sequence and it sort of was but the ""twists and turns"" that happen were surprising, then the battle sequences begin, this is when the movie started to defy logic and fell into some clichés, the main character discovers that it takes a mess load of bullets to take a bug down when its in machine gun mode, but it only takes three when you use it as a shot gun, you'd think he'd learn from this, but he doesn't, at this battle bullets are never an issue, but get to later battle sequences and people are low on ammo left and right, the sacrifices made in war movies are made, and the clichés are followed. Now that the preceding excessively long sentence is completed, heres a new one to sum it all up: Don't watch this movie expecting academy award winning material, because you wont find it here, this is a fun and smarter than most action movie, I recommend for those who wish to kill two hours.7/10",Starship Troopers

Remember Luke's ""parents"" killed in the original Star Wars? Well, Verhoeven pays homage to that scene and others, but presents the clichés in such an innovative fashion that I found myself worried about the fates of the four primary characters. The high school antics and all the Neal Patrick Harris appearances are clearly played for laughs.The movie is really about two pairs of lovers (shades of Archie comics), but who really belongs with whom?  This is the subplot between all the war campaigns against the bugs. It seems that Dizzy (my favorite) will win over our hero with her loyalty, spunk and dedication.  Verhoeven, however, is having fun when he lets Rico fall instead for the voluptuous Denise Richards. Yes, size matters! The would-be lovers of Rico and Carmen eventually suffer very violent demises.Woven into the structure of the film are small tributes to such films as An Officer and a Gentleman, Braveheart and Aliens. It's a tour de force film from Verhoeven, with satire, sarcasm, philosophy (i.e., fascism), relentless action and eye-popping CGI mixed together. The incredible FX include the hordes of bugs and the realistic gore, especially the decapitations and severed limbs  (perhaps inspired by Braveheart).All in all, a wonderful treat from Verhoeven.

The actors were cardboard, the cast looked like rejects from 90210, and the special effects looked like a joint effort from Dave Cronenberg and Nickelodian.The best that can be said for the movie is that it was an *intentional* parody of the novel and the concepts of patriotism, courage and valor.

A fascist society that relies on army service in order to attain citizenship. People only caring about blowing crap up during their service. And what is the motivation of the enemy? Perhaps they have a deep kind of motive to want to destroy the humans. But the military simply doesn't care. They're enemies, pure and simple.People and 'bugs' regularly get ripped to shreds. No big deal. If people get wounded or stabbed, a medic is casually referred to.This film is obviously a fun satiric flick that makes fun of totalitarianism, violence and mankind's presumption of having superior intelligence, all dressed in some kind of fascist propaganda skin which apparently upset quite a few people. Didn't bother me, though. I still got some laughs out of it.Would you like to know more? Just watch it, if you're into people getting ripped into small particles, gigantic 'bug' type creatures, explosions, and space ships.

Those who comment that the film is a parody prove the point. The novel was serious social commentary, NOT a parody. The characters sure weren't the jackbooted thugs of the film. Military tactics made a lot more sense and the humans' weapons system were as advanced as you'd expect that far in the future. And the core concept of the novel - the Mobile Infantry's power armour - was ignored for reasons which really don't stand up. Verhoeven is a hack and the only thing which might have salvaged part of this fiasco is if he'd resisted using the title as a marketing ploy. This would have helped avoid the painful comparisons between a fine, memorable novel, and a laughable shoot-em-up nonsense fest.",Starship Troopers
495,lastostadas,A Real Transgression of it's original counterpart.,10,30 November 2009,"In an imaginary dialog referred by H. Kahnwailer, Pablo Picasso explained to Delacroix: ""You took a Rubens and the result was a Delacroix. In the same way, I think of you and do something completely different.""Well here, Paul Verhoeven didn't only do something absolutely different but also killed Heinlein and ripped apart savagely his novel. How can Heinlein resist such an adaptation of his novel with such a film contradicting nearly every point of the book and satirizing the main themes? For all that the novel was criticized for, the film makes account and delivers an everlasting stream of satire with caricature-like characters who evolve strictly in a military sense and horrible merciless insects supposed to be ""the bad ones"" (the racism theme Heinlein was so much critized for and so many reviewers don't seem to understand and who makes them miss the whole point of the story). Once in a while the films produces a sort of Nazi-propaganda video which seems to have an answer to all the character's (and therefore spectator's) questions with quotes such as ""Why we fight?"" which doesn't state the real reasons why humans are at war with bugs or death sentences broadcasting and military service propaganda with a subtle ""do you want to know more?"". War makes a fascist of each one of us, and even if it seems wrong, it seems to be our undeniable nature.I don't dislike Heinlein more than any other author and take his novel as the result of the period he lived in and as the war veteran he was, even if he never was engaged in any battle. The Forever War was a result of another generation marked by Vietnam. More in accordance with the latter Verhoeven show us an up-to-date view of war and propaganda and how the particular and cunning views of a few can imprison us all in an utopian society. What makes a true piece of art is the different views it can have and this is what makes, both the novel and the film, critized nearly in the same way, so great. So read the book, then watch the film, or vice versa, don't pay attention to what I said and write your own thoughts and get involved in this fabulous argument.",Starship Troopers

Political propaganda? Satire? Tongue in cheek? All of this? None of this? A lot of people try to be nice to this movie by suggesting it is a subtle satire. Well, if that is what it was meant to be it has failed. Good satire relies on wit and humour to achieve its goal of undermining its target. Unfortunately, there is no wit in this film and the sparse humour seems to be wholly unintentional. In fact, I doubt very much if satire was the intention at all. I think the film makers never rose above the teen age target level of the original book, and simply translated the Heinlein story onto the screen without ever considering that it is possible to infuse films with meaning that goes beyond the most superficial actions and feelings depicted in them. And that, of course, means that this simplistic movie can be summarised in one sentence: Ken and Barbie join the Hitlerjugend and get what they deserve.",Starship Troopers

498,boondoggle129,Great movies must be poignant to deliver a message. This fails.,2,17 June 2006,"The movie is certainly a critique on the emotional propaganda that is used to recruit people for a war.OK. So, now why should I care? The movie certainly compares war like humans to 'bugs', or an insect survival mentality that eschews reason and the value of human life for the sake of humanity's domination over all life forms.That's a message; and I appreciate anyone who tries to deliver a message.But enjoyment of movies is not solely predicated on the value of the message.You cannot argue that bad writing can be excused because the message of the narrative is so grand and important.The idea behind the movie is fine, and the political message is delivered clearly: Those who join the army are mindless, and the hierarchy of military institutions are simply opportunists who happened to be at the right place at the right time. OK. There is nothing wrong with a message in a work of art.The challenge of any kind of art is to find a message, and then make it relevant to an audience. All artists should ask themselves why their audience should care about the art they perform.Let me share some points of view: The hero in the movie is unrealistically elevated from no rank to high rank based purely on his acts of heroism (which are diminished by the movie's end) and his timing.The audience's belief in the hero's ability to think is continuously diminished by his pithy can-do remarks which he hijacks from his superiors.The hero is presented as a strong jawed, good-looking guy who adopts leadership phrases from his deceased predecessors.Where the plot fails is in its mockery of the hero. The audience is left, at the end, wondering, ""who is the hero?"" because the story mocks the hero.The graphics and music, the 'mis-en-scene' which any literature graduate is supposed to ignore, are the best parts of the movie. That means that the development of the hero, falls second place to the mis-en-scene. That's basically not good.Shakespeare made a folly of his hero Macbeth, but in the narrative, the audience still felt empathy for the hero.Empathy means you care about the character's fortunes.A story is only good, no matter how noble the message, if you feel empathy for the characters.So, however cool the message is, if you don't give a darn about the hero, why should you care about the message.I appreciate all the comments about how great this movie is for its message, but, when you want to tell me a story, you better make sure I care.Present me with heroes I care about, and then I will listen to the 'message' in the story.But if you don't give me heroes I care about, don't waste my time.This movie, which has great effects, somewhat decent music, and a basically pathetic script, did not move me enough to care about its message. For all its noble intentions, the movie was a waste of time.But: for all you who are not convinced: Just look at the continuity at the end. The end of the movie is twenty minutes of suspense that have nothing to do with the resolution of the plot, which is concluded and explained in 30 seconds, 'Deus ex machina' fashion. All you budding story tellers would do well to understand 'Deus ex machina' and why it is the biggest indicator of bad story telling around. Look it up.For those who are looking to find truly awful art, this movie is it. For those who seek an enormous waste of time and effort, this movie is for you.",Starship Troopers
499,mraos,Verhoeven's masterpiece,9,9 February 2009,"A fantastically subversive film. Definitely the pinnacle of Verhoeven's career. You are never sure whether he exalts or damns the jingoistic fascism so very accurately represented in this movie... Oh heck, he does present it in a seductive way.. but that is precisely the answer to the question why young folk do have this need to ""join up"" in order to butcher and get butchered - the siren song of blood and soil. War as a concept is fun - it is exciting, glorious and it gives us meaning: the good and the bad guys! However its other face is the lowest level of physical and moral Hell - ""It is afraid."".. brilliant.Hats off to Verhoeven. He manages to be painfully critical and yet respectful to foibles of human nature at the very same time. If you want to know what made Hitlerjugend or any other army (bulk of which is invariably composed of men too young to know any better) tick then see this movie. The beauty of the inhumane beast that is war is almost too painful to watch - the innocence and beauty of youth made scintillating by the utter inhuman annihilation of it... and that is just on one level of this masterful satire.Many critics point out that the message is not clear enough for a satire but if Verhoeven stooped to portraying this fascist society in an overtly negative light without any redeeming qualities then it would have become exactly a bland and unconvincing tool of propaganda that he so relentlessly attacks in this film. Many satires fall flat on their face because they present their subject in an overly negative light. What is most disturbing in ST is that we actually do root for the ""good guys"" and understand why this society became what it is... it makes us understand the lure of militarism on a visceral level and a lot of people used to black/white thinking may find this unbearable. The movie is not trying to sell you its viewpoint or a ""message"".. beneath its intentionally carnivalesque shoot-em-up exterior it is coldly analytical to the level of being painful - which explains the high incidence hysterical laughter i noticed in the audience reacting to its many over the top moments, both in terms of gore and story.Verhoeven at his very, very best.",Starship Troopers
500,Hörnla,Funniest Anti-War-Movie ever,10,16 February 1999,"Reading the other comments, I seem to have experienced a somehow different movie. First, ST is in fact a Comedy, exaggerating everything you would expect from a splatter and/or war-movie. First it seems threatening, but soon it becomes ridiculous and I think that Verhoeven intended this. Then it's a very entertaining satire, especially for somebody who knows WW-2-outfits and because of the newsreel-scene in the beginning (I hope the original version can provide such an impressive voice as the German synchronisation featuring the legendary voice from ""7th sense"", a serial of 3-minute propagandas for security on roads during the 80s, by then very popular because of the shown crash-scenes.) Somebody in the audience asked if this movie based on the novel ""Fatherland"", describing a world after a German-won WW 2, but Verhoeven wanted to show something else, i.e. that war itself has won the world presented in ST. At last, ST is an anti-war-movie. How this idea came to my mind? Well, contrary to (the also excellent) Saving Private Ryan, which presents wars as cruelest possible experience, but sometimes necessary, the war in Starship Troopers is (to an intelligent viewer) absolutely pointless (Seen Armageddon? That's a simple way to get rid of Asteroids!). The sense of the whole military operations is hard to follow, the simple soldiers are presented by the director as almost brain- amputated, played by non-actors like Denise Richards (having apparently just two reasons to get casted, both situated on her chest) and Caspar van Diem; and Earth's elite is totally brutalized, moving towards a niveau of civilization near to the Bug's one.In the end, Starship Troopers, though many wouldn't believe it, is a movie to recommend even for sophisticated viewers - though they will probably take different impressions home than the popcorn munching ""Cool! Guts! Cool! F F N!""-guy sitting next to you.",Starship Troopers

This film is so bad that I can't even think of something worse to compare it to. Sure, it's violent, but even that didn't save it because the violence didn't affect me at all. If you're some human and you think that it's a good idea to run up to a 20 foot bug that needs to be shot a million times with a high-powered machine gun before it even begins to be injured, then you deserved to get eaten. I was actually cheering for the bugs to eat the stupid humans. My other major problem is that at one point in the film, Neil Patrick Harris (TVs Doogie Howser) was standing right next to a bug and the bug didn't eat him. The bug had the perfect opportunity and it blew it. I was there, yelling in the theater ""Bug! Eat Doogie Howser"", but it didn't.

504,George_Bailey,They sucked his brains out!,9,5 March 2000,"Starship Troopers is a deceptive and subtle film, and due to this it is extremely misunderstood. Helmed by Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director responsible for such other balls-to-the-wall action sci-fi classics as Robocop and Total Recall, Starship Troopers is both an intelligent parody of American fears and a take no prisoners, blood and guts war movie.At first, it's easy to see how much in this movie has been changed from it's source material, the book by acclaimed science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlien. It seems to share only a handful of things with the mentioned novel: the title, the names of our hero and several other characters, and the main story arch of Earth going to war with a race of vicious, bug-like alien beasts. But if you look closer, you'll see that the movie is more successful in accomplishing the message of Heinlien's book than the book itself.The movie is set in the future, with no given time or date, and we see a society that is much more conditioned and under control than the world of today. Like most sci-fi Earths of the future, our planet is governed by a single body, a Terran Federation, and everyone on the world falls under their hand. Only military veterans are allowed to become citizens of the Federation, and only these veteran citizens are allowed to vote. Jail is no longer much of a consideration in this future; corporal punishment is the law. Don't worry about paying a 200 dollar fine for drunk driving: about ten lashes at the local whipping post will do the trick. All of this is presented to us by Verhoeven in ingenius propaganda shorts which intercut periodically throughout the movie, detailing every aspect of the world in an indirect and strangely effective manner.Our main story involves a young man named Johnny Rico, his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, and his buddy Carl Jenkins. After graduated from high school, the three go into the service; Johnny joins the Mobile Infantry, a Marine-like troop of battle-hardened soldiers, Carmen signs up to become a pilot in the Galactic Navy, and Carl goes into Military Intelligence. All three of these characters are good-looking young kids, strapping and confidant, more like Beverly Hills 90210 cast members than rifle-toting grunts. But as we follow Rico through MI Boot Camp, and ride along with what he experiences, we see that these bleached-teeth young 'uns transform from naive, to scared, to blood-thirsty harbringers of destruction.And destruction comes in the form of an attack by a race of hideous insect beings hailing from the far-away world of Klendathu. Now Verhoeven has his chance to send our young friends, hungry for death, into the cold night of unblinking combat. The special effects in these battle sequences are nothing short of amazing, with fantastic CG renderings of looming Federation starships, vicious bug drones, and gigantic beasts which launch nuclear fire from their antennae. These scenes are gory, spectacular, and above all: wicked cool.Starship Troopers is a film which is more complex than meets the eye. The aw-shucks hopefullness of youth, representing mankind in all its glory, taking on and crushing their Godless opposition can't help but call to mind a time when America had such enemies to turn to as Communism and Facism, and the ability to say, ""Our boys will take care of you."" That idealistic era is a far cry from the United States of today. Our boys aren't fighting, because we have no bugs.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone with a love for great sci-fi and intelligent action films.",Starship Troopers

With terrible acting, stupid dialogue, a rickety story full of holes, incredible amounts of blood and gore, and a nude mixed shower scene out of nowhere, just because Verhoeven needs to show bare breasts at least once in each of his movies, this movie deserves only one word: LAME!

Radcheck's words make no sense whatsoever, and yet he pounds out each word like it is a fundamental truth. It is fascist propaganda, and the director intends you to think about how similar today's Earth is to this film. Yes, the film is silly, and so is our world today. Watch ""Battle Line"" on the History channel, or the black and white filler stuff at the end of A&E Classroom, or ""Victory at Sea"" on PBS, and then watch Starship Troopers again... you won't be saying you don't get it.

It wasn't meant to be serious but I thought it did have a serious point (however, I read the book and perceived the movie as recreation of some of the plot).Just like all Heinlein's novels, this one is full of action and violence (well, that's why we like it :) But the movie also presented a supposedly democratic society gone bad. The slogans of propaganda do sound ridiculous, but how do they differ from ""UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU"" ?? Noone would say that slogan is something to laugh about. The issue, I think, is that the movie portrays a society, supposedly democratic and based on freedom, that underneath is just a Nazi camp. What's the difference between killing 'bad people' or killing 'bad bugs' if the only reasons for killing them are: they are enemy, they are bad, and you have your orders? I think the underlying theme is that people sometimes do swallow these slogans which (as you can see in the movie) do sound ridiculous, if you substitute bugs instead of (communists, heretics, homosexuals, or take you pick of enemy number one). Or how ridiculous was the replacement of the admiral? When the attack on bugs fails, nobody questions policy; a bad admiral is to blame (obviously it was his fault) and a new one is appointed. A system that maintains the status quo and doesn't question its actions yet preaches the ideals of ""good citizenship"" in schools (maybe that remind you of your history class, who knows).It is a reminder that the slogan ""it will never happen here"" is not really reflective of the world. The movie shows how easy it is to hate; that noone will care (I mean, did you really feel bad for the bugs) if our newly selected enemy is ugly and doesn't think like you. They deserve to die just for that (what was the issue with the bugs after all)! Plus, the last propaganda clip is 'classified' however I somehow don't think what they were doing to the bug will pass the Geneva Convention! But who cares, it's not like the thing is human or deserves any rights. And mind control: I mean obviously the upper echelons used to do only the 'right' thing.It also, of course, portrays some of the hate associated with the cold war (the hate for communism, as the bugs are an idealistic portrait of individuals willing to die for their society without question. Obviously the movie can't do justice to many of the issues, well, at least not in a way Heinlein wanted.I think it's a good film, especially if you remember the book. A great action flick; not an Oscar winner by any means, but still a decent one.

The orchestration is great, and does an excellent job of setting the mood. You see this most notably during the big dropship scene precluding the first human invasion.The premise isn't overly realistic - a ""bug planet"" inhabited by ornery insects has used biological plasma blasts to launch asteriods at earth, killing millions.  But this is Sci-Fi, and if Star Trek can have Klingons, and Star Wars can have Jawas, then Starship Troopers can have bugs.The second reason I really like this movie is that it, along with ""Aliens"" are heavy influences on a favorite video game of mine, ""Starcraft.""  I highly recommend both movies, and the game as well.The lead roles are those of Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien,) Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards,) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris,) along with supporting roles; Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer,) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey.) Rico, Carmen, and Carl are friends from Buenos Aires who all join up with different branches of the military.  Rico enlists with the Mobile Infantry who are analagous to the US Marines - ground troopers who are the first in and the last out.  Carmen works towards becoming a pilot in the Federation Fleet, while Carl who has innate psychic ability joins the ""Games and Theory"" division, which is Military Intelligence.The main focus is on Rico and his enrollment in the ""Roughnecks,"" along with Ace and Dizzy (who is also from Buenos Aires.)  The ensuing battles are bloody, the explosions are big, and the bug-guts are messy.  The overall special effects were done wonderfully, and it lent a sense of devastating realism to the movie without making it too flashy and gory.If you like any of the other Man vs. Alien movies (Aliens, Predator, Terminator, etc...) you should give ""Starship Troopers"" a look.",Starship Troopers

The heroes are white, Christian, clean-cut Americans and the enemies evil vile, bugs. The news talks of the Earthlings being valiant soldiers, fighting against the evil aliens, when in reality the Earthlings landed on their planet first, conquering it violently. The action is amazing. Two hours straight of watching army trainers abusing noobs, giant arachnids rip off limbs, giant arachnids getting their limbs ripped off... it's pretty cool. Starship Troopers is a purposely over-joyous, over-zealous movie. It satires the join-the-army movies and commercials perfectly. I'm doing my part, says one soldier. I'm doing my part, says another. And I'm doing mine! says an overly-enthusiastic kid in an army helmet. Laughs ensue. The world of Starship Troopers is a purely militaristic world. In order to get citizenship, you must join the army. The school children are taught how good it is to fight in the army, and it sticks with them. My mother always told me that violence doesn't solve anything. Really? I wonder what the city founders of Hiroshima would have to say about that. They wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. Correct. Violence has resolved more conflicts than anything else. Unlike most war movies that start out like this, there is no change in views throughout this movie. The characters don't learn war is Hell. They learn it's Heaven. Fun to watch for the satire, fun to watch for the entertainment. Fun for all.",Starship Troopers
514,rrvtjd,VERY distinctive film,6,24 January 2011,"Starship Troopers contains many striking features, the most obvious of which is the visual and sound effects. The landscapes, space vehicles, creatures, machinery, and equipment are all very well done. The frightening sights and sounds of the creatures are also a major source of the excitement and angst produced by the film. Unfortunately, other visual effects which depicted grotesque injuries, hideous deaths, and the overall gratuitous violence seem far over-the-top. Since the aircraft and space ships depicted in the movie have devastatingly effective weapons, why is it necessary for the foot soldiers to land on the surface, only to be eviscerated by the hideous creatures? More suspense and fright can often be produced by events which are not seen, but only suggested. It is not necessary or desirable to leave nothing to the imagination of the audience, since what a person fears most in his or her own mind can be more terrifying than anything that could be depicted on screen.",Starship Troopers
515,Ratter,Everything a Sci-Fi film could need,8,10 November 2007,"Starship Troopers is one of those rare movies that you know is rubbish but you just can't help watching over and over again because it is enjoyable, which is essentially the whole purpose of watching a film. The plot is fairly basic, which is good as films like this risk becoming boring or too complicated if they try to be too intelligent. This being said however, the film weaves in a bit of political satire and romance as well as the core component of 'man vs alien-bug war'.The film itself is well made and like Robocop, features news updates during the film to keep the viewer up to date with the Trooper universe. Two sequences worth pointing out would have to be the Klendathu drop and the siege at the outpost, which as far as action sequences go are near the top of my list with the likes of the beach assault scene from Apocalypse Now.Despite the B-Movie cast, the actors really help add to the film, even if their acting is a bit wooden at times. The two actors who stand out in their performances are Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside who help to keep the feeling that the film is more than just a B-Movie.If the acting or plot doesn't convince you then the CGI should. For a film made in 1997, the special effects are something not to be sneered at. I've seen plenty of more modern films where the CGI was nothing compared to that of the film.To top it all up is the kick-ass score that was composed by the legendary Basil Poledouris, which is in my opinion one of the best pieces of music ever to accompany a film. This is ideally a traditional Verhoeven sci-fi film. Like Robocop and Total Recall, it features graphic violence and partial nudity, which although one may find unnecessary, it makes it a perfect choice for a Friday night in. Any Verhoeven or sci-fi fan would be stupid not to give Starship Troopers a try.",Starship Troopers

The main story line...about in a not to remote future, the insects from a planet named Klendutcha evolved to a such high level that they could challenge and destroy human civilization. As a results, Rico(Van Diem), Carmen(Dennis), Dizzy(Meyer) and another several guys were recruited to annihilate the insects threat!The side-line include a very well made military camp training and the triangle love between our sagas!!!Amazingly, it was still as good as before...although it was a movie made about 10 years ago...several neat points about this movie I like to share with you all that which hardly seen in other Sci-fi... 1. The triangle love between Rico, Dizzy and Carmen..although this is not a love drama, but some sweet moment and efforts been made into that. That deserve some credit!!How sweet ! 2. The CGI and many of the bugs(which are constantly jumping around ) really look real and amazing. 3. Many and many body counts and many more heavy machine gun fires....I gather not many Sci-Fi has that now adays...for those who enjoy seeing machine gun firing...here you go! 4. Overall the set-up seemed to be quite well made...not like other cheap Sci-Fi...with many nice spaceship...many well equipped soldiers and the training camp was cool as well... 5. The flow of the movie is superbly smooth....nothing to slow down..nothing unnecessary... Finally...I am glad that I pull out that DVD to test on my new movie projector..it truly worth a watch(for those who haven't) and rewatch again (for those hard stalwart Fans of Starshp Trooper!) PS: It is a great sadness that the sequel of this big time Sci-Fi is far below acceptable standard...they should invest more to make a nicer one or just don't make that ""Hero of Federation""...

I don't know if Paul Verhoeven has read it, but the book which most closely resembles the tone of the film is 'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman which was written as a Vietnam veterans response to the romanticised militaristic 'virtues' presented in Heinlein's novel. Unsurprisingly, Starship Troopers is reminiscent of both Robocop and Total Recall featuring many graphic scenes of violence mixed with a(n un)healthy dose of black humour. As in Robocop, much of the background is presented as snippets of news programs and this device allows Verhoeven the freedom to parody the far right politics and jingoism without involving his main protagonists. The action sequences and special effects are extremely well done though faint hearted viewers may find the levels of gore rather extreme. The acting is adequate and doesn't suffer from the lack of big names, at least the players seem to have fun in their roles. That said, the weakest point of the film is the reliance on poorly sketched archetypes rather than on characters. The love triangle sub-plot in particular is cliched and largely charmless.Taken as a whole, Starship Troopers is a grand old adventure story.",Starship Troopers

521,tajci,Brilliant! Verhoeven's best Hollywood movie!,10,16 December 1998,"This movie is brilliant satire on everything one can think of when thinking of SF movies, and much, much more. I can only imagine how much fun Neumeier had when writing the script, or how much fun Verhoeven had when he directed this masterpiece. And I cannot believe that there is anyone who can take the ""messages"" or anything in the movie seriously. So, for all of them, all I can say is: This movie isn't serious about ""technicalities"" in it (i.e. weapons, laws of physics or biology of bugs). This movie isn't serious about society in it (i.e. about this ideal military society it agitates for). And finally, this movie isn't about special effects. Special effects are there (and they are great) because this is, after all, a SF movie, and because Verhoeven loves special effects. If anything, I think that Verhoeven made this movie just to laugh at people who might take this movie seriously. Not to mention numerous quotation of other movies (any real movie-fan will have a great time just recognising them), and irony and despise Verhoeven's movie has for TV (news, soap operas, censorship, idealisation of  "" the American way of life"", etc.). Maybe it's even Verhoeven's answer to those who accused him of despising and undermining women - this is the most ""feministic"" movie I've seen in years. Don't leave your brain outside when going to see this movie - take it and use it. That's the only way you'll enjoy this movie. And when you've seen it once, go and see it once again. For conclusion, I think that this movie will enter my all-time favourite movie list, but somewhere with Monty Python's movies, not with Blade Runner.",Starship Troopers

524,Robin-55,Elaborate Nazi Joke,10,19 March 1999,"The central characters are supposed to be flat and meaningless. Their motivations are intentionally one-dimensional. They are intended to seem like a bunch of war-mongering jocks. The reason for this is because they are the National Socialists of the future.These blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan beauties live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Could they by chance be the descendants of the Nazis who all moved to S. America after WWII?And all that talk about how to become 'a citizen', how only by conforming and becoming an idealized military warrior can a person win acceptance in society? Everybody else is an undesirable, a social outcast? Familiar.....?If this all sounds a bit far-fetched, then just check out the costumes. Doogie Houser beginning as the school nerd and ending up goose-stepping around in full Gestapo regalia, peak cap and long black leather coat? Hold on.....And that incredible ending. The 'happy' ending is the realisation that our heroes have induced fear in an alien species. How twisted is that?Basically, Starship Troopers was a widely misunderstood film. Shot down in flames for being dumb and too loud, it was criticised for being exactly what it so expertly mocked. The irony was lost on the public at large (no surprise) and Verhoeven's outrageous deadpanning completely overlooked. It is a film that seems dumb at first because the characters are so dumb, but on closer inspection reveals itself to be a sophisticated satire on conformity, patriotism and the cult of the hero.Even if you hated this movie, go back and check it again. Just don't watch it as a sci-fi film or a war film. Watch it as a jet-black comedy and it will please you much more.Plus.....I've never seen carnage like that before. Yeeeeehhhhaaaaaaaa!

525,arnoldko,anti-american satire,9,28 February 1999,"Paul Verhoeven, a Dutchman, is known in Holland for his socio-critical movies.  Watching his ""Turks Fruit"" or ""Soldaat van Oranje"" is painful for any Dutch, in the way he paints us.  After moving to Hollywood, Starship Troopers is maybe his best effort of applying his way of movie-making to his new surroundings.  It is quite interesting to see how almost only non-American viewers seem to see the underlying themes of the movie.  The self-awareness of Americans don't seem to be up to Dutch standards, which explains the limited success of Paul's efforts.  Confronted with american-style glorification of militarism, 90210-arian actors and downright intolerance and racism, his public jumps into denial.  Perhaps he has seen this coming and has aimed at a European public, ignoring for example american double-standards when painting a gender-blind society.

526,JM24,Blood and guts flick that just doesn't cut it,1,10 August 1999,"Starship Troopers.  What can I say.  This movie was more terrible than could be imagined.  The violence is non-stop. Humans are just shrieking paper bags of blood that are stronger than strong, but somehow could have their arms broken off by a 2-year-old.  The plot is non evident, the characters do nothing but scream, scream some more, and scream even more.  Did I mention that they scream? And couldn't this whole mess be avoided if they had taken out the planet with some kind of missile? If this is the future of mankind, count me out.The ""aliens"" are no better.  The skittering and deadly ""bugs"" that roam a planet similar to Arizona are constantly picking off wailing humans.  Some bugs are like ants with a few extra limbs, some are giant beetles that fart blue fire, some are slow and massive capsules of mucus.  It's an exterminator's nightmare.Even the way that the movie progresses defies logic.  At some points, a toolbar pops up and various information (that is often irrelevant to the ""plot"") is given.  Soon we return to another viewpoint.  And then another. And another.  This movie can't decide if it's a TV show or a security camera.The line that marked the point where I gave up on this movie is ""They sucked his brains out.""

528,tommyuk,Verhoeven has style !,8,4 November 2006,After watching James Cameron's film 'Aliens' in 1986 (which I believe was loosely based on the Starship troopers novel) I have to admit I wasn't really all that impressed with 'Robocop' in 1987.At the time I thought the best parts of Robocop where the ED209 boardroom scene and the in-between TV Commercial shorts which where quite funny.I have to give credit to Robocop though because I really like the way Paul pushed this idea to the limit and incorporated it into Starship Troopers with the satirical Federation broadcasts.He has an amazing talent for visualizing classic Sci-Fi and I think he did a fine job on Total Recall based on Philip K Dick's short story 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale'. I think Verhoeven is a fantastic director who is not afraid to poke a bit of fun at Heinlein's fictional idealistic future and us also at the same time in our own crazy world.Don't get me wrong I love Heinlein's novels and hope some day that another Director might try and visualise the Mobile Infantry closer to the MI in the novel.I would hope that such a director might adopt some of this film's brilliant concepts such as the Arachnids organic weaponry.I think Heinlein would have been just a little bit impressed with the CGI in this fine film,Starship Troopers
529,snovack,Potential never realized,1,3 January 2008,"This film had fantastic potential. Anybody can tell you that this was based on a book written by Robert Heinlein. In truth, however, all Verhoeven got right was that the main character was named Juan ""Johnnie"" Rico, and the enemy was the Bugs. To give this more context, let me add that the book was originally published in 1959. Keep this in mind. The story was written before Vietnam, only six years after the Korean Conflict had drawn to a close...only four years after the publishing of ""The Return of the King"". Remember that when you read all the commentary here about how this movie is a ""Social Commentary"". That is all Verhoeven, not Heinlien. According to the DVD commentary, Paul Verhoeven never finished reading the novel, claiming he read through the first few chapters and became both 'bored and depressed', the movie's message is ""War makes fascists of us all"", and that he sees the movie as a satire of American militarism. Great background research there Paul... The overall theme of the book is that social responsibility requires individual sacrifice. It is the only science fiction novel on the reading list at three of the four United States military academies. The novel was filled with life lessons and examples of the importance of civic duty. More importantly though, it had a REALLY cool element that would have translated very well on film. POWER ARMOR!!!! The book spends loads of time explaining the power armor that made the ""infantry"" the ""Mobile Infantry"". Soldiers didn't ride down in boats, they were shot from tubes in capsules (hence the term ""cap trooper""), and their suits looked like a kind of giant mechanical gorilla. Rather than utilize one of the best ideas in the history of science-fiction warfare, Verhoven decided to create ""Space 90210"" and add in his own sophomoric commentary on soldiering and society. Pretty boys and girls in shower scenes might bring in the high-school money, but it certainly doesn't make a good movie. If you enjoyed this, I strongly recommend that you read the book. You'll know immediately why those of us who did were very disappointed. Fantastic potential, never even close to becoming realized.",Starship Troopers
530,Bobske_,An amazing and still current parody on modern warfare. Do you want to know more?,10,20 March 2006,"A lot has already been said about Starship Troopers. The movie relies too heavily on special effects. The movie only supports B-actors. The story has already been done. It has even been called 90210 in space. Even though a lot of critics didn't like Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi movie, the movie was a hit. Even though this happens all the time, I do believe that a lot of critics were wrong about this movie I think this is a great movie. I love the setting, the giant bugs, the impossibly handsome cast and the impossible odds. This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder why you never joined the army Even though you know it's never going to be like that, you still hope it would be. Well, at least that's what I was thinking.The war statements, the war recruitments, the plot outline or even the selection of the cast in this movie are a bit over the top, but the same thing can be said about Dr. Strangelove. Don't worry I'm not comparing this movie with Kubrick's masterpiece, I'm just pointing out that Dr. Strangelove also has a (support) cast with over the top ""caricatures"" that a movie like this really needs. They feel right for this movie.About the political statement the movie tries to make, I do believe that war makes fascists of us all. The military planners in this movie called for a swift and direct strike at the enemy. Of course everything goes to hell. Misinformation, bad planning, manipulation of the public, a poor understanding of the enemy and underestimation of enemy forces turns the quick strike in to a long and bloody operation that does more harm than good to the heroic good guys. With the capture of the Brain Bug, the war has just begun. Does this sound familiar? I know it's pretty easy to make this comparison now but this movie can be compared to a lot of modern western wars. The movie tries to make a point (with an exclamation mark) but also tries to make it with a big nod.If you want to see an entertaining action flick with hot chicks and cool dudes battling legions of bugs against impossible odds, than this is the movie for you. If you want to see a nice parody on modern warfare and the western civilization that supports it, than this is also the movie for you. Just decide for yourself what you want this movie to be.I gave this movie a rating of 10 stars not because I think this is the best movie ever (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest holds that title), but because of the entertainment value of this movie. I've seen this movie a dozen times and it still keeps me entertained till the end.In short: Everybody should own the DVD!",Starship Troopers

532,Henry J Sosenite,a near perfect satire... not to mention action and violence and fun for everyone!,10,9 January 2008,"Full of tongue-in-cheek clichés, dark humor, and ridiculous action, Starship Troopers is a sassy and bold film, and one that's often misunderstood. To some people, it's pure garbage, but anyone who can see it for what I perceive it as- pure satire- will love it.Starship Troopers is loosely based off a Robert Heinlein novel. I haven't read the novel, but the way I see it, the makers of Starship Troopers completely changed the entire tone of the book, adding loads of sarcasm and references to fascism.The driving force behind Starship Troopers seems to be a fascist ideal; the main character, Johnny Rico, feels pressured to join the military by the government's giving special treatment to people who enlist (such as the privilege to vote) and society and the media's glorification of military life. His parents are strongly against it, but he enlists; after all, as he puts it, he doesn't need his parents when the Federation (a governing body that seems to control the entire planet) can take care of his every need. After the obligatory but always fun boot camp scene, the rest is pure action as the Earth goes to war with a deceptively intelligent race of bugs from the other side of the universe.If you don't ""get"" the fascist references and the very sarcastic and satirical humor, Starship Troopers will seem like across as the worst film ever made. It definitely comes across as a bad film sometimes, but it's all purposefully done in mockery of old sci-fi shows (there's definitely some pokes at Star Trek), and in particular, war films. Starship Troopers contains many a stirring speech about patriotism that could've been lifted right out of a John Wayne film. The acting- virtually all of it, every performance- is up to 50's standards, and thus perfect for the film. While there are a lot of serious situations, a lot of the situations are still comic, in a way... it's hard to describe.Besides all the fascist mumbo jumbo, Starship Troopers gives the viewer a good time, which is what really matters. The action scenes and computer graphics are incredible, good enough for an Oscar nomination, and I'm sure it would have won the Oscar if it had been more of an ""Academy-type"" movie because I don't think better computer graphics had been achieved up to the time Starship Troopers came out. The film has a good story, but especially a good way of telling the story: one of its unique features is three or four short propaganda films for the Federation. They're not only hilarious and entertaining, but they're an extremely clever way of filling in background information and moving the story along.A few years ago, it seemed like there was a lot of badmouthing about Starship Troopers, how unbelievably awful it was and stuff like that. Now I guess more people get it; I'd say that it's considered a classic by the public. Some people aren't fans of sarcasm or jaw-dropping action, and those people probably can't stand this film. But I can't understand how anyone can dislike sarcasm or action, so I can't understand how anyone could not love Starship Troopers.",Starship Troopers

With future Nazis, aliens, and tactical nukes.",9,26 September 2010,"Summary: Johnny Rico, a citizen of the militaristic and fascist Federation, joins the military because his girlfriend Carmen does. Soldiers are needed because of a war with alien Bugs. After a lot of filler, they land on the home planet of the Bugs and from then it's a war movie. As the story progresses, new and more powerful Bugs appear, and they take forever to die, and then someone kills them. The End. So why is this a good movie?Well, the disturbing thing about this movie(this was intentional) is that while the humans are Nazi-ish and brainwashed by propaganda, they're just normal people. They are not evil, it's their society that is. You care about the characters. At the end, they discover that at least some of the Bugs can feel emotion. ""It's afraid!"" ""YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!"" So in the end, this is a movie about war and its effect on people. In this case, they are Nazis. You root for them, and you feel sorry for them.

A seemingly global federation apparently expanding across several continents where over 300,000 soldiers can die in a single invasion. In this case, the invasion is another planet filled with inferior ""bugs"" that are completely underestimated as an enemy. Federal propaganda is filled with censored online video depicting only what it wants the people to see, unless it is what the Federation wants the people to see. The uniforms have characteristics of Nazi officers. Simply view historical footage of Nazi officers and you can notice similarities.Students are taught the differences between a citizen and a civilian. Citizens have all of the rights while civilians are treated as minorities because a civilian (undefined) does not have the courage to protect the Federation with their life. Insubordination is punished with either death or lashes.At the same time, German life during the 1930's is shown. Life is abundant and thriving under Nazi rule with few people publicly showing any kind of resistance. Of course, this is not shown probably because of budget problems or deleted scenes.In the end, the Federation is portrayed as showing it's domination of the galaxy through a force of willing men and women (yes women in a GLOBAL federation) ready to sacrifice their lives for its survival.",Starship Troopers

The beauty of Verhoevens movies is the way that manage to be satirical towards practically everything, the movie going public, the movie industry, the minor themes of the movie, and the overall theme. It works on all these levels. If you watch this movie and came away thinking that it was a fun action movie, you didn't get it sadly. There are more than enough scenes where it's made plain as day what is actually going on even if it isn't as obvious as in the rest of the movie. This blatantly makes fun of the typical Hollywood action movie, and the narrow morality that many characters in Hollywood movies tend to have. I was particularly fond of how it handles the notion of love in a twisted militaristic society. I really feel that this is where the movie gets elevated to brilliance... The shallow emptiness, the meaningless resolution, it all combines to paint a fascinating picture.Good luck in the future with verhouvens films. just remember that there is more than meets the eye.9/10",Starship Troopers

I saw this twice at the show way back when it came out. I didn't want to but was asked ""pretty please with sugar on top"" I never liked it the first time and the second time took any suspense away from the movie entirely.Technically its OK. Acting is below average from everyone, but mostly because of clunky writing. Who ever designed the helmets should have been shot. At least size it to the actors head. In at least 3 scenes, any number of actors can be seen trying to push the helmet back on top of their head instead of in their eyes, or dangling off to the side awkwardly.You know how I mentioned the writing was bad-dialogue wise-its not nearly as terrible as the book. I sat down and started reading this recently and had to come here to re evaluate this movie. While I thought it awful before, it is better than its source material. Yes it should have had the power armour. Course then it would have looked worse than Robot Jocks(that one was sooo bad) But the book is just awful. Boring, no plot, no character development, bad descriptions and worst of all preachy militaristic fascism philosophy. So its hard to imagine the movie being better than the source but it was.See how bad the book must be if this only rates a 5. At least you had some action here. There was a half hearted attempt at developing the characters. And some of the technical staff did a good enough job for this to pass as better than DTV quality. Hey look a plot, not just marching. So grudgingly I had to bump it from 3 to 5. Almost a 6 because the book was just so bloody boring and they tried to make it work. So good effort, but still falls short.There are already plenty of reviews that detail the movie, so I won't bother. I just want people to know this movie is STILL better than the book so don't be dumb like me and go reading the novel thinking it will be better.

I went into this movie expecting just an action packed special effects demonstration, and I came out fairly satisfied.  Some of the satire was a little over done, and a little hard to handle, and much of the acting was not high quality.  But overall, I still thought it was a decent mindless action movie.  Then I read the book, and was SEVERLY disappointed in the movie.  It was nothing like the book.  I am sure had Heinlein been alive, he would not have allowed the screenwriter to so blatantly rob the title of the book.  They only got a few details right: the society of Earth was a very militaristic one, the right to vote had to be earned through service, Earth was a war with an arachnid life form, and the key character names were the same.  But the movie missed a very large portion of the book's focus.  The book actually deals with the actual war for maybe half of the time.  The movie also missed a very critical concept with the Mobile Infantry.  In the book, the MI was made up of highly trained, highly equipped, and highly motivated soldiers.  The MI of the movie was a mass of people who had been handed a weapon and pointed in the right direction to shoot and die.  This is by far the absolute worst novel adaptation I have seen.I know a lot of people are probably saying that viewers shouldn't compare it to the book, to watch the movie for what it is, a mindless action movie with good effects.  Well, it is kind of hard not to compare the two when the book that is being butchered is a well written political and sociological commentary by an astounding writer such as Robert Heinlein.

I was scanning channels aimlessly and stumbled upon an alien war zone. Intrigued, I watched from about the middle of the film to the end, merely to see what was going to happen next.Recently, I revisited the film to take a better look. What I found was an oddly entertaining sci-fi flick that may or may not have an interesting message to convey.The acting is mediocre at best, as the film's focus seems to be action over character development. Denise Richards is awful and emotionless as a love interest and space pilot. Neil Patrick Harris is wildly miscast as a psychic intelligence officer. Casper Van Dien is occasionally interesting but mainly uninspiring as infantry-man John Rico.The CGI is mediocre. The film came out in 1997, (this is the same year as films like Titanic, M.I.B., The Lost World etc. all of which depend on CGI for their success)and has surprisingly poor effects. The gore is campy and bizarre, and the aliens lack detail and realism.The film runs it's course, and somehow, I can't help but realize that I enjoyed watching the movie.Playing off the aesthetic of WWII era war films, we see a militaristic nation fighting to destroy an alien race that is threatening humanity. With flying captions and campy narratives, we are informed of the valor of the ""Starship Troopers"" and their war against the evil ""Arachnids"" At the end of the film, you realize the political undertones involved, and find yourself forgiving the terrible acting and one-liners. What we have here is a biting satire that also entertains and excites the audience.This movie was poorly executed. Very interesting premise.

Heinlein's novel envisioned a civilization that had learned to balance rights with responsibility in a benevolent libertarian society. Verhoeven, being Dutch (a country that is both a brothel and a crack house), feels he must justify his ""Utopian fantasies"" of promiscuity, excess, infidelity, and selfishness. To Verhoeven and his ilk, morality and love for ones country = fascism. This circular reasoning explains the totally implausible plot of this movie. Edward Neumaier (screenplay) must have been in a crack house while writing this script. He basically took Heinlein's characters and story line (a war between Earth and an Insect Race) and and goes off into cloudland in order to brainwash gullible young people about the evils of patriotism and civic responsibility by mixing a poorly scripted and incoherent story with gratuitous gore, nudity, and sex.

Remove a LITTLE blood and guts, a LITTLE nudity, and put in some genuine character development and social commentary. The book was a classic; the movie, a charlatan.The actual movie is in loyal to the book in plot summary, but not in the important details. Sex plays far to large a role, the weapons of the humans and bugs are wrong (in the book, bugs used projectile-style guns as well, and humans wore tremendously fascinating body armor), social commentary is made in to some sort of snide plot device, and the actors are WAY too attractive (any HUMAN society would use them as models, prostitutes, or actors in teen-exploitation movies, in that order).The basic plot is the same: young people, after intense training that rips away their innocence, are sent to battle giant insects that for some reason are hostile. Caspar Van Dien plays the principal actor, which I suppose is an insult to anyone else of that profession. Dina Meyer and Denise Richards are his two love interests (in the book, he really had none); they've got great bodies, that's all you need to know plot-wise.The movie definitely has a facist aspect, as human society is controlled by a massive political system that borders on military dictatorship, but this, as with so much else, is a mangling of the book. The movie almost seems to promote the repressive political system.If you've got $5.95 to blow on one or the other, definitely spring for the book; it'll last longer than 3 days, and actually conveys one of the best sci-fi writer's ideas intact.",Starship Troopers

The boot camp is very brutal, and with the exception of the one guy being accidentally shot in the head, did not see any real logic to all the wanton violence going on. When the fighting finally did start at first i thought it would finally get interesting and explain whats going on. I mean it doesn't give a rational explanation as to why the human race is at war with these bugs besides the fact there angry that humans are moving in on there territory (I would be angry too). The more i watched the more disappointed i got and by the time it was finally over i still did not understand the logic of the movie.

Starship Troopers is not subversive. Starship Troopers is not satire. Starship Troopers is just stupid. For all its smirking, in-on-its-own-joke faux camp and oh-so-ironic stabs at social commentary, Starship Troopers is nothing more than a schlocky sci-fi shoot 'em up aimed at adolescents (clearly demonstrating that the filmmakers knew all along that their 'subversive' film was a steaming turd) and directed with all the ham handed prurience which we've all come to know and hate from Paul Verhoeven (whose chief claim to fame is Showgirls, the movie which ensured that no one would ever be curious enough to see an NC-17 film again).That's not to say that 'satire' and 'subversion' aren't attempted, just that they fail miserably (and how could they not with Verhoeven at the helm, not to mention a cast of 'stars' headed by the likes of Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards?). Any satirical effect is lost in the stunning lack of context. So there might be a fascist society some time, for some reason at some point in the future, and it might not be pleasant?

573,movie-monster,The Most Misunderstood Film Of The 1990's,8,22 February 2010,"Few films have polarised opinion quite like Starship Troopers. Some see it as a generic Hollywood Sci-Fi/Action film, a poorly acted and weakly scripted conversion of a popular, if controversial book. Others view as some sort of subtle satire on the US Military with some fascist overtones. I personally feel it's a mixture of both, and is without doubt Paul Verhoevens finest film (yes, even better than Total Recall). When I watch Starship Troopers, I get the feeling, more than with any other film, that the Studio Executive who green-lit it for a budget around $100,000,000, didn't know quite what he was getting himself into.The film tells the story of several young, impressionable students, who are members of a futuristic global society, drawn into a massive inter-planetary conflict in the 25th Century, against a species of giant insects known simply as 'the bugs' or 'the arachnids'.What you have here is a film that can be enjoyed purely as mindless popcorn entertainment, a piece of action-packed, blood-soaked, interstellar mayhem. This is achieved through the sheer scale of the battle scenes and the vast set-pieces. Every time I see the initial Klendathu drop-scene in this film, played out to Basil Pouledaris' epic score, it sends a shiver down my spine. The CGI in this movie is truly outstanding. Indeed, the effects still look impressive now, 12 years on. The aforementioned drop scene and the bug siege later in the film are both awesome to behold.You get the impression that a great deal of the money put into this film went on effects, and this also would help explain the group of B-list actors and actresses assembled to star in this movie. The only names who could really be considered 'familiar' are the excellent Michael Ironside, playing Lieutenant Radzcak, and the rather attractive Denise Richards (at the height of her fame). I often excused the sub-par acting, for the reason given above, but since watching the film a number of times, I now have an entirely different theory. The very reason this cast was selected is because they are 'adequate'. Take Casper Van Dien, appearing in his first, and to date, last true big-budget production. Van Dien is not a great actor. The scenes in which he speaks at times made me wince (partly because of the lines he is given), but you can't argue he is perfect as Johnny Rico, Squad Leader. He is a good looking guy. The same is true of Dina Meyer, she isn't a bad actress, but she is a beautiful woman. The same is true of all the other minor characters. They are not representative of the sort of diversity you would find if the Earth was ever to engage in an interstellar war. They are all young, very good looking, and intensely idealistic. If this were to occur for real, you would have poor people, ugly people, and convicted people. There is a scene where Rico, Carmen, and his best friend Carl are enrolling in the Military and they are speaking to a Veteran, who explains; ""Mobile infantry made me what I am today,"" before revealing he is missing an arm and both legs. Johnny Rico gives him an almost dismissive look, and this attitude is prevailant throughout the film. As yet more and more, able young people are mercilessly slaughtered by the bugs, they still carry on signing up believing it is for the greater good, when really the government is simply using them.The entire movie is really like a propaganda film for the military, complete with mindless media reels (a Verhoeven trademark, used in Robocop). Its ability to illustrate the impact media can have on a population during war is chilling. The bugs are completely demonised by the State News Network. Viewed only as the vicious, inherently evil creatures that they are, the more important point of the conflict is completely overlooked. This is the that the only reason the bugs sent the meteor to Buenos Aeries in the first place is because of human encroachment on their land. The attack was far from unprovoked. The film shows the central characters starting out as high-school graduates and finishing with them as experts in their respective fields, with the exception of Dizzy, who is killed. There is no reflection whatsoever and just the illogical, and empty conclusion that; 'They'll keep fighting...and they'll win. This is the point I realised that the film is really just a satire and perhaps even a parody on the nature of war itself.I wonder how many people watching this film cheered in cinemas as the bugs were mown down, when the reality is that the humans depicted in this movie are an equally ugly species, if not more so. At the end of the film, when the bug leader; the brain bug, is captured, and Rico's friend Carl is sent to translate the sounds it is making and tell the others what it is feeling, he answers with two simple words; 'It's afraid.' They celebrate in its terror. The same terror they felt in Klendathu. This is the real message behind Starship Troopers; nobody wins in war, everybody loses, but it will inevitably carry on all the same. This is a film that celebrates war, but dryly mocks and criticises it in equal measure. You can enjoy the relentless violence, beheadings, severed limbs and other grisly moments (the scene where the brain bug literally sucks Xanders brain out is one of grimmest I have ever seen.), all the while realising its not quite as far-fetched as you might think, and when you look at the real-life conflicts that have taken place since the film was released, you could even argue it's a little ahead of its time. Too criticise the dialogue or acting in this film is to miss the point entirely. For an action movie, its clichéd, its generic, but its quite simply one of the very best.",Starship Troopers
574,soundfreq,I'm from Buenos Aires and I say Kill'em ALL !,10,28 May 2001,"I think a lot of people don't understand that this movie uses a lot of revolutionary propaganda techniques brought forth by Leni Riefenstahl in Triumph of the Will. This was a WWII piece that helped Hitler maintain favor of his people despite the long and terrible fighting. Some of these are, for instance, large assemblies of troops in formation, military speeches given before large audiences, and icons/flags waving before the camera. The reason that Triumph of the Will was so popular was that it showed a reunited Germany after the disappointing defeat at the Treaty of Versailles (WWI) and the shame of a nation that ensued. This movie (among many others) brought together the Germans against the rest of the world, joined together in a 'Thousand Year Reich'. In Starship Troopers this timeline is subtly referenced. For instance, you can see that even before the bug meteor many of the older citizens have the scars of war (Rasczak, the anatomy teacher, and the paper-pusher at the enlistment station) - this sort of earlier war would conceivably fuel the fire to 'Destroy the Arachnid threat' whatever the consequences. These techniques help to anger the viewer towards the unfeeling, merciless enemy who threatens civilization.It's a different type of film that appeals to a lot of people who don't appreciate it for what it's worth. I'm glad that this futuristic tale of space cowboys and killer aliens was done by the director of RoboCop and Total Recall, because anyone else would have settled for inferior special effects. This is definitely is definitely Paul Verhoeven's best work in recent years because it employs all the best CGI special effects for all the blood thirsty groundlings, but it pays homage to great a European director whose work affected his life. Imagine growing up during WWII in the Netherlands - he was born in 1938 in Amsterdam.",Starship Troopers

The movie has a great idea awesome looking armor good insect effects and story. If you want a movie with gore and action this is your movie most definitely the best in science fiction movies. You cant judge the movie to be a nerdy movie in the future not like star trek or star wars no. This movie is about killing bugs that are twice the size of humans and rip us to pieces. This movie shows us how they trained and how thousands die per hour. Very excellent let me ex plane. Starship Troopers you can say the battles are more bloody then the war movies. This movie shows us what the military might be like in like 100yrs or so. Why a teenager wants to become a citizen and defend earth and kill those who appose us like Insects. Shows us how they sacrificed themselves to save there buds. The battles would be like from Black Hawk Down. The soundtrack is great for this war future film. The directing was great the acting was great. The film is a good action film because the overrun and outnumbered have very low survival chance.,Starship Troopers
576,kircdekk,"""Come on, you Apes! You wanna to live forever?""",10,23 September 2007,"I saw this movie almost ten years ago for the first time. Being then still twelve I(shouldn't have seen it then)was just fascinate by the special effect, taken by the action and gore, and started adoring Denise Richards.After that I have seen it again many times,discovered the films of Paul Verhoven and the books of Robert A. Heinlein. Today it's a different movie to me.Verhovens film, dubbed fascists at its release, is the exact opposite. It is an anti-war, anti- state, anti- military and anti-fascistic hell ride. For the movie it works great, but because of that it departs for the far more brilliant novel it is based on. The movie is basically divided in 3 parts. It starts as a unimpressive futuristic high school flick. We meet the poster boy Johnny Rico (Casper van Dien) his perfect girlfriend Carmen(Denise Richards), and their friends Carl(Neil Patrick Harris) and Dizzy(Dina Mayer). Carmen and Carl go to join the army, and Johnny taggers along because of Carmen. Carmen gets Starfleet, Carl intelligence and Johnny becomes ""fresh meet for the grinder"" and goes to join the mobile infantry. Then the movie turns into a far more compelling, Full Metal Jacket-like boot camp movie. We meet Johnny s instructor sergeant Zim(played brilliantly by Clancy Brown), a bunch of recruits and Dizzy again. Carmen dumps Johnny via space-mail, and he causes a death of another recruit and wants to quit the army. In the moment Johnny starts walking down Washout lane the Bugs attack Earth. Johnny gets back into the uniform, and with that the movie becomes in my mind one of the best war films made in the last twenty years. Of course there is the issue of alien bugs, with an agenda to destroy the human race with shooting asteroids for the opposite cornet of the Milky Way galaxy. The problem with the plot is that you mustn't take it seriously, if you take it you will be shocked, if you don't you will be laughing the entire movie. Eventually the bugs kick the hell out the humans at first, but as the movie progresses so those human race, at least the scientists, not the members of the mobile infantry who almost all get ripped apart by the bugs. The cast of ""poster boys"" and ""model girls"" works really great. Casper became my hero at twelve, too bad he continued his career in straight to video messes like ""Dracula 3000"". Denise Richard succeeded looking great and acting better the she has done since. Dina Meyer proved to be a reliable and great action girl. For me the supporting cast steals the show Jake Busey as Ace, Clancy Brown, and above all Michael Ironside as Lt Rasczak. Verhoves direction is intense, and the movie filled with false commercials and news turns out to be a profound critic of todays western society. lLM-s and Phil Tippett's special effects still stand today and a beautiful score by Basil Poledouris is just compelling. All in all a great entertainment, social commentary and a must see movie, although it lacks the greatness and depth of Heinlein's masterpiece.",Starship Troopers

Key part of book is about importance personal responsibility towards society, ""Dubois lesson"". It explain how right attitude and responsible behavior is important for everything and everybody. It is base of book and packed in incredible good sci-fi story. Another important part of this story is powered combat suit. Dare to say Heinlein invented it. It play such important part of book and story, that I can't imagine it would be dismissed. However - in movie was. Instead of that Verhoeven and Neumeier replace it by some ugly space-bugs, and gave them unthinkable skill - insects, without something like high-tech space navigation devices or transports, they are able to attack civilization on another far distant planet!!! Put it to simple analyze - screenplay just robbed the book, thrown away whole core and important things and left that unimportant - bugs and butchering.

The Orwellian world government of Starship Troopers has very little of the daily misery that Winston Smith endured. All of the characters of the film look healthy, attractive, and even happy.Yes, there is a great deal of gore in the movie, but the violence is portrayed as fun and glorious rather than senseless and tragic.There are also a few moments of genuine satire, but overall Starship Troopers comes off as a 1990s version of the pro-military movies of the preceding decade.",Starship Troopers

(like we all are today ... fortunately their are alternative medias and internet) Overall a great film, a lot of gore but supportable (it's war after all), great special effects, action and suspense.And the beautiful stars most of them die sliced in pieces !

I tried to give it another chance.Great SFX does not save this movie.*spoiler abound*
Dina Meyer's was quite a likeable character but this was completely ruined when she flashed her boobs and was then killed off. The nude scene seemingly gave her bimbo status and acted as a sign that this character's death was imminent. I haven't read the book but I only wish they'd substituted this death with one for Denise Richards' character's. Watch out for Denise Richards' inane and permanent grin.

582,Tchigorin,Early C,5,11 March 2007,"There are some things worth liking about this film. It is quite funny at points and its social commentary---while a little muddled (this is, in part, because of the nature of its ""source"" material but more on that later)---it does deserve to be heard. However, it should not call itself ""Starship Troopers"". This film is very different from Heinlein's novel and---to the extent that it is similar---is a parody of it. I believe it is wrong to call something an adaptation of another thing when it is, in fact, a parody of that thing. Indeed, the film started off as an unrelated project called ""Bug Hunt."" Heinlein's novel was used as a way to sell the project.Would a person take All Quiet on the Western Front and turn it into a Catch-22 style comedy? If a person were to do so, he ought to have the decency to change the title. Heinlein's novel seriously considers the idea---and the downsides---of a liberal Republic with a highly limited franchise and using this background to ask an even more important question, What is worth fighting for? A novel written as well as Heinlein's is and asks a question of such seriousness does not deserve to be ridiculed directly: At least give it the dignity of keeping its name.I posted elsewhere about why I believe the political parody in this film is incoherent. However, I will briefly mention that characterizing this society as fascist makes no sense; a fascist society would not use commercials to get people to enlist. It would draft them. There are other details that show further how little sense Verhoven's parody makes, but I will comment on them later.",Starship Troopers
583,R-Grant,"Slick, anti-Fascist, anti-war parody",9,29 January 2007,"Quick summary: hilariously good-looking people. Never have the cast of Beverly Hills 90210 looked so good. Brilliant special effects - they barely look dated even today. Superb music. Solid directing. The film hangs together very, very well.OK. This film is a parody, first of all. It - incredibly, although satirically - depicts a functional, working fascist society, which is divided into ""civilians"" and ""citizens"". It also depicts this society as an aggressive one - invading an alien species' territory, then fully going to war against it when it retaliates.It depicts the media as a major agent in this regard: there are few options as to what to watch, and the first is the ""Federal"" channel.It's also very brutal. This is an anti-war film, and also a film with aliens in. It has people ripped apart, although the parody remains (at one point, ""Mormon extremists"" are massacred in an output). It's tongue-in-cheek to the death.It's important to remember this though: the humans are the aggressors here. They started the fight. However the barrage of media spin, drill-sergeant conditioning and comradely banter creates the impression the humans are the good guys. The attitude of all of the characters reflects this; they believe that they are retaliating, when they are actually the initiators. The film gives some insight into how an invading country's citizens (in the general sense of the word!) can be convinced that what they are doing is right.Also we get to see a huge fire-breathing alien get blown up from the inside. Awesome.",Starship Troopers
584,nicholascamerontaylor,It would appear as though some people are just stupid.,8,18 July 2014,"It never ceases to amaze me how one film can be so universally misunderstood. How the satire and criticism of American fascism and imperialism can be so whole-fully misinterpreted as a love letter to the far right. It would appear as though the world's collective iq lowered just for the occasion of reviewing this film.Of course this film is not a love letter to fascism, and the squeaky clean look of both the film and it's cast is In my most humble of opinions meant to appear almost Step-ford Wives like. They are supposed to appear too perfect, an eerie reflection of the brainwashed masses duped into supporting a state that is inherently against their interests. It is presented as right wing propaganda but not in a serious manner, but rather to poke fun at average Joe and his blindingly loyal attitude to his country. Perhaps the problem lay with the fact this film resonated too closely with the public and as a result they resented it for holding a magnifying glass so closely to their precious little infallible lives. Who knows? The only thing I can know for sure is that the unwashed masses are wildly incorrect with their assessment of this film, because in a word this film is great. Allow me to analyse the film just that little but simply. The essential quality a film must have in order for it to be a success is not a stellar plot, or a stellar cast, or any amount of such things. The essential quality is watch-ability. Can you watch this film and better yet can you re-watch it? Well Starship Troopers is nothing if not re- watchable. Every time I watch this film I enjoy myself, whether I watch it for it's satirical view of American politics and somewhat hilarious take on the meat grinder of war or to watch a mind blowingly awesome summer blockbuster, even as a cheesy high school romance this film holds up. It has a little bit of something for everyone, Starship Troopers fills every niche and fills it well. I can only hope that those who with negative views of this film take the time to re-watch it because they are missing one of the most fun films in decades that has allot more going for it than what is on the surface.

The political message is turned on its head, as is the vision of what makes a man and a society righteous.Put all that aside, though. Pretend the producer/director had no political agenda and judge it as an action/adventure film. Now it's even more of a stinker. The casting is terrible. The actors are wooden and unlikeable. The battle scenes are stupid and unforgivably long. The blood and gore are practically slapstick -- and still revolting. There is no progression toward a meaningful goal and no story line worth following.Verhoeven at al should never have been allowed to get at Starship Troopers.

If nothing else, it has Dina Meyer which makes up for a lot (even Casper Van Dien's wooden acting). Jake Busey is pretty good, and Michael Ironside is typically pretentious and overbearing as the leader of the Roughnecks.On the other hand, if you're looking for an actual adaptation of the classic novel, this isn't it. The whole story has been reworked, characters have been changed around, and the plot barely resembles the book. The main character (indeed ALL the main characters) are white, whereas ""Johnny"" was actually a Filipino named ""Juan 'Johnny' Rico"" in the book. While the movie preserves some of the book's often heavy-handed political message, it's largely consumed by action sequences that never appeared in the book.I also found it amusing that, apparently hundreds of years into the future, the movie depicts space faring human soldiers being dropped into combat with no armor support, no heavy weapons aside from a few bazooka-like nukes, and hand weapons that are nothing more than high tech machine guns. Given that they're supposed to have fought the Bugs before, wouldn't they know these MGs were barely effective against the enemy?

It's about American 'silent majority' - people who spend hours watching Beverly Hills, who like stupid action movies, never read a book in years. This movie is a very sarcastic parody on all blockbusters. An ordinary person finds all he needs here: action, sledgehammer moralizing, soap opera love, contempt for aliens. It's just pushed to the limit where you realize - *mentally* we are ready to become members of a nazi state. Everything you see blossoming in the movie is being born today. First, 'black and white' thinking: we are good, they are bad even if you don't know a thing about them. We must be confident and strong.Second, political correctness - I always believed that political correctness will be logically complete when we don't have separate bathrooms for men and women, wash together in a shower and regard sex as a fun thing between 'buddies'. Third, total lack of spirituality and human emotions - we don't need it. All our life is based on things like career, fun, sports. Love is something of the third priority - given a choice to have a career or to stay with a person you love, we always choose the first option.

The dialogue was cliche and uninteresting...the nudity was superfluous and did almost nothing to further the plot, storyline, or anything besides the actresses' porn careers.The worst part of the entire film would have to be the gratuitous, senseless, pointless, protracted scenes of very graphic CGI violence. This movie just killed people off constantly, until there are literally only about two people left. But despite the protestations to the contrary, it does not do so in a way that is a satire about violence or war; to do that would require some technique, subtlety, storyline, or character development. None of that is present in this movie (and good ol' Heinlein's book isn't that much better), and the film degenerates into a pure action film because of it.Well, I use action in the loosest sense of the word, because it still stinks in comparison to a movie like Lethal Weapon 4.I found the movie to be absurdly long -- long enough that I was almost bored to tears before the end of it.

Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way that Verhoeven so badly misread the original text.  To be honest, I am not sure that he had ever seen the original text or he would have made a different, better movie.  I had high hopes for this movie since Starship Troopers is one of the few Heinlein novels amenable to an adaptation to the screen.

It's more close to an anti-war satire remotely in the vein of Kubrick's classic: ""Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"". I said ""remotely"" because this film doesn't even pretend to be subtle/clever/sophisticated in its humors.

They brought in the Skinnies, as well as the marauder suits, and full armour.Why couldn't they do a full battle suit movie like the book -- hand flamers, micro nukes from shoulder launchers, etc.  That's the way it should have been done.  I'd love to see the pod landings as the book described it.They also missed out too much of the psychological aspects and the character development -- boot camp, OCS, etc that the book spent more time on, than the actual battles.Oh well.

601,The archgimP,A film too often taken at face value.,9,4 September 2001,"(Extremely vague pseudo-spoiler) When I first saw this movie; me and a friend hired both this and 'Guyver' from the video store. I know it now sounds odd to mention both these movies in the same breath, but in the UK until that point; unless you followed the 'movie-scene' (which we didn't at the time) SST was an 'unknown'. There had been very little promo material about it (comparably) and really I was watching it because of the pretty picture on the box.We decided to watch SST first out of the two movies. When we had watched it once, we were so impressed with it we decided to skip 'Guyver' and watch SST *again*.This movie has often been taken on face values, a lot of my friends like the 'bug shooting' and 'wartime' aspects of the film. But just like 'Robocop' (also Paul Verhoeven (sp?)) this movie has very little to do with the story as presented at face value.This movie is about growing up, pure and simple. It documents the lives of some pretty idealistic kids and how they grow apart when they leave an insulated environment and have to cope with the wide world outside their doors.However; Mr. V has taken the unique perspective of the 'kids' for this journey, and he has tried to make you empathise with *their* struggle, rather than the usual take of 'Parents watching kids grow up' which dominates most big movies.All in all; a unique perspective on maturity which can hit you on so many levels if you're open to it, that it's not funny..

603,skye wingfield,"""one of my favourite cinema experiences""",9,11 June 2002,"Starship Troopers must surely rank as one of my favourite cinema experiences. There I was enduring what at first seemed to be a futuristic version of Beverly Hills 90210 only for some guy to get his head blown off in a truly shocking moment which was only a glimpse of the carnage to come. This film cranks the violence gauge up to maximum and just gets better to the point where I wanted to get up and applaud.Anyone who believes this film to be nothing more than a piece of shallow, gore-heavy sci-fi just doesn't get Verhoeven's and writer Ed Neumier's sense of humour and I would advise them to look closer. Just as Robocop was full of sub-text so is this adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's novel.
It is a quite blatant comment on how war can create a facist society just as Robocop was a comment on 80's corporate idealism (with religious alegories thrown in too).The acting may not be the greatest ever but remember this Verhoeven so tounges are placed firmly in cheeks! A special mention must also go to the SFX which five years on are still pretty much faultless.",Starship Troopers
604,SmartandDeadly,They Butchered the Book,4,30 September 2005,"I'm not sure how many of you have read Starship Troopers the book before reading it, but I'd like to point out a few things. First of all, there is a huge problem with this movie's interpretation (as usual with movies based on books). The dictionary defines fascism as ""a totalitarian political system led by a single dictator who allows no opposition, promoting an aggressive nationalism and often racism."" Am I the only one seeing a bit of a conflict? There was a democratic system in place which was most certainly not lead by ""a single dictator"". Furthermore there wasn't any racism mentioned at all in the books, indeed if you hadn't noted Sergeant Zim was most obviously of Asian descent (see his last name), as was Shujumi and quite a few others. Juan Rico himself wasn't of a descent himself that would be defined as ""Arian"". This movie on the other hand seems to have portrayed everybody as the typical ""Arian"" person. Furthermore there was a blatant disregard for human life in the ways of the M.I. The M.I. never leaves its own people behind. This is stressed throughout the book, it is continuously repeated that fighting spirit is valued and that even if one M.I. soldier is left behind they will come back for him. This is quite contrary to what is shown in the movie with random killing and ignorance of losses. There also seemed to be a few training scenes where lives were completely wasted for no apparent reason whatsoever. If you will once again flip your books to the page where Robert A. Heinlein describes the search for the two young men gone missing in the Rockies during training you'll realize that this is beyond stupid. Finally the scene where John tries to resign is quite ridiculous. It is stated numerous times that any Mobile Infantry soldier can leave whenever he likes. In fact any army member was allowed to resign under virtually any conditions unless they happened to be in the middle of a drop or some other such forbidding position. The people were furthermore most certainly not coerced into joining the army. If any of you will go back to the scene (in the book) where John is being recruited, you will realize that they were indeed discouraged and were told not to join by the recruiting officer. This makes the entire idea of the advertisements about doing one's duty quite ridiculous. Overall, I was severely disappointed when I had seen how this movie had butchered the book. If you had read it first and are thinking of watching the movie, I recommend you save yourself a good deal of mental anguish and don't watch it.",Starship Troopers
605,oodyrejid,Space garbage!,2,5 January 2014,"this is utter rubbish, a dreadful carve-up of one of the great SF novels of the past sixty years. Verhoeven clearly never read the book, and utterly misses its point and its message. The wonderfully imagined Power suits Heinlein envisaged are absent from the movie, as is the book's point that the average M.I. ""cap trooper"" is a highly skilled, efficient intelligent and superbly trained elite soldier, not the dumb grunt portrayed by the ""baywatch"" types in the movie. I am baffled by the number of reviewers who call this film ""brilliant"" etc etc, it's tripe, full of pretty boys and girls playing war and being killed in graphic and gory fashion, when they aren't playing some dopey ""football"" game, posing naked in the showers together or joyriding round the solar system in half-million ton interstellar assault ships that apparently have the handling qualities of jet skis.......... there's no satire or hidden message in this movie. it's just an abysmal adaptation of a superb book, that has taken the title and some of the character names from the book and ditched almost everything else. The military tactics shown in the film are laughable, or would be if they weren't accompanied by the excessive gore and splatter effects, I mean, soldiers armed with automatic rifles crossing millions of miles of space to invade another planet without artillery, armoured vehicles(or indeed, vehicles of ANY kind) no air support,no apparent medical back-up and not even carrying any supplies or extra ammunition..........And as for the tactic of running into battle blasting away with their rifles and then a few seconds later running away back to the ships.........it was a good job these tactics and these blokes(and glamorous girls too!!) weren't involved in the D-Day landings in 1944, that's all I can say....... to anyone who has read the book I'd say DON'T watch this movies, in fact to most people I'd say, don't watch this movie.......it's rubbish.",Starship Troopers
606,william-fu,"Good For Entertainment, but Not Really an Appealing War Film",5,2 August 2009,"Starship Troopers I would say is a pretty appealing Sci-Fi action film during the 90's since you can't really compare them to the present Sci-Fi films with all the more advanced CG graphics and special effects. But since this is a ""war"" film about humans fighting against bugs, it is indeed challenging in a way that you got these two different races from different worlds fighting each other. So it is very unlike those historical war films that we saw before about Vietnam war, and World War II. Those kinds of films are more easier for people to relate with because of the human emotions, there's the drama or a look into the human psyche when people are killing each other. But its difficult to see that in Starship troopers because all we ever see is just the actions in battle. The perspective was pretty much focused on the humans of course, while the bugs are just being portrayed as totally villainous. Which for me, it's pretty narrow, as it appears to be like you know, ""We humans must slaughter them all since they attacked us.."" this would be OK if this film is to be watched or enjoyed under the light of purely entertainment, because to me this film only portrays the human side. As I watched this film, I kept on asking myself, ""What good are the humans? We have our own pathetic weaknesses too, but in the end, we as humans still enjoy the outcome of the wars when we blow our enemies into bloody pieces."" There's a lot of blood and ore in this film, but never really show the professional maneuvers of the military. I do not feel it is real because I do not feel being part of the combat. I've seen older war films that has done a greater job than this one, because in those war films its just never about the guns and the shouting, and all the blood. You actually get to experience the psychological horror or shock coming from the actors, but in this film, you don't really see that. All we see is the joy of blowing the bugs into pieces and killing them. We don't see the actual emotional experiences of how war might have any effects on the character's mental state. Maybe just little bit at the beginning when Rico discovers how terrifying the bugs are, but their encounter with the bugs are always the same. The same kind of tension, the same kind of challenge, and there's really nothing new other than the flying and giant new monsters. I do not feel like being in a battle field because the humans are just running all over the places and shooting the bugs in bundles. I would enjoy it more to see the humans actually are attempting to accomplish certain orders on the battle field under the command of somebody. I like the drama, and the girl who played Carmen, she's gorgeous and it really makes me to dislike early on because of her character and I really wanted to see her to be with Rico again, but somehow it didn't really work that powerful. It becomes like I really don't care anymore about them because I don't really see a lot of conflict between them. I really wanted more out of them. Maybe all this is little too much for this film, and maybe its because I've seen some of the war films already that were pretty much better than this one. So this could be biased. Overall I think its alright...for just purely entertainment.",Starship Troopers

609,Tiekozulu,Sci-fi B movie awesomeness,7,10 June 2013,"Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well.In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they ""nuke"" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared.This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening.This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film.Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well.go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.",Starship Troopers
610,theodman,The smartest dumb movie ever.,10,2 December 2009,"You can watch this film in three ways I think, one, is with a bag of popcorn, a few beers and some friends, and just try to enjoy the ride. Two, is with your thinking cap on, and to really try to take in all the subtle, and not so subtle satire, and anti-propaganda that this film offers. Three, is a mix of the above, and it's the way I think a lot of people have started to watch this movie, at least that is the case for me.When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I loved the movie for really simple reasons(not bad, but simple) it was visually stunning for it's time, it had funny, over the top characters that you just can't help but to love, and a cast of really easy on the eye actors.Then I bought the DVD, and started to notice all the social commentary that I kinda missed the first time around, and now I hold this film as one of my all-time favorites, maybe even top 5.I see a lot of difference in opinion on these boards, and I can't help but to think that the people that do not like this movie, have not moved away from the first example I wrote on how to watch this film, and simply do not like sci-fi films, and don't want to give credibility to the genre.For people who DO like sci-fi, and are open to new takes on the sci-fi genre, this movie is a godsend. It's a treat for the eyes, ears, and brain, and just one of the most entertaining movies I've ever had the privilege to see. If you haven't seen it, I envy you, cause you're in for a real treat.If I had rated this movie back when it came out, I would have given it a seven, maybe an eight, but now, after so many years, and views, I have come to the conclusion that this movie deserves a top score, ten out of ten from Sweden.",Starship Troopers
611,sublunari,Fun for the Whole Family!,8,10 November 2005,"I believe in this wonderful movie because it has a wide appeal. It appeals to intellectuals and it appeals to non-intellectuals. It's fun to watch, the special effects blew me away as a kid and still hold up today, looking better and more real than anything George Lucas has made in the past few years. If you don't enjoy yourself it's probably because you have a dislike of violence--and this movie has to be one of the most violent things I have ever seen--or because the dialogue is so childish, campy, and vacuous that you feel as if your brain is being sucked out by a gigantic termite.On the other hand...It's a satire. It puts on display the ideal right-wing society, and all the hilarious brainlessness thereof. Authority is never questioned. Leaders are always correct. You don't matter unless you're a warrior. The enemy is a faceless, writhing mass of animals--no, insects--that must be destroyed at all costs. Everyone is remarkably beautiful, but at the same time every character's mind is so malnourished and so filled with state propaganda that no one has anything of any importance to say. The human mind has become so frail that soldiers go into combat without any kind of strategy--beyond ""kill them all!""--regularly break formation, wear useless armor and carry weapons that are practically useless, rarely if ever have any kind of effective support in the form of cavalry or artillery, and always fly their ships as close together as possible even though they know that in doing so they are easier targets for the bugs--who do have artillery--and that they will inevitably crash into each other. It's a prophetic film, with it's own Pearl Harbor/911 moment, its own terrorists who hate freedom and are most certainly not defending themselves from a foreign invasion of their own lands--compare the U.S-backed regime in Saudi Arabia to Fort Ticonderoga in the movie, deep in the ""Bug Quarantine Zone""--and with plenty of its own blind patriotism. The difference, however, between the film and the modern age is that the Starship Troopers win, as they have the intelligence to fight an actual enemy rather than the concept of terrorism, like us. The metaphor isn't perfect, though, since the Starship Troopers don't feel the need to occupy Klendathu and civilize--pardon me, democratize--the bugs. Beyond that, the sound, music, and cinematography is solid, never getting in the way of telling a violent, satirical adventure. The love story is stupid, as is really every relationship in the movie, but that's because this is the right-wing paradise, where everyone is a little brainless cog too busy making babies or killing bugs to think of anything interesting. The film is about as similar to the book as The Wrath of Khan is to Moby Dick, but that doesn't detract from the immense pleasure I feel in watching it. I laugh, I cringe, I think: I am entertained. Star Wars was obviously a huge influence. My only complaint has to do with the plot: the siege in the middle of the movie is really the high point, and should actually go at the end. It was simply too incredible to be topped. And as an aside, they don't really explain how bug plasma could shoot an asteroid across the entire galaxy in what seems like a matter of a few weeks at most, which leads me to believe that the whole reason for fighting--the destruction of Buenos Aires--was faked by the Federation itself, but who knows?

It seems naive and sentimental. The don't buy the message and don't believe for a minute that one man can win against the powers that be. Paul Verhoeven doesn't believe Heinlein's Ideals and it shows. Heinlein never saw this future as a fascist society as many people who saw the film seem to think. This was a proposal for an Ideal society based on his interpretation of American Ideals. Voting is much less important than innate civil rights. Only those who give up their freedom through Civil service can vote. The entire philosophical aspect is there but weak and this severely handicaps the film. The casting was very television-B movie and the costumes were awful. The whole Robo-cop feel was transposed onto the film. It would have required someone that actually had a feel for Heinlein to sell the underlying Ideas. Even the military camaraderie was botched.

It follows the classic propaganda themes of war films (good looking people fight, the hero does brave things and gets promoted, the hero's friend is killed and there's a moving speech, etc.) and thus reviewers could be emotionally tricked into believing it's a pro-war film, but it's a subtle satire of those films.A cast of *very* attractive then unknowns appear as recruits and officers in a violent / gory / blood war film that may have more wound realism in it than just about any war movie ever made. When I saw this movie a woman in the theater actually went into hysterics in the big battle scene when a half a man's body flies towards the camera and 'hits' the screen. Verhoeven, who survived WWII in Holland and reports seeing bodies in the streets after air raids, put his visual memories to good use.

With this film, plus SHOWGIRLS and BASIC INSTINCT, Paul Verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors. His celebrated film TOTAL RECALL was - I admit - successfully scripted, but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws. Obviously nobody wanted to invest TOO much money in a production from someone like Verhoeven, the result being that much of the special effects in STARSHIP TROOPERS seemed fake. But not everything bad in the film was the director's fault, even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors. It is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the Razzie Awards (I expected five for the acting categories).

You do not have to think hard or anything else, if you like the genre just sit back and enjoy the ride. This film has the same structure as Robocop. We have to thank for that the same filmmaker: Paul Verhoeven, Jost Vacano and Edward Neumeier. So if you like Robocop you should like this one. Some comments say that this is a B movie. I do not think so, but there are some things, which will make you make that decision. The only thing, which I can say: `This is a B movie thing', is the design of the spacecrafts. For the rest it is top notch: Special Effects - one of the best I have ever seen, music by Basil Polidorious is just awesome, cinematography - very good (Jost Vacano - way to go). The problem with the script is obvious, but as I said, `You do not have to think during this SF flick', this is not some serious movie about the war or the war tactics. This is more of the satire. Be course some thing will remind you of the Vietnam War, some of WWII. Some people criticised it like it was some `Platoon' or `Saving Private Rayn'. They just did not see that you do not have to judge this film on the same level as above-mentioned movies. The blood and gore just filled the movie.

At the suggestion that the bugs are attacking only in defence, having been interfered with by the Federation too many times, and that a 'live and let live' policy would save the most lives, the protagonists respond aggressively and not particularly intelligently.

Where the film's future world society is bleak and oppressive, the book's society is hopeful and prosperous. Purpose behind the actions of each character, indeed both species in the war, is lost in the director's quest for a blockbuster shoot'em up. Heinlein at least suggests the possibility that humans attempted to settle a bug world, however this is lost in the xenophobic frenzy that this movie is.The movie isn't half of what it could have been had it followed the book more closely without a loss of any of the director's all too important action sequences.",Starship Troopers

I'll admit that I didn't see it in the theatre, but seeing _Starship Troopers_ on TV made it look so clunky, so stupid, and so, well, bad, that I feel grateful that I didn't waste any money by going to see it. The costumes made it look as if it was made for TV (or at least filmed in Toronto).  Futuristic?  My ass!  This movie isn't even two years old - and it already looks dated! I actually found it somewhat disturbing how Aryan a lot of the actors looked.  It seemed almost like Nazi Propaganda for the future.  Is this the message Verhoeven was trying to get across?

Well I read ST when I was about twelve and it struck me nothing so much as a stupidly idealistic view of the American future. There's nothing stupid about the film. It revels in being corny, comic book and unashamedly the AMERICAN WAY. It's big dumb and brilliant.

To many Europeans, Verhoeven shows the American way in a somewhat overdone way. To us, this is they way American think about war and warfare. The way they feel about their country. Verhoeven is holding up a mirror to American culture (or the lack of it) and people mistake it for fascism. Sad....",Starship Troopers

Any attempt at a script or plot was clearly thrown overboard as too complicated. The gung-ho jingoism was just daft and the military school was risible - full of people who think hairstyles are an intellectual challenge. The special effects were OK, (if you like seeing people's insides) but the overkill just became boring. You couldn't even get interested enough to dislike anyone.

While Starship Troopers has no hope of becoming a Hollywood classic(it was nominated for one paltry Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it lost to Titanic), it is probably one of the funnest movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It can be classed as probably the best B-movie ever made, because let's face it, it has that B-movie feel to it.(Even thought it cost $120 million to make.) The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen, and overall, it is just one cool movie.

Judging by the way they fight, its obvious they were manufactured for their perfect looks... and nothing else.This rates as one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. Acting was non-existent, situations were ridiculous, and the plot was as thin as air in space. The holes in the plot were as big as Moon-sized asteroid chunks.1) Main characters. Duh! I did not care whether they lived or died! Why didn't the bugs get the chance to eat the entire cast? Not one of the characters had a slightly likeable personality, acting was wooden and stilted. Just check out Denise Richards' acting ability. Her acting is about as good as mine. And my acting is ATROCIOUS!!!2)Battle tactics on planet. Shooting at run-away cranes on multiple legs with pathetic little guns is bound to have little to no effect. Shooting at bugs the size of houses with pathetic little guns is ALSO bound to have little to no effect.3) Do keep all your battle ships in a tight cluster while bug fart bombs bombard you - then wonder 'but why are we being shot down for? It's just bug fart gas! Besides, Denise Richards is at the helm!'4) Bugs firing an asteroid across the galaxy to earth - and nobody tries - or bothers - to stop the thing before it hits Aaron Spelling's Mannequin Factory.

The third and final requirement is that there has to be a great villain or enemy in the movie and the bugs are amazing.

It can be very interesting if you leave the movie and try to place it in context of the real life--especially if you agree with Verhoeven's message.People point out that the movie is supposed to be full of biting satire. Yet, the problem is that the satire is not especially obvious to most viewers, unless they were, somehow, already receptive to the movie's message. To the more naive viewers, the movie just seems like full of poor, over-the-top, and unmotivated acting without much of a plot (all of which are true). If the seemingly ignorant reaction of the audience is itself part of the satire (even if unintended), that seems like like an indictment of the movie rather than a plaudit: if the audience doesn't get the message, the movie failed to deliver it properly. If the only people who get it are those who agree with the movie's themes already, it is a poor communicator, which, in turn, makes for not-exactly-a- great movie.If the movie were actually better written, acted, and its point more apparent, it might have been an actually good movie whose virtues can be appreciated by everyone, whether they agreed or not.

The males are forced to play stereotyped roles, with interplays of aggression and dominance. No-one is a baddie except the aliens. The worst alien is CGImation representing the last accepted bastion of prejudice - a fat thingy that is OK to hate or ridicule.

646,einsi_tequila,Fun to watch,10,3 August 2010,"It clearly shows that they spent more in special effects and hired TV actors to meet the budget, in this case it was a very good choice. It's surprisingly realistic for it's time, a good blend of props and computer graphics. The director Paul Verhoeven and bunch of the designer crew also did Robocop, so you can see where attention to realism comes from. I think the action and gore is just right, makes the movie a lot less pretentious. It's fast and cuts to the chase. It's certainly not a Oscar winning type movie, but it's one of my all time favorites for a simple reason... it's fun to watch. It's overall even, good characters, adventure, action, humor, horror and a bit of drama. It's just one of those lovable all in one movies. The actors don't really stand out from each other, it's a good thing. This movie is actually a high point for many of the actors in worldwide cinema. They must have had a lot of fun acting in this movie because the confidence shows on screen. The message in the storyline is drawn from the origin of fascism in early 1900's, the idea of combining a community into a single identity under leadership in order to become a strong war machine. In result, individuals become insignificant. Like in the classic song by Pink Floyd ""Another brick in the wall"". There's a downside to this movie though, it sort of disgraces the book it's based on with the same title written by Robert A. Heinlein. I recommend reading the book or seeing the movie, I don't recommend doing both. Read the book if you are more of a visionary, see the movie if you just want to see a fun action movie.

652,Roy72,Totalitarianism is very good looking.,9,14 June 2006,"Having read lots of comments already made there doesn't seem much to add though I seem to unique in loving both the book and the Film. I clearly believe this is meant as a satire and am as amazed as many other posters that some people simply didn't notice that the humans were the bad guys.Heinlen's original novel postulated a fulfilled society with low crime, high employment, and global harmony. The price was fascist government, capital and corporal punishment for offenders and you don't get to vote. UNLESS you indenture with the government for two years to suffer and maybe die in the process. I think many people round the world in hellholes like Somalia, North Korea, Iraq etc would go for it given the choice.The famous ""Shower Scene"" is mainly remembered for Men and Women being naked together- shock horror!! But what is shocking is the characters revealing that without military service you can't i) vote ii) join the media iii) breed!! Now that sounds like a good way to control the population as only ex-military types get to have children/choose the government/publish their thoughts.Things I loved - bug stamping propaganda- some of the music - Cheesy smiles to the camera after blowing up BIG insects-""Make it 20 minutes"" Not so good- some of the acting- some departures from the Novel e.g. the accountability of top officers. If you cock up the operation and get 100,000s of soldiers killed you don't get to retire quietly.Final point I don't think this satire is squarely aimed at the U.S. but mankind's attraction to State power/militarism. It just so happens that right now the US is the only Superpower in the world and just happens the most powerful and expensively equipped armed forces in history so the glove just appears to fit most comfortably there.",Starship Troopers

Anthony Hopkins using an accurate sten gun in a ""Bridge too Far"", and the wonderful realisation by Micheal Caine in the ""Battle of Britain"" that spitfires tend to overheat when sitting too long on the ground. This is the amazing stuff that I look for in a Spielberg movie or from British filmmakers.This is a completely different kind of movie, and one I thought I would hate. Quite the reverse. Sometimes its just an-over-the top science-fiction flic, and yes it is indeed that. But it does say something, in my opinion, about the youth that governments typically send into battle, and why they behave as they do.Combining humour, pretty good CGI, an unlikely plot (it is science fiction after all), it still rings true for the sense of what young people have been asked to do for the rest of us. Lay your sense of disbelief aside, enjoy the shower scene, and revel in the fact that Hollywood did something quite good in this film.",Starship Troopers
658,AllAmericanAssParty,Another Great Verhoeven Sci-fi film (SPOILERS),7,13 November 2005,"I remember when this film was released in theaters, several of my buddy's went and saw it and came back astonished. They made claims that it was better than Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. When I finally saw it on my own I didn't find it to be quite that good, but came to the conclusion that it was in fact a good sci-fi film.When it comes to the visual effects and overall look of the film, I thought it looked really cool. Although the bugs themselves weren't, to paraphrase Ebert, as impressive as the aliens in the Alien movies, they served their purpose as the antagonists in this film.SPOILERS BELOWNow as for the acting, in some areas it could have been better. I wasn't totally impressed with Casper Van Dien as Rico, his presence on screen can be somewhat nonexistent in some scenes. The rest of the cast however is very good especially the women in this film, which were better than most of the male characters. I thought Dina Meyer and Denise Richards were great as a grunt and a starship pilot. The triangle relationship that the 3 main characters have was really good. I have to admit that I was actually really sad when when Dizzy was killed.The story overall is good. Although the bugs live in a far away galaxy, they still managed to find ways to hurl asteroids toward earth, which was interesting to me. What I didn't like though were the way the infantry fight these bugs. As advanced as the future is portrayed in this film, all these guys really do is use 1000 shots to kill 1 bug. Where are the advanced weapons? How about using more nukes rather than have 100,000 soldiers be killed in 1 hour.So in conclusion, I think Paul Verhoeven definitely delivered with Starship Troopers, despite a few problems It had. Although not quite as good his Robocop, I think it tops Total Recall. For those of you that like Star Wars, Star Trek and the Alien films this movie is definitely recommended.",Starship Troopers
659,TheOriginalhonk,awesomely cheesy,7,18 May 2004,"In general the movie is excessive, cheesy and a stereotypical sci-fi action flick. But, I think it was meant to be over the top, thats what makes it so entertaining. The advertisements for the army sprinkled throughout the movie really compliment the film, making the whole thing come off like some type of weird social commentary. Though the acting of Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards leave much to be desired, that almost adds to the satirical feel of the film. In the end, its not the best written, best made film of all time; but that all adds to the feel of this modern day B-movie. If nothing else its entertaining, and as far as I'm concerned thats all a movie really needs to be.",Starship Troopers
660,dutch_guy,An Excellent Parody of Futuristic War,10,18 September 2004,"This is a quintessential guy film. You take the best of the WWII films (even better with alien special effects), combine it with Internet hype, sex it up with a bunch of pretty faces (and bodies) and surround it with the most violence since Verhoeven's previous work on Robocop. What is the most interesting feature in this film, however, is the bizarre love triangle between the three lead characters that doesn't get resolved in the end. This feature, while despised by most female viewers, shows that Verhoeven continues to depict strong female characters that are on an equal level with men and not in direct competition based on their sexuality. While this movie appeals to the most primal of instincts on a base level, it definitely contains much more. The futuristic social-political commentary on militarism and the space age are interesting and worth a critical look. Overall this movie is A+ in my book.",Starship Troopers

I don't recommend this movie to anyone. In this movie, you will see future space soldiers, descending onto an alien planet (without prior bombarding) and then shooting to aliens with machine guns, whose capabilities are comparable to these from WWII. Don't mind any spacesuits.

It makes it seem like you're seeking information to join the army fighting in the film with it's constant ""Do you want to know more"" quote. It even make you feel patriotic and want to fight alongside their fictional army in their fictional war. Overall though it involves lots of action, and killing with an adequate story line to keep you interested for the whole movie. I just wish they could have kept out the need for a love story that just makes the film seem like cheesy Hollywood nonsense. That's why I give it no higher than a 7/10.",Starship Troopers

665,xfearbefore,A misunderstood thrill ride,8,11 August 2011,"Can you say ""underrated""? Unfairly labeled as nothing more then Sci-Fi exploitation trash, this film is far more deep and thought-provoking than most critics and viewers give it credit for.First off, let me just say that if you're a fan of the novel by Robert A. Heinlan (great book), but you've never seen the movie...do NOT expect a faithful adaptation. The movie is basically nothing at all like the book, with slews of new characters and new plot lines created for the movie that had nothing to do with the book. This however doesn't have to be a bad thing always, and this film is a prime case of that.Where the novel was bleak and poignant, the film is both an in-your-face parody of war and Sci-Fi films, and a biting satire of the rise of fascism and militarism. From Michael Ironside teaching his students in the class room that violence is the ""ultimate power"" from which all other power is derived, to the blatantly Nazi-esque uniforms that the intelligence officers wear, it's hard to believe how very few people understood this was a satire at heart.The acting can be very wooden at times, but in a way it's actually helpful to the film. Like Southland Tales, another gravely misunderstood film, the actors in the film are supposed to be wooden. They're the perfect war-movie clichés, from the quickly rising hero (Van Dien) to the motor-mouthed wiseass (Jake Busey) to that one overzealous guy who decides he can single-handedly defeat an entire race of bugs. Dina Meyer is actually pretty decent at times though, and Michael Ironside is ALWAYS fun to watch, regardless of what he's in. And did I mention the film includes Neil Patrick Harris? That wins points immediately. Plus this is probably the only film you'll ever watch with Jake Busey in it in which you don't want to claw your eyes out every second he's on the screen (I loved his character in the film as a kid, so much so that I wanted my friends from then on to refer to me as ""Ace"" in honor of his character. They laughed at me and I was never called Ace again) Another thing worth mentioning are the designs of the alien insects, which are all absolutely fantastic. They look 100% real, and like living, breathing organisms and not computer-generated pixels. The ""brain bug"" in particular is wonderfully designed.In the end, there's something for everybody in this film. If you want to take it on face value alone as a cheesy sci-fi action romp, you'll no doubt have a great time watching it. If you're looking for something deeper though, this is also a film for you. Upon closer inspection, you'll realize that the human's are not the heroes in the story, but are in fact the invaders encroaching upon space that isn't theirs.Definitely give this one a try if you never have. Maybe you won't pick up on all of the subtle fascistic hints here and there, but it will be virtually impossible for you to not alteast enjoy yourself watching this film. I've seen it probably 20 times since I was a kid and it never gets old.",Starship Troopers
666,Anonymous_Review,When satire becomes an action film,10,11 January 2008,"General comments.Starship Troopers is an action movie. It was supposed to be a war commentary adaption, but instead they tried to make a satire, and it ended up an action movie. While the humour is all there, the themes exaggerated and over done tongue in check, it ended up an action film. While the critics were polarised and some found it hard to enjoy the film as it turned out a satire morphed action movie rather than the serious war commentary it originally was. Some find it great because of this though.acting.Sure, Casper Van Dien may not be the greatest actor, but he's not as bad as everyone thinks, he's at least mediocre. The other actors make up for it with their own. and either way, it's an action film really. You're insane if you're complaining about the acting.story.The film was supposed to be kind of high class, but they twisted around and it suits the simple idea of man versus bugs. Because of this, it's limbs galore, bodies flying all over the place and gun-ho ho ho. The film came out as a 15, so it's no surprise that the audience it's aimed at loves it since it's such a tongue in cheek gore action film.Reception.There's the crowd that's disappointed in the adaption which should have been more war commentary and less war action. Unfortunately, you get what you get, and the film isn't without it's flaws. The bad acting isn't too bad as I stated, and the plot doesn't take a brain to follow. Then again, it's a wonderful tongue in cheek action film, with satirist themes.Art Design The designs in the film are brilliant, sure the film had a high budget. But they still produced 1000 fiberglass helmets and hundreds of realistic armour and futuristic guns (even if the guns don't have iron sights, it just adds to the themes of the film)To top it all off the film is glossed over in a good soundtrack and good dialogue. Admittably not great dialogue, but good dialogue.I give it 7 out of ten for being entertaining, but still flawed.",Starship Troopers

Keep one thing in mind about ""Starship Troopers""; just like the US on 9/11, they were attacked first. Responding is not imperialism. This movie shows one alternative government, while not my personal choice, is effective at meeting a challenge. And maybe service in the military as a condition to citizenship is not such a bad idea. The acting is terrible; Gary Busey's son is as good as he is, which is not so good. This is also a great example of the possibilities from one world government.

668,Doc-Zucker,I just can't buy the pretended satire,1,28 January 2008,"At the time it came out I seemed to be the only one in my closer environment who actually detested this movie for its gruesome use of Nazi imagery and violence. Everyone seemed to embrace the idea that it was a satire, that Verhoeven was not to be questioned for his political ambitions (or at least naivety) and the films graphic depiction of violence could thus be enjoyed without remorse (something that has actually become en vogue among many since ""Pulp Fiction"": Laughing about violence in the theaters no matter what context the violence takes place in.).Having seen it again now, I must say my view hasn't changed a bit. The irony is aimed at, but to me it just doesn't work. I'm still quite sure that this sorry effort is highly popular among skinheads and other right wing dumb nuts and it is disconcerting to see that so many people still seem to acknowledge this as a clever satire.To me, the irony wears thin and only hardly covers the immature joy that Mr. Verhoeven obviously had in fumbling around with Riefenstahl-imagery he could not control but solely copy and illustrations of gore that can almost be called violence-pornography.To be avoided.",Starship Troopers

People say, the actings bad, and cheesy, but that's what the film wants you to think. A parady on American politics, ie cold war propaganda, an how we see others. Forget about the Nazi uniform,thats a red herring. The director has challenged you to see beyond this films issues.

670,BenNicholson123,Whaddanamazingmovie!!,9,31 October 2005,"Starship Troopers! Its one of those movies which you just love or hate, personally - i loved it. I first whatched it at a friends, i just walked into his house and was presented by a big fat bug sucking someones brain out an i was instantly interested :P i whatched the whole thing shortly after and by the end of the film i had a grin the size of a banana, i think for most people the first time they watch this movie they see the gore and the blood and not much else, the second and third times you've seen the fight scenes you can look past the flying legs and see the deep storyline and issues for instance you can decide which are the good and bad guys - the bugs are peaceful until the humans attack their world, while we see images of hatred from the humans, ""The only good bug is a dead bug!"" and ""Kill em' all"". We can follow the path of the hero Johnny Rico, how he joined up for a girl and how he became a man through rigorous military training. Overall a stunning movie with an intense plot, wonderful effects and a great message. However it is incredibly gory (One of the first scenes is a news reporter being torn apart by a bug) and i wouldn't recommend it to younger views or people who are offended by that sort of thing.

671,yoyome-12135,It tries to be a satire but ends up being a self-caricature,6,11 September 2020,"The idea is not bad, it is obviously not just a copypasted sci-fi/action and it attempts to draw you into deeper topics but the execution simply does not deliver. Other than the less than subtle propaganda pieces and nazi uniforms, there is not much that it does to further the idea it tries to develop, which is showing a futuristic dystopian society akin to the Third Reich in its essence. Acting does not help at all - it would have been better if they just told the actors to really overdo it in an obvious, mocking way or conversely make it more natural. This just comes off as some very bad acting and is also very inconsistent across the board. I also find it strange that they didn't bother with any common sense (and it was not even purposeful imo) when it comes to people not dying of blood loss when they are pierced right through etc. If you think it's good satire, you should give Idiocracy a try, it is much better in delivery, despite pondering on a rather different subject matter.",Starship Troopers

674,WarHawkeye,Galactically Bad,1,29 October 2005,"Bad on every level I can think. Bad war film, bad action film and far worse than stupid political commentary.If this were simply a bad film, that would be fine, but the fact that it is based on a classic science fiction novel makes it a crying shame. I remember how excited fans of the book were that it was finally being made into a film, and how disappointed they still are that Verhoven did it.I'm not surprised people will try to give the film credibility by talking about how ""complex"" it is. Um ... no. It's not, really. It doesn't come across as having a bad script and bad acting and a morally bankrupt point of view because it's making a statement, it comes across that way because has a bad script it's truly badly directed and yeah, most of the acting isn't great. On the other hand, the script's subtle-as-a-jackhammer political agenda and wooden dialogue would have been hard to rise above even if the director did have some sort of vision that was worth sharing. Why bother using Heinlein's book if you have so little respect for it? Why ruin the film adaptation of a book for your own purposes? How arrogant, self-serving and irresponsible is that? The combat sequences make no sense whatsoever, with the hi-tech Space Marines charging the Bugs in a way that would seem more appropriate in ""Braveheart"" being especially bad.I can't remember being more disappointed by a film, ever.

675,jshopa,An invisible satire,6,29 March 2007,"I took a course in eighteenth century English lit several years ago, and one of the first pieces we studied was Daniel Defoe's pamphlet ""The Shortest Way with the Dissenters"", a satirical piece he had anonymously published. Defoe wrote in the voice of his opponents, denouncing his own group (the dissenters) and proscribing outlandish punishments and generally pushing for their extermination, while heaping considerable historically inaccurate praise on his foes. Yet as absurd as his suggestions were and as woefully misguided his praise was, the satire completely went unnoticed. His opponents who he had intended to satirize adopted the pamphlet and lauded it as a fresh look at the problem. His own political/religious group was horrified. Then, when it inevitably came out that he, an outspoken dissenter, had written the piece, the satire became all too evident and his flustered opponents had him pilloried and thrown in jail. Defoe had made the dire mistake of underestimating the potential for evil of those he was criticizing and thus his satire became invisible for those who were not looking for it. What has all this to do with Starship Troopers, you may ask? Well, as far as Robert Heinlein's novel goes, it has precious little relation, but then the same could be said for this film which, while preserving character names, locations, lines of dialogue, and plot points from the novel, it is no more an adaptation of Heinlein's novel than Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a true story. However, Paul Verhoeven, like Daniel Defoe before him, has crafted a work of satire that is largely invisible to most viewers, leading to a critical and commercial failure that more or less finished him in Hollywood. What is most troublesome is that not even those associated with the film, apart from Verhoeven and Neil Patrick Harris, seem to have any realization that what they are doing is satire. They go about their roles with the gravest sincerity. This leads to such great moments as when Michael Ironside intones with the utmost conviction and solemnity 'They sucked his brains out.' They're acting in a good old' fashioned war propaganda picture, much like Michael Bay's dubious Pearl Harbor, but the director was making another film altogether, the direct opposite in fact. Starship Troopers is at once an anti-propaganda film satire as well as an ongoing checklist of sci-fi and war movie clichés that over the course of the film escalate to an insane degree. Verhoeven was in some ways retreating to the safety of his first big North American success, Robocop, with its absurd ultra-violence, media criticism, and carefully concealed subversive satire. The trouble is, bringing us back to the example of Defoe, is that with the satire invisible, this is a troubling and unpleasant film that seems to target the lowest common denominator. There are many things to recommend about Starship Troopers. The special effects are shockingly well-done for the most part, including stunning cgi effects for the bugs which are still impressive today. Neil Patrick Harris does a slyly comic turn as Carl Jenkins, who unlike his character in the novel, has become a psychic SS agent, and there is a bizarre cameo by The Golden Girls' Rue McClanahan as a Dr. Strangelove-esquire biology teacher. The wide-eyed sincerity of the rest of the cast also makes for fascinating viewing, as if they were making their way through a forties b-picture with a plot line that seems like a high school drama club's adaptation of Heinlein's story. There are also a lot of things wrong with the movie. For starters, the lame costume design of the troopers, of which the less said the better. The alien effects, while often stunningly well-realized, are occasionally oddly cartoonish (the same can be said for the prevalent gore). Mostly, the storyline is a jumbled patchwork mess that takes huge leaps of logic and the characters are Styrofoam replicas of actual human beings ('More meat for the grinder', as their recruiting officer says). However, if one can entirely dissociate it from the novel after which it is vaguely patterned, and is fully aware of the director's intent (as opposed to the intent of all others involved), this is an intelligent film and both a funny and deeply disturbing satire.",Starship Troopers

While we are constantly shown that submitting ourselves to the State Ideological Apparatus involves a loss of control over our mind and bodies (which in the film leads to dismemberment, disembowelment, and disfiguration) the message is presented under an ironic and self-reflexive veil of pure entertainment that is irresistible.

Where other directors go out their way to soften the edges on this material and make as MOR as possible, Verhoeven eschews any Brechtian distance from the material, by throwing in Melrose Place/90120 clones as Hitlerjurgen and Spielbergian movie mechanics to run us full throttle into a world which is an endless cycle of war and mass destruction",Starship Troopers

Haven´t you experienced watching a movie, lets say 2001, and you find it stupid because, lets face it: The year 2000 is right around the next corner and there is no one living on mars or the moon or whatever. Another big quality is that a lot of people die. I´m not saying I want to see people die, bear with me here. I´m meaning that it´s realistic in a way. A lot of the people introduced in the story die, which is statistically correct. If 1000 people die in a battle, some of the people you are fighting with must die. I also like the irony throughout the film (the cow and the murderer), and all the trivial things you don´t notice until the 5th time you watch. All the actors do a good job, save one.

I've tried hard to think of any redeeming features and I can't. The only reason I gave it a score of 1 is because 0 isn't an option.And lastly, if anyone decides to do the same with Glory Road or The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, please, please, please don't.",Starship Troopers

695,olegperov,Have a few minuses but a very good movie.,10,24 February 2000,"I have to say that I really like that movie and my friends like it too. My reception of this movie can be described by quoting a local movie critic ""Cineastes were running around greeting each other with an exclamation ""What a movie!"""".Then why many people don't like it? Many people think of this movie as of a sci-fi blockbuster. What Paul Verhoeven  has made is not exactly sci-fi blockbuster, though it have many action scenes and the lovers of the genre will like it. Verhoeven made an example of ""What a propaganda movie could be in some totalitarian future"". And from this point the movie is perfect.So what's are the positive things? First what comes in mind is a TV broadcasts, which are showing to us how does this totalitarian future actually looks like. The best way to learn any society culture is to look at their TV broadcasts. It's nice to see that Verhoeven continues and evolves his Robocop feature.You say that acting was bad. Well, actors did played inexperienced some times. But this fits this movie perfectly. The characters are young, self confident and always in a good mood, their emotions are simple. Isn't this the way people should be in a totalitarian future?They know who's their foe is and that the first priority is to serve in army. So there is nothing strange about them seeing how their friends are dying and then smiling after getting promotion - that's the way people should act in a militaristic future.Main characters looks ideal, always have a perfect haircut and a hundred dollar smile. This is how positive characters must look in a propaganda film.Next thing is the plot. I haven't read a book and I can't say how different is the movie plot from the book. But the movie plot is great. It have many story lines, every scene have sense and there is nothing unnecessary. Some of the story lines are very like Soviet propaganda films (eg. three friends apart in the beginning of war and rejoin in the end).Film have many nice and well directed scenes, sometimes you should check what's going on at the back of frame to get a full picture. The picture is sunny and light, houses, nature and environment are all very nice. A ideal picture of a happy future.And of course! A special credits for a Dizzy vs. Rico sex scene, one of the best movie sex scenes I've seen. This pulling a T-shirt over eyes thing can go straight in to the cinematography annals.To conclude a positive things some words on special effects. I liked them not because they were outstanding and qualitative (that's a must have feature of any watchable movie with SFX) but because they were made smart. Arachnids are shown the way you would probably see them and they not doing anything they not suppose to (like people jumping from one building to another). Their interaction with environment is very good. So at some point you forgetting that you watching SFX and starting to believe it.The negative things. Unfortunately this movie have some. Some of the technical moments I don't like: A verbal countdown and a manual course calculating on a hi-tech spaceship. An asteroid flying from other side of the galaxy to us should fly on a VERY high speed, so you would probably not see it. If you did see it but was unable to send message to Earth 'cause of transmitter breakdown, then why nobody else seen it? And why you should send an infantry to fight arachnids when you can drop a bomb on a planet, as Ace was advising? But those are small minuses.Bigger minus is: Every time I watch this movie I get a feeling that something is missing between a moment when Carmen meets Zander on Roger Young and a moment when Rico gets a message from her where she says to him bye. Perhaps there is an explanation to this, I heard that some scenes were cut from the film during editing. Maybe an another version of a movie exists, different from the one I've seen. So Paul, if you ever gonna read this, please send me a note, okay? :)But even with that minuses I still think that the film is excellent. 10 out of 10 for originality. I have seen it for about ten times and I going to watch it and least the same number of times. So "" Come on you apes, do you wanna live forever?!"".",Starship Troopers

Yet if you were to watch this movie closely you would begin to think ""What went wrong?""If you thought of it as a cheesy rip-off from the classic novel then you're in the right, a symbol of political oppression displayed in the confines of the film... it's a slight possibility, or an outrage in military tactics and over all attack strategy you've hit the jack pot!No offense meant to Verhoeven but.. why? The full scale invasion made by a fleet of pilots who can just out turn an asteroid going at lets say 50,000 Kilometers per minute, but get slaughtered in orbit when they could have easily dodged plasma going no more that 200 Kilometers and hour.And nothing but infantry on the ground in an hostile environment, and to make my point on Tango Urila they had fighter/bombers eradicate the bugs with napalm, yet there were five times that many fighter/bombers above Klendathu in the first conflict, where was the victory? The brain bug? A grunt getting their brains sucked out does not account for the tactical plans of fifteen generals who are more than likely highly experienced and are omniscient about the state of the fight.Even if you ruled out the fighters, this is the future! Where are the tanks, mobile suits, light squad vehicles; If the film featured these Klendathu would have been a cakewalk, maybe a few hundred casualties mind you, but all the same a scene of total obliteration thousands of bugs splattered and another planet secure.Although short in the basic actions and conduct of real warfare, a good film or any film for that matter will have it's short comings.",Starship Troopers

It's very sad to hear that, it didn't do very well at the box office when it was released in 1997. But you have to thank Hollywood for giving the green light for this movie. The action is top notch and so are the actors. People should also take this movie very serious because you are introduced to the ugly face of war.

702,horam66,How to bomb a system that paid you to lick his a....,10,14 July 2011,"Another review of this film? I just have to... First of all, I don't like movies with large amounts of action, violence and military units - but although this movie delivers more of these than any other movie I've ever seen, I love this one. Second, I don't give a damn what Heinlein intended to tell in his original book - if I want to know what the writer has to tell, I read the book, if I want to know what the director has to tell, I watch the movie.And this movie I watched because it was made by Paul Verhoeven. I'll make it short and get to the point. The reason, why so many people obviously do not get the satirical notes of this movie, is that the satire is ""balanced"" by permanently triggering hung-ho emotions so that the viewer is led to forget the satire he or she just recognized the scene before. This technique of permanent sensual overload and distractions is exactly the same, that every fascist society uses to pull the strings of its inhabitants, to make them dull and sleepy for what really happens. Sometimes the terrible truth breaks through, but it is immediately swapped over by the latest news of some celebrities' excesses or divorces, the next best free porn on the internet or any form of social or political gossip. Verhoeven does exactly this - using this manipulative technique, so that you have the chance to realize how this manipulation really works and what it makes to YOU: your senses, your emotions, your mind. To me this is Verhoeven's finest work - a real achievement of what in Europe is known as ""enlightenment"", a way to make citizens more aware, more conscious, more ""autonom"".Starship Troopers is Verhoeven's ultimate assault on Hollywood, on Social Media, on totalitarian Societies in general - and the USA in particular. You can love it (if you appreciate freedom of mind in any way) or hate it (if you identify with systems outside of yourself) - but you just can not miss the huge ironic dimension, that this very expensive movie was financed by a system that the movie attacks with everything at its proposal. Verhoeven showed guts - something very missed in mainstream cinema today.",Starship Troopers
703,anakin_starkiller,Ken & Barbie vs. Bugs,3,3 January 2003,"Van Dien and Denise Richards are looking exactly like plastic people in Barbies Wonderland. The plot is really bad and the special effects are worse. In 1997 it had be possible to create more realistic star ships. The bugs looked ok but not exactly good. The army camp scenes where ok, and I enjoyed the acting of Clancy Brown as Career Sgt. Zim, and Michael Ironside as Lt. Jean Rasczak. Most irritably was the use of ordinary machine guns versus the giant bugs. This is a SF movie. I never read the book, and I think the use of machine guns bases on the originally story, but directors never give too much on books (look at LotR). Why did'nt they use more grenades or other heavy weapons. I give a 3 out of 10.",Starship Troopers
704,adlib_,Contemptuous Sneer at a Good Book,1,1 December 2003,"The book Starship Troopers is an unusual paean to military virtue.  It depicts an idealistic, puritanical society defended by a military with a high esprit de corps.  In  contrast, the movie depicts a cynical, sleazy society defended by troops that laugh when one of their commanding officers is killed.  An ugly movie, one of the very few I've seen bad enough to make me leave the theater before the movie ended.",Starship Troopers
705,delapluma,Still much underrated,10,3 December 2008,"In an unprecedented act of aggression, a long-time yet obscure Enemy razes your hometown to the ground, killing your family and hundreds of thousands others. The Enemy is uncivilized, powerful and obviously malign. Do you really have a choice but to escalate the conflict into a full-blown war in defense of our values and way of life?Maybe you do.The whole movie is of course a propaganda film, aiming to guide the audience into a belief that the 'utopian' (well, hardly) society is right to fight the bugs, and that it is wrong not to participate in this fight (ring any bells?). This is fully in line with Verhoeven's longstanding fascination with (military) propaganda: one of his first cinematic efforts was a film celebrating the Dutch Royal Marine Corps. It is therefore not so strange (but slightly disappointing nonetheless) that at the time of the movie's release many movie critics lambasted the movie precisely because of its seemingly unabashed celebration of fascism/Nazism.However, if the viewer takes a step back, removes the spin from the facts and 'figures things out for one's self' (to quote Ironside's character in the movie), instead of letting himself be sucked into the unfolding drama, he would for example notice that it is not so clear at all that the bugs are the real Enemy, as the news media would like us believe. What is, for example, the role in all this of the Mormon sect alluded to in a news snippet? If you drop the assumption that the bugs are the aggressors, what then motivates the actions of the government of the Federation (an outright militaristic global regime)? Why are we really fighting this savage war?Starship Troopers' ultra-violence doesn't romanticize war - quite the contrary - but the relentless propaganda and resulting hysteria seem to justify it. Whether or not you agree with this 'justification' is up to you, but Verhoeven makes it abundantly clear where he stands.This is more than just a great pro/anti-war movie however, as a browse through the many excellent IMDb reviews will testify. Verhoeven inserts many of his favorite themes here, satirizing contemporary (American) culture/society, questioning the moral superiority of the 'good guys', etc.And even if you really just want to view ST as nothing more than a '90210 in space bug-shooting gore fest', well, it aims to pleaseA subversive, prescient piece of Hollywood (!) film-making.10/10 ** Multiple viewings required! **PS: judging by the number of disgruntled Heinlein fans, if you love the book, stay away from the film",Starship Troopers

What's really great about this film, and what makes it quite unique, is how it manages to get the vast majority of the audience on side the fascists (in fact, I'd suggest we're here talking out and out Nazism rather than plain old fashioned Fascism - the clues are all there) without the audience even realising down which road they're being gently coaxed along.

With the rise of Faux News and their ceaseless pandering to the lowest common denominator, the average American is incapable of discerning the true nature of this film.It's not 'satire' - it's a cautionary portrayal of what happens to a culture that has lost its way and has been force-fed fear for half a generation. With stunning precision, it anticipated the Cheney/Rumsfeld/Bush agenda to use fear to collapse the American middle-class and create generations of cannon-fodder for the new corporate state.Look at any of Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda films.

714,howard_offtherails,One for a rainy day,5,9 February 2004,"Well, the good news is that Starship Troopers has terrific action sequences. If you like a bit of sci-fi horror, this should definitely float your boat. Soldiers get torn limb-from-limb with gay abandon, bugs explode to shower their attackers with green goo, and huge starships explode, break apart and drift in pieces through the formation. Communal unisex showers are a bonus, too - if you like a bit of softcore pornography, this should definitely bloat your boat.The movie's premise is interesting at worst, fascinating at best. Earth has united beneath a supposedly ""fascist"" (though not racist - we are presented with a fully inclusive society, at least as far as human beings are concerned) government, based in Geneva. Interstellar expansion has brought conflict with a range of diverse insectoids, and now the Mobile Infantry - the US Marines with a new name - are being sent in to win the war.The movie follows their progress, interspersed with various bits of pseudo-interactive news that give us the big picture. This is an interesting and (as far as I know) original device that really does work to give a sense of the wider setting.The characters are just what one might expect from any cod-action movie: the gung-ho type who runs straight in and gets killed, the coward who runs away and gets killed, the shouty ""I wipe my arse with thistles one a fortnight if I'm lucky"" officer type, the ace pilot, the arrogant smoothie, the heartache drama queen, the introspective one... you've seen them all before, in every crap movie ever made.It's crew cuts and c-cups all the way, I'm afraid, so this is one of those films where you have to forget about the characters and just enjoy the action sequences. Unfortunately, it's hard to empathise with cardboard cutouts, so it's hard to care for them. The battle scenes would be so much less mundane if there was any reason to like or even notice the protagonists.It's a shame that so much potential was wasted. Aside from bits of news footage and occasional scenes around Buenos Aires in the first portion of the film, we see little of the society these people are supposed to defend. Are there any poor people? Where do they live? How do they get about? Is employment a privilege or mandatory, widespread or precious? Does the government lie to the extreme left, the extreme right or somewhere in between?Videophones, dropships, miniature nukes, warp drives, yelling military types and eight-legged aliens with no visible genitals, all the proper sci-fi stuff is present and correct. But some of these clichés can be a little hard to swallow - for example, with mobile videophones on the market since 2003, are future telecommunications really to involve us standing in a corridor and talking to a plasma screen?That interactive news begins to grate after a while. The sequences get sillier and sillier as the movie goes on, and at times it feels like you're watching a sci-fi spoof, rather than the real thing. When they get too bloody, a ruddy great ""CENSORED"" sticker is slapped over the dismembered cow or whatever it is. Very silly, but not very funny.Like many films before it, Starship Troopers tries to cover too many bases at once. Is it a political allegory, an adventure or an action flick? An ensemble drama or a first-person narrative?Really, Starship Troopers is a daft B-movie with a better budget. The acting's pretty good, and the dialogue glides along without too many hiccups (it's a damn sight better than anything George Lucas ever wrote, for example). The CG sequences are a couple of years ahead of their time, too - the machinery, vehicles and other technological knick-knacks look just as good as they did in 2001's Final Fantasy.If you like your extreme violence then you'll enjoy Starship Troopers. It's of a similar level (four out of five carotids on my scale) to Saving Private Ryan, but where that movie was claustrophobic, detailed and grainy, Troopers is expansive, liberal and very, very red. There are thousands of soldiers on screen at any one time, and a good proportion of them get ripped asunder by mandibles, claws and spikes. On the other hand, if you're expecting any wit, intelligence or genuine thrills then you're in for a disappointment.The opening half-hour hints at so much more - politics, morals, strategy - than what made it into the script. If a remake is ever in the works, I'd suggest the following:1) Exchange slapstick for irony. Irony's funnier. 2) Explain. Explain characters. Explain the background. What year is it? How did we get from here to there? 3) Lose the clichés. They're neither funny nor believable. 4) Get some tension in there. Jurassic Park and Alien we both similar to parts of Starship Troopers; both were far better movies.But keep the shower scene, I mean - wow.....!",Starship Troopers
715,DistortedReviews,this movie was worth the time to watch.,8,12 August 2012,"Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoeven4 StarsThe PlotStarship Troopers is a science fiction story about Boy (Johnny Rico) learning to be a man by joining the military where he must Fight and Die. His adventure the pseudo fascist social order known as the Terran Federation promotes the fact that if you want to be successful, or even accepted in this society, then you must be a citizen, and the only way to do that is to join the military. Johnny along with his best friend Carl Jenkins, and Girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, all enlist into the military together hoping that they will see each other again after their training is over with. But unfortunately fate has decided to throw something else at them. Actually it's an asteroid, lunched by the Bugs, a large force of intelligent warrior insects that have been spreading throughout the galaxy. A classic plot for a film, at first glance you would think that it's nothing special but by the time you get settled on what's going on something else will happen to cause more problems for the Protagonists. The plot of this movie is a bunch of expected curve balls that are thrown at you but they are impossible to doge, you know they are coming but you can't do anything to stop them. The movie also has several sub themes of romance, duty, disgrace, and betrayal with the most satisfying conclusion. Starship Troopers is an adventure to escape from reality and to watch the Bugs splatter, and not to mention that it was a book first.The Cinematography At first glance it's filmed as a serious dramatic science fiction film, but it's also a very comedic movie, with every scene very properly lit. The lighting is sometimes over lit, causing the film to be almost classic B movie era style, but without that, the film would be very run down and cheesy. The sets enhance the movie and fit the style and setting of the overall look of the film. A lot of the film has moments that are considered over the top but without those scenes the film would lose its flow and the comedic relief would be lost. The Acting The acting in Starship Troopers is over the top in most instances, such as instances where the actors don't act how a normal person would expect. The entire film had the essence of a horror film but also had a lot of comedic parts that the actors played well. Some of the main actors seen in this film are Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris. The Sound The sound in Starship Troopers is well edited, the music is added as a subtle back ground without it taking up much of the sound layer. The sound effects are at perfect volume without overplaying any scenes, and all vocals are clearly heard and not covered up at any points.

And together with the quick camera, more blood, more violence and more nudity you would ever expect from a simple action movie, you fasten your seat belt and want to wait and watch more. I especially liked the unisex shower scene, where the main actors (except for Dennise Richards) take a shower together with all other soldiers.

721,berserkcrusader,Excellent movie- review contains some spoilers,9,1 March 2005,"Starship Troopers is set in the 23rd Century, in the midst of a war between the Arachnids from Klendathu and the Terran Federation centered on Earth. It's a gory movie, a Bug-hunting movie, a movie worth watching several times. Though few and far between, some scenes seem a bit choppy, including the scene involving the loss of the Rodger Young. The special effects are amazing; the Arachnids scare some other people I know who have seen the movie as much as they seem to scare cap troopers. Sound quality could be no higher, and one scene involving the death of a Bug has a unique, humorous sound to it. Almost all the acting was on par with what I expected; Shujumi had possibly the worst execution of lines out of all of them. The scene where Dizzy dies (first time a movie has done this!) actually made me feel like I knew her. All in all, the movie is worth watching several times over.",Starship Troopers

Flying Saucers, etc and I still enjoy the old ones. Starship Troopers has all the elements needed to be a successful and popular film: (1) admirable and realistic characters (2) good v. evil (3) heroes who are flesh and blood and not supermen (4) humor which isn't always intentional and (5) some of the greatest special effects I've seen in years.The evil arachnids were the best spider-monsters I've ever seen.As far as the film having a Fascist quality, I say bull. I'd like to live in a society where (1) college was free (2) military veterans were highly respected and received more rights (3) military and civilian leaders admitted their mistakes and were forced to step down and (4) where a woman could become the top leader.As far as I'm concerned, this film had no flaws.

This crap though was only surpassed in its failure by the Schwarzenegger Total Recall. The so called Mobile Infantry was neither very mobile nor was it an effective infantry. Their main maneuver seemed to be running around screaming and dying. In the book, everything was done with a purpose. Here, it was just to be able to stage carnage. Giant bugs able to target orbiting ships with their asses, really? Lame visual anus jokes. Whatever statement it was trying to make about militarism, or fascism or women in the military, it failed to make clear. The bloodbath did not rise to the level of say, Saving Private Ryan for illustrating the horrors of war. It just looked like a horror movie.",Starship Troopers
724,robinbdevlin,Starship troopers: a Maligned Classic,7,4 April 2015,"Starship troopers is one of the most maligned films of all time, panned by critics on its release, 17 years ago, they called it a ""nonstop splatterfest so devoid of taste and logic that it makes even the most brainless summer block buster look intelligent"" in the Deseret News and the New York Post called it a ""Crazed, lurid spectacle,"" as featuring ""raunchiness tailor-made for teen-age boys."" Even Roger Ebert who had lorded the social satire of Robocop said that the movie was a ""one dimensional trivial nothing pitched at 11 year old sci-fi fans."" But is that all it really is?I feel that the critics have missed the mark somewhat; Starship troopers was, and is, a searing incitement of right wing militaristic culture. Even though the film is 17 years old now (yes I feel old too RBD) the message is still as clear as a bell and that message can be summed up simply as ""War makes fascists of us all."" The movie comes out and says that violence is ""the supreme authority from which all others are derived"" and that ""Naked force has resolved more conflicts throughout history than any other factor. The contrary opinion, that violence doesn't solve anything, is wishful thinking at its worst. People who forget that always die"" these are not the words of a military recruitment officer or of a drill sergeant but the words of a teacher in a high school. The director of the film, Paul Verhoeven, (he of Robocop and Total Recall fame) is on record as saying that the film was playing with fascism and fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American culture. And one can't help but see a comparison between the gung-ho jingoism of the propaganda films and the rightwing media in the states, especially fox news. Set in the far of future where mankind has reached out to the stars and started to colonize alien planets. This rabid colonialism has provoked an otherwise peaceful race of insect-like aliens to lash out against earth, which it suddenly and quite rightly now sees as hostile. Seeing fairly obvious self-defense tactics as further gestures of aggression Humankind musters its global forces and charges headlong into a grossly outmatched interstellar war, the film uses this as a spring board for a satire on the first Gulf war but it really works for any war that the USA has fought in since the end of the second world war, with the well trained and well equipped troops of Earth representing the states and the poorly equipped and not at all trained bugs representing the Vietnamese or the Iraqis The film is loosely based on a 1959 novel of the same name by Robert A Heinlein the book was meant to be more of a political Essay than a work of pure fiction with large a large portion set in a school classroom the characters debate with there History and moral philosophy teacher(played by the awesomely understated Michael Ironside), who many consider to be speaking in Heinlein's own voice. The script itself was a totally unrelated entity called 'bug hunt at outpost nine' Paul Verhoeven admits to not being able to finish the book as he found it 'depressing and boring'. The film can also be seen as a work on 'paradise lost' with the innocents of youth replaced with the hell of war.Even by todays standard the special effects look good, partly because they used real models, it took over a year for model builders, and special effect artists boss film Sony image works and good old industrial light and magic to make the ships that you see on screen. The movie offers up a beautiful totalitarian state where all the children are beautiful wide eyed and innocent, whereas the adults by contrast are usually maimed in some way from there service. The world itself feels fully fleshed out with different types of alien fulfilling different roles put together the world feels rich and detailed, if somewhat unsettling.The movie concerns the lives of three high school friends, all of whom sign up for military service after leaving high school. Denise Richards plays Carman a high flyer who wants to pilot starships, Casper Van Dean plays Johnny Rico her boyfriend who doesn't really want to join the military but signs on to impress his girlfriend, and there mutual friend Carl, played by Neil Patrick Harris who joins up because well they never say but it is strongly implied that career choices are limited. So the three join up, Carmen goes to fleet to learn how to fly, Johnny goes into the Mobile infantry to learn how to kill and Carl goes into military intelligence to learn how to commit genocide and the film then follows John Rico's journey from being a fairly amiable high school jock hero to being a cold blooded killing machine. Our hero loses the love of his life when she decides to make a career out of being a pilot, as opposed to just fulfilling her two year service as Rico intended on doing, then an accident on the training field see him take ten lashes as punishment, his dues paid he decides to wash out and quit before he finishes his term of service and to give the fascist state in the movie its due they allow him to, that is until his hometown, Buenos Aires, is whipped of the face of the planet by a meteorite. It is then at our heroes lowest ebb that he reaches inside himself and is reborn, now a man. It is worth mentioning that there is no concrete proof that the meteorite strike was in fact an attack by the 'bugs' and could have in reality just been a random regular act of god, but the all-powerful Earth government treated it as a hostile action and used it as justification to go to war.",Starship Troopers
725,ben-70190,"The guy didn't even read 2 chapters through the book, yet claims it's about fascism.",4,3 July 2020,"I don't think I could put this better, and since I'm quite tired, I'm not going to try. So I'm gonna quote u/jailthewhale on this one:
""Perhaps the most widely misunderstood work of science fiction, Starship Troopers does not promote fascism. The film, which is what most people are probably familiar with, is hailed as a satirical critique of a fascist society that is fueled by war. This fundamental misunderstanding of the source material comes across as uninformed and intentionally misleading given that the original story (book by Robert Heinlein) espouses a radically liberal, albeit militaristic, worldview; a society based on merit and service to society where those who serve and contribute are given a voice in how society is shaped. This is not a fascist perspective.The story is, however, a scathing critique of communism (the bugs represent a communist society). Certain plot points in the movie have been interpreted in such a way that paints the Federation as the aggressor when in fact it was the bugs who made a pre-emptive strike against Earth (the meteor that wiped out Buenos Aires) and instigated the First Bug War. The Federation was then forced into action upon learning that it now faced a threat hell-bent on destroying the human race. Again, not fascist, but instead a justified retaliatory action meant to save the human race.People also often cite that civilians having to join military service was the only way to earn Citizenship and the right to vote. Another misunderstanding; civilians could also serve in any civil service/office role to fulfill this requirement. It was not mandated that they be soldiers. Again, the idea that people have to earn the right to vote and participate in the structuring of society is not an ideal rooted in fascism. These are the values of a liberal society based on merit and individual choice/freedom. No one was required to serve, but choosing to serve granted privileges that those who did not serve could not enjoy.I think these are the main examples that people use to frame this work as a promoter of fascism.""It's a 4/10 because it's fun to watch... ish.",Starship Troopers
726,peterbaugh,Entertaining but misunderstood by many,9,25 October 2015,"I like and bought this movie. I love the ""campy"" satire and how the movie makes fun of social norms which are not all bad. I know history, and I know there is propaganda during wars, and that sometimes you must fight or be destroyed. Basically this is the movie, but I like how it shows the feelings and thoughts of the young going into battle, and the older leaders that must watch all soldiers die. Did anyone notice that the men and women were treated equally? That both sexes could perform any position to fight and save the world? The first time I watched this, I thought it was OK, good action, campy. The more I watched it, the more I got the meaning and the humor. Now this is one of my favorite movies. And I hated Battle Star Galactica... however you spell it. I like Sci-Fi but not brainless non-humor Sci-Fi.

Yes it is fun, but when did this facetious overblown movie ever call upon itself to be taken with a straight face? Frankly, Starship Troopers is a terrible exercise in movie-making and it does not pretend to be otherwise.

735,Pope-3,"No plot, no character development, no realism....",6,18 September 1998,"....But that's all pretty much intentional.  This is, at first glance, the type of film in which you doom yourself to hating it by thinking even a tiny little bit.  If you just sit back and take in the shooting, the gore, the explosions (no thinking now!)....then it's a good action flick.  But wait! What's this?  Satire?  Uh oh--you made me think!  The movie does present the viewer with some interesting, if thinly veiled, satirical comments on the future world presented to the audience.  I especially enjoyed the scene where children are wrestling over an army rifle.  But now that they've got you thinking, there's not really that much else to enjoy (unless your brain is still turned off).  There is zero character development.  The only reason anyone would care about whether Dina Meyer's or Denise Richards' characters got killed/hurt or not is because they're attractive.  That's pretty much the only reason we're given to care about _anyone_ in this movie.  ""Oh, but he has nice teeth--he can't die!""  When Dizz and Rico learn that their families have been killed, they don't really even exhibit any remorse. Perhaps that's another comment on this future society--people don't really know how to show sadness.  But I think I'm giving the movie too much credit here.ST is quite effective in involving the audience with its adrenaline-pumped action scenes, and so the huge, gaping (gargantuan, mountain-sized, monstrous) holes in the story's plot (and I use the terms ""story"" and ""plot"" quite loosely here) often don't occur to us until after the movie's over. Hey, wait a sec.  How do those bugs launch glowing stuff outta their butts into space?  That's an interesting case of Darwinian evolution if I've ever seen one.  You'd think they could come up with something more effective than those dinky guns the Troopers are given (perhaps the nukes they seem so reluctant to use) to combat the HORDES of bugs rushing towards them.  But no.  Shouldn't the thousands upon thousands of bugs leave at least ONE print in the sand?  How exactly do they launch asteroids light years away, hitting their intended target exactly?  How is it that Denise Richards is stabbed through the shoulder, and yet is up and moving, hugging friends, and flashing that Colgate smile of hers at the camera just a few minutes later, not even worried about bleeding to death?  What do the bugs, on a planet that appears inhabited solely by the bugs themselves, eat?  How can those guns of the Troopers in once scene be practically unable to injure a single bug, while in the next, the same gun cuts down 20 of the same?  But this is not the movie one would go see to nit-pick.  Unless you're too cynical to avoid it (like myself), just sit back and enjoy the violence.  (Hey!  No thinking!  I saw that!)As for the bugs themselves and all the other technical wizardry it took to create such a flick--well, they're decent, but they could have been better. The bugs did look _kinda_ realistic, in that they appeared to inhabit an actual space along with the actors (again, another term I'll use loosely). But they still look too.....uh......what's the term?  Too shiny.  Too bright.  Too....happy.  Too much like they're computer generated (which, of course, they are).  Maybe I'm just biased more towards the Alien/Aliens dark horror-ish sci-fi films, but Starship Troopers just seems to take out that all-important ""mystery"" of the alien creatures.  There were slight hints of this in the scene where the flying bugs are first encountered, but it's significantly lacking elsewhere.  Again, though--that's not really what this film is about (I don't think).  It's not intended to scare, just to excite. And that it does do.  The bugs are quick (not mentally, mind you), and the pace of the film carries the viewer along with its special effects quite well.So, overall--not a great movie.  Film students will not be studying it in the future to determine how the great filmmakers do it.  But it is what it sets out to be: a light-hearted, no-brain-required, gore-galore action flick (with some nudity thrown in for those who just can't do without it).  It's a plus to note the satire with which the film is presented, and if you can ignore the holes in the story's logic, you will probably find yourself enjoying this movie.  If you're looking for plot and realism, go rent L.A. Confidential.  No, go rent L.A. Confidential anyway.",Starship Troopers

If you don't believe me then listen the commentary by Verhoeven and Neumeier.  They aimed at producing a propaganda film of the future, one that would demonstrate the vacuity of fascism by the film's own over-the-top attempts to manipulate a docile population into accepting violent solutions to all problems and by the use of media to manufacture consensus. In the wake of the latest Gulf War, the film resonates well with the direction the U.S. is taking.

Or maybe great artist just can not lie - even if his own political beliefs are quite dubious.Mankind is under some semi-Nazi, semi-Plato rule. At any rate the obsolete ideals of Freedom and democracy and respect for alien ways and habits, however bizarre and unappealing to out species they might seem, are well gone or are rather censored and silenced out.  To some viewers though the very abundant fascist symbolics itself would set the framework of reference. To some it would be just ""cool"".  For me Paul Verhoeven manages to do something difficult to believe - by the end of the movie I started to side with the Bugs.In fact, why would you side with ruthless 2-legged predators that are sending their youth to die at the other end of the Galaxy in a battle for domination of a rocky, deserted planet (or couple of them) of no apparent use for humanity? Very lame excuse, without any evidence behind it is that huge Bugs living there are somehow related to asteroids hitting Earth, hundreds of light years away.  Looks like a pure propaganda and misinformation.  Rulers of the Earth seem not to mind a couple of asteroids to actually hit the Earth, even though there is a defense system in place.

752,latheofheaven,How could they do this to one of the greatest books of all time?,1,24 October 2004,"This movie was a disappointing gore fest. Yes, the book by Robert Heinlein's contained imaginative battle scenes, but the storyline had philosophical commentary on an alien world of the future. By alien, I mean the human world. Only people who served in the military could vote, for example. We learn that Johnny Rico's father has never voted and doesn't consider it important(does that seem familiar?).We learn about a society where the parents of naughty children are whipped alongside the children.We learn a little about the world of a soldier and the hard training of boot camp (a few ant bites should never bother a soldier). We also learn about the camaraderie of soldiers and how it leads to a better fighting team.The movie contains none of this. We get bugs, blood and gore.If you're a fan of the book, watch the special edition of ""Aliens"" (James Cameron read ""Starship Troopers"" before producing this movie). IMDb provides a trivia post -- it states that actors playing Colonial Marines had to read the book (research).",Starship Troopers

754,tchie,At least the actors are decorative,2,29 December 2003,"Neither discernibly based on the Robert Heinlein book of the same title, nor effective military or science fiction, Verhoven's Starship Troopers utterly fails to capture either the substance, or feel of the controversial book. Instead, the film offers only neatly-packaged issues and mindless stereotyping painted with a cartoonish brush.Rather than try to address any of the issues brought up in the book (notably the meanings of civil service, franchise rights, and the definition of citizenship), the film attempts to be anti-military satire.   However, the desperately poor portrayal of military training and action detract from any effective anti-military effect.  In particular, he sterile production values remove any semblance of reality from the film.  Ridiculous enough to be farcical, the humor lacks the energy of farce and is tongue-in-cheek without wit or irony.Lacking the science to be science fiction, the grit to be military, or the wit to be anti-war, Verhoven's Starship Troopers uses cartoon gore and Nazi-era uniforms to show us, nothing.",Starship Troopers

757,besnode,A Perversion of Heinlein's Novel,1,20 June 1999,"This movie is beyond wretched.  It had the potential to be no more than a B-Grade Sci-fi monster movie with classy special effects, but for some reason Verhoeven decided he had to make it into a twisted version of Heinlein's excellent novel.Those who have seen the movie but not read the book may be shocked to learn that what Heinlein actually wrote was a story about a fundamentally noble human culture and the moral justifications for war against an implacable enemy.  There was none of Verhoeven's pseudo-Nazi fascism and grade-school quality propaganda in Heinlein's version.Film adaptations of books inevitably leave something of the book behind, but Verhoeven has managed to raise this to a truly dreadful art in Starship Troopers.  Virtually nothing of the book remains except some of the character names, and even most of those have been switched around (for example in the book Lieutenant Raczak was never a school teacher -- that man's name was DuBois -- and Pvt Flores was male!).  Worst of all, though, is Verhoeven's twisted version of Heinlein's philosophy: Verhoeven has literally turned the moral center of the novel completely backwards, then tacked Heinlein's name on it as though it were a legitimate portrayal of what Heinlein was really saying.  Using a man's name to legitimize what is no more than a parody of his work is simply wrong.Bottom line: It's a bad movie, made for rotten reasons, out of an otherwise great piece of literature.",Starship Troopers

In fact, the only common elements that this movie has with the book is the title.  Stunning visual effects accompany stunning crap.  This is certainly not the worst book to movie adaptation, but it is exceptional in the screen writers' complete misunderstanding of the point of the original.

It bears only the most superficial resemblance to the classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein, and proves once more that Hollywood has utter contempt for the profession of writing, whether of books or screen plays. Hollywood producers seem to believe that writing is a superfluous element in the making of films, and their disregard for its importance is obvious in movies such as this. We have seen a trend to use special effects as a crutch for weak plots and inadequate acting, but here we can add to this the defamation of the work of a deceased author.

765,oodle,Amazing satire ... don't let it fool you.,8,11 January 2000,"What happened to the time when nazis were nazis and commies were commies and you never had to concern yourself with any thought to their humanity?  It is a thought that is both nostalgic and very real today.  It is a dream for simple ideals.  This movie is about these utopian American ideals.  In short, I found this movie amazing (... but forget about any book that it is based upon).  It is an action movie with great SFX that makes is easy to enjoy on the surface and easy to stereotype, but I feel there is a bit more underneath than it gets credit for. This movie is a satirical extrapolation. It extrapolates on 50's ideals of technology and the role of technology in people's lives.  It extrapolates on the 90's unattainable dreams for perfect people and perfect relationships. (What an interesting cast, eh?) It extrapolates on WWII propaganda and the dream for a single-minded government all of its subjects trust.  It extrapolates on the perfect democracy where men and women will voluntarily face what we would consider horrific dangers and face them with pride and confidence.  A perfectly simple society in the sense that you always know what to expect and you always know who the enemy is.Don't let the obvious cliches and dumb lines fool you ... this movie breaks rules which cause movie buffs to either cringe or scratch their heads. Where other movies will show you how horrible the enemy is by focusing on the characters who are most afraid and who mentally crack (so that you, the viewer, can believe how horrible the enemy is, I suppose), in this movie the one's who crack are a minority who are tossed aside and ignored in a way. Where other movies peg specific characters as especially stupid, or ugly, or weak in order to show that the main characters are smart, beautiful, or strong; this movie instead bombards you with a whole cast who is depicted as smart, beautiful, strong ...  and confident.  Where other movies use gore to impress dark or graphic images upon the viewer's mind, this movie holds nothing back when it comes to gore but it does not affect the mind because these killing-machine bugs can only tear apart human bodies but they have no effect on the human spirit, pride, and ingenuity.  (Gore is only a vehicle for action and SFX.) There are no elements of the dark and sinister here ... this movie is dominated by daylight, well lit rooms, and openness.In my opinion, this movie is all about utopian simplicity.  Wouldn't it be great if our society could accept simple relationships with straightforward intentions?  (Never turn down a good thing.)  Wouldn't it be super if we were all beautiful and comfortable with ourselves?  (Shower, anyone?) Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could trust our leaders to teach us the important things we need to know?  (""Medic!!!"") Wouldn't it be marvelous if we had a single impersonal enemy to unite the human race?  (""Kill 'em all!"")It is about the simplicity we crave.

767,campbell.stevenson,Verhoeven sits on the fence,5,4 April 2000,"Is Verhoeven a satirist? This movie, like its predecessors Robocop and Total Recall, has elements of satire, but I think it fails because the director won't come off the fence - he's got a big budget to play with, and doesn't want to lose a big audience by testing their intelligence too much (which is a pretty cynical view of audiences but, hey, this is Hollywood). Verhoeven confines his obvious satire to the newsreels (the same technique he used in Robocop). These present the fascistic Federation in the same light as Fifties/Cold War portrayals of the US Government - and perhaps contain the idea that you should not trust what you see on film. But this is as far as his criticism goes. There is no character who puts any kind of forceful point of view against the war or its conduct. This is either very deep satire (in hiding to the point of being invisible) or a cop-out. I'm inclined to the latter view.

And really scary monsters (or 'bugs')! Yes, the computer animated monsters are actually very well made. The story is basically the classic 'good versus evil' theme, spiced up with the just as classic love story. Starship troopers isn't a film that tries to investigate how we are affected by war and our response to suffering, a la 'Full Metal Jacket'.

Criticizing Paul Verhoeven for the movies he made in the US is easy. But you must understand that America isn't a place where you can make the movie you want and he stated that he hasn't made a movie the way he wanted since he came to the US. Well he can either make these movies or do nothing at all. Starship Troopers is probably the movie where he had some degree of freedom.

773,Doc_Jargon,Travesty,3,14 April 2011,"I gave this 3 for execution of effects for the time.Robert Heinlein's novel, in spite of what ignorant civilian readers have projected onto it, was not a pro-military indictment of soft, civilian rule. The author, a veteran of World War I, recognized the merits of honorable military service, but did not glorify war or militarism. His novel was ""speculative fiction"" which is the literary equivalent of philosophical ""thought experimentation."" It is the answer to ""what if"" questions. What if society were arranged in such a way that only military veterans had a political franchise.The film was a mockery of Heinlein's thoughtful premises and conclusions, thinking it was a rebuttal to what amounted to a straw man argument. The producers of the movie set up a false understanding of what Heinlein communicated in his literary text, then burned it down with scathing parody. If what Heinlein had written actually was jingoistic, the parody would have been spot on, but since the man never indicated that he felt military service produced (or identified) superior individuals, or that he advocated the arrangement he explored, the parody only serves to mock one of the greatest minds in speculative literature.This ""crime"" of staining the memory of one of the ten best authors in the history of science fiction, and making money from debasing a valuable original work, goes even further than this, however. The movie also issues an infantile and intellectually fraudulent insult to the real military. Unoriginally stealing dialog and plot points from legitimate war stories and actual events, this movie is a middle finger in the face of every veteran who served sincerely and in good causes. The military is often misused, but that is the fault of ignorant civilians making political decisions based on media hype and poor philosophical training. The fact remains that a volunteer military is largely made up of admirable people doing difficult jobs under bad conditions, and the movie soils the record of these people.Anyone who likes this movie as any sort of protest against militarism is deeply lacking in sound information or critical reasoning.",Starship Troopers

The film cleverly uses comparisons to the Viatnam war in which the troops fight a greatly underestimated enemy and pay the price through military blunders. The 'bug holes' are similar to foxholes and in the film it is interesting to note that everyone in the world seems to be American from Geneva to Buenos Aires. A prediction of things to come?

Minor points in the movie do reference the book such as the attack on Buenos Airies, and the names of some of the characters. Paul Verhoven himself said that he never finished the book, he probably never passed basic training in the book. I'm not asking for a complete faithful rendition of the book, that would be too much to ask of Hollywood, however I do ask that they get it somewhat close.

The movie is supposed to be a parady of a violent society and does a very poor and obvious job of sending this message. The plot line is somewhat pridictable and doesn't have any great twists or turns in it.The movie is also just plain stupid, the soldiers are armed with assault rifles and travel on foot while battling giant insects, they run in a mob and then just stand up in a line, completely exposed, and start fireing into the ranks of insects, after a while of this some random soldier yells retreat and the order is followed, the soldiers run away in the same mob fashion. Lets think about this, if you are battling giant insects wouldn't a tank be better then a foot soldier? Their is no artillery, no armour, no heavy weapons, no air support, the soldiers simply run around as one big mob. A child playing Command and Conquer on his PC knows more about military tactics then the person who wrote this script.I give this movie a 1 because it has a horrible plot, horrible actors and is a poorly written film.

Starship Troopers is one of the better sci-fi films out there, and I can't say I didn't enjoy it. The main draw for me was the believability of the world created by this film. I'm not saying that I'm expecting the future to be like this, only that I could see this world existing and didn't spend the whole time snorting and saying ""Yea right"".The characters and acting on the whole remains one of this film's strong points.Casper Van Dien came across as a little wooden at times, but the rest of the cast came off well, especially Dina Meyer as the spurned and long-suffering Dizzy Flores. The characters came across as very real for this world, including my favorite the grizzled old Centurion-like Lt. Jean Rasczak (played by Michael Ironside).So on whole a pretty good sci-fi action movie.

But for God's sake, if you claim to be telling the same story, TELL THE SAME STORY.This movie, on its own, may have its merits-- but should have been made without any association to the book it was supposedly based on.

784,pennlewis,Why did they make this movie? (Other than the $$),2,20 April 2001,"Let me start by saying that Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers is still considered the original model for all hard sci-fi warfare stuff. (Just read a few jacket covers in the Sci-Fi section at your bookstore and you'll see what I mean.) It was ground-breaking for its time and still stands head and heels above most in the genre.  The book is a combination ""coming of age"" and ""why we fight"" novel and, in addition to the action sequences (which start page one) there are several philosophical passages concerning when and why we should fight and what being a ""citizen"" means. Read it.Now, the movie called Starship Troopers has none of this, except for the action.  All of the characters have been re-written and given different motivations and abilities.   Casting was bizarre (Johnny Rico is a dark latino sort(as I remember the novel), the nudity (while nice)  was gratuitous. Though the film attempts to portray women in a more modern light it fails - in Heinlein's novel they are actually superior in some ways, just not physical ""grunt"" stuff.As to the technology depicted - I can't believe that hollywood is not up to a portrayal of the type of technologically-intense warfare depicted by the book.  The armored combat suits are key to the novel and influence all of the strategy behind the warfare depicted.  The movie assures us that hundreds of years in the future, with apparently faster-than-light drive, we still send men and women into combat armed only with rifles (and with no ground transport to boot!)!  Ridiculous!The acting is stilted and boring with one or two exceptions - the plot is full of holes (not true of the source material) - though these things don't surprise me given the director's track record.The director obviously doesn't like the message of the original novel, seeing Heinlein's society as a fascist one - to the point of giving the officers Nazi style outfits. (So again - why make a movie out of this novel?)  As to my original question - why did they make this movie - I guess to offend anyone who's read the book.  Why not just call it - ""Kill the Bugs!"" Because thats really the only similarity between the movie and the book (besides a few plot points).In short, despite the decent special effects (just decent, though)this film is among the worst contemporary adaptations of a science-fiction novel ever made.

The movie will not get critics' acclaim, but it was one of the best past-time back in 1997.There are similar titles like ender's game which is deeper in plot and everything, but my taste is that bug movies is at its best if it is just an eye-candy.This movie came out after Blizzard launched its master piece starcraft, I was not aware of the book, and then thought the movie was based on the game. :p",Starship Troopers

A non sci-fi fan may view it as a typical lasers and aliens flick.  Both assessments only scratch the surface.I've read the book, and I recommend anyone who has seen this film do the same.  The book was written in a different era, and the comparisons of the politics in the book, with those of the film are remarkable.  Indeed, it appears to me that the filmmakers purposely made a visual statement in the movie that matched what a reader of the book would have expected- the patriotic bugkillers, the military bonding.  Yet, the movie throws the whole propaganda of the book on its head, subtly I think.  And that's its brilliance.  It pokes fun at its entire message.  Not to mention it does so with exciting lasers, cool aliens (and pretty decent, and just plain pretty actors and actresses).If this all doesn't make sense, watch the movie and read the book.  It'll be worth the effort.",Starship Troopers

It has great action and wonderful effects, but at its heart is a WW2 movie transplanted into the future.  Paul Verhoven chose to use his director's chair to make a movie ridiculing Militarism and fascism.  He also parodies the racist propaganda films and newsreels that are made to whip up hysteria against your enemy.

I also read the book, quite different, not to say a completely different breed, and I loved it too! But this post is a correction to that of John Thompson, from St Louis Mo. Heinlein makes the character Johnny Rico be from Buenos Aires, Argentina (which happens to be where I live, hey!), that's in the book, that's on the film. Rico is not from, nor does he ever come close to, the Phillipines, like you say. When the bug asteroid hits Buenos Aires on the movie, there's a TV report that shows where it is located, to the south of south America. No, it is never said, neither on the book nor on the film, that Buenos Aires is in Argentina, but just looking at the map should be enough. And so, being Johnny Rico an Argentinian, a country that has had a lot of European immigration, he may very well look like Casper Van Dien.Of course there are mistakes on the film! I won't say there aren't, but that wasn't one of them. Let me tell you where the mistake is in that part, if you watch the film, the part where they show Rico's house, you'll notice it is placed on a hilly, desert-like area, whereas Buenos Aires is located in the middle of a huge fertile plain!

Said farce is not, however, terribly well written. Verhoeven masterfully blends one visual effect into another... but missed the point of the novel completely, ignored the allegory so profound in the novel, and has openly mocked the novel... and the movie falls far short because the obvious mockery is neither funny nor effective.I don't mind the mixing of genders, but it really blows the point of homo-eroticism being part of the soldier's bond to other soldiers; straight from Sparta to the future. The setting of the novel is only bordering on fascism; the movie implies that democracy has fallen to fascism already; yet another disconnect.The lack of helmets is another failing. The MI are supposed to be fighting on inhospitable worlds, throwing tac-nukes; Verhoeven can't even keep that much in place.Despite all these flaws, I have seen the movie more than 5 times, and enjoy the eye-candy it provides. Sadly, that's all that it provides, as Verhoeven's agenda isn't even well put forth; I got that it was anti-soldier right off... but other than that, his attempted satire was a complete flop.",Starship Troopers

I understand what the director is trying to achieve and I appreciate the underlying cynicism of the overly simplistic story. The point is Verhoeven did a major disservice to an exceptional novel written by one of the great science fiction writers of our time and for this he cannot be forgiven. Apart from that of course the movie itself sucks too. One of the commentators asks, ""How to explain the poor showing of this movie at the box office?"", I'll do it for you; Poor acting + Poor script = Crappy movie.

802,rabbibw,Yeeeeeeeccccccccchhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,30 March 2004,"This, to say the least, was a complete and total disappointment. Heinlein's novel--which this movie was supposedly based on--is one of Heinlein's best. Like many of his other books, including ""Have Spacesuit, Will Travel,"" ""Starship Jones,"" ""The Rolling Stones,"" it is a coming-of-age novel; it's the story of Juan Rico, a high school kid who decides to join the military as soon as he turns 18.  As the novel progresses, we get to watch the character grow and change as he confronts the horrors of combat as well as personal catastrophes:  the loss of close friends, the death of his mother.In addition, though, this novel is also about the human race.  Once again, as in some of Heinlein's other books, this is also a work of political philosophy.  In this case, it's how the human race developed a truly rational moral philosophy, how society changed as a result, and how that philosophy affects the lives of the people living in that time.  It also addresses the question of how the human race will fight and ultimately win its first war against a truly alien enemey.The movie completely ruined all this.  It turned this book into yet another special-effects festival, with lots of blood, gore, and death, following a bunch of future teenagers having the same kind of fun killing bugs as they would at a high school football game.I have no doubt that the author will find a way to come back and haunt the producers, writers, and director of this drek fest for the rest of their natural lives.",Starship Troopers

804,larndts,The most misunderstood movie of the 90's,10,25 March 2004,"Starship Troopers by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven is probably one of the most misunderstood movies of the 90's. This highly satirical, sci-fi actioneer deals about a group of teens from Buenos Aires who join the army when earth is threatened by giant alien insects. The movie follows their adventures from bootcamp into battle.On the surface the movie might come across as shallow. Some even find the fascist undertones of the movie offensive. These people clearly didn't get the satirical aspects of the movie. Like in RoboCop, Verhoeven uses commercial breaks between acts to give us glimpses of this fascist future society while at the same time ridiculing it. It also shows us the folly of war as we see thousand of troopers fighting a ground battle with insects far more powerful than them. It's stupid, but then again war is inherently stupid as this movie clearly demonstrates.But for those who don't notice or care for these satirical messages, a superbly made action movie remains. The special effects in this movie are superb featuring huge space battles with enormous aircraft carriers and ground battles with hundreds of bugs. Effects on this scale had never been seen before in a movie and to this day these scenes remain impressive and jaw-dropping. The score by Basil Poledouris is bombastic and suits the movie perfectly. And say what you like about Paul Verhoeven but the man knows how to direct a movie, especially one filled with special effects.

It seems like Verhoeven is right in his satire beyond what i expected... this is so symptomatic in fact...So, *SPOILERS* - of course the extensive use of fascist (or even nazi) emblems is done on purpose, - of course the only good character (Flores, who is also the only student opposing the teacher M.Ironside in the classroom) has to meet a cruel death, - of course it is the human the aggressor, and not the bugs, - of course buenos aires looks like L.A. and people play football there,of course the world's capital is Geneva (ever heard of Societe Des Nations, later to become United Nations ?) and the parliament hall looks like Hitler's reichstag, - of course all we know about planet earth is through silly media cnn-like cuts, since all we talk about here is a military fascist society whose values are uniformization of its people, and the destruction of anything different.This is a true B-Movie style gem, with a fierce satire of contemporary US society, with on top of the cake the amazing special-effects-cherry. i give it a 9/10.",Starship Troopers

808,dreaming15,Why be provoked?,3,1 May 2008,"It's a bad movie. And it's a bad action movie. When i watched it, i got bored, especially with all the actors who either couldn't, or was told not to display any range of feeling. I can't tell which. Parents and family dying: No feeling, but I do feel a bit compelled to kill the bugs, even though i'm not sad. Being dumped by girlfriend: So what, eventually i will get together with the girl who loved me all along. I did get stunned by the bad acting, but it didn't provoke me. Who could actually expect a movie with Denise Richards to be filled with good actors?After 30 minutes they had lost my interest completely. But a while after that they started shooting bugs. Like many others i am quite amazed at the lack of advanced weapons. But it's action, lets accept it. Problem was that after a while i got tired of the bug killing too. It was to much and to pointless. After the third shooting i got it: IT IS A LOT OF BUGS. So many that hand-held weapons at three meters distance is incredibly stupid. Well. Somhow the guy with the square face dies, but is patched together again. I don't really see why they couldn't use this technology on the dead army girl who is in love with square jaw, but i don't really care either. More bugs get killed. Denise has trouble in her spaceship and has to be saved. La-la-la. I can't really remember at what point i stopped watching. The movie ended up as background noise and picture while doing other things.When reading all the other reviews i am stunned by the praise for this movie, and people saying it's a satire or parody. It's just not good enough to be either. I can see some of the points, the news-clips is kind of funny and satirical, but that's about it. Most of all its a boring movie. And complaining about to much blood and gore and to much nudity... Well. Honestly. The sex-scene was incredibly boring, and the shower thing was different, but hardly provoking. The blood and body parts. Green and red slime doesn't really scare me after having seen more than one action movie. You had to know you were not about to watch My little pony.

810,ajbweiner,Post-modern pamphlet,10,4 July 2008,"A remarkable film. As many have pointed out, an excellent satire.I want to respond to criticisms point by point.Shallow, mindless crappy formulaic Hollywood action-flick? ... actually I'm not even going to bother responding to this one.Weak Science Fiction? Verhoeven uses science-fiction as a method for projecting current social trends into extremes. It's a form of reductio ad absurdum. ""See what happens if this ideology takes over"". Those who believe that ""real"" science fiction is only hard science fiction (i.e. effectively fiction about science) are completely disregarding much of the potential of the genre. Furthermore - I firmly believe that the scientific ""mistakes"" are entirely intentional. The film is full of absurdities (e.g. the bugs are considered to have intentionally launched an asteroid from the other side of the galaxy to hit Earth. The mathematical genius required to calculate such a launch, not to mention the faster than light travel, clearly imply very high intelligence, yet the bugs are still considered unintelligent). There are many such examples - resolving these problems, whilst not always impossible (in this case, e.g., maybe the rulers knew the bugs were intelligent and actually meant for the initial invasion to be a disaster for propaganda reasons - maintaining social cohesion of the ""federation"" must be a difficult task - having a truly feared and despised enemy is an effective force for controlling one's people, etc.), is missing the point I think. This is a truly post-modern film, and consciously so. The vehicle is ""the standard American action movie"". I think considering it a mere parody of the genre is too limited. Verhoeven is using the genre not just to mock it but because this kind of film derives and culminates directly from the kind of ideological premises he is criticising.Fails to copy the book? Yes - yes it does. Is that a problem? I mean, if you like the book, fine - but did you really go to see the film because you were too lazy to read the book again? Verhoeven's adaptation of the book is a ""cover"", if you like - and like any self-respecting artist, he is bringing to the work being covered his own perspective. Consider the Sex Pistols' 'God save the queen', or 'I did it my way'. Those are valid covers (ok 'God save the queen' perhaps doesn't exactly qualify as a cover, but it also refers to what it is criticising by sharing its title with its target). The Cohen brothers' adaptation of 'No country for old men' is also a valid cover - you don't have to be critical of the original for your version to be valid - but you do have to make the song your own. The Heinlein is chosen for the same reasons as Verhoeven chose the standard Hollywood action movie: they exemplify the ideology that he despises, that he is warning us against. It's not surprising, of course, that the people who watched the film because they loved the book found the film unappealing: the ideology of the book is satirised and condemned, much of the content is ignored (because irrelevant to the point being made), etc. Imagine the reaction of a British royalist who bought ""God Save the Queen"" having looked no further than the title.The acting sucks? Well of course it does - frankly, if Verhoeven had hired the best actors/actresses in the world to perform these roles, he would have had to brief them to act just as VanDien and Richards do, and I doubt they would have done it as convincingly as the real thing. In a sense, Verhoeven is like Ken Loach  he has people play themselves. The roles are of and by cliché wooden pretty soap actors and actresses. No depth of character may be allowed to slip out. The whole film is staged to perfection to be a standard Hollywood action/teen highschool movie.Those who complain that the characters aren't likable and that therefore they didn't like the movie may have a point, in a twisted sort of way. I think it was Verhoeven's intention to make the characters likable at the surface level: at the level of the action-flick, we root for them. If having characters to root for is a primary concern when watching a film, then you're probably not looking for much in the way of depth of artistry - so if you didn't like the characters it would imply that Verhoeven failed. Personally I disagree: I think that at the immersion level we do root for the heroes - particularly VanDien. Richards' character is superficially ambiguous and at the immersion level we are meant to mistrust her. The simplistic techniques used to bring about these shallow characterisations are deliberately so. The utopian culmination of the ideology Verhoeven rejects would be a world in which these stereotypical ideal cut-out characters were real. Inversely, if this formulaic hollywoodian image of the world were real, we would drift inexorably towards the dominance of such ideology.It's a bad satire? I'd really need you to give some examples of good satire - and I'd still not be satisfied. There are numerous ways to satirise - but the classic approach (exemplified by Swift in his 'Modest Proposal' I think)is to produce a work which mirrors the style of the people you are criticising whilst exaggerating their content sufficiently subtly that a naive reader/viewer could mistake it for the real thing. This is exactly the case for Starship Troopers. He is satirising bad movies, right-wing ideology and propaganda and has been accused of making a bad movie that is propaganda for right-wing ideology. (I laugh at these sorts of critics as I laugh at the people who condemned Swift's 'Modest Proposal', or the Bonsai Kitten website. Fools, but thanks for your unwitting support).",Starship Troopers

812,bva-70,theme of movie vs book,2,28 September 2002,"I've read some of the comments by others and I have a few things to say myself.
First off: the file stank.  I was very excited to see it, based on the title and having read the book, so I dragged a few friends to the theater.  I was never again allowed to choose a movie for the group.The film stank for me because I had read the book.  If you hated this movie because of its thematic content, then I can honestly suggest you read the book because the book is very good and has exactly the opposite theme.The film stank for my friends because they like interesting movies with one or more of the following: a good plot, good acting, good character development, or a good visual show.  This movie didn't quite cut it in these categories, although it makes the highest marks in the visual show. It wasn't to our taste, but it is pretty good raw action.The movie has a facist theme, and emphasizes the homogenaity of a society brainwashed by censured news bites. The society makes a mockery of free choice and liberty, and displays no value for human life or suffering, and the characters show no growth, nor growth potential.  Some commentators have suggested that the movie is an attempt at satire.  If so, it is extremely heavy-handed without the subtlety required for satire.
The book celebrates democracy, liberty, individuality, diversity, and free choice, in peacetime first; then wartime.  The central character, Johnney Rico, starts off as a clueless high school senior.  As the story continues, his character evolves as a result of his choices (primarily) and events (secondarily) and he becomes an adult, ultimately earning his father's respect.  The book is an intelectually challenging and serious work.
I did not have a problem with some of the anachronisms that another commentator did, while I did agree with every other criticism.  The book was sci-fi from a previous generation (first published in 1959) and the vision of the future was very different then.  For example, in the book there are no electronic computers, so in order to pilot an orbiting spaceship, a detailed flight plan must be calculated by hand in advance.  With the help of a sliderule, of course, which is how it is even possible.You might ask why the butcher who took the book and made the screenplay didn't update the weapons anachronisms (since they took care of the computer anachronisms).  I can't defend it, even though it doesn't offend me.  But hey! there's plenty in this movie to offend everyone!",Starship Troopers

It manages to divide pretty cleanly as first half plot, second half war, and as far as your average watcher will go (I.E. not some *whole world is about star trek/LOTR/My religion* ist) it manages to create some pretty cool action, and as far as I'm concerned did its best to keep morals and justifications out of the relative range where it is questionable.Almost all the people I know have a copy of some of the lord of the rings, but bar your first viewing has anyone (certain stereotypes excluded) done much more than flick to a big battle. Little to understand, lots to watch.If viewed this way, as the head of unquestioned unplotted war genre, it is quite good, a decent amount of graphic violence, without being to chilling, an awesome amount of ammunition spent, and even by todays flawless standards, pretty decent CGI.an optimistic 9/10",Starship Troopers

817,slackblast,I can't tell if the director missed to point or satyrized it,6,27 August 2008,"One of Heinlein's masterpieces, Starship Troopers was a complex novel that focused on the morality of violence and militarism. In the novel the society was democratic and free to the core, but only ex-servicemen could vote. The mobile infantry and military were dedicated, professional, and absurdly moralistic. The book made you think hard about when it is and is not okay to use violence.The movie is only tangentially related to the book. Sure the names are the same, and so is the general story arc. But everything from Rico's character, to Zim, to the MI was twisted and distorted. (MI in the novel had massive powered armor and could move kilometers in a single jump) It's hard to tell if the director either totally missed the point of the novel or understood it so completely he decided to parody it. Based on how little the movie seemed to focus on the inherent morality of violence and militarism, and instead chose to just parody it, it seems like he missed the idea.Still an enjoyable movie.",Starship Troopers

""Starship Troopers"" the movie belongs on Mystery Science Theater 3000. They take a very minor character (Dizzy), changes the gender (him to her) and elevates her to an important character. Other characters are greatly cut back on or eliminated all together (Johnny's dad appears later in the book, and the History and Moral Philosophy teacher is changed to being Lt. Razack). Massive parts (Johnny going to officer academy), are cut. Also, the armament of the troopers is greatly diminished (from Power Armor with very big guns and a hand flamer to utterly useless armor and basically a SAW with a Shotgun on the bottom). Skip the movie, read the book instead.",Starship Troopers
819,azuzuru,Amazing style and wit,8,17 December 2006,"This film had incredible style and sophisticated wit. I've never seen anything like it. Soft porn stars fighting giant bugs in co-ed battle teams, with a background of very smart fascist satire. Oh, and Denise Richards being a most delicious space babe.I'm a big fan of the book, and I thought the movie more or less stayed faithful to the book's principles. Fascism is shown, but so is the""service means citizenship"" belief system. In the book, Heinlein asks interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between the individual and the state, and the obligations of each to the other. ""Starship Troopers"" society in the book is a democracy, but only people who have endured the brutal hardships of military service are allowed to vote -- others are granted rights but have no say in government. The movie sort of addresses these issues in oblique references to ""service guarantees citizenship,"" but most casual moviegoers probably didn't get it. Also, the movie puts a biting satire on the most fascist elements of the society -- showing the kids ""doing their part"" by stomping insects and the mother hysterically clapping and urging them along. Although the satire wasn't in the book, I liked it. It showed how totalitarian societies whip up the populace to believe anything, and totally go off the deep end. It happened in 1930s Germany, and it can happen today.",Starship Troopers
820,Koondog92,Worst Movie Ever.,1,15 September 2010,"There is no question that movies rarely hold their own compared to the books that they are based on, but this one is a travesty. I simply can not understand why they bothered to name this movie Starship Troopers...it has virtually NOTHING to do with the book. Written in 1959, the book is a masterpiece exploring culture, philosophy, and the preconceived notions of our powers that be, couching the whole thing in the realm of an interstellar war with truly visionary weaponry and technologies. The book reads like it was written in the last couple of years, and is filled with action tempered with humour and thought provoking examinations of why we believe what we do about justice and peace. The movie is none of this. One of the main stories of the book is the battle armour worn by the MI, completely absent in every detail in the movie. Heck, one of the main characters in the movie dies in the first chapter of the book and is never mentioned again. Essentially, the screenplay borrowed the name of the book and the names of some of it's characters, and that is it.So forgetting what an amazing travesty this movie is compared to the novel, how does it stand up on its own? This can be answered in one word: poorly. The acting is sad, the characters have no edge or depth at all, there is little plot development and nothing to engage the viewer beyond some T&A and bit of gun play. Michael Ironside is the only redeeming feature of the film, because he is by definition rough and tough, which is what you expect to see in military veterans...Van Dien can't pull off tough to save his well manicured life.Do yourself a favour. Put down the remote, and pick up a copy of Heinlein's Starship Troopers. You won't regret it. You might regret ever having watched this movie, though...",Starship Troopers

By itself it is a mediocre B-movie sci-fi flick that is fun to watch, but it misses the whole point and frankly PV is a fool for giving this movie the name Starship Troopers. It steals only the most vague parts of the book and leaves out everything that mattered. As far as movies based on books go, this is one of the very very worst, most far-from-intentions film ever made. For those who like minor spoilers! In the book Dizzy was a man, Du Bois is the name of the teacher that became Rasczak in the movie, and Carmen was no one's girl. Read the book if you want to get the real story. Read it two or more times to better understand the point. After all, even PV admitted that he only got though a couple of chapters then quit.

825,jvindal,A waste of time if one expects something faithful to Heinlein's book,1,3 April 2010,"I am not sure what in the world the Heinlien estate was thinking by allowing this movie to call itself ""Starship Troopers"". All I can figure is that someone (Heinlien's wife?) was more interested in earning a few bucks instead of preserving the spirit of original book itself. Yes, movies often stray from the original novel, but this movie makes a mockery of the book.One important difference that most people miss is that in the book, citizenship was not dependent on military service--it was dependent on national service. In the book, people are assigned to serve where they can best be used, and no one is turned away who wants to serve. This concept is one that many on both sides of the political aisle have embraced. This is turned into something ugly in the movie, with militaristic jingoism instead of what Heinlien was trying to portray.I guess I was too dense to see the satire the first time I saw this movie ten years ago. I just thought it was a bad movie which butchered the original work. Now that I have seen the comments here, I know that the director and producer maliciously and purposely butchered the work to support a political agenda. Either way, it is still a horrible movie with an unrealistic portrayal of war, inclusions of sex and violence to titillate the juvenile in most people, and a distortion of why a just society may find itself forced to defend itself.",Starship Troopers

Since they made no effort to make the plot anything like the book, why couldn't they spend some time on the awesome technology? What's the real difference between the landings in ""Starship Troopers"" and the landing on the beach at the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan""? None! It's just soldiers, gripping their rifles and storming out of the vessel, screaming. In the book it's a very different thing.

836,dan-l-porter,Good movie; Atrocious film adaptation,8,11 July 2012,"Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 book Starship Troopers had a massive impact on science fiction. It's a staple of Military Sci-Fi and created the rather beloved group of warriors - The Mobile Infantry ""Marauders"" - that has inspired very many popular series like Warhammer 40,000 and the Halo video game series with their use of iconic armor. The 'Power Armor' as it is called and the massive equipment was a large part of the atmosphere of the story, the soldiers being equipped with enough hardware to be able to drop into a battlezone with numbers in the dozens and take on a whole army with the usage of tactical nukes, armor-mounted jump-jets and extreme strength. This power armor, integral to the original story, was completely disregarded and changes the whole tone of the film.I do like this film, and It's a favorite ""mindless action"" film of mine because of the Zulu-Esque onslaught of alien nasties that is used in many science fiction stories and many feel never gets old and the general art and uniforms and equipment of the MI soldiers is very cool indeed. But they completely leave out the Marauders until the 3rd film in the series (in short: Don't subject yourself to it. Second one either). Why? It's very frustrating to me that they left that out. And when they finally decided to put it in two movies later, it was extremely lackluster. There are several other small things that are disregarded as well, like the fact that Rico's full name is ""Juan 'Johnny' Rico"" and he is, in fact, Hispanic as his name and home suggests.I suppose my biggest qualm is that with the misappropriation of the ""Starship Troopers"" name, and I will be a bit biased and snooty about this, but that's a very large point to me. The movie is fun, and the action sequences and effects are great. It has a few completely idiotic moments in it, but it's still a fun ride, stuffed to the rim with mindless violence that is somewhat tastefully done at times, albeit very grizzly. If you want to get some friends together to watch a cheesy ""sci-fi"" action film to just have some fun with and not watch a film that deals with much more Sci-Fi than ""Aliens"" and ""Spaceships"" or emotions than ""Kill the bad guys F*** yeah we're number one"", this is your film.

However, they frequently leave out that, despite cheese, a movie can be immensely entertaining and this movie is in that category with me.

It's fun and so what if it's predictable as I already know how it's going to turn out when I re-watch it anyway. In fact, it's now 2012 and the next thing we'll be doing after finishing this review is to watch it again.Something like ""8 1/2"" is worthy of reviewing but it's not a movie one watches to be entertained.

Heinlein takes us into a world where civic duty and honor are tantamount to citizenship and respect.

While controversial it is interesting how many antiwar liberals say this today when talking about the Iraq war. When Michael Moore falsely said in his lying propaganda movie Fahrenheit 9-11 that no member of Congress sent their kids to be sacrificed in Iraq ( which was not true like a lot of things Michael Moore said) he was implying that only people who were in the military should have a vote.Yet these same peacenik, hippie, liberals don't like the military.The film also makes the point that it is a lie to say war doesn't solve anything. It shows how some are willing to make sacrifices for others and how those in the military know the difference between accepting the responsibilities for the welfare of society and those like Johnnie's parents enjoy the wine and cheese while letting others do the heavy lifting.The only criticisms is that too much of the violence was gratuitive as were the nude scenes.

(The government of the novel is, for example, not fascistic, nor is propaganda used to sway public opinion. In fact, questioning authority and tradition, through fact gathering and analysis, is a requirement for becoming an officer in the Federation's military.)I don't mind Verhoeven making points of his own, but I detest him abusing a classic work of literature. I've seen comments saying that ""perhaps it wasn't close enough to the book.""

There is nothing that the government can do wrong, and all the soldiers portrayed in the film are not citizens of earth; rather, citizenship has been revoked as a basic human right and transformed into a privilege that must be earned. However, there is no criticism of this amongst the film's characters. In fact, they also buy into the notion that it must be earned.Secondly, regard the equally one-dimensional antagonists in the film, known as bugs. They are as evil as the soldiers are good, showing no remorse for the enemy, as well as little compassion for anything else. Their only concern is the killing off of humans, and this is done in a most sadistic fashion.Thirdly, no gray, moral quandaries are explored. No alternatives are posed, no history leading to the current events is presented. It's kill or be killed. The good can do little wrong, and the evil in the film is absolute.Finally, regard the audience watching the film. Is this just your typical American teenager looking to watch a cool sci-fi action film? Or is this really a slick propaganda piece meant to be watched by the non-citizen of Earth? Therein lies the brilliance of Verhoeven's film. It's the type of film that could only be created by the Hollywood machine, a self-reflective criticism of an industry that has typically produced films that were so biased, they could be considered propaganda.

849,ubay,"Basically, some barbaric intelligent primitive aliens decide to attack Planet Earth...to war, people!",2,25 December 2005,"Some might say this film is good for this reason and that reason, but the truth is that this is not a very exciting film. It is too violent, over the top, and as a result very boring. If you want war films, check out something like Saving Private Ryan - but do not waste your money on this rubbish. The graphics are just sick (who thought these ideas up?! UGH!) and although some props and effects may be cool, and the plot may be quite interesting, overall this film is just disgusting and somewhat stupid. My brother got it two times: first time I felt disgusted and bored, the second time I told him where he could put it. Luckily he didn't rent this, he only borrowed it from the library ;) If anyone disagrees, that's up to you and is perfectly natural, and you are entitled to it.",Starship Troopers
850,SamiHussain,They sucked our brains out....and it was good.,10,21 February 2005,"Perhaps nine out of ten of you will recoil in disgust even at the name of the movie, before you've even cracked open its ectoplasmic shell and gorged on the space goo inside...shame on you. Whilst the cast is a bizarre troupe of shambolic non-actors, (save for Ironside), and whilst the story seems to have rolled out of the mind of a toddler playing Spaceships and Aliens, Starship Troopers is perhaps one of the most engaging, outrageously entertaining pieces of cinematic history I have come across. Screenplaywright Neumeier takes Heinlein's somewhat obscure and simplistic model of ""alien-threat-mankind-doomed-war-ensues"" and moulds it into a deeply, deeply dark comedy. Credit where credit is due, Verhoeven has captured and then gifted us with shockingly surreal scenes that stun and catch us off guard. It is not often one can boast a film that sees a soldier-cum-reporter describing mid-battle the ""ugly, bug planet"" only to get ripped in half by a ten foot arachnid whilst his cameraman continues capturing every gory second. The boot camp process is dealt with an unnervingly brutal efficiency, without losing an ounce of the blackly comic introduction to the later, and equally blunt settings. The defence of the Fort is a brilliantly defiant yet hopeless stand, and the settings of an alien planet appealing to both that hung-ho, Chuck Norris-esquire persona, and the childhood nightmare, Tim Burton-esquire fear that run though us all. The gore and violence intertwines perfectly with a comic love-square, in a surreal tribute to man's competition against one another. Such violence is bewildering yet strangely enchanting, and I found myself drawn into the film as a result. Akin to the hopelessly adolescent antics of the Japanese class in the Battle Royale series, Starship Troopers strength lies within its availability to be one of the most startlingly blunt films ever. It doesn't demand a deep concentration in order to engage with it, but it commands an interest that leaves you feeling bizarrely battered, but nonetheless entertained. Who can resist immortal lines such as ""They sucked his brains out!"", ""Fire 'em up...give 'em all you've got!"" and Rico's bitter scream of ""DIZZY LOOK OUT!"" as an arachnid forklifts her? I challenge you to sit down, kick off those dancing shoes, and enjoy a film made for one purpose.",Starship Troopers
851,honsou,Military sci-fi at its cinematic best,10,26 February 2005,"On one level this is a pure action flick at its best. Amazing effects, mindless violence by the tanker-load and the good-guy gets the girl. Nothing more to say, really.However, this isn't a pure sci-fi action film; this is military sci-fi in all its fascist glory. Guns, warriors, alien scum and pretty explosions rendered in a disciplined manner. I wouldn't call it tongue-in-cheek, its too hardened for that. I wouldn't call the satire in your face or subtle; its more... subliminal. Sublety by another name perhaps. I don't read so far into films as others do; maybe I'm right for it, maybe I'm not. You just cant get it so wrong. Certainly people spend less time actually reviewing films.Uncharacterized enemies, a one sided view the situation, rampant jingoism, those are the trademarks of militarism. This film catches them well in a futuristic setting. A little slow to start but still enjoyable, with just the right sense of innocence and its loss, replaced with the hardened edge that invariably lies within success. When the action finally gets going, it really gets going. The effects are stunning for 1996 when they were made, and even 10 years on they'll still be impressive. I thought Casper van Dien was more impressive than the film really shows; certainly the screen test on the DVD seemed to show a greater depth IMO. Denise Richards was a little too wide smile for the film, but Dina Meyer pulled off the 'chick with a gun' more convincingly than any other woman I've seen on film (they always seem uncomfortable with it, but Meyer carried herself naturally). Her character was pretty good too ;-) . Clancy Brown clearly enjoyed himself, hamming up the stereotypical drill-instructor pleasingly, and Michael Ironside was wonderful as the hard-nosed and competent Leiutenant. The cheesiness beloved of action films was there but it never became too cheesy to detract from the work (unlike say 2004's King Arthur). Another thing that takes this to the level of military sci-fi.Basically, brilliant. As clever as the others here say, depending on the level you watch it, but maybe not subtle in the way some like to think. If you want a working definition of the military sci-fi I've been harping on about, this the one i refer you too. I just wish there were more examples like this.",Starship Troopers

Yes it is great for the symbolism and the comparisons to right wing governments and the suffocation of the individual under the pressure of media control and all the pretentious factors that I DEMAND a film have to score more than a 5. But the high brow aside it has huge spaceships crashing into balls of flame, giant man eating spiders ripping people limb from limb, razor sharp humour, a cool sound track, an easy to follow story line, it is populated with beautiful people who are introduced, get naked then despatched in fountains of blood, there is even a lame love story for the girl friend.

While the movie does see a feminist future, it also sees militarism as the normal state of the future without any moral message to the film. If people create a movie without knowing the intelligence of their viewers then they shouldn't have bothered. The other scenario is that they just made a nice, little, nazi indoctrination film disguised as a sci-fi. I tend to believe the second scenario.

855,jcjanko,Poor Propaganda,1,15 October 2005,"This movie is horrendous. Gee, could the writer be trying to parallel the human race in this movie with America today? The propaganda and even uniforms are reminiscent of Nazi Germany, but we know exactly who the writer is bashing. This is proved when the TV reporter explains (subtly worded as an argument) that the only reason these bugs are attacking is because humans invaded their land.Hmm...that doesn't sound at all like the far-left's argument about modern terrorism, does it? Now, I am not sticking up for American foreign policy at all with this review; I am only saying this movie is way over the top. One perfect example was the children smashing little bugs on the sidewalk. That was bad enough, but then we see the mother cackling like a lunatic next to them.Combine that with Johnny's outburst after the reporter makes his comment above about humans invading their land. Instead of combating his argument, Johnny comes over and says (paraphrasing): I am from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all! What that scene is clearly meant to show is that humans in this film, like Americans today, are just too stupid to see the ""whole picture."" He clearly knows nothing outside of his little city in a vast universe (he even mentions earlier how he's never seen the universe). This is EXACTLY how elitists across the world portray Americans, that is to say, ignorant of everything but what's right in front of them.I'll stick with reality.",Starship Troopers
856,harith-255-148523,A futuristic film tinged with a very satirical tone,8,5 March 2015,"Actually, I needed a few minutes to understand that Starship Troopers mocks different other films. The plot happens centuries after our times ; we immediately observe a new world, divided between humans and huge monsters, called arachnids. One can understand quickly that it answers to lots of theories, some of them were even the subject of other sci- fi films, like ""Aliens"" (1976 and 1986).I consider this film to be visionary : in 1985, they already developed a complex scenario with huge bogs, trying to attack Earth, but also military bases on other planets. Because it is a whole ironic theory : humans would be in war against kind of aliens. It has something of a propaganda, that makes sometimes laugh. It remembered me totalitarian countries doing propaganda, like Nazis. The sentence : ""Do you want to know more ?"" becomes awkward all over the film, because of its repetition and aggressive tone.It is also an answer to technological progress ideas : there are issues about an eventual world only composed of robots, and a presence of human life beyond Earth. Aside from the bloody side of humans being killed, the film could please to a child : it is plenty of robots, and spatial ships... But the story definitely does not have to be taken seriously. Even the soundtrack is exaggerated; it is very emphasized throughout the film, through a very patriotic and heroic tone.I made a comparison between the Federation, which refers, in the film, to the single united government of Earth, and the United States. Aside from this huge war, this world seems to be an utopia, where everyone can decide of his future life and meet wonderful people. There is a huge propaganda led by authorities ; for instance, at the end of the film, the TV broadcasts the capturing of the ""Brain"" of the bogs. This broadcasting does not cease calling viewers to join the Fleet if they want to be heroes like the ones from the film. There is a real brainwash, the same way as the US did to defend their imperialism during the Cold war.Nevertheless, as a conclusion, I found that the main actors : Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris interfered well in their respective roles of the perfect lovers and students who sacrifice their relationship for the benefit of their career.I think that it is overall a great success, when you understand the hidden critical realized by Paul Verhoeven.",Starship Troopers
857,john-wallen,Thoughts on the REAL story of Starship Troopers,8,9 July 2005,"Many folks have commented on the ""antiwar"" tone of the film, or the portrayal of the Federation as ""Fascist""... That certainly seems how the director intended it to turn out. The CGI is excellent, the scenery breathtaking, and as a shoot-'em-up space opera, one of the best.BUT... and this is a BIG ""BUT""; the novel as written by Heinlein in 1959 bears very little resemblance to the film ""based"" on it. Only the ideas of Bugs & service = citizenship remain. Most of the scenes from Basic training are invented by the director, to reinforce the idea of a callous, brainless ""cannon-fodder"" military. in the novel, the ""Bugs"" are a technological, space-faring race, with star ships of their own. They dropped an H-bomb on Buenos Aires, and did not shoot goop out of their ovipositors! :) Much of the actual novel was concerned with what the role of a citizen should be to the State, and what responsibilities & duties should exist (in both directions). Set in the aftermath of a long, painful global thermonuclear war, the characters in the novel are used to explain how citizenship is defined, and subplots deal with the growth of a callow teenager into a mature, responsible adult.Space battles & combat are much less a part of the novel, but academic discussions would be dull & boring on the screen... The growth and maturation of the lead character (Rico) are explored in depth. Note that at the time of the writing, integrating men & women into combat units, and having female commanders of warships (star ships) was indeed quite new! Still not reality even today in 2005.I enjoyed the film, but was sad that what I felt were the major points Heinlein was trying to illuminate were completely excised, & in some cases, overlaid with pseudo-Nazi fascism completely at odds with the thrust of the novel as he wrote it. But, then again, Tom Clancy gets his plots tinkered with in screen adaptation too! :) I'd highly recommend that folks who found the film interesting (from any viewpoint) look up the author (Robert A. Heinlein) on Wikipedia, & perhaps check out some of his other books, plus the original novel.",Starship Troopers
858,jewminator,Amazing critique of fascism,9,4 December 2015,"The fascist advertisements in the beginning of the movie appear very appealing in their perfect society. We learn that after the fall of democracy, the veterans of war take over all of the Earth's government to for the Global Federation of Earth. The system works perfectly. Crime is mostly gone and sexism as well as racism is nonexistent as well. We see in the game of Jumpball that the quarterback is Dizzy which is a woman. In the shower scene men and women shower together with no issues and no disclosure or privacy. The whole system works on the idea that civilians can work someway in the service to become citizens whether it would be to serve in the military or help out any other way. The difference of a civilian and a citizen is that the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not. Once a citizen you can vote and perform other tasks that a civilian could not do otherwise. In the shower scene a woman claims that she joined the service to become a citizen to make it easier to get a license to have a baby, which by today's standards may seem absurd but also kind of makes sense. The only restriction on having a baby today is grabbing any willing partner and preforming a certain task. This results is a beautiful creatures of life but not always are the parents willing to provide for the child. Some are left to fend for themselves which almost all are unable. Not saying a baby could survive on their own but it leave a lot of trauma throughout that child's life. Getting a license to be able to have a child is the government's way of securing that child's future.The government's whole idea thrives on the idea of force. In the movie they talk about that force is the use of violence. Naked force has resolved more human issues than any other form. History is written by the victor. In a lot of ways most would disagree with a fascist government but this movie makes the whole idea make sense. It's not a complete disregard for people's rights. It's more of a system where you choose to obtain more rights than others. You choose to become a citizen and there is no punishment for choosing to stay a civilian. Civilians still have the right to get a license to have children is just easier if you're a citizen. There is no segregation or separation it's just the idea of bettering yourself and the community around you and you are rewarded. Fascism is not good in a lot of ways but this movie's version is pretty good. What you should take from watching this film is motivation to better yourself and your community to become and asset not a setback. Would you like to know more?",Starship Troopers

There was much more depth to this movie than it seems. You have to watch it with an open mind. Another thing the documentary clarifies is that originally there troopers were supposed to armed with high tech robotic tank like suits and mega cannons,etc. It didn't happen because they wanted the dramatic effect of swarming masses of blood thirsty humans and to recreate d-day invasion, which had no support units except pure infantry.(there were tanks,m4 shermans, but they sank, only a few made and most of them were blown up)Watch the movie saving private ryan and as a matter of fact any war movie, more than 50% of the fighting is done by infantry, not tanks, not planes, not ships.

The effects are great, the non-action sequences are funny. Not a very intelligent film, however. This is one you'll want to turn your brain off for.Those who haveEdward Neumeier and Paul Verhoeven raped Heinlein's classic sociological essays in novel form. Lets go down the list: *In the book, the government was a representative republic with a military service obligation for full citizen's status. This term was only two years, a third of the time our enlistee's are obligated to complete, and could opt out at any time, the only penalty is that they cannot try again. There is nothing fascist about it. *Only approximately 1 in 50 bugs were actually the dangerous warriors armed with an energy weapon. There were no giant tank bugs. There were no little tiny ones. It was workers/warriors, brains, and queens. *MI personnel used powered armor. In fact, the effectiveness of this armor was great enough that a single squad spread out over several miles could burn a city with minimum civilian casualties, intentionally. (In show of force to convince the ""skinnies"" to join their side of the war} *There were no women allowed in MI. This is for the same main reason the modern army does not allow women in combat arms: except in unusual cases, women are not as strong as men. However, nearly all pilots were women due to better tolerances for acceleration and change in direction. The movie was schlock that only borrowed names.

870,dorin-lazar,Evil adaptation of the book,1,5 July 2012,"Verhoeven tries to make a 'war is evil' movie after a book that is pretty much about anything else. While the book is military Science Fiction at its best, a smarter 'Full Metal Jacket', the movie fails in every concern. It fails to depict correctly the views of Heinlein, mocking them instead. It's a pity, really, since Heinlein's views deserved proper recognition and a good movie.It's not only that Verhoeven decided to destroy the book. It's the actors it chose, the B-class movie that resulted out of that. It's all the cool things that were missing from the movie: the power suit, the tensed action, the military training, the long travels, the effects of the war on the hero's psyche.But let's talk about the film, and not the book. The film is filmed like a B-class movie. It insists that the military should be gender-ignorant, and does that by doing a shower scene of naked troopers, both boys and girls, because in the mind of left-leaning Verhoeven that's how the army should be like. Then, it sends all this equality army to slaughter because the army is mindless, obviously. Now, the army shoots with some things that are not even as good as real live bullets (but they live in the future, probably there are some kind of humane left-leaning lasers that don't kill, just stun or something).The 'love' triangle (square?) that the movie tries to depict is not even laughable. The acting is so bad, it's not even funny. The soapy look, the fake newsreel interludes and the whole atmosphere makes this wannabe war-is-evil movie just a silly waste of time.

I don't mind that somebody has a different mindset than mine - but if you try to make a movie out of a book, then you should follow the premise and the spirit of the book! According to the reported comments of the idiot Verhoeven, he never even read the entire book - because he got ""bored and depressed""! Poor baby! How in the world can one make a film out of a book, if one has not even read it!!!!! The book contained very thoughtful social comments, whether or not one agreed with them. If a movie is represented as being a film of a book, or ""based"" (that's a copout!) on a book, then the producers, writers, directors, etc. have an intellectual obligation to come as close to the story as possible (within the constraints of cinematic time and space).

I'd never even heard of the book - and I'm well read. Believe it or not. As an action film it's pretty good, and watchable. I picked the book up a few years later by mistake, assuming it was a 'book of the film' thing. Very mistaken.Of course you'd expect that, the book is 50 years old. But it has many values ahead of its time, if coloured by their era; for example Heinlein ranks all humans equally, but never mentions race explicitly. He decides that women are better at maths, piloting and so on, whereas the film takes a more realistic 'all equal in all roles' attitude. I still haven't decided upon the political bias of the novel. It's not particularly right wing, as has been claimed; rather the opposite in some ways. The film, however, is distinctly satirical and anti... well, I'd say anti politics in general. Pro people, perhaps?This is very watchable. As an action film, it works. As a societal film, it works. Satire, works. Comedy, works. Taken as all the above it works well.

It takes a intelligent filmmaker to use such subtlety that it was granted a theatrical release in the US. Were 'they' any smarter, they would have forbidden the film in the first place... probably.This film should be as mandatory in history class as Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the will.
