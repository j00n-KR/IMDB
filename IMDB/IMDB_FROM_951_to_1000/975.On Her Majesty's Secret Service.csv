0,MartinHafer,"I know many will disagree, but this actually was the best Bond film",9,23 March 2008,"Despite overall lackluster ratings, this is my vote for the best James Bond film. No, it's not because I am a George Lazenby fan. Despite this Aussie not being right for the role, this movie deserves kudos for being so intelligently written--possessing a depth that was never equaled in any other Bond film. Bond, for the first time, was human. Another reason I loved this film is because it was a very long and complex film--making it seem leisurely yet exciting throughout.There are two plots in the film that run concurrently. First, Bond happens upon a very spoiled and confused lady (Diana Rigg). She is an emotional mess and she needs stability in her life. In a very odd choice, she drifts towards the usually irresponsible and shallow Bond--who in his own way needs her as well. Second, Blofeld is back again and he's up to something--but what this diabolical scheme is, no one knows. Oddly, in a case of lousy continuity, Bond and Blofeld don't seem to know each other--though they were well acquainted in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Maybe the fact that Lazenby was playing the role confused Blofeld--as did having Telly Savalas play the role of Blofeld instead of Donald Plesence! Had the original actors returned, this mix up might not have occurred! By the way, I actually liked Savalas better as Blofled because the character had more depth. Here he did more than stroke his...cat...and push buttons to send people to their deaths.In addition to the exceptional plots and writing, this film also had amazing but appropriate stunt-work. The skiing scenes were amazing and were copied in later bond films (such as in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME). I also appreciated the downbeat but exceptional ending. A great production throughout--too bad the series took a more comic book approach in subsequent films.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
1,TheLittleSongbird,"On second look, this is actually better than I thought",8,25 August 2010,"Admittedly, I did not like this film at first and I can't adequately explain the reasons why. Was it because I didn't like George Lazenby, or that it distanced itself from the Sean Connery outings? On second viewing though, I was surprised at how wrong I initially was. It is not the best Bond but it is light years away from the worst. George Lazenby may be a tad inexperienced and the least charismatic of the Bonds, but he is still likable and does try hard, that I can see. And it does tone down some of the gadgetry and spectacle, however in doing that the film does boast some of the best and slickest sequences in a Bond film. The story is believable and sticks closely to the book, and the script goes into a greater psychological depth. Consequently both Bond's pursuit of Blofeld and romance with the feisty Tracy are wholly believable. Terry Savalas is great as Blofeld, and Diana Rigg is splendid as Tracy. The cinematography and scenery are beautiful, and John Barry's score and Louis Armstrong's theme song are simply terrific. In conclusion, better than I thought and dare I say underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
2,bkoganbing,Enter And Exit George Lazenby,6,14 July 2009,"Poor George Lazenby, just could not get the public to accept him as James Bond. And poor Sean Connery, it took him years to get them to accept him as someone other than Bond on the big screen. Sometimes actors just can't win, but Connery eventually did.When he absolutely, positively refused to do another Bond film after You Only Live Twice, the producing team of Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli signed the unknown George Lazenby from Australia to play 007 in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.By this time the public had not only gotten used to Sean Connery as James Bond, but James Bond behaving within certain parameters. So even though the novel called for James Bond to for once do the right thing by the woman, I don't think the public took to the idea of Bond marrying his Bond girl, in this case Diana Rigg. Certainly Lois Maxwell as Ms. Moneypenny didn't. Here expressions during the wedding are priceless.Telly Savalas plays Ernest Stavros Blofeld, Bond's perennial nemesis and he's decided to lay claim to an ancient title and really join the ranks of high society. And if he doesn't get it, he's going to let loose a virus from his Swiss chalet fortress. In many ways Savalas is the best part of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.So if you want to see George Lazenby's one time only Bond for curiosity, you might catch On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
3,Leofwine_draca,"Overlong and a bit flawed, but this Bond's a good 'un",7,6 September 2016,"ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is a film I'd always missed watching as it stands separately from the rest of the crowd. I'd caught all of the Connery and Moore films but never had a chance to sit through this one before. I wasn't exactly thrilled to watch it – after all, it did get panned for a reason – but I found it a fairly amiable outing for the secret agent, and probably better than Connery's THUNDERBALL and DR. NO, at least.There are quite a few things going for this film. The cast, for one, is good. Lazenby usually makes the list of everyone's worst Bonds and it's fair to say that he'd had no acting experience before this; despite this, the male model comes good. He's not my favourite Bond but I'd put him just behind Connery and I much prefer him to the slimy Pierce Brosnan. The regulars all make fun appearances but OHMSS also deserves kudos for the casting of the best Bond girl of all time in Diana Rigg, fresh from her stint on THE AVENGERS. Rigg is every spy's dream: a madly attractive woman with plenty of intelligence and also spirit, as she reveals in the climax when she tackles a thug. The fact that Bond actually marries her shows that she's a cut above the usual blonde bimbos and I loved every minute of her. Funnily enough, I'd never understood the fuss about Rigg until I saw this film but now I'm a big fan. The final casting coup is Telly Savalas as the villain, Blofeld. Savalas is one of those larger-than-life actors who seems to dominate every film he's in, and I've never disliked him in a role yet. Whether playing a pervert in THE DIRTY DOZEN, a Cossack in HORROR EXPRESS, or Blofeld in this, he's been fantastic and lights up the screen no end.The movie also benefits from some decent, fast-paced action scenes and genuinely funny humour. This was the first time Bond went skiing and his antics on the slopes easily beat those of Moore. The snowbound locales make for plenty of inventively staged set pieces, like the car chase taking place in a stock car race or the high-rise antics around a cable car. Blofeld's plot to use biological warfare around the world is slightly cheesy, like something I'd expect from an Italian spy film rather than a big budget Bond flick. It's little more than an excuse to include loads of glamorous women including Joanna Lumley (!).However, the main problem with this film is the poor pacing. It's one of the longest Bond films ever and it shows. While the action is decent, the scenes come few and far between and barely anything happens in the first hour and a half. This makes at least half of the film slightly boring which is why it was panned when it came out, although some fans do appreciate it these days. I didn't mind it, and for what it's worth I enjoyed everything up on screen, especially when it finally starts kicking off in the second half.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
4,SnoopyStyle,Different kind of Bond,7,16 December 2013,"Bond (George Lazenby) becomes close to gangster Draco's daughter Tracy (Diana Rigg). Draco wants him to marry the willful Tracy in exchange for information on Bloefeld (Telly Savalas) of SPECTRE. Following clues, Bond discovers Bloefeld's dastardly plan in the Swiss Alps with many beautiful women.George Lazenby's Bond is much more of a brute without the sophisticated charm. It's a different take on Bond than everybody else. He's willing to slap a girl around, and he looks like he likes doing it. The big attention grabber is Diana Rigg. She commands attention in every scene she's in. Although I like Donald Pleasence better as Blofeld than Telly Savalas. I even like his white cat better.There are a few too many slow scenes with Lazenby. If he isn't hitting anybody or playing around with Diana Rigg, it can get quite boring. He is literally photocopying files in one of the most boring spy action in a Bond movie. Once he gets on the mountain top, at least there are a bunch of beautiful women to spice things up. The movie still drags in the Alps until we get some skiing action. The real skiing has a good kinetic feel. I also love the kinetic feel of the car chase. They obviously sped up the film for parts of it, but there is something about real crashes that CGI will never match.There is something very valuable about Lazenby's Bond. It's too bad that he doesn't have the charisma to lead the franchise. And what a dark ending! They don't ever approach that until the Daniel Craig's Bond in 'Casino Royale'.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
5,Horst_In_Translation,Lazenby one out of one,6,30 June 2020,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is a British, mostly English-language movie from 1969 and of course this is a Bond movie. The word ""long"" applies here for different reasons because the title is among the longest in the Bond universe and also it runs for over 2 hours and 20 minutes. The director is Peter R. Hunt, who previously worked as an editor on other Bond films, but here he got to be the man in charge and this was his first directorial effort ever. Two writers were in charge of the screenplay. For Simon Raven, this is surely the most notable career effort and his only affiliation with a Bond movie. The head writer was Richard Maibaum for whom the exact opposite is true. He was already a really established writer back then, started his career before WWII even and worked on several other Bond films before and after this one. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" had its 50th anniversary last year, so it is nice to see some cast members still alive here. I will elaborate on some of these: For lead actor George Lazenby this is probably the career-defining effort as well and he scored a Golden Globe nomination in the newcomer category that does not exist anymore today. I personally also know about his long relationship with a former tennis player, but that is probably only because of how much I care about tennis. Others will only know him for Bond. I think he did a decent job overall, even if he is the one Bond that not too many people remember anymore today. Quantity is also a reason here because he only appeared in this one 007 movie before negotiations turned out unsuccessful and the producers did all in their power (especially their monetary power) to have Sean Connery return for his first of two comebacks. Of course, Connery's footsteps were already really difficult to fill for Lazenby, but like I said: I think he wasn't bad at all. Actually, there is a really nice Connery reference at the very start, before the opening titles, when Lazenby says something like that the other fella would not have let the bad guy(s) get away. Hilarious stuff how they were breaking the fourth wall there. This moment could have made you think that Lazenby might give this role an approach as comedic as Moore did later on, but it is not true. Lazenby's character is not super serious, but also not particularly light.Let's go with the credit list here: The second cast member I want to mention is Diana Rigg. She is also still alive today just like Lazenby and most people who know the actress nowadays probably know her from ""Game of Thrones"", but they would never think of her turn here in this movie. Which is really a pity. She is so good. One of my top three Bond girls of all time. Also she is pretty emancipated. She can drive a car. She can fight the bad guys. And she can stand up for herself. Also when she talks to her father who is a really influential mobster. She disappeared a bit in the second half and I was slightly surprised how she was featured so dominantly very early on already. I guess they wanted to make clear that she is the one and only girl for Bond in this movie. And actually, there aren't too many others indeed, even if Bond is circled by Blofeld's young females in Switzerland, especially the one with the lipstick action. And Tracy's death at the very end is definitely so heartbreaking. One of the saddest moments in Bond history for me how he holds her and tells the officer that she is just getting a little rest, perhaps the saddest ending to a Bond movie. So Bond gets married, but he does not stay married for long sadly. His relationship with Tracy is also one that was referenced much later, like when we have Moore's 007 visit her grave in another movie. These two (Bond and Tracy) are really the key players in this film.Of course, we also have a main antagonist and it is once more Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who goes by the hilariously French name of Bleuchamp occasionally here. He is played by Telly Savalas (Kojak) and Savalas is known to be an action guy, so it is not surprising that we see a slightly different Blofeld here. No white cats, but instead Savalas' take on the role has him ski down the hill, has him ride really fast in a bobsleigh. He is a man at the middle of stuff going on, not just one who coordinates the way other Blofelds have done it. But of course, it is not just down to the actor, but also all down to the writing. I think he was alright. The main henchwoman here is played by Ilse Steppat. Sadly she died immediately after shooting was finished at an age where she really shouldn't have, so we will never know what could have been with her career. This film was her international breakthrough. I mean she is not as good as Lotte Lenya in her Bond movie, but still pretty good and she is also the one who fires the crucial shots at Tracy at the very end. It is not unusual that Bond goes up against the main hench(wo)man at the end, but here it is different because Blofeld is still alive and actually with Steppat's character in this scene. So maybe it is really true that Lazenby's character lets the bad guys get away too often. You could say there is a frame with the funny quote early on, but the tragedy at the very end.Gabriele Ferzetti plays Tracy's dad and he seems to be a high-profile mobster, so Bond somewhat collaborates with bad guys here to defeat his main opposition, even near the end when they physically assist him there like some underground army. Also not really too usual. That the bad guys do I mean, not that they help him. He sometimes has a small army at his command that is not linked to MI6. They try to catch him early on, but how he deals with the Black guy is one of really not too many true physical fight sequences in this film. Another new route they were heading. But what is even more unusual is how Lazenby's Bond almost never kills. Maybe this was intended to somewhat justify his loss of innocence (i.e. loss of Tracy) that would turn him into a killing machine in later movies. But then again, the Black guy did not belong to Blofeld which could explain it. But there is at least one of Blofeld's helpers who gets away alive too later on, not to mention Blofeld and Bunt themselves. Lois Maxwell plays Moneypenny and hey, she gets a kiss from Bond. On the lips this time even and he says something as if he might want to date her when he is back although it was probably just banter. He meets Tracy anyway then and the scene at the wedding with Moneypenny in tears and the hat is somewhat typical. You never know if she is really sad or if it is really all about somebody getting married as she says. I definitely prefer this traditional Moneypenny by Maxwell over the more confident Moneypenny in later movies.One thing that is also slightly uncommon is the title: ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" includes a direct reference to the Queen (or King), something you never find otherwise in Bond films. The title is mentioned several times when Bond meets Tracy's dad. For example, the latter says once that he would not give out any information to Her Majesty's Secret Service if not absolutely necessary. And ""absolutely necessary"" means in this case that his daughter's husband works for the MI6. He is really trying to have Bond marry Tracy. Like it is all his plan because she needs a strong hand or something. Oh my, I honestly hope that they will never because of female emancipation etc. start censoring comments like this. Or scenes like the one when Bond even slaps Tracy to get some information out of her. She still falls for him pretty quickly. On a completely different note, this is also a rare Bond movie that has no famous Bond song. No Bond song at all you could almost say. The closest to it is probably Louis Armstrong's number you hear on one occasion in the movie. Also not common at all. You often hear a tune or a jingle, but actually really vocals are an exception the way it is here. So you see that this is a movie that is different for all kinds of reasons. One thing I did not like too much about it (and which may also explain my rating) is that I felt in the Swiss Alps it got too action heavy at times with the chase sequences, explosions etc. They could have kept the film 15 minutes shorter I suppose, cut out some of the less meaningful stuff for sure. I also felt the entire villain idea with what the purpose of these girls was is a bit too absurd for my taste, but I did like that they included an actually existing big body like the United Nations that Blofeld sends his threat to. It's still kinda ironic that Blofeld was in so many movies and yet he is probably not remembered by as many as Goldfinger. Props to Gert Fröbe for sure. Even Christoph Waltz apparently cannot change that.Okay, let's not get drifted away too far now. What I do want to say too is that the number of memorable henchmen here is far too low given the running time. I guess Bunt is alright, but she is not a fighter and as for the fighters, there are pretty much zero who make an impact. The Black dude early on does not really coount either because he does not belong to Team Blofeld. Who else is there? This could have made for a nice change instead of all the action. Also here we have a Bond movie that was not nominated for a single Oscar, perhaps because they were not too fond of Lazenby back then. At least not as fond of him as people are today. He is mostly getting fine reviews nowadays I believe. Okay, I think this is pretty much it. Nothing to say about Q really this time, he was mostly forgettable now, especially compared to Moneypenny who also had the application for leave moment adding further to her screen time in this movie. All in all, this is not one of my favorite Bond films, but also not one of my least favorites, even if I hoped the quality could have stayed as good as in the first third. Then probably I would have given a higher rating. It drags a bit here and there in the second half before the epilogue.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
6,classicsoncall,"""This never happened to the other fellow!""",7,14 December 2018,"Sean Connery's absence from this James Bond outing is duly noted with tongue-in-cheek humor during the opening sequence when George Lazenby makes the comment in my summary above. I didn't think I'd care for Lazenby in the Bond role but I think he did it justice in his only appearance as the MI6 agent, Double-O7. Nor did I ever think Bond would succumb to the throes of holy matrimony and was proven wrong on that count as well. For only a brief moment as it were, as the finale to the story provided an unusual pathos to the Bond saga. Telly Savalas was a pretty good choice for the role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, as if he were made for the part. He would have been a natural to remain in the franchise.With Lazenby, the fights and stunt work appeared to be better choreographed than Connery's pictures, although his did get better as the series progressed. The ski chase scenes and the stock car sequence were both fairly exciting, but the rear projection shots on the ski slope did look somewhat tacky. With all the talk of Blofeld's 'Angels of Death', his plot to unleash biological warfare on the world never came close to passing, so in that regard, he wound up an ineffective villain. Better luck next time.The movie contains a neat nod to a future James Bond picture during that scene in which the Sir Thomas Bond coat-of-arms is explained to James. With this, the sixth picture in the Bond series, it wouldn't be until Number Twenty came out that we got the title ""The World is Not Enough"". By then, it would be still another actor to don the mantle of James Bond - Pierce Brosnan.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
7,gavin6942,One of the Best Bond Films,7,5 June 2017,"James Bond woos a mob boss's daughter and goes undercover to uncover the true reason for Blofeld's allergy research in the Swiss Alps that involves beautiful women from around the world.Although George Lazenby sort of shot himself in the foot by walking away from the Bond franchise, he is arguably the best James Bond ever on screen and this is one of the better films. Even telly Savalas plays a great Blofeld, though Donald Pleasance is clearly the best. And Diana Rigg? This may be her best role outside of ""The Avengers"".I feel like there is more development of plot and characterization, rather than non-stop action or strange gadgets. This was a fully-baked Bond, something you just never see.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
8,jboothmillard,On Her Majesty's Secret Service,7,14 September 2005,"I used to think that this film was either terrible or average, as it is the one and only film from the leading Australian actor, before Sir Sean Connery returned in Diamonds Are Forever, but it has become a cult favourite for fans, and the more I watch it the more I like it, based on the book by Ian Fleming. Basically James Bond 007 (Golden Globe nominated George Lazenby) saves Contessa Teresa 'Tracy' Di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) from committing suicide, they meet again later at a casino and hotel. The next morning Bond is kidnapped and taken to the head of the European crime syndicate Unione Corse, Marc-Ange Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti), he reveals himself to be Tracy's father, he explains her troubled past and offers Bond one million pounds to marry his only daughter. Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy in exchange for Draco providing information that will lead him to the whereabouts of the head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), his archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas). Following a whirlwind romance with Tracy, Bond is lead to Bern, Switzerland where he learns Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, Bond poses as Bray to get close to him. Blofeld has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps, there twelve women, ""Angels of Death"", are being brainwashed to distribute bacteriological warfare throughout parts of the world. Bond tries to get Blofeld captured, but his henchwoman Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat) catches him, Blofeld identified Bond shortly after his attempts to lure him out of Switzerland, after being trapped Bond makes his escape skiing down Piz Gloria while being chased. Bond arrives in the village of Lauterbrunnen, there he is reunited with Tracy, they escape after a car chase, they are forced to stay in a remote barn during a blizzard, where James declares his true love for Tracy, he proposes marriage to her, she accepts and they embrace. The next morning Bond and Tracy are chased again by Blofeld and his henchmen, Tracy is captured when an avalanche is set off, Bond gets away and is informed by M (Bernard Lee) that Blofeld intends to hold the world ransom, threatening to use the brainwashed women to destroy agriculture. The plan is to pay the ransom, but Bond goes against orders to mount a rescue for Tracy, Draco joins him with his army to attack Blofeld's headquarters, the facility is destroyed, Blofeld escapes in a bobsled with Bond pursuing, Blofeld is snared in a tree branch, injuring his neck. In the end James and Tracy are married in Portugal, they drive away in Bond's Aston Martin, they pull over at the side of the road to remove flowers from the car, suddenly Blofeld (in a neck brace) and Bunt commit drive-by shooting, Bond is devastated to see Tracy has been killed. Also starring Yuri Borienko as Grunther, Bernard Horsfall as Campbell, George Baker as Sir Hilary Bray, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Angela Scoular as Ruby Bartlett, Catherine Schell as Nancy, Julie Ege as The Scandinavian Girl, Joanna Lumley as The English Girl, Anouska Hempel as The Australian Girl and Jenny Hanley as The Irish Girl. Lazenby was a model and appeared in adverts before becoming the super spy, he looks the part and gets some good moments, but a combination of his quitting and the producers unhappy with him meant this was his only outing, but what a memorable one, full of terrific action sequences, great locations and a love story ultimately doomed, an underrated and worthwhile spy adventure. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 12 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for both the title theme music and Louis Armstrong's ""We Have All the Time in the World"", and it was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the emotional tragic ending. Very good!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
9,Tweekums,A new Bond!,10,26 August 2011,"In the sixth Bond film George Lazenby takes over the role of James Bond from Sean Connery and acquits himself admirably. Of course it may have helped him that this Bond film has one of the best stories and he is able supported by the excellent Diana Rigg. The story opens with Bond rescuing a girl called Tracy who is walking into the sea; he doesn't get a chance to know her straight away as two thugs assault him. Later he meets her again in a casino and ones again rescues her; this time from a gambling debt; he spends the night with her but in the morning she is gone. As he leaves the hotel he is grabbed by more thugs and taken to the offices of Marc-Ange Draco; hear of the Corsican Mafia and more importantly Tracy's father. He has a proposal; if Bond marries Tracy he will give him one million pounds Bond has a request of his own; he wants Draco to use his criminal contacts to find Blofeld. Once back in London Bond finds himself off the case but Draco provides a lead that gets him back on the case and sent to Switzerland where Blofeld is running an allergy clinic and attempting to be recognised as a count. Bond goes undercover as a herald by the name of Sir Hillary Bray. Bond manages to discover what Blofeld is up to but is captured; he manages to escape but contacting London will be a problem. He bumps into Tracy again in the nearest village and the two of them continue to flee Blofeld's goons. While hiding in a barn James proposes to Tracy and she accepts but unfortunately Blofeld's men capture her. James returns to London but is told Blofeld's treat to release the 'Omega Virus' means that he is to be pardoned of all his crimes and left alone. With no official backing Bond turns to Draco in order to thwart Blofeld's plans and rescue Tracy.To my mind this is the best Bond film; it has a good story, spectacular action that is believable including ski chases, bobsleighing and a helicopter assault on Blofeld's mountaintop lair. As well as a new Bond this film features a new Blofeld, the excellent Telly 'Kojak' Savalas. Diana Rigg is brilliant in the role of Tracy, the best Bond girl to date, partly due to her acting and partly because the character wasn't just another girl for James to seduce and leave. As well as plenty of excitement this film has some genuinely emotional moments; have a handkerchief handy for the ending, as it is a real tearjerker.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

11,BA_Harrison,"Romance, action, and tragedy—all in a day's work for Bond.",8,29 September 2012,"Having performed his duty for queen and country over the course of five films, Sean Connery's Bond was long overdue a break; taking his place, Aussie actor George Lazenby, who begins his first mission, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with a well choreographed fist-fight, rescuing reckless babe Countess Theresa AKA Tracy (the gorgeous Diana Rigg, one of the sexiest Bond women ever) from a pair of gun-toting thugs.This act of heroism brings Bond to the attention of Tracy's father, organised crime boss Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti), who asks Bond to marry Tracy, for which he will not only pay the spy £1million but also help him find his nemesis Blofeld. Neither Bond or Tracy are willing to go along with the deal, but the couple wind up falling in love anyway; their relationship must go on hold, however, until Bond has located Blofeld's hideout and foiled the villain's latest plot to blackmail the world.A rather uneventful middle act—during which Bond does little else but hop in and out of bed with dolly birds—prevents OHMSS from being perhaps the greatest movie in the series, but the rest is pure 00-heaven, Bond's human side developed nicely during the first part of the film, and his license to thrill fully exercised during the amazing, action packed last 45 minutes or so, which features some incredible ski-stunts and one of the nastier deaths to befall a baddie (head-first into a snow-blower, resulting in a gruesome spray of blood-red slush!).Other high points include Louis Armstrong's unforgettable song We Have All The Time In The World, a cool car chase that sees Bond and Tracy taking part in a stock car race, and last but not least, the oh-so-tragic ending, which never fails to choke me up.As far as I am concerned, Lazenby was a more than worthy successor to Connery and I am truly sorry that this was his one and only outing as 007.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Bond falls in love with a troubled Contessa while tracking nemesis Blofeld (Telly Savalas) from the Swiss Alps. The action sequences are nicely spread about by director Peter R. Hunt, whose work unfortunately goes slack for the romantic drama. One simply fails to believe James Bond in this affair of the heart--and when he chats with old friend Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), it seems absurd that she should treat him just as she always has (maybe it's the job and not the man she's secretly smitten with?). Certainly there are unusual ingredients here for a 007 adventure, but it doesn't quite click. Terrific music score by John Barry, fine cinematography and amazing stunt work.

13,JohnHowardReid,Excellent Bond!,9,25 September 2016,"Some of the sharpest editing ever seen in a motion picture adds breath- taking excitement to what is actually a seemingly endless variety of fantastic stunts and fabulous action. An attempt at tongue-in-cheek humor is made by Simon Raven's additional dialogue. This is not always successful, although there are three or four extremely witty rejoinders. But often all these humorous touches seem to have been dubbed in as an afterthought. The main action is gripping enough in itself and really needs no support of contrasting comic relief. Lazenby looks the part better than Sean Connery and acts with reasonable assureness and skill. No expense has been spared and all the money has been wisely invested in superlative sets and eye-catching location lensing, plus a faultless support cast.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
14,Coventry,Bond Misfit Bond!,6,22 January 2016,"""On her Majesty's Secret Service"" - or abbreviated ""OHMSS"" as from now on just to make my life a little bit easier - is definitely an eccentric outsider in the overall and long-running James Bond film franchise, and that's NOT only due to the fact that it was the first and immediately last appearance of George Lazenby as the legendary British secret agent. Although it's undeniable that the bizarre casting of this Australian born character actor was a wrong decision, there are several other aspects that make ""OHMSS"" a curious 007-flick. The screenplay remains very close and loyal to the original Fleming novel, which results in a few bizarre continuity issues and a drastic change in narrative style, and indisputably the biggest difference between this one and the rest of the series (you may even call it a culture shock) is the sub plot/story twist that the traditionally macho-like and womanizing bachelor Bond falls genuinely in love and even shamelessly expresses his emotions! Because of the different tone and themes, there are quite a lot of fans that consider ""OHMSS"" the best film of the entire series, and even Sean Connery himself claimed that he would have preferred to star in this one rather than in most of the other Bond-vehicles he appeared in. Personally, I don't rank ""OHMSS"" in my top five Bond flicks, but I've certainly come to appreciate it more over the years, especially after multiple viewings. ""OHMSS"" doesn't contain a wide variety of exotic filming locations, the main plot is pretty dumb, the amount of exhilarating action sequences & stunts is significantly lower and Lazenby isn't the proper protagonist, but still this film is non-stop compelling and the climax is inarguably the most unforgettable of the entire franchise. Pretending to be Sir Hilary – an expert in genealogy – 007 infiltrates in the criminal organization of the charismatic villain Count De Beauchamps; who's really just Ernst Stavro Blofeld with his earlobes clipped back. This is immediately where the gaps in continuity begin to show, since this film totally doesn't take into consideration that Bond and Blofeld already were opponents in ""You Only Live Twice"". High up in his lair in the beautiful Swiss Alps, Blofeld has developed a virus capable of exterminating all types of fauna & flora – including mankind – and his evil scheme exists of spreading the virus throughout the world via unsuspecting gorgeous women of various cultures. Masking as a medical guru who discovered a cure against allergies, Blofeld has lured these girls to Switserland, where he's hypnotizing them during their sleep and preparing to send them back home on Christmas with the virus. With a running time of more than 140 minutes, ""OHMSS"" is definitely overlong and several dull scenes during the first half easily could have been cut, if you ask me. The last hour, however, is vintage Bond material with fantastic action footage (for example the ski-chase or the bobsled- battle) and suspenseful moments. I tend to rank my personal favorite Bond movies based on the charisma and degree of evil of the main villain. I love Telly Savalas and he depicts a fascinatingly sober and menacing Blofeld, yet I still prefer Donald Pleasance in the role. Savalas surrounds his Blofeld character with an aura of mystery and nihilism and I suppose that even the peculiar way he holds a smoking cigarette in his hands has some sort of additional meaning. Finally, I can't end the review without mentioning George Lazenby I like this guy a lot, but admittedly I prefer to see him in obscure cult movies, like the Italian Giallo ""Who Saw Her Die"", or crazy exploitation movies, like ""The Man from Hong Kong"". As James Bond, Lazenby just isn't capable of providing the character with a healthy portion of witty self-parody. For a brief moment during the beginning I had some hope that it would work out fine, notably when this pretty girl runs away from him and he turns to the camera to say: ""That never happened to the other guy"", but this was just a stand-alone highlight.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
15,michaelRokeefe,"007 always completes his assignment, even against an archenemy.",5,30 November 2002,"This installment of the James Bond series will probably always be the source of argument. A lot say this is the best written so far; while a lot of 007 fans are not thrilled in the least with the wooden-like George Lazenby as Bond, James Bond. I feel as many do, it is a shame that Sean Connery declined to continue the role.(Thank goodness he did return for just a while later). Bond confronts his infamous archenemy Blofeld(Telly Savalas), and must extinguish the plans of a global attack of germ-warfare. Scenery and special effects to please.

18,hitchcockthelegend,"Even if we have all the time in the world, the world is not enough.",10,8 May 2012,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is directed by Peter Hunt and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars George Lazenby, Diana Rigg, Telly Savalas, Ilse Steppat, Yuri Borienko and Gabriele Ferzetti. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Michael Reed.Bond 6 and 007 is obsessed with locating SPECTRE supremo Ernst Stavro Blofeld. After rescuing beautiful Countess Tracy di Vincenzo from suicide, this brings Bond into contact with her father, Marc Ange Draco, who agrees to help Bond find Blofeld in exchange for 007 courting Tracy. Blofeld is located in the Switzerland Alps at Piz Gloria, where he is masterminding a fiendish plot involving biological extinction of food group species'. Bond will need to use all his wits to stop the plan from being executed, he also has big matters of the heart to contend to as well...Connery gone, but not for good as it turned out, so into the tuxedo came George Lazenby, an Australian model with no previous acting experience of note. It would be Lazenby's only stint as 007, badly advised by those around him that Bond had no future in the upcoming 70s, his head swelling with ego by the day (something he readily admits and regrets), Lazenby announced he would only be doing the one James Bond film. The legacy of OHMSS is the most interesting in the whole Bond franchise, for where once it was reviled and wrongly accused of being a flop, it now, over 40 years later, is regarded as being one of the finest entries in the whole series. Yes it is still divisive, I have seen some fearful arguments about its worth, but generations of critics and film makers have come along to laud it as essential Bond and essential Fleming's Bond at that.Everything about OHMSS is different to what Connery's Bond had become, the gadgets are gone and heaven forbid, Bond got a heart and fell in love. He was a man, with real aggression, real emotions and forced to use brain and brawn instead of mechanical trickery. Changes in the production department, too, wasn't just about Lazenby's appearance. Peter Hunt, previously the Bond film's editor, directed his one and only Bond film, and Michael Reed on cinematography also appears for the one and only time. New Bond, new era, but reviews were mixed and in spite of making a profit of over $73 million Worldwide, this was considerably down on previous films. The reviews didn't help, with much scorn poured on Lazenby for not being Connery, but really it's hard to imagine anyone coming in and not getting beat with that particular stick! Box office take wasn't helped by the film's length, at over 2 hours 10 minutes, this restricted the number of showings in theatres, something that should be greatly noted.Away from Bond anyway, OHMSS is a stunning action thriller in its own right. From the opening beach side fist fight, where uppercuts lift men off their feet and drop kicks propel them backwards, to helicopter attacks, bobsleigh pursuits (resplendent with punches and flinging bodies), ski chases and a car chase in the middle of a stock car race: on ice! There's enough pulse pumping action here to fill out two Bond movies. But the Bond aspects are magnificent as well. Lazenby has wonderful physicality and throws a mean punch, he cuts a fine figure of a man and he's acting inexperience isn't a problem in the hands of the astute Hunt. Lazenby is matched by Rigg as Tracy, the best Bond girl of them all, she's no bimbo, she's tough (fighting off a guy with a broken bottle), smart yet vulnerable, funny and heart achingly beautiful, her interplay with Lazenby is brilliantly executed, so much so that when the devastating finale arrives it has extra poignancy. A scene that closes the film on a downbeat note and remains the most emotional scene ever put into a Bond movie.Savalas finally gives us a villain who can compete with Bond on a physical level, making the fight between them an evenly matched and believable one. He lacks Pleasance's sinister fizzog, though the bald pate and Grecian looks marks Savalas out as an imposing foe as well. The Swiss Alps setting is gorgeous, with Reed capturing the scope magnificently, while some of his colour lensing in the interiors soothe the eyes considerably. Barry's score is one of his best, lush romantic strains accompany Tracy and James, operatic overtures dart in and out of the Swiss scenery and the James Bond theme is deftly woven into the action sequences. Louis Armstrong's beautiful ""We Have All The Time In The World"" features prominently, perfectly romantic and forever to be thought of as part of the Bond Universe. Finally it's the great writing that gives us the best sequence involving the trifecta of Bond, Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and M (Bernard Lee). 5 minutes of class that gives Moneypenny an acknowledged importance in the relationship between the two men in her life. It's just one of a number of truly excellent scenes in the greatest Bond film of them all. 10/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
19,Theo Robertson,The Other Fellow Should Have Been Cast,6,1 June 2004,"Some people consider OHMSS to be the worst Bond movie made . It`s not ( That`s either MOONRAKER or A VIEW TO A KILL ) but it`s not the best either though it had all the potential to be the best Bond movie ever made . It`s totally serious apart from the post modernist opening  , it contains some very good lines like "" Gatecrasher , I`ll leave you to tidy up "" and the classic "" He had lots of guts "" and this is the movie where Bond`s heart is melted and he gets married so we`ve got a mile stone incident in the franchise . The problem - And it`s a fatal one - is that George Lazenby is painfully wooden as James Bond . Okay the legendary British agent is not an Oscar winning role but Lazenby delivers his lines with the conviction of a speak your weight machine and is totally ill at ease on screen and you do find yourself wishing that Sean Connery had stayed in the role for this movie . This is compounded even worse by the production team drawing the audience`s attention to the fact that Connery is gone by having a title sequence composed of a montage of clips from the previous movies and there`s a scene where Bond empties his desk and we`re treated to strains of themes from the Connery Bond movies . yeah Lazenby is poor but you do get the impression his very lukewarm reception in the role was also partly to the production team also wishing that Sean Connery was also playing Bond

20,preppy-3,One of the best Bond movies ever.,8,24 July 2015,"**SPOILERS** James Bond (George Lazenby) battles the evil Blofeld (Telly Savalas) who has plans to sterilize the entire world (or something like that--the plot is kind of vague). He also falls in love with beautiful countess Tracy (Diana Rigg).This is a VERY controversial Bond film. Some fans hate it simply because Sean Connery isn't in it and they find Lazenby bad. Others (like me) think it's one of the best of the series. If it's such a bad movie why was it such a huge hit at the box office? Also I think Lazenby is pretty good as Bond. He doesn't have the effortless charisma of Connery or the easy-going charm of Roger Moore but he's a hell of a lot better than the terrible Timothy Dalton. He's tall, handsome and excellent in the action sequences. Even better he plays off Rigg incredibly well in the romance scenes. The movie itself is great! As I said the plot is kind of vague (especially in the edited TV prints) and the first part is kind of slow. It's also way too long at 140 minutes. But when the action kicks into high gear during the last hour or so it's fantastic. There's car chases, ski chases, plenty of fist fights, a hair-raising bobsled fight...even an avalanche. Also this is the only film where Bond gets married. There's also beautiful locations, a great soundtrack and good acting. Rigg has got to be the best Bond girl ever (with Carey Lowell running a close second). The only real debit is Savalas badly miscast as Blofeld.

This film has a bit more class and less innuendo that it's earlier iterations - and Diana Rigg adds a bit of mischief and panache as the boisterous, independently-minded ""Tracy"" with whom poor old ""James"" has a pretty torrid time. This story isn't so good, but that isn't Lazenby's fault - indeed I felt that he, Rigg and Savalas tried hard to create a sense of suspense and menace; as did Ilse Steppat as the no-nonsense ""Irma Bunt"" (is that an anagram?).

At the heart of the action is the beautiful but rebellious Tracy (the incomparable Diana Rigg), the daughter of one of the most dreaded gangsters, Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti of ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), in Europe. Draco wants Bond to marry Tracy, but 007 is more interested in tracking down the elusive Blofield. The action scenes from the first one on the beach to the ski chase down the mountain when a villain gets ground up in the snow machine are unforgettable like this movie.

What follows is a perilous undercover assignment that takes him to a mountain fortress high up in the Swiss Alps where Blofeld is working on a fiendish secret project which he plans to unleash upon the world if his conditions aren't satisfied. Anyway, rather than revealing the entire plot, I will just say that this is a worthy entry into the James Bond collection. As mentioned earlier, the role of James Bond is performed by George Lazenby in what would become his first and only appearance as Agent 007.

Australian George Lazenby took over the part for this ONE AND ONLY time.Many Bond fans point out that this picture is the most faithful to Ian Fleming's character and book series. The story is taken from the novel of the same name.People usually have two problems with this episode in the Bond series: (1) Lazenby as Bond and (2) After the first 20 minutes the story lacks any real action for the next hour or so wherein Bond goes undercover to investigate Blofeld's lair.Concerning the second issue: Because the story involves at least one full hour (probably longer) of action-less spy investigation, those with ADD probably won't like this film. Personally, I enjoyed it; I can't stand when films have an explosion every two minutes to supposedly keep things ""happening"" and maintain the interest of the audience. Bond masquerading as Sir Hillary at the ""allergy clinic"" is both interesting and amusing. Besides, the last 40 minutes or so feature numerous thrilling action sequences: ski chases, a car chase, a bobsled chase and the final assault on Blofeld's mountain stronghold.Needless to say, if you're a fan of winter sports, you'll want to see this film. By the way, George Lazenby was a very accomplished skier and had won two contests in Australia before taking on the role of Bond at the age of 29, the youngest Bond as of this writing.Speaking of Lazenby as 007, he looks and acts like James Bond to me. Maybe he doesn't have the same charismatic flare as Connery in the 60s (Who does?), but he certainly has his own unique appeal.Lazenby, incidentally, was a martial arts expert, which he taught during his stint in the Australian army. He even studied under Bruce Lee and later stated that it was Lee's philosophical teachings that enabled him to go on to have such a successful business career and personal life. In fact, George was actually going to have dinner with Bruce the night he died (!) and even replaced him in what was supposed to be Lee's next film ""The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss"" (1974).He amusingly commented on Pierce Brosnan as the new Bond in 1995's ""Goldeneye"": ""... this is the 90s and women want a different man, a man who shows his feminine side. Pierce definitely has that."" He also reflected on the character of Bond himself: ""He's a ruthless (bastage), really.""As for the women in this movie, Diana Rigg is undeniably good-looking but she doesn't do anything for me personally (too tall and thin), but there are numerous other beauties to behold throughout the picture.Because of Lazenby and the film's literary faithfulness, this is a very unique and worthwhile Bond adventure. It's also a must for those who love winter sports and spectacular Swiss winter locales.It is the longest Bond film at 2 hours, 22 minutes, up until Daniel Craig era; and was filmed in Portugal, Switzerland and Pinewood Studios, England.GRADE: B+",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

32,deloudelouvain,A new face for James Bond but Sean Connery is just better.,6,4 July 2021,"I've been watching (sometimes rewatching) all the James Bond movies in the chronological order. On Her Majesty's Secret Service isn't the worst but it's also not that great. For the first time a new face as James Bond, a thing that will change a lot in the future. This time he's played by George Lazenby (that by the way could have played in seven other Bond movies but he didn't want to which wasn't a clever move from him). He's the odd duck in the pond, not very charismatic, not very credible as James Bond. Bond is still a bit sexist, the year 1969 is pobably why nobody cared that much about it. There are a couple entertaining pursuits but the stunts overal are a bit boring. No special gadgets either which is quite disappointing. The good thing about this movie is Diana Rigg (the later Miss Emma Peele in The Avengers). She's candy for the eye. Telly Savalas (better known for his role as Kojak) plays the evil one (first time I observed he has a weird finger, couldn't take my eyes of it). In short, it's watchable but not the best. Next stop: Diamonds Are Forever.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
33,SimonJack,New actor and weaker script don't hold up for 007,6,5 October 2017,"If this weren't a James Bond 007 film, it might rate a notch higher. But no more than that. This is an interesting plot, and the film has some of the usual great scenery and camera work. An unusually higher caliber of cast (Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas) raise it a level. But it has a few things against it. The biggest minus is that it drags in several places. It has short bursts of boredom with little action or interest. The second problem is George Lazenby as James Bond. Again, if he wasn't James Bond but someone else, it would be OK. But, he doesn't have the Bond persona. George is a nice guy, a gentleman, even a little down to earth and humble. But he's not a very good actor. His fight scenes have the slightest pause in them, so they seem contrived or staged. James Bond, on the other hand, is supposed to be tough and macho. He's an overly self-confident, even a little conceited character. That's James Bond, but not George Lazenby. And the third thing wrong with this plot is Bond getting married. I don't think any fans were ready for that at that stage of the Bond character. Again, if the hero was anyone other than Bond, it would be OK for a film. But not here. And Diana Rigg's warming up to him after a while just isn't very convincing. Lazenby didn't go over back then, and the search was on for another actor to play James Bond. We would see Sean Connery return two more times. This was Lazenby's first starring role after just appearing in a TV series. He has stayed in the movies and on TV, but couldn't hold up in leading man roles.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
34,Mr-Fusion,It's rewarding if you stick with it,7,24 November 2015,"Over the years, I've heard reactions to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" vary between ""dull"" and ""underrated"" (and many points in between, come to think of it). Not many OO7 movies tend to be this polarizing, which immediately heightens the curiosity level.The opening certainly doesn't do the movie any favors, with its awkward fourth-wall-breaking, and I had to get used to Diana Rigg's aristocratic demeanor and George Lazenby's take on the Bond character (credit the man for being different than Connery). And the best word I can use to describe the movie's first half is . . . soporific.That said, it gets a lot better once Bond gets to the Alps; at least then we get scenery and atmosphere, not to mention a villain. I liked Telly Savalas' Blofeld; he oozes just the right menace without chewing the scenery. Lazenby's good during the fight scenes, and the ski and bobsled chases are both pretty cool. All of this makes it easy to stay for end, which is where the movie really shows us something: a teasingly happy ending for James Bond, only to rip the rug out from under him.It's a ballsy ending.7/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
35,ShadeGrenade,"""May all your allergies be swiftly cured!""",10,26 November 2006,"Let's get one thing straight: 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ) does NOT have a major continuity error as some poor souls insist. True, Bond and Blofeld met in the previous movie, but the order of the books was reversed by the producers. Had 'Service' been filmed first, the problem would never have arisen. Whenever I watch the films I always make a point of seeing 'Service' before 'Twice'. It makes more sense that way. The film marked a change of pace for Bond following the gadget laden 'Thunderball' and 'You Only Live Twice'. First-time director Peter Hunt had the best book of the series to work with, and wisely stuck to it. It starts with Bond on a global manhunt to find Blofeld. In Estoril, Portugal, he gets romantically involved with the Contessa Di Vicenzo - Tracy - ( Diana Rigg ), a gangster's daughter hell bent on self destruction. Blofeld is running an allergy clinic in Switzerland, which Bond infiltrates posing as a genealogist. The villain has brainwashed ten beautiful girls to carry phials of Virus Omega across the world. Unless his demands are met, he will unleash sterility on a grand scale. In a thrilling ski chase, Bond escapes from Piz Gloria... To replace Connery, Eon hired unknown Australian male model George Lazenby. His performance has been the subject of much controversy over the years; whilst lacking Connery's experience, he acquits himself impressively. He looks good in the action scenes, and handles the romantic stuff pretty well. His 'human' Bond is perfect for this story; Connery's version would have jarred with its realistic, darker tone.Diana Rigg is brilliant as 'Tracy'. The late Telly Savalas made a more believable 'Blofeld' than Donald Pleasance. Among the 'Angels of Death' are Catherine Schell and Joanna Lumley.The fights are perhaps the best ever seen in a Bond movie; the pre-credit tussle on the beach gets the picture off to a flying start, while the ski chase, stock car rally and bobsleigh finale are magnificent. Sublime cinematography from Michael Reed. John Barry outdoes all his other Bond scores here; 'We Have All The Time In The World' ( sung by Louis Armstrong ) is a knockout. The decision to retain the book's downbeat ending ( Bond finds love, only to have it snatched from his grasp ) was also a contributory factor in its success. Despite the critical panning it got at the time, the reputation of 'Service' has grown over the years, to such an extent that many fans include it on their list of all-time great Bond movies. I would go further. In my view, its the best Bond of all time.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
36,JamesHitchcock,Why?,5,31 January 2013,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was the sixth film in the James Bond series, and the first which did not star Sean Connery, who had temporarily retired from the role after ""You Only Live Twice"". (Connery was later to return to the role twice, in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and the unofficial entry ""Never Say Never Again""). Various actors were suggested as his successor, including Roger Moore, but in the end producer Albert Broccoli and director Peter Hunt went with an unknown male model named George Lazenby whose only previous acting experience was in television chocolate commercials. Why? Yes, I know that there are revisionists, both on this board and elsewhere, who will swear by God and on their mother's grave that ""OHMSS"" is the greatest film in the series and that Lazenby's magnificent interpretation of the role is the main reason for its greatness, but such revisionists never really ask themselves why, if he was such a great actor, his subsequent acting career has been so undistinguished. (Apart from this film, he is perhaps best-known for appearing in no fewer than eight of the innumerable sequels to the original ""Emmanuelle""). To tell the truth, Lazenby's performance here- wooden, emotionless and unconvincing- is a dire one. His decision to play the role of Bond only once appears to have been his own, but at least he spared the producers the dilemma of whether or not to sack him. His poor performance in his one and only appearance has led to his name being used as a metaphor for equally forgettable contributions to other film franchises, such as one critic's description of George Clooney as the ""George Lazenby of the 'Batman' series"". It would, however, be unfair to blame the film's lack of success on one man alone; there are other reasons why this is among the weakest of the Bonds. One might have thought that, following her success in the Bond- inspired TV series ""The Avengers"", Diana Rigg would have made a natural Bond Girl, as her fellow-Avenger Honor Blackman had done in ""Goldfinger"". (A future Avenger, Joanna Lumley, has a small role here in her screen debut). There were, however, rumours of an on-set feud between Rigg and Lazenby, and whether or not these rumours are true there certainly seems to be a lack of rapport between them. This matters, because this is the film where Bond falls in love. He may have gone to bed with the likes of Honey Ryder, Pussy Galore and Kissy Suzuki, but he never falls in love with them. He does fall in love with Rigg's character, Tracy di Vincenzo, a love which ends tragically. Bond is therefore required to show much more of his emotional side than he normally does, and the film requires more by way of acting skills from its leading man than do most of the other entries in the series. Telly Savalas as Blofeld makes an adequate villain, but no more than that, and I felt that the film-makers should have kept Donald Pleasence, who played the role in ""You Only Live Twice"". Pleasence's Blofeld was hid his ruthlessness beneath an icily smooth exterior, but Savalas's is little more than a crude thug. One cannot really imagine Savalas's character, unlike Pleasence's or for that matter Charles Gray's, caring whether or not he is recognised as the Comte de Bleuchamp, or even successfully passing himself off as a world-renowned allergy specialist. I would also question whether it was a wise move to have the film end tragically. I know that this was the ending which Ian Fleming wrote, but the scriptwriters have not always followed the original novels faithfully. Certainly some of the recent Daniel Craig films, notably ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"", have also had a tragic ending, but these films have generally been more serious in tone throughout. For most of its length ""OHMSS"" is a typically light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek Bond movie, with the standard plot about Bond's efforts to thwart an evil megalomaniac trying to hold the world to ransom. The ending therefore comes as a jarring shock; it was, apparently, booed in some cinemas. Moving from the film's weaknesses to its strengths, it has a particularly fine score, composed by John Barry and including that great song, ""We Have All the Time in the World"", unforgettably sung by Louis Armstrong. Ever since ""From Russia with Love"" there had been a convention that the theme song of a Bond film should have the same title as the film itself, but in this case Barry felt it would be impossible to write a song entitled ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" unless it were done in a comic-opera Gilbert and Sullivan style. There are also some decent action sequences, mostly involving winter sports of one sort or another, in keeping with the film's main setting in Switzerland. The film was also responsible for introducing a new Bond cliché, the downhill ski chase. Ever since it has been predictable, whenever we see the combination of snow and mountains, that Bond will sooner or later find himself skiing down them with the bad guys in hot pursuit. (Or occasionally that Bond will be the one pursuing the bad guys). Most of these sequences, however, come in the second half, and the action in the first half tends to drag a bit. (This was the longest-ever Bond film until ""Casino Royale"" came out in 2006). The film's strengths, however, do not really compensate for its faults. This is not the only below-par Bond film- I could also mention ""A View to a Kill"", in which the ageing Moore's performance finally toppled over into self-parody, ""Licence to Kill"", essentially a violent revenge thriller masquerading as a Bond, and the dull ""Quantum of Solace"". ""OHMSS"", however, must join that undistinguished trio as candidates for the title of Worst Bond Film Ever. 5/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
37,KineticSeoul,"Not your typical James Bond movie, which might not necessarily be a good thing",5,29 January 2016,"This is a very different Bond films compared to the Connery films. I give it props for it trying something new by going in a very different direction. Where instead of it focusing on the bad guy's plans and Bond using his wits and charm to beat the villains. This takes on a bit more realistic and romantic approach. Now this film is divided between people that really dislike and people that like it or think it's one of the best Bond films out there. I thought certain elements were done well, but when it comes to the overall film I personally thought it was boring. And some parts I just wanted to skip when it came to couple of scenes that ramble on and on. There is one ski chase scene that somewhat stood out but it has been done better in future action films. The main aspect that makes this Bond installment stand out is the fact that James Bond gets married for the first time in this. And also the ending that is actually sort of impactful despite the build-up not being that good, it does save this from being a Bond movie that I would tell others to pass on. The romantic aspect is endearing at certain points but isn't all that memorable. Watching this movie seemed more like a lame drama than a actual action movie. Just about everything about it seemed so generic. It's not much of a shock why this film failed at the box office. It doesn't have enough cool action sequences that connects well with the story enough for boy audiences to get into and talk about much. And the romantic elements was just too forgettable for girls to fall over with and talk about among each other. And top that off with probably the worst Bond ever minus the ""Casino Royale (1967 film)"". I don't want to bash on someone that dreamed of playing the role of Bond, but the guy that played Bond in this just lacked the charisma, the suaveness, slickness and the strong presence to play Bond. One of the main aspects of what allowed Bond to survive in the film industry for such a long time was because Bond is a character that just about every male wanted to be and fantasize about and women would fond over. I could picture neither when it came to the guy that played Bond in this. He was just too goofy and lame to play Bond. In fact he seemed like he should have been a side character or a character in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise. Even the writing for Bond in this, is just simply bad at times. I mean Sean Connery's version of Bond is known for his one- liners. In this, there is one scene where one of the bad guys falls into a snow grinder and his one-liner is ""he had lots of guts!"". Overall, if your into a lame romance movie that revolves around a super spy give this one a chance. I am pretty darn sure when Mike Myers did his parody of James Bond he has this Bond in mind.5.5/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
38,OllieSuave-007,Lazenby kicks some serious arse as 007!,7,1 April 2014,"This is the first and only film starring George Lazenby as James Bond 007, where he helps mobster Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) track down arch nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas), where takes him to Switzerland and poses as Sir Hilary Bray to find out Blofeld's secret plan. Along the way, Bond woos Draco's daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg).This movie goes at a steady pace with some intriguing scenes that I've found appealing including 007 attempting to escape from Blofeld's pursuing henchman and the romantic chemistry between Bond and Tracy. Lazenby proves he is a formidable Bond that can could some serious butt, using his own moves and stunts when grappling with the henchman. This makes Bond an even more serious force to be reckoned with and an agent to fear more, in addition to his already famous license to kill.Lazenby as Bond is a women charmer and equipped with a few one-liners and somewhat suaveness. However, his Bond has a serious and sensitive tone as evident in his emotional interaction with Tracy, who becomes one of the more unique Bond Girls, stealing Bond's heart and coming to rescue his life a few times. This makes this one of the more touching Bond movies. The plot itself picks up speed right from the start, drags towards the middle and abruptly comes to an action-packed climax. As with many of the Bond movies, there are a lot of talk and less action, but this one lacks some suspense and humor as well. The good acting, though, counterbalances it. It's not one of the best Bonds, but overall, it's a pretty movie.Grade B-",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
39,thesar-2,An Avalanche of Disaster,3,3 March 2013,"By far the worst Bond and Bond-film (to 1969 date), On Her Majesty's Secret Service didn't just suffer from the super-spy's replacement: it was incompetent, too long, lazy and relied too heavily on altering course.Now, I am unfamiliar with the reasons of said change of roles (from 5-time Bond, Sean Connery to 1-timer Bond, George Lazenby) but I have heard it was because Connery didn't wish to be typecast. Uh, yeah, right – 5 movies in as many years as the same character and he just THEN didn't want to be labeled as Bond for the rest of his career.In any case, the new Bond was even duller than when smirking Connery held the position. And the movie wasn't there to get his back, either.A chance meeting of suicidal, yet strong, Tracy, leads Bond to both love and a mission to find his long-time nemesis, Blofeld – another change of actor, this time: Telly Savalas. He does, indeed, find him on top of a Swiss Alps mountain where another evil SPECTRE plot emerges.I will give the movie some credit for actually starting off horribly and slowly getting slightly better – including an absolute punch-in-the-gut of a dark but original ending. However, overall, it was a mess of filmmaking: horrible camera angles, terrible lines, laugh-out-loud and cartoonish action scenes and they took the biggest risk turning 40% of the film into a romance. It did not pay off. It would be the equivalent of giving Jason Voorhees a friend out in the woods he can get some of his guilt off his chest each Saturday the 14th.At least they made it a little more – and shockingly – adult. James doesn't just admire a Playboy spread; he steals the pin up gal's pages for later.It's a miss and I believe the world was enough for one Lazenby Bond.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
40,bensonmum2,"""This never happened to the other fella.""",9,29 June 2009,"I'll skip the usual plot description. If you're a fan of James Bond, you've most likely seen On Her Majesties Secret Service anyway. If you haven't seen it, then what are you doing reading this – go out and get it right now. And anyway, this is going to be long enough so why unnecessarily add to it with a pithy little plot summary. On my list of all-time favorite Bond movies, On Her Majesties Secret Service would be somewhere in the top 5. Why? Well, first it's one of the few James Bond movies where I've actually read Ian Fleming's book. And I liked it – I liked it a lot. The plot and storyline appeal to me in a major way. I appreciate the fact that the movie is so true to the source material. I like that there are so few over-the-top gadgets. Bond gets by on his wits and brawn alone. That's one of the things that also appealed to me about the recent Bond movie, Casino Royale – the lack of incredible gadgets. It makes things a little more believable. (I realize that I'm being a bit hypocritical here. It goes against everything I usually stand for when I write about how much a I appreciate the relative realism in this movie. I'm usually so in favor of outlandishness in my spy movies. Just read some of my other user comments and you'll see what I mean. It's difficult for me to explain, but it works in this case.) Second, Diana Rigg. Is there any reason to say anymore? Beyond Ms. Rigg, I love the whole cast. Of all the actors that played Blofeld, Telly Savalas is my favorite. Donald Pleasence was a bit too close to a being a parody (i.e. he's practically Dr. Evil) and Charles Gray, though a good actor, was never right for the role. And don't you just love the way Savalas holds that cigarette? I've never seen anyone but him do that. Too cool! (That's right – I just called smoking ""cool"".) While I'm talking about the cast, I suppose I should mention George Lazenby. It's not that he's that bad, it's just that he's not Sean Connery. I find it impossible to judge his worth as Bond from one movie. He's okay I suppose, but I would have liked to see him given the chance to grow into the character the way Connery and Moore did.Third, On Her Majesties Secret Service is an amazing looking movie. Some of the shots of the Alps, especially those from the helicopter, are some of the best photography in the entire series. Cinematography, sets, locations, lighting, and anything else that goes into making a movie look good are all outstanding. It's a wonderfully shot movie.Finally, I really appreciate Peter Hunt's direction. On Her Majesties Secret Service might most well paced Bond movie ever made. It's so even form start to finish. As much as I hate to admit it because I enjoy most all of the Bond movies, there are some that drag on and on to the point of distraction and lack the flow of this movie.If I've got one complaint it would be with some of the lame attempts at comedy. They're terribly forced and don't feel right in what is otherwise such a straight forward movie. There are a couple that are so bad I wince every time I hear them. For example, after one of the baddies is sucked into the giant snow blower turning the snow a pale pink, Bond quips, ""He had a lot of guts"". Groan worthy or what? Still, that's my only real complaint so a 9/10 would seem to be in order.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
41,gridoon,The most awkward Bond film,3,23 July 1999,"I find it puzzling that Lazenby has so many defenders.I think he is by far the worst Bond ever, walking around like a soulless zombie, fighting like a robot, lacking charm and humor.The structure is uneven: the first part of the film is extremely flabby, followed by a frenetic series of wild chases.Aside from the really gripping bobsled chase at the end,most of the (widely praised) action scenes and ALL the fight scenes are too-frantic and heavy-handed; were they edited by a neurotic?                                                   Two redeeming features: the unusually bitter ending and the equally unusual references to previous Bonds.Apparently,they tried to convince us that the Bond myth lives on,even if the actors change.But the casting of Lazenby,and the awkward editing, make this one a failure",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
42,Lejink,Do you want to know a secret....?,8,14 June 2011,"...the secret being that this is actually a very good Bond film indeed. Being Scottish, I have an obvious loyalty to Sean Connery's familiar playing of the role and perhaps it was a mistake of the producers to throw the relatively unknown George Lazenby into the part. I'll come to Lazenby's acting later but undoubtedly this is one of the most action-filled Bond films of them all and is boosted further by the utilisation of top actors in key supporting roles (Diana Rigg & Telly Savalas), a fantastic soundtrack by the late, great John Barry and just, as you'd expect, the highest production values besides.I don't think Lazenby does that badly in the part, younger than Connery at the time by almost a decade, he's athletic and certainly looks the part. His acting of course isn't as strong as Connery's but he's far from wooden and should I think have been given more chances to prove himself in the part - ironically after Connery resigned the second time, the producers employed an actor in his 40's to carry the part well into the 80's. There is some very obvious dubbing for some of the accents Bond puts on and it was perhaps a mistake to get him into a kilt given Connery's country of birth.Diana Rigg on the other hand, fresh from playing Emma Peel in ""The Avengers"" is perfect as the wayward Tracie, the only Bond girl to get our hero to the altar (if only briefly) and never looked better than here. Telly Savalas seems to get more screen time as Blofeld than Charles Gray and Donald Pleasance combined and it's justified too with a weighty performance (although it seems strange him not recognising Bond even in disguise recalling their encounter in the immediately preceding ""You Only Live Twice"").The cinematography is excellent and I'm sure the Alpine scenery would have looked superb on the big screen. The stunts and fight scenes are excellent too, apart from some jarring process shots in the downhill chase sequences. It also contains the funniest line ever uttered in a Bond film, Lazensby's sly reference to his predecessor ""the other fellow"" and a surprisingly downbeat ending which shows that crime sometimes does pay, even in Bond's universe.Best of all though is John Barry's quite superb music, the sleek, flowing theme tune my favourite piece of music from any Bond film and perhaps only equalled by Isaac Hayes's ""Theme From Shaft"" in the best film theme ever stakes.Overall then, I thoroughly enjoyed this Jimmy Bond outing and doubt that Sean himself could have added a whole lot more to what was a cracking feature.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
43,bowmanblue,Carry on Bond,5,27 July 2017,"Oh, dear, the 'Bond franchise' really was in a bit of a dilemma after the departure of – arguably the best Bond – Sean Connery. On the plus side, they seemed to have a decent replacement in the form of George Lazenby, better known as 'Who?' to most of us, but there was still the little matter of how to bring him out from behind Connery's massive shadow and make the role his own. What followed was a mish-mash of everything we know as 'Bond,' combined with some things we'd never expect from the world's most famous secret agent. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is often (unfairly!) labelled as 'the worst of all the Bond films.' It's not. Quite often those who finally sit down to watch it come round and see that it's not all bad, it's just different. And it knows it.Right off the bat it pokes fun at itself for the change in leading man (a running joke if you look closely to certain lines of dialogue) and the does its best to carry on the story. However, George Lazenby, albeit a capable actor, is just too wacky to be taken seriously. I know Connery's Bond was quite dark and the producers obviously felt that a 'lighter' touch would help go some way to distinguish the two Bonds. However, as my title suggests, it feels like more of a parody of a Bond film that 'official' spy movie spoofs like the original 'Casino Royale.' We see this new Bond playing a new role, i.e. he's in disguise, but the disguise is so geeky that he could have been played by Kenneth Williams and no one would have noticed. Now, you may say that Sean Connery went undercover as a Japanese man and Roger Moore as a clown. However, these were for mere minutes of their respective films. Lazenby's performance lasts a fair portion of the second act. Plus he wears a kilt and no Bond should wear a kilt! However, like I said, it's not all bad. The action and the women are both there (even if there does seem to be an abundance of 'jump cuts' in every fight scene which are more noticeable than ever when watching on your typical large flatscreen TV). And, most importantly of all, this film really does try something new. It tries its hand at romance. Now, most of us would hardly consider Mr Bond, James Bond, to be the most romantic of characters. Yes, he gets the girl, but – technically – 'romance' is the last thing on his mind. However, here we actually see Bond fall in love. Now, I know that the modern audience may collectively cry 'so what!' as we've seen this more recently from Daniel Craig. However, back then (and after Connery's 'love 'em and leave 'em' attitude') it really was quite shocking. I read one review online which described the feeling pretty well. It said something about how previous Bond outings were spy/action movies, whereas this was a romance film, sprinkled with elements of action and spying. I think that's a reasonable appraisal of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Unfortunately, for all its new and daring moments, it just never worked. It felt everywhere and all over the place, constantly trying to give the audiences something they'd recognise while trying to establish a new face for the super-spy. Plus, if you look deeper into the trivia surrounding the making of the film, you'll see that George Lazenby made himself notoriously unpopular with the producers and critics before he was even unleashed on the audiences. Ultimately, it seemed that the world just wasn't ready for a new Bond. George Lazenby isn't as dark and doesn't have as much screen presence as Connery and couldn't carry the wry humour that Roger Moore found so easy.Once again, the lead villain is Blofeld and, once again, he's being played by a new actor. Telly Savalas does his best with what's given and is a far more physical mastermind than Bond is used to, plus the sets really do show off that funky late sixties feel, but, just because 'Never Say Never Again' is – technically – the Bond film that should be overlooked due to it not being part of the official franchise, this one will always remain the film most casual fans choose to skip.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
44,ThomasDrufke,The Forgotten One,6,11 October 2015,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is often the forgotten Bond because it was in between Connery outings. Of course, this was a one off for George Lazenby, who wished to only play 007 once. The studio was able to get pretty much everyone else back, with the exception of Blofeld, for the film. I will say that this film with Connery probably would have been better, but this is by no means a bad film. It just has several problems that could have been fixed.Lazenby isn't as good at pulling off the womanizing or bada** side of Bond, but his chemistry with Tracy, played by Diana Rigg, was great. Knowing that Rigg has a big part in Game of Thrones 50 years later was interesting to watch as well. But I'm not sure Bond has had as close of a relationship to a woman in any of the other films, which makes this film pretty unique. One of the biggest issues with this film though is the pacing. It's 2 and a half hours long, and you feel the length. There is a good 45-50 minutes or little to no action at all, and this is a Bond film. I can't say I wasn't at least on the verge of falling asleep at that time. But the film picks up in its last act for a semi-decent action film. I don't know why we continue to take our favorite spy in strange places ie; space, underwater, and now in snowy mountains, but it made for some fun ski chases.Speaking of the action, this film has a huge issue in its editing. I know the 60's loved exaggerating the punches and fight scenes, but the fast paced and sped up editing here is obnoxious to say the least. To go along with that, the one liners were noticeably bad, and the film is just not James Bond-y enough.

45,cricketbat,An average Bond film with fantastic skiing scenes,6,1 February 2020,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is an average James Bond film. The story is fine, but George Lazenby is no Sean Connery, and the movie takes itself too seriously while somehow still being overly cheesy. Also, it feels like someone took the fight scenes and chopped them up in a blender. And then there's the ending, which is, how shall I say it, an unsatisfying tonal shift.

46,lesleyharris30,"Has Many Good Moments, but a Weak Addition for the Franchise,",5,4 July 2015,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a mediocre cast. It definitely has some good moments, I definitely enjoyed Telly Savalas performance as Blofeld, he was very confident in the role, and also the ending to this film is easily one the best I've seen in any Bond film, it certainly dosen't make up for the mediocrity for the rest of the movie, but the last five minutes are very pleasing and could almost bring a tear to your eye. The weakest part of the movie was certainly George Lazenby, he is the weakest actor to play Bond to date and I would highly doubt anyone will the taking his place, he has no charisma in the role and he seemed very unsure of himself, his movement, the way he delivers his dialogue, nothing about Lazenby's performance felt right to me. The action sequences in this film are very poor, which was a huge disappointment as these are, obviously, one of the main reasons we watch 007 films, they had great potential for setting them up in a ski lodge, but the way they were filmed just looked very amateur. It's certainly a disappointment and one of the weakest of the series, unless you're looking to watch every James Bond film, I would not recommend On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond quits the secret service to track down Blofeld, who is developing dangerous weapons in the Swiss Alps. Best Performance: Telly Savalas",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
47,CuriosityKilledShawn,The World Is Not Enough.,7,12 January 2007,"Always the underdog and never the Top Dog, OHMSS has a bad reputation that it doesn't deserve. I honestly don't know what Bond fans really want in their movies as they hate anything that has too many gadgets and set pieces (like the uber-crap Die Another Day) and turn their nose up at anything that represents Ian Fleming's true vision of Bond. Lazenby, like Daniel Craig, suffered a press backlash before the film was released that swayed public opinion against OHMSS. Fortunately this was not the case with the more recent Casino Royale but this entry also deserves the same regard.The story has Bond taken off the Blofeld case after failing to apprehend him twice and sent on a 2-week holiday. He soon falls in love with Contessa Tracy Di Vicenzo who's daddy is the boss of one of Europe's largest crime syndicates. Daddy, has a deal for Bond. Make his daughter happy and he'll point him in the direction of the elusive Blofeld and give him a £1,000,000 bonus. An offer he can't refuse huh? It turns out that Blofeld (Television Savalas, the best incarnation of the character) is hiding in the Swiss Alps and Bond goes undercover as Geneology expert Sir Hilary Bray to smoke him out. Bond just happens to be a bit of a Geneologist himself (this movie has him discover that the Bond family motto is 'Orbis Non Sufficit'...interesting)and reckons he bluff his way through it.Blofeld's world conquering plot this time around is kinda Austin Powers-ish but it's thankfully played down. Bond, stripped of his stupid gadgets, must rely on his cunning and wits to outsmart Blofeld and defeat his evil schemes. I particularly like the scene where Bond is locked in a cable-car gear-room and his attempts to escape. Despite the obvious rear-projection a ski-chase, car chase and bobsleigh chase are all very well done.John Barry's score is also noteworthy and his main OHMSS theme is brilliant. If there was ever anything that could come close to replacing the signature Bond theme while still retaining that familiar sound then this is it. Hunt it down, check it out. The scope cinematography is also a standout and often has some nice, atmospheric shots. Something not often seen in a Bond film.I first saw OHMSS when I was a kid and I remember reading about how it was a flop when it was released in theatres. Which is actually a total lie, it DIDN'T flop. The mediocre review in the horrid tabloid newspaper I read made me, as a 10-year-old, dislike the the film. I don't feel that way now though. And despite remembering how it ended I was still pretty shocked when it came. It's far more dramatic and memorable than typical Bond endings. Is this what turns most people off OHMSS? Who the hell wants same-old same-old? Yes, there are a few continuity problems, such as Bond and Blofeld not recognizing each other but since their only face-to-face was with Connery and Donald Pleasance (the most parodied Bond villain performance) it would be absurd for Lazenby and Savalas to be familiar with each other.Too bad Lazenby didn't come back for Diamonds Are Forever. It would have been better for him to be given a nice little double-feature instead of Connery returning one last time. The youngest Bond actor (he was 29 at the time of filming), he certainly looked athletic and believable but apparently his youthful cockiness onset ruffled the producers feathers too much and his own doubts in the series and himself as an actor prevented his return.Don't let the ancient bad rep put you off. OHMSS is just as worthy as another other superior Bond film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

He lacks the suave personality that James Bond is supposed to possess. Despite my displeasure with Lazenby being cast, I don't dislike this movie. On the contrary, I enjoy it very much. I was floored by some of the incredible action scenes. I was still angry about the casting of Lazenby, but I became so entertained, it didn't bother me as much. I have to admit it has a pretty poignant love story as well. It may be only the second time in this series (Casino Royale being the other) where James Bond legitimately falls in love. Yes, he's had plenty of love interests, but i'm talking deep love. The ending is quite heartbreaking. Diana Rigg made for a good love interest. Telly Savalas is the best Blofeld, aside from Donald Pleasence. Overall, don't let Lazenby hamper your enjoyment.

The sixth entry in the series is rather dull for the first hour or so, but then it takes off and the action is non-stop from the time that Bond escapes from Blofeld's Swiss villa on skis. The chase scenes are quite exciting. The lovely Miss Rigg is perhaps the strongest Bond girl in the series. There are a number of good lines, including Lazenby's sly aside to the camera, ""This never happened to the other fellow,"" referring to Connery.

51,The-Sarkologist,The Bond movie with the saddest ending,6,27 January 2013,"Well, Sean Connery has left the series (though he does return in the next film) and he has been replaced by George Lazenby. Lazenby does an okay job, but does not seem to have fell into the piece the way Connery had, but that is probably because Connery had had a lot of practice in the previous films, and you can see that he had got the role down packed. I guess that is the problem when you change actors, namely the new actor has to get the feel for the role again, and it is not like James Bond is Doctor Who, where the new actor can bring new eccentricities to the role.Blofeld has been replaced with Telly Sevalas, though I must able the role does suit him reasonably well. There is a suggestion that there is a continuity error in this film in that Blofeld should have recognised Bond because they have met before, though I am likely to suggest that the reasoning for this is that Bond is in disguise when he comes into Blofeld's strong hold, and it is only later, when he makes the slip, that Blofeld realises that he is Bond. Mind you, I would have thought that the makers of the film would have done a better job than this.Another reason that I didn't like the film previously was because Bond got married, which is something that I never expected Bond to do, however we do note that he is hesitant at the idea, and but is later persuaded and does in a sense fall in love. Also, as I have since discovered, Bond actually marries the Cortessa in the novel, so it was something that Flemming had actually written into his series. Mind you, the other interesting thing is that the order of the movies and the order of the books differ, though that does not excuse the mistake regarding Blofeld and Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

55,johnnyboyz,"Enaging Bond film, but for its attention to character and subtext more-so for what its predecessors were fond of.",7,25 July 2013,"The official recognition of just how badly the ball was dropped by the producers on Thunderball and You Only Live Twice is demonstrably evident in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a film which points out said fact since it happens to be quite good without necessarily seeming like it's even trying. You might say the entry is the first of its ilk, in that repetitions of this scenario in years to come via ""For You Eyes Only"" following on from ""Moonraker""; ""The Living Daylights"" following on from ""A View to a Kill"" and ""Casino Royale"" following on from ""Die Another Day"" are all instances of the Bond films getting a little too big for their boots before being brought back down again to a workable, ground zero level that encompasses all the good, old fashioned things it should. I'm sure there are even those whom would add to the list ""Skyfall"" which of course followed on from ""Quantum of Solace"".In short, Thunderball and You Only Live Twice equate to being bad but with enough in them to keep them from being terrible, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service equating to something more substantial, more sustainable and, strange as it may sound, more normal. The chief difference to everything that preceded it is, of course, that George Lazenby is playing the role of James Bond – the filling of a void left by Sean Connery when he left over disagreements with producer Albert Broccoli. I like to think it was a clash of interests over which direction they were even taking the franchise, and that had it remained what it was before it got its big ideas prior to Thunderball, he'd have hung around. Connery did come back, of course; but it was for a project in Diamonds are Forever which didn't focus on extravagant volcano lairs occupied by villains with piranha pools and looking to initiate World War Three and instead spent half its time telling the story of a low-rent smuggling ring operating out of somewhere like Holland.The new Bond here has essentially forced everyone back to basics. He sits as he drives, face and head shaded by the dimming light of an evening on the coast. There is a woman on the beach nearby, but she is not dressed provocatively nor is she the object of anybody's pleasurable gaze. Moreover, she is attempting suicide via her walking into the sea and it is Bond who stumbles upon her just in the nick of time to save her. ""This never happened to the other fella!"" chirps Lazenby. Indeed. There is more life; more realism and more humanity in this brief opening than there probably was in 80% of You Only Live Twice, the previous entry, where for the first time in the franchise the female characters were essentially superfluous bar the fact they looked good in white bikinis.But Bond is still the same man. He's still suave; still confident; still full of the quips; still good in a fist fight and cool enough to win one within the confines of a hotel room before strutting out, spotting some caviar on a tray, trying some, recognising its brand and then walking off again. Some things, it would seem, do not change. The mission this time involves an extended stay at a luxurious Swiss retreat under the guise of someone else in order to infiltrate another man's fiendish plans. The sense of fresh directions are as pure here as already waning formula was apparent in the last two entries, the likes of which have often come, with hindsight, with the new actor playing Bond evident in Moore's voodoo/drug orientated crusade in Live and Let Die; Brosnan's post-Cold War revisionism in Goldeneye and a gloomy, post 9/11 revisionism in Casino Royale. If it feels different, then it is out of the fact Bond doesn't do so much traversing of the world as much as he does stick around in the singular locale for practically 90% of the final act. What he lacks in air miles, I suppose he makes up for in spiritual traversing when the aforementioned girl whom he saved during the opening was none other than a wealthy mafia don's daughter named Tracy (Rigg). Additionally, this was always the Bond film without a theme tune containing lyrics; Louie Armstrong's ""We Have All the Time in the World"" essentially filling in for whatever lyrical theme the viewer craves, although always remaining an overture.The enemy, as was last time, is Blofeld, but he too has had a face lift before indeed going on to change appearance altogether within the canon proper in 1971's Diamonds are Forever. He is played by Telly Savalas, one of the few villains not to harbour a scar despite the clear establishment last time that Blofeld was indeed as hideous physically as he was politically. When the two come face to face much earlier on during proceedings, they curiously do not recognise one another in spite of what You Only Live Twice thought was a seminal moment last time out when they did indeed meet and the two nemesis' recognised one another. The plot here is to do with germ warfare and the issue of casual drug use rears up, the aesthetic synonymous with 60's light drug culture (before it stepped up into a harder gear for the 70s) is invoked and a tract to do with demonising the whole thing is placed out there for the mainstream to digest. The pleasing thing aside from the fact it's there is that it doesn't wear distract from the film overall. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a tight, smart Bond piece which is most likely familiar to viewers as the most un Bond-like of Bond films. At the time of its production, that sort of evaluation was sorely needed lest the franchise died on its feet anyway.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
56,filipemanuelneto,Bond is defeated by love,8,31 March 2016,"Directed by Peter R. Hunt, produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and with screenplay by Richard Maibaum, this is the sixth 007 franchise movie and one of the least considered by fans today. Nevertheless, it was acclaimed at the time. For the Portuguese, it contains a special affection because it was the only Bond film to be shot in Portugal so far (except ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", that was partially shot in Macau, which was then under Portuguese administration).In this film, the British agent on holiday in Lisbon, saves the life of a woman who tried to commit suicide. Later, he discovers that the girl is the countess Teresa di Vicenzo, ending kidnapped by her father, Draco, head of the mafia of Corsica, which asks him to help her daughter, marrying her and giving her a new life. In exchange, he agrees to give the location of Blofeld, who the MI6 has been looking for. It will not be necessary: seeing the mutual interest, Draco accepts to collaborate with Bond, which starts dating Tracy. The investigation leads Bond to Switzerland, where the villain, disguised as Count Bleuchamp, manages a clinic while seeks to legitimize his nobility. Disguised as expert in heraldry, Bond infiltrates in the enemy's nest and quickly discovers his evil plans.This film is quite different from those that preceded it: despite having the same blend of action and beautiful women, the film has something that we will not see again until very recent years: Bond truly falls in love by a woman who not only loves him but also combines with him: they are the perfect couple as they love each other and also love the danger, sharing the adventure and allowing the risk to unite them. Finally, Bond was defeated by love after several films seducing women. Another difference of this movie from all the others is the fact that its the first film without Sean Connery. Many people saw the character as linked to this actor who thought it wasn't possible to give it to another actor but George Lazenby showed that this wasn't true and made a good performance in the role of 007, probably the biggest role of his career. In fact, the biggest mistake of his career was refusing to continue it for more seven films. Another important note in this film, especially when compared to that preceded immediately, is the absence of the Q- Branch inventions, a director's choice, who want to follow the Fleming's original story more closely.In addition to the central cast inherited from previous films, George Lazenby plays Bond, Diana Rigg gave life to Tracy, ephemeral wife of 007, Gabriele Ferzetti played Draco and Telly Savalas gave life to Blofeld. The soundtrack, including the instrumental opening, was composed by John Barry and includes ""We Have All the Time in the World"", the last musical recording of Louis Armstrong before his death.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The way Lazenby ran on the beach like a pànsy n his skirt made me laugh then.This is the sixth in the Bond series n the only one of George Lazenby as James Bond.

This film is notable for the lack of gadgets and for the tragic ending.
The film is a bit gory, a guy chasing Bond skis into a snow blower.Some info about Bunt from the book - in the movie series, Bond nevr gets a chance to kill Bunt as she was the person who shot Bond's wife and her fate never explained in the movie series but in the book, Bunt is assumed to have died in the conflagration when Bond destroys Blofeld's castle.

60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"It's length and ""one-off"" status are only elements that hold this ""Bond"" back",7,5 September 2017,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is an odd ""Bond"" movie to assess, namely because it's the first film without Sean Connery, but also because some other actors were replaced, including Telly Savalas supplanting Donald Pleasance as Blofeld, while other key roles (Q, M, Moneypenny) remained the same. This quasi-reinvention warrants a level of comparison to the previous five ""Bond"" films, but can also be assessed as its own ""one- off"" edition.Australian George Lazenby is a handsome, charismatic charmer, and it's clear to see why he won Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman's admiration and reportedly a 7-film deal. If he would've gotten a chance to grow into James Bond, he would have earned a lot more fans and would not generally have been ranked as the least of the six Bonds. He's a definitely a younger, pluckier interpretation of the character as opposed to Connery's mature, gentlemanly wiles. Still, he's easy to root for — the ""Bond"" films are a formula and he fits nicely into his end of the equation.What's nice about ""OHMSS"" is how it dials back from the silliness and larger-than-life nature of ""You Only Live Twice,"" which is probably the result of it being a direct interpretation of an Ian Fleming novel. The bulk of the action stays at Blofeld's Switzerland hideaway, where Bond is getting close to his foe to find out the truth behind his ""allergy research, so there's more isolation that world-traipsing, while the ski chases give the movie that big ""Bond"" energy without resulting to spaceships and nuclear war. The stakes are Bond's survival — and his love for Tracy (Diana Rigg).Seeing Bond in love, even though his romance with Tracy bookends the film and there's a little sexual mischief in the middle, definitely adds a bit more depth to James and a lot more emotion to points of the film. ""OHMSS"" isn't dramatic or deeply touching, but there's a real human element we haven't necessarily seen at play and won't see at play much until the Daniel Craig era.At 142 minutes, ""OHMSS"" hold the title of the longest of all the early ""Bond"" entries, and it's 30 minutes too long to be sure. Parts of the film drag — the first act feels especially pointless — and most of the payoff comes in the final 45 minutes. Other than a few sneak attacks on Bond in his hotel room(s) there is not a lot of intermediary action to hold our attention. The entertainment is supposed to come from the suspense of Bond's deception while in Blofeld's clutches.Director Peter Hunt turned out to be a one-off as well and maybe that was for the best. His style calls a lot more attention to itself than Terence Young or Guy Hamilton's with a little more brute action and a tone of rapid-fire editing in the action sequences. It gets a bit dizzying and he turns to camera effects way more than was status quo for these films. So in some ways it's a more visceral, visually interesting take, and in some ways he oversteps. Regardless, he gets things going when they need to get going, keeping ""OHMSS"" from becoming a total slog. It's just a lot of peaks and valleys.""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" has a lot of the elements you want in a ""Bond"" film, providing a safe playground for Lazenby to fill Bond's shoes. If the film doesn't end up as a one-off blip and the Lazenby Bond storyline is continued, the conversation around ""OHMSS"" changes. Instead, it's a solid if not overly long ""Bond"" entry of little consequence.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

62,Anonymous_Maxine,The most unique Bond film of the entire series.,9,9 August 2001,"Why was George Lazenby only in one Bond film? Sure, Lazenby is no Sean Connery (yeah, but NONE of them are, remember?), but he still did an excellent job in his only effort as the great James Bond. Of course, probably the main thing that made Lazenby so effective in the role is that he resembled Connery in so many ways.  They were built the same, they had the same hair, the same eyes, they even talked a lot alike. And there can be no doubt, by the way, that this had a significant role in securing the part for Lazenby.One of the things that is unique about On Her Majesty's Secret Service, besides being the only installment that starred the man who was only in one of the films, is the excellent editing. In the opening sequence, for example, during the spectacular fight scene on the beach, there is some of the fastest and most effective editing that is seen in the entire series. And it's a good thing, too, because the opening sequence was otherwise over dramatized. For example, Bond saves a woman from drowning herself in the ocean, and after grabbing her as she waded slowly and calmly into the water, he carries her back to the beach and lays her down on the sand, inexplicably unconscious. What happened there, did she hit her head on Bond's shoulder and knock herself out? Luckily, this pathetic discrepancy is quickly forgotten as the remainder of the scene secures itself as probably the best opening scene so far.There are dozens of unique qualities of On Her Majesty's Secret Service that really set it apart from the other Bond films. For one thing, there are no words in the theme song, which is unusual because most of them are written specifically for the respective films (and most are absolutely awful, as well). And thank God, too, those theme songs are killing me. The endless flirting with Moneypenny actually proceeds to the point of a kiss here, which I believe takes place just after James resigns from the secret service, another peculiarity of this film. I could go on and on about these things that are totally uncharacteristic of a James Bond movie. There are about ten Bond girls, instead of the usual one. After having resigned, James goes through his old gadgets, some of which are recognizable from previous films, and also note the song that plays during this scene  `Underneath the Mango Tree,' the same song that was playing when we were first introduced to the Beautiful Honey Ryder in Dr. No. James Bond utters the words `I love you' as well as `Will you marry me.' There are dozens of things that are different from the rest of the series. The skiing scene was actually done well, as was the car chase on the racetrack. And at one point in the film, Bond actually impersonates a man who doesn't like women!(spoilers) And yes, you heard right, Bond got MARRIED! While this may have been the one step too far in coming up with original material (a married Bond would spell disaster for later films), the almost immediate death of his new bride not only creates pretty impressive emotion (when did that ever happen in a Bond film?!), but it also begins to legitimize the promiscuity that Bond has always displayed. It made his womanizing behavior seem less adolescent and exploitive. The story of On Her Majesty's Secret Service is also fairly unique to a certain extent, but it's really still the same old thing about some super villain holding the world hostage and it's all up to Bond to save the day. But in this case, rather than the usual nuclear weapons hijack, the villain is threatening the world with bacterial warfare, or an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, to be exact. While this is indirectly destructive toward humans (it threatens the economy rather than directly endangers peoples' lives), it is still good to see something a little bit different once in a while. As this essentially normal Bond plot unfolds, we see lots of impressive stuff. Notice that the main Bond girl (after the one-after-the-other romp with lots of them early in the film) strangely resembles Shirley Manson, the singer for Garbage and the performer of the excellent theme song for The World Is Not Enough 30 years later, and that movie's title originates in THIS film. Weird, huh? On Her Majesty's Secret Service is clearly one of the Bond films that really has a lot of stuff to look for, particularly if you are familiar with the other Bond films. The story itself is not exactly a point of interest by this point in the series, but the action is still very impressive and it is made even better by the amazingly well done editing. The fast paced luge scene at the end of the film is a good action sequence, as is the very convincing avalanche, but when Bond crash lands at the end of the luge scene, a big slobbery dog immediately runs up and starts licking his face, which is just entirely too convenient. They may as well have had him land in a big easy chair. Luckily, the film did not end here, but rather with the tragic death of Bond's new wife which, rather than hamper interest in Bond films to follow (which would be the case, had he remained married), makes you want to rush out and watch the next one to see the killers brought to justice, Bond style! There can be no mistake about On Her Majesty's Secret Service. This is definitely one of the best Bond films, regardless of who played the starring role. Any fan of James Bond or just quality action films is sure to love this one.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
63,FiendishDramaturgy,THE BEST of the Earlier Bond Flicks,9,27 April 2008,"George Lazenby, sans Bond's plethora of gadgets, is a most gallant figure striking a pose against the backdrop of more suave men in the role. Connery's Bond is arrogant and his Bond character relies too heavily on the gadgets. Lazenby's Bond is a beautiful action figure, but his romantic lead quality is not quite par with Connery's. Go figure. Unfortunately, Lazenby never received the opportunity to reprise his role. Connery returns in the very next film installment, ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" as a means of giving the studios a quick substitute for Lazenby, but his return was only temporary, as Roger Moore followed immediately after.Telly Savallas makes for an excellent villain as easily as Diana Riggs makes for a beautiful blushing bride-to-be.This is the most faithful adaptation of any Ian Flemming Bond novel, and is definitely the most poignant. Lazenby is a fantastic action hero and a believable spy, but the world just could not see him in the romantic lead; although, in the one scene requiring depth and emotion, he totally delivers.This rates an 8.7/10 on the Bond Scale from...the Fiend :.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
64,Captain_Couth,The James Bond Series: Best of the Bunch.,9,16 October 2004,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) in my opinion was the best film of the series. I felt that George Lazenby was unfairly slagged by the critics for his performance. He did the best that he could. His acting fit very well for his character.The direction moved the film at an even pace. The action set pieces were impressive and Diana Rigg was hot. Telly Savalas was excellent as Blofield, he gave the character a suave touch. But you call tell that underneath his mack daddy act he was all business, and violent business indeed.Everything about this movie had a cool aura to it. The stunt scenes were amazing (for it's era) and the cinematography was beautifully shot. I had one bone to pick with the film. The in jokes got a bit heavy handed. Other than that it's a fun film. Too bad George Lazenby was demoted to B-Movie hell after this flick (at least he got a three picture deal with Golden Harvest where he made three classic action films).I have to give this movie a high recommendation. If you love the James Bond series you'll enjoy this one.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
65,elshikh4,"It's Not The Predicament Of ""The Other Fella"" Only !",5,21 March 2008,"This is a memorable Bond movie despite a lot of things: It's a genuine (Ian Fleming) novel, the only in the series to be done in 140 minutes to date, it got a star who performed the character just for once, and here the world famous single spy finds himself in love and gets married, and it's the only Bond movie with a sad ending, one of only 2 Bond movies - else (Goldfinger) - with opening credits that have clips of other Bond movies, over and above the first Bond movie to have the main song right in the middle of it, with montage sequence, and finally the movie which contained one of the most catchy in-jokes ever, my favorite: ""This never happened to the other fella!"".In fact, there are much worse Bond movies than this one. Here, there is a bit of suspense, action (thanks to director Peter R. Hunt), and a great music by great composer (John Barry), plus the unforgettable ""We Have All The Time In The World"" which had many reasons to be a classic: very sentimental lyrics, music, one of the last songs done by the icon (Louis Armstrong), and the emotional sign about it too as it had been sung to a love that would die after a while. BUT there were some things to bother, such as the usual silly plot; which's like eternal mark of the series, and sure Mr. (George Lazenby)!The man is not an actor. His only previous experiment was an ad that he appeared in. However, who said that Bond movies are about acting?! It needs just a charismatic British guy, with some persuasion as an actor, and (Lazenby) unfortunately got a little of both (let alone that he's Australian too!). So casting him instead of the first Bond, or - naturally for a lot of people at the time - the original Bond, (Sean Connery), was a problem indeed. But the bigger problem is that this role, for one rare time, required from its star to act. It was brutally critical position for (Lazenby) along with important developments like the love and marriage of 007, so the tragic of his wife's murder. Hence, the mission was too hard, but my problem isn't mainly with (Lazenby)'s talent inasmuch as his charisma. Many times I felt how his presence was so weak to be in a movie, action movie. His eyes made me out of believing that he's a slick spy, or a tough guy, a romantic lover, or a movie star!Btw, I watched the authentic trailer before the movie. You'll hear sentences from a very enthusiastic manly voice like: ""The name is Lazenby.. George Lazenby!"", and how he is ""A strong type of man who doesn't take NO for an answer"". Well.. He got it as another lead for Bond!Aside from that, the script bothered me. Look at Bond's bad sense of humor, and odd attitude (cutting a picture of a naked girl off a magazine?! OH MY GOD!!, that's totally not Bondy at all!!!), and how the whole Blofeld Swiss Alps facility / lair sequence was close to a farce. Then, the marriage thing. The script didn't say anything about the reason why Bond choose Tracy, played by (Diana Rigg), to marry her. For him, she was a one-in-a-million girl, considering Bond's affairs!, so why is that exactly?! Plus, I believe that the only use out of that marriage was getting his love killed; so Bond could devote himself for revenge, and searching freely for any other girl without marriage again, as the man became psychologically sick about such matter. It was a perfect melodramatic trick to make him emotionally wounded, and forever single, in the same time!I may watch (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) again for having a nice time with the music, feeding my nostalgia to the 1960s' cinema, and not for seeing how a poor actor made it to be part of a big movie (as if we don't see that daily!), but to be a wild charming James Bond with those dead eyes!I'm sorry to say it: ""This already happened to the other fella"", and was more attractive too!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
66,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"OHMSS, the Bond that everyone forgot.... and it's really a shame. It was also made in 1969 and I hate having to press the spoilers button... so the review is going to be hard and... really? It came out in 69, everyone had a chance to see it already... but whatever.Lazenby, had he continued, could have carried on the Connery Era Bond into the 70s. He still had a few Moore Era tropes, a joke or two that was clearly very Roger Moore, but his delivery, his persona, his very being were far more Connery and the cold blooded assassin would have continued, with only a momentary glimpse of heart that, we know, hardened him in some ways.It certainly sets a gold standard among 007 films and lays out some VERY important background that disproves the new ""James Bond is only a title and not one person"" argument that some people are making in order to rewrite the character entirely. Background that is revisited in Dalton's Era, thus cementing 007 as one person.Connery is not 007 anymore (and they address it in a 4th wall breaking joke from the start) but his persona lives on in OHMSS. This is probably the last of the Classic Connery Era Bonds, discounted because Lazenby is in the title role. But the mood, the character, they are all still there.This is truly the last Bond before the Era of Silly Bond started.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
67,ianlouisiana,..a wit and freshness the franchise has rarely offered................,7,8 February 2009,"As much as any James Bond movie can be called ""serious"",""OHMSS"" is a serious and straightforward attempt to film one of Ian Fleming's once notorious ""sex,sadism and snobbery"" tales.In this story it is snobbery that runs rampant with Blofeld's desire to attain respectability by proxy from the Royal College of Heraldry and Bond himself acquiring a coat-of-arms and a family motto.How Fleming must have relished such nonsenses as ""Sable Basilisk Pursuivant"" and ""Three Balls Argent"" that are spoken deadpan by the cast.In particular Mr George Baker as ""Sir Hilary Bray,Bart.""has a lot of fun with such arcana which he delivers with gentleman's relish. Adopting Bray's persona,Bond insinuates himself into Blofeld's stronghold in order to ""retire"" him. However,experienced swordsman though he is,Bond finds himself falling for the daughter of a Mafia Boss whom he encounters in a number of ""meet-cute""situations.She is played by Miss Diana Rigg,fresh from her success as ""Mrs Peel"" in ""The Avengers"".Indeed there is a moment in the movie where she holds a rose between her teeth in an echo of the title sequence of the TV series. Mr Telly Savalas is good-naturedly bad as Blofeld and gives every impression of enjoyment. The snow sequences go on for too long but generally speaking the movie has a trimmed-down look as does its star Mr George Lazenby who looks slim and fit,two things one could never accuse Mr Roger Moore of. Mr Timothy Dalton may have seemed a little too cold-blooded,Mr Pierce Brosnan too post-modern ironic and Mr Daniel Craig purely and simply a thug,but Mr Lazenby - despite a latent affection for slapping his ladies around that Mr Moore rather unconvincingly inherited - has intelligence and energy to spare and knows how to wear a good suit. His big,butch Aston Martin is the best of all Bond cars,lacking the affectation of the DB5. 40 years after its release it seems little short of ludicrous that ""OHMSS"" was almost universally panned.Beyond the crass sexism tha t makes the ""Carry On"" series seem like the work of Germaine Greer and the comic stereotype ""foreigners"",the movie has a wit and a freshness that the franchise rarely has offered,before or since.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

I was a bit weary with this movie with a new actor, the open scenes were okay, decent fight scenes but nothing compared to the passed movies. There were a few fight scenes in the first half hour of the movie, two fight scenes were decent but third fight scenes wasn't really bad. The editing of that scene was so bad and why did a punch sound a gun being shot? After that scene the movie just drag on for far to long, I was really bored for most of the movie and there wasn't really much action in this movie.And when then was, like the skiing scenes felt a bit dull as well, those scenes just felt tame and bland. As the movie came to end, I was really disappointed, with the whole movie and I hated the ending, why end the movie like that? Awful way to end a movie. I was not fan of this movie at all however George Lazenby did a decent Job playing James Bond but he was no Sean Connery. I found him better at the start of the movie about the first 30 min, I thought he fitted the role really well but some parts felt bit odd at times.I am going to give this movie lowest score I given to James Bond movie so far 4 out of 10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
69,drqshadow-reviews,Black Sheep of the James Bond Catalog,4,5 May 2014,"The black sheep of the James Bond catalog, for just about every reason under the sun. I suppose we can start with Bond himself, played for the first (and only) time by George Lazenby. An extremely green, unseasoned actor, Lazenby just hasn't the chops to do anything with the character. He's certainly got the right look for the part, and he shines especially bright in the punch-outs, which seem far more vivid and realistic than the fisticuffs of the late Connery era, but in terms of intangibles he's all wrong. He lacks the unspoken confidence and worldliness I expect from 007, the charm and charisma that makes this character who (or what) he is. Like Telly Savalas, who struggles to fit in as the villainous Ernst Blofeld, Lazenby may have fit well enough into a similar film, but here he's totally out-of-place. The plot deserves points for poking in new directions, granting Bond a tangible sense of vulnerability and (of all things) an actual conscience, but I'm afraid that only compounds its problems. The frosty scenery is nice, as are the rampant chase scenes aboard an odd cluster of mixed vehicles, but I don't have kind things to say about much else. That the series darted straight back to the old, familiar mess of silly names, bad puns and dense rivers of cheese in the follow-up, Diamonds Are Forever, is really no surprise. Still, I can't help but wonder what might have been if EON had stuck to their guns and pressed on through this particular set of growing pains.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
70,Fluke_Skywalker,"Best Bond? No, but close",8,10 October 2020,"For years this was the oddball of the Bond franchise. The one off w/the guy who wasn't Connery. It wasn't particularly well regarded, and certainly not well loved. But in more recent years it's been re-evaluated and is now regarded as one of the, if not the, best Bond movie ever. I'm not quite willing to say it's the best, as for my money Casino Royale holds that title firmly, but it may be the second best.OHMSS is very different from its contemporaries. The tone is far more serious than even Connery's most serious efforts. And don't even get me started on the Roger Moore era. It's also an exceptionally handsome film. One that looks and feels many years ahead of its time. Add in a wonderful, and tragic, love story and you've got a recipe for what should've been the franchise for at least the next decade. But none of this works if George Lazenby doesn't, and thankfully he does. And I mean really does.My previous two viewings left me thinking that Lazenby was fantastic w/the fisticuffs, but perhaps a little stiff w/the quips and the drama. Not so. I really gained an appreciation for his performance this time and I dare say Lazenby is as good here as anyone who's played the role. I can only imagine how he'd have fare two to three movies down the line, w/time to grow into the part.OHMSS starts off a tad slow action-wise, but once the action does kick in it elevates the entire affair into a really special territory, Bond film or no.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

74,JoeKarlosi,On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) **1/2,6,23 February 2007,"Every movie buff at some point runs across that odd film which is often praised to the heavens, and then no matter how many times he gives it a fair shake, it just completely baffles him as to what is supposed to be so ""great"" about it. For me as a big James Bond movie fan who has seen every installment a few times, that confounding movie continues to be ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, which I place somewhere at the bottom on the quality list, and that means even underneath A VIEW TO A KILL, MOONRAKER, and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN - the three films which usually fight for that position. It's still an above average spy movie, but not a great Bond feature, and it falls shy of actually being called ""good"".This was the sixth Bond adventure, and the first not to star Sean Connery as 007, who decided he'd had enough (for the time being). Instead we got stuck with a nobody called George Lazenby, who'd never made a movie before and whose credits up to that point consisted solely of TV commercials for a chocolate manufacturer. But the front office felt that Lazenby looked handsome enough and kind of close to Connery's image, so he was in (it's extremely difficult to believe nobody was more suitable from the hundreds of candidates who were considered). But if I'm being too hard on George, let me take a little of it back by saying he was serviceable enough for a non-actor in his cinematic debut, and at least he could handle fight sequences well. While the criticism for OHMSS begins with Lazenby, it doesn't end with him, and his casting is the least of it.The story comes from Ian Fleming's novel (which I admit I haven't read and don't care to, as I'm only interested in the film series) and it has James Bond saving the life of a young woman countess named Tracy (Diana Rigg of ""The Avengers""). Then, for some reason, Bond personally has it in for SPECTRE mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld and has made it his personal driving mission to find and apprehend him (this would have made more sense as the storyline for the next film after this, for those who know what I'm referring to). Other things begin to happen for no discernible reason, as Lazenby's 007 finds himself fist-fighting with groups of thugs who repeatedly seem to pop out of nowhere for a while, and then Tracy's father tries to talk him into marrying his daughter because she needs someone like Bond. Even though 007 says he doesn't want to get tied down, this is precisely what he winds up doing at the end of the show by taking Tracy for his bride, but at least his reasons seem to be his own, not her dad's. There is nothing wrong with the idea of James Bond finally meeting that one special lady who can melt his heart and cause him to abandon the old bachelor life... the trouble is, we can't really understand ""why her""? One of the biggest troubles with this film is that Tracy and Bond have very little chemistry together and their ""relationship"" mainly consists of the two of them in MTV-like video vignettes where they walk together, ride horses, laugh a little... and all to a sappy Louis Armstrong song entitled ""We Have All the Time in the World"". This little fling happens pretty early on, and then Tracy disappears until much later.Things get more silly as Bond impersonates a Scotsman and wears a skirt as he goes undercover to investigate Blofeld (Telly Savalas), who is now posing as an allergist running an out of the way clinic in Switzerland, but is really trying to unleash a deadly virus upon the world using his female patients as pawns. Blofeld is hypnotizing the girls who live at his clinic, giving them auto-suggestive thoughts to love chickens. All of this business is incredibly stupid, and it doesn't help matters any that Telly Savalas (future Kojak himself) is completely miscast as a newly-Americanized Blofeld - miscast, that is, after Donald Pleasence just played him with an awful facial scar (now missing) and a foreign accent, in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Pleasence himself was a step down after we'd gotten a certain feel for the persona of Blofeld, who was wisely featured only in shadow for the first few Bond films. Both actors were wrong for the part, but Savalas is worse (""who loves ya, baby?""). And how is it that Blofeld does not recognize Bond from their last encounter? And moreover, why doesn't 007 himself even consider for a moment that this past enemy may, in fact, recognize him immediately? Apparently all continuity went out the window here.OHMSS is also well over two hours and feels like it. There are some good stunts and some nice action sequences consisting of ski chases (Blofeld now does his own leg work on skis?) and a thrilling bobsled battle, but for the reasons I've mentioned, this is a lesser chapter in the long-running franchise. It would have been interesting if Sean Connery had made this his last film instead of coming back for the next one (DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER). I doubt it would have been that much better, but perhaps it would at least have been more interesting seeing the iconic Connery we'd already become so accustomed to finally letting down his guard and falling in love; as it turned out, George Lazenby was a brand new actor and sort of like a brand new secret agent, and so his commitment to one woman doesn't strike us as anything extraordinary for his Bond. This love angle would be tried again nearly 40 years later and with much greater results with the far superior CASINO ROYALE (2006). **1/2 out of ****",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
75,slokes,Same Old James...Only More So,8,9 October 2009,"At the time, and for more than a decade after, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was the outlier among Bond films, the one without Connery or Moore, without a distinctive opening theme song, and - most critically - without a cute ending. Seen now from a greater remove in time, it's easier to appreciate ""OHMSS"" not for what it isn't, but for what it is.For one thing, it's a love story cleverly disguised as a spy thriller. James Bond (George Lazenby) has fallen for a seemingly self-destructive woman named Teresa (Diana Rigg), the hard-fallen daughter of a genial Corsican crime boss (Gabriele Ferzetti). Bond beds her, which actually pleases her father since he thinks it will give Teresa a second chance on life. Thinking of duty, Bond offers to pursue the relationship in exchange for information on the whereabouts of that cat-loving supervillain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Lazenby remains the youngest actor to have put on the tux and Walther PPK, and he looks a bit callow in his one turn as 007. But look deeper and you see a performance rich and compelling.Yes, Bond was established on the movie screen by Sean Connery, and Connery remains the definitive Bond in his original cold, hard-edged style. But like critic Danny Peary observed 20 years ago, is it possible to imagine Connery in a barn telling a woman that he not only loved her, but wanted to hang up his gun and marry her? Here and elsewhere, Lazenby presents a different kind of Bond, vulnerable, uncertain, and touching.""This never happened to the other fellow"" is the way Lazenby puts it, in a wink to the audience at the end of the cold opening. To me, that's a huge part of the charm of this film.What else is terrific? Firstly, you have the best score of any Bond film. John Barry's titles music, an instrumental this time, with its crisp, chilly uniquely guitar-centered orchestration, goes very well with the ski chase that fills out most of the movie's second-to-last half hour, and his ""We Have All The Time In The World"" co-written with Hal David and sung by Louis Armstrong, remains the best of all Bond songs.Rigg captivates as the troubled heroine (""Teresa was a saint. My name is Tracy."") Telly Savalas has the Blofeld role this time, and nails it with the right smooth mix of charm and menace. You watch him purr as he holds his cigarette in an effeminate manner, yet you never lose your guard with him, or with his deadly assistant Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat, in what would amount to a posthumous performance.) Director Peter Hunt knew the Bond formula from years of editing the films. This, his only time helming a 007 flick, has the classic look of the Connery films but a freshness to its presentation that makes it stand out 40 years on.There's also the ""Angels Of Death"", beautiful pawns in Blofeld's latest world-wrecking scheme. Nestled within a mountaintop resort in the Alps, they giggle like schoolgirls as Bond appears in the guise of a kilt-wearing genealogist. Angela Scoular and Catherine Schell make for appealing conquests, though 007 somehow misses Joanna Lumley as one of the Angels, about the only thing in the movie Lazenby doesn't get right.I'm not completely sold on ""OHMSS"". The fight scenes are choppily edited, and it runs on too long in parts. Having Lazenby dubbed by George Baker for a long stretch of the film to fit an obscure point about Bond working undercover was a mistake that rankles with repeat viewings.But ""OHMSS"" is a brilliant film all told, a spy thriller that really thrills, and a Bond film that brings home the character Ian Fleming wrote about in his great novels. It's a shame Lazenby never did get a chance to follow up on his performance. At least he never suffered the indignity of becoming an old or bored 007 on screen. He's always young in this, one of the best Bond adventures, and the riveting antithesis of what you expect from 007.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

As Bond prepares to battle Blofeld at a secret base atop the Swiss Alps, his love for Tracy may cost him all that he cherishes The sixth James Bond movie is nothing if not unique, for several reasons; it's the only one to feature Australian actor Lazenby in the part, Rigg is unlike any other Bond Girl, Bond is dubbed by another actor (Baker) for half an hour of the running time, Bond gets married (unthinkable), there's no punchy song over the credits and there's a monumental downer of an ending. It deserves kudos for originality at least. Personally, I hate that ending - I can't deny it packs a punch and is well played by Lazenby but it just doesn't fit in the same way that a high-octane car chase in a Merchant-Ivory picture wouldn't fit. I remember seeing it when I was ten and thinking that it made Bond a wimp, and I still feel the same way. Fortunately, what precedes it is fabulous; the opening third is intriguing because Tracy is so wild - she's reckless, tragic, glamorous, isn't impressed by Bond and never just stands around looking pretty like too many heroines in this series. Blofeld's lair is terrific, complete with great trippy psychedelic stylings and a gaggle of international totty, and there's a fantastic two-part ski chase (complete with avalanche) segued by a great sequence with the villains in a black Mercedes 220S pursuing Bond in Tracy's red Mercury Cougar. Perhaps best of all is John Barry's sensational score, which does what he did so well - thumping ominous brass for all the action and sweeping strings for the romance, and also features the classic Louis Armstrong ballad, We Have All The Time In The World. I think this gets my vote not only for best Bond music, but probably Barry's best score of his long and illustrious career. The movie is a bit risible at times - the speeded-up fights kind of explode out of nowhere, and Blofeld's masterplan with the goofy girls is more than a little ludicrous. The structure is also a total mess, with forty minute of one plot and then a hundred minutes of another; the scene at the ice-rink which ties them together is rather well done visually (via Tracy's boots) but makes no sense whatsoever. The other liability is beefcake Lazenby, whom I kinda like - he flashes his smile and gets on with it - but he is a bit wooden. Perhaps unfairly he only got one go at Bond, whilst all the others had more chances at bat.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service, though, takes a different tact and makes what might be the smartest use of a Bond girl in the franchise.The Countess Tracy walks out into the water on a beach in Portugal where James Bond happens to be close by. He saves her from her attempted suicide only to see her escape from his clutches. He later meets her at a casino where he gets her out of a jam by fronting her twenty-thousand francs. Separated again, Bond gets kidnapped and taken to the head of the second largest criminal organization in Europe and Tracy's father who wants Bond, knowing his connection with Tracy and Bond's reputation with women, he feels like Bond is the right man to tame his wild daughter in exchange for information about Blofeld's whereabouts. The odd thing, in regards to the Bond formula, is that Bond does end up making a genuine connection with Tracy, and it takes about the first thirty minutes of the film to establish that. Aside from the action scene around Bond and the organization's henchmen taking him to their leader, the movie almost feels like a straight drama for that first half hour.The movie then forgets Tracy for about an hour as Bond goes on a Bond adventure to Switzerland where he finds Blofeld's lair at the top of a mountain and populated with about a dozen young women for him to seduce while pretending to be an effeminate representative of the London College of Arms sent to verify Blofeld's assertion that he's actually the heir to a title, a count, to be exact. Bond goes through the girls one by one in the middle of the night, and it only ends up getting him in trouble, blowing his cover. Escaping down the mountain to the nearby village, cornered and feeling forsaken, Bond runs into Tracy again, and the relief on his face is palpable. He couldn't rely on any of the girls on top of the mountain for help, but Tracy immediately gets him into her car and drives him to safety (after a chase that runs into a nearby stock car race because this is a Bond movie, after all).This is where Tracy becomes more than just a typical Bond girl. Bond ends up feeling such a sense of appreciation for what Tracy did that he proposes to her, and, because of that first thirty minutes of the film, I found it utterly believable. Tracy's a good woman with wit and can keep up with Bond. Her saving him by driving through a stock car race just feels like the kicker that would convince Bond to settle down with a woman.There's a ski chase that ends with an avalanche, Tracy getting captured by Blofeld, and Bond working with Tracy's father to organize a daring air rescue with three helicopters because MI6 won't have anything to do with the mission because Bond shouldn't have been there in the first place. It's a daring sequence (and an obvious heavy influence on the final part of the dream in Christopher Nolan's Inception) with an exploding building on top of a mountain as people run in with guns to take out Blofeld's henchmen and rescue Tracy.People belittle the movie in a certain way as calling it the one where Bond gets married, and I think it does disservice to the actual work that goes into it. I think it rubs people the wrong way because it messes with the conventions (that had grown so tired at this point to the point where I couldn't tell you the name of the girl Bond ended You Only Live Twice with even while watching the movie), but the wedding and the violent aftermath is a great place to take the character who's stuck in formula. It keeps the formula in form but changes the nature of it, providing earned context to Bond's inability to stick with a woman for more than a single act of a single film.George Lazenby, though, doesn't match to Connery as Bond. I think he's fine, but Connery was so effortlessly suave and in command that Lazenby just wilts in comparison. He's affable and can throw a punch, but the puffy shirts really don't help.Still, I think it's an intelligent deconstruction of the Bond formula with a good rendition of Blofed by Telly Savalas (though I still prefer the twitchy performance by Donald Pleasance in You Only Live Twice), and Diana Rigg is charming and intelligent as Tracy. It's handsomely filmed, though the projection on most of the close ups in the skiing sequences are way too far from matching the real footage taken on location. It's really good, but it could have used a couple of tweaks that push it further up. Maybe Connery's presence would have been enough.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
79,Spleen,"I include a spoiler or two, but so does everyone else",4,10 January 2000,"`Maligned', `abused', looked down on', `sneered at' ... but not nearly enough, by the look of things.Reason enough to malign the film is that fact that Bond gets married.  Oh, I know that he was technically married in the previous film as well: but in this one he's REALLY married.  He meets the love of his life, they decide to live out their days together, et cetera, et cetera.  Can you honestly see Bond doing this?  Well, after watching the film, I've really SEEN it, and I still can't see it.  Lazenby brings no more emotional commitment to this particular fling than Connery, Moore, Dalton or Brosnan bring to any other fling - and with good reason, because there's nothing all that special or lovable about his bride.  If they WERE going to marry off Bond, then they should have chosen -But no.  The very idea is just too absurd.  It makes `On Her Majesty's Secret Service' feel like a sitcom, where the writers insincerely offer a plot development that we simply KNOW won't go anywhere, because then there'd be no next episode.Mind you, that's not all that's wrong.  Something about the flavour, something ineffable, is off.  It's not just George Lazenby.  I mean, to my eyes he looks almost as much of a doofus as Roger Moore, and the scene with him standing around in a kilt offering double entendres in lieu of charm, has me sinking into my seat; but he's not spoiling things all by himself, surely.  The fight scenes are all wrong, the fast-motion footage that looked violent for Connery looking no more than rushed and comical for Lazenby. That's not it, either.  Maybe it's just that nothing goes right: none of the lovely inessentials (good location shooting, action set pieces, babes) are present in force, the script is weak and Lazenby and Telly Savalas are both miscast.  Pretty painful to watch, all things considered.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
80,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Head. Potato Head.,3,24 December 2020,"Did the producers actually expect moviegoers to buy Mr. Potato Head as James Bond? Lazenby has about as much charisma and s2x appeal as the wood panelling in M's office. And he looks like an extra from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. In fact, I think he's in the band at the internment camp at Andersonville where Tuco and Blondie end up as the dinner guests of Angel Eyes.Speaking of which, Draco is played by Gabriele Ferzetti, who is also the railroad baron (i.e. head bad guy) in Once Upon a Time in the West. I'm guessing that in both movies he spoke his lines in Italian and was dubbed into English. It sure looks and sounds like it, anyway; which helps to give this a spaghetti-Bond feel.It also appears to be the beginning of the Bond franchise casting a TV actress as a Bond girl. At least Diana Rigg could act. One of the few Bond girls who could lay claim to that talent.But it's all such a snooze when it's not completely offensive. First Bond smacks Rigg around and then forces himself on her. And later he's lounging around in the office looking at the Pl2yboy centerfold. I mean, can anyone imagine Connery's Bond lowering himself to that extent?Frankly I'm surprised the series continued after this movie plotzed into theatres. And no, it's not some unheralded gem in the franchise, either. It's a bona fide dog.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
81,Kingslaay,One of the worst Bond films,6,23 April 2017,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service was an excellent novel, one of Fleming's finest Bonds. The production got a great Bond girl, villain, henchman and other characters to make this a classic. There was only one problem, Bond himself. Since this is a James Bond film it is also the biggest problem. George Lazenby was terrible and unable to portray 007 in this adaptation. What makes it worse is his predecessor, Sean Connery, is arguably the best portrayal of the spy so there was a high bar. Lazenby was a car salesman and not an actor which should not prevent him from portraying the agent but sadly it did, he couldn't act. He lacked charisma and struggled to play the role. His accent and delivery of lines was terrible and laughable. Not surprised this was his first and last portrayal of Bond. A number of viewers and critics over the years have praised this film. Like I said earlier this was an excellent novel and plot with all the ingredients. So it is easy to appreciate the film for these elements but Bond on his own was disastrous and while the film had great stand alone elements its main element to tie it together was terrible. This story was perhaps better than Thunderball or You Only Live Twice however when it came to film an exceptional actor hit it out of the park. It is a big shame and big wasted opportunity that such a great novel was adapted and portrayed by Lazenby. Ion Productions and MGM are not in the habit of remaking a film in the franchise due to its legacy so it is a real shame such potential was wasted. What if Connery had played this one or it was left unused to be played by Daniel Craig with 21st century CGI that would worked beautifully in the snow locations? We can dream of the potential of what could have been but sadly it was ended when an inexperienced actor decided to wear shoes that were far too big for him. I compare Lazenby's one stint at Bond to the portrayal of Batman in the 1960s, while the elements for a great vigilante exist in fiction and literature it was hilariously portrayed. Every great series has period where it was weirdly and badly dramatized. The same elements and sources for Batman have been used to make iconic Batman movies like Nolan's trilogy. The same applied to Daniel Craig's great portrayal of Bond in Skyfall to make a script or screenplay so much more than what it it is.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
82,eric262003,"Not Classic Bond, But Still Very Good",7,7 December 2020,"With exception of a tiny flaw in the production aspect, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", the sixth edition of the James Bond series is one of the best entrees in this long running franchise that's still going to this day. The action scenes will very much have you glued to your seats with excitement and unpredictability. The love scenes were more earned than rewarded and has a bit of sadness in the end which is rare for a Bond film. And even having Bond embodying a bit emotion like grieving after his wife's passing and Bond almost coming close to resigning for His Majesty's Secret Service. The biggest flaw as the casting of Bond himself, which felt like it was cast at the last minute as Sean Connery's successor was the obviously inexperienced George Lazenby taking over and proves that he is not in the same league as Connery. Though I will forgive that it was Lazenby's acting debut in any movie (he's done a handful of commercials prior to being cast as Bond), his acting comes off rather, dull and lacking in the wit or the charisma as Connery.
The intro to Lazenby's character was quite appealing as his visage is concealed at first. The back of his head is featured, then we feature the ""James Bond Theme"" starts playing, then when the beach fight commences, that's where Lazenby's face materializes and the movie takes off after there. The oblique one-liner from Lazenby's Bond was priceless, ""This never happened to the other fellow.""
What makes Lazenby stand out is that unlike the other Bond's he can fight the physical ones and is not fully dependent on high-tech technological enforcements to help him prevail over whatever danger is coming after him. His fighting skills is really all he has to master as his acting is below par in compared to the other Bonds' before and after him. The worst part is seems to be like Lazenby tries too hard to be like Connery in his outings, but in the end it failed pretty badly. What Roger Moore succeeded that Lazenby failed was that Moore was going to play Bond to a newer approach instead of being a Connery 2.0 James Bond.Even though Lazenby's acting is rather green, there is still much to love about ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". For one, it shows that even the greatest womanizer can still find genuine true love and here Bond actually falls in love with a Bond woman and even marries her. This shows he does care has feelings towards women and are not always the flavour of the week. The Bond girl us a troubled daughter of a high-ranking European crime boss named Tracy Draco (Diana Rigg). This comes after he saved her while paying off a franc debt, her father Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) feels welcomed for Bond in becoming a son-in-law. He marries Tracy while rejecting his 1 million pound offer and they make way to their privacy for a little rest and relaxation.The romantic angle between Bond and Tracy plays a prominent role in the first 45 minutes of the movie and the dying minutes of the movie. Though the franchise is pretty much met with action and suspense, the loving chemistry between Bond and Tracy takes us to a more realistic viewpoint to the Bond character being that the kind of girls he loves are not the damsels in distress who he rescues, but who's almost at an equal to him who he could genuinely connect with. Rigg was a standout in her performance as Tracy. Like Bond, she herself can challenge the world and showcase her bravery towards danger. Though some might find her self-reckless in nature, Bond finds her rather attractive. In a film that counteracts the formula to the Bond series, the Bond girl actually usurps Bond himself. There are three pivotal scenes that truly captivates a more humane side to the Bond character in this movie, the scene where he wipe the tears of Tracy on her birthday, when he asked her for her hand in marriage and the tragic scene that will leave even the non-Bond fan to tears.For action lovers, there's a plethora of them. The main villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas replaceing Donald Pleasence) returns as he threatens the world with biological warfare which was waged in his private clinic in a secretive area located in the Swiss Alps. Taking the false name of Count de Blochamp, Blofeld goes incognito as a genealogist. Bond finds his esoteric hideout. Even though they faced off each other before in the previous film ""You Only Live Twice"", it felt a bit odd seeing Blofeld forgetting about what Bond looked like. While Bond was posing as Sir Hilary Bray, Bond makes an awkward slip and now Blofeld is after him in heart-pounding chase scenes which includes the uses of skies and toboggans. Blofeld is not alone as he has a fellow assistant named Irma Bunt (Isle Steppat) by his side.The action scenes provide some of the most well choreographed scenarios in the Bond franchise and the epic struggle between life and death will truly leave its audience astounded. Under the direction of Peter Hunt in his directing debut, we see that Hunt has mastered the action scenes with caution and the right amount of formula that was used in the Bond series during the Sean Connery era.The score was composed by frequent composer for the Bond movies, John Barry. In the 11 Bond films he composed, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is his best work. Even with the omittance of lyrics in the opening scenes, the soundtrack was majestic. The daunting ballad ""We Have All the Time in the World"" by Louis Armstrong is the perfect song for the growing attraction Bond has with Tracy. The ""James Bond Theme"" is still a pleasure to the ears.Sure after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", Lazenby stepped away and Connery return for another go around with ""Diamonds are Forever"". It's a wonderment what this film would've been like if Connery acted here instead of his successor. However, it's still great that this experimental type film shows that there would still be hope long after Connery stepped down as to this day many actors followed to get a different side to the Bond character. Even though Lazenby is no Connery or Moore, the movie takes Bond to another direction never explored before while still proving a myriad of entertainment and excitement the way Bond delivers.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
83,brando647,It's Not as Bad as Some Would Have You Believe,7,2 November 2013,"The sixth 007 adventure, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, has a reputation as the worst Bond film in the series. Anyone who believes this either: a) has never seen the movie and is judging it solely on the fact that star George Lazenby only lasted one film or b) has never seen DIAMONDS ON FOREVER, which is a hundred times more painful to sit through. This movie has its flaws, no doubt, but it's still a strong movie with a good plot. It's forgettable, but that's more a problem stemming from mediocre casting and weak performances from the principles. The film is plenty engaging while you're watching it, and the story is actually pretty good. Despite swapping out our lead actor, the movie continues (sort of) in the same canon of the previous films. Following the events that occurred in Japan in the previous film, Ernst Stavro Blofeld is James Bond's primary target but MI6 believes the chase is done. M pressures Bond to give up his pursuit of the madman, but Bond believes he might have discovered a lead in a chance meeting with a beautiful woman named Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo. Her father is head of a criminal syndicate and has information on where Bond might find Blofeld and offers to trade the information if Bond were to consider marrying his daughter. Initially reluctant, Bond's relationship with Tracy blossoms while he begins an investigation into a medical research lab in the Swiss Alps where Blofeld has gathered a harem of beautiful women to bring his latest plan to fruition.George Lazenby was not an actor when he was given the role of Connery's successor in the iconic role of James Bond. The closest he'd done was some commercials for chocolate (or something) but he was primarily a model. I'll admit, this is an instant strike against the man. I'm a major fan of this series and it's an insult that someone might've hired this man on the basis that he's good at mugging for the camera and notyou knowacting. It wasn't until about a half hour or so into the movie that I finally became comfortable with Lazenby in the role. He takes some warming up but he did a well enough job filling the shoes of Connery. I won't go so far as to say he's on Connery's level, but he's not as bad as so many detractors would have you believe. He's certainly got the smug confidence of 007. Diana Rigg (of the television series ""The Avengers"") is Tracy di Vicenzo, the first women to be more than a casual fling for Bond. She and Lazenby have a good chemistry together but I couldn't help but find it to be more than a little shoddy that their relationship is crammed down our throats over the course of a montage. We're expected to believe that James Bond, who has never seen his women as more than playthings, suddenly develops tender emotions over the course of a Louis Armstrong song. Montage gripes aside, Riggs and Lazenby are a strong pair with a believable spark between them but Riggs didn't pop off the screen like previous Bond women like Ursula Andress or Honor Blackman. If Tracy hadn't been the first (and one of the only) to win Bond's heart, there would be nothing about her performance that would stick with you after the credits rolled. Telly Savalas fills the role of Blofeld for the film, and this is where my interest wanes. Donald Pleasance was a perfect Blofeld in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. He is the man I imagine when I picture Bond's ultimate arch-nemesis, and Savalas doesn't even come close to matching him. Pleasance was sinister and his performance brought a perfect evil to the character. Savalas makes Blofeld charming, with a warm demeanor that contradicts everything Pleasance instilled in the character in the previous movie. It just feels so wrong. Sorry, Telly. You're no Blofeld.If Connery had stuck around and brought his usual awesomeness back to the role, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE would've probably be remembered as the best of the early films. In my opinion, some more thoughtful casting is all that stood between this movie and the respect it deserved. It does have a few other issues, namely the over-long run-time and a couple technical problems. The movie is one of the longest 007 movies in the series at nearly two and a half hours, and it feels like it. I blame it on the excessive ski sequences. Ski fights are boring and this movie goes a little overboard. I can only see so many henchmen go careening out of control before I get bored. It's made worse with the horrible rear-screen projection used for the principle actors. There is no way to make it look realistic and it looks horribly cheesy. And we get not one, but two extended ski chases. On a more positive note, I love the setting. Blofeld's research lab is perched on the peak of a mountain in the Swiss Alps and it makes for a wicked final battle when Bond and his compains helicopter in for a full assault. An assault that ends inwait for ita bobsled chase. With rear projection. I understand though; technology was limited at the time. It doesn't make it any less lame. I did enjoy Blofeld's scheme in the movie though. It's a little more complex than the average nuclear weapon theft and involves a dozen gorgeous women. The man knows how to plan.The movie culminates in one of the most important sequences in all the 007 films, as it gives us the first real emotional insight into his character. He opens up and expresses an emotion other than ""murder"" (murder is an emotion, right?) and he is immediately punished for it. Watching ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE can be a bit of an endurance trial, but it's a well-worth it. It's a must-see for fans of the series.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
84,Gislef,A Trivia Pursuit Entry? I don't think so...,6,3 December 1998,"(to quote Gene Siskel's comment about Lazenby as ""best Bond"").  Lazenby actually isn't too bad - he's a bit GQ model-looking, but no worse than Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan.  He gives a credible performance, except he looks uncomfortable loaded down with the sexual innuendo and one-liners. And he looks darn good in the fight sequences (which he performed in himself).  OHMSS is probably on a par with Dr. No, For Your Eyes Only, and the Dalton movies in that it gives us a gimmick-less, non-comic book ""human"" secret agent. rather than a superspy/superhero.  Stripped of his gadgets, Lazenby's Bond several times displays rather MacGyver-ish qualities.  We also see Bond as an imposter/infiltrator, and basically as an independent with very little ties to MI6.  OHMSS is certainly the last Bond movie with any substantial ties to Fleming's novels.  The supporting cast is adequate (Savalas is probably the best Blofeld, at least as Fleming pictured him), and the romance between Bond and Tracy is well-established (more than in the novel).  This makes Bond's bed-hopping at Piz Gloria a bit odd.  Other flaws are that the voice synch is really bad, to a degree that sometimes you wonder if Bond isn't a ventriloquist.  And there's one skiing sequence too many.  At 140 minutes, it's certainly hard to watch in one sitting.  That's probably one of the reasons it's not that popular.  But it's a generally enjoyable film, particularly for those looking for secret agent movies rather than super heroics.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

More faithful to the source material than usual, story is low on gimmicks and gadgets and is structured away from the constraints of formula, setting up emotional stakes that are atypical for the series; film never drags, but is low on action for the first 90 minutes (aside from a few quick, brutal fight scenes), then sets up a nearly non-stop series of spectacular chases and battles with great stunts and camerawork for the final 45. Lazenby's shortcomings are negated by a top-notch Bond girl in Rigg and visual excitement courtesy of Hunt, who had previously performed editing duties and second unit work on earlier Bond pictures (in turn, this film's editor, John Glen, would eventually helm multiple entries). John Barry's score ranks with the best the series ever produced; theme playing over opening credits is an instrumental, but the love song ""We Have All the Time in the World"" (sung by Louis Armstrong) plays during a romance montage.

88,pyrocitor,The least Bond like Bond film,8,26 October 2004,"Spoilers hereinIt's almost hard to believe that On Her Majesty's Secret Service is part of the Bond franchise, especially for the 60s, where bright, flashy exotic locations, plenty of beautiful women, tons of intriguing gadgets and completely unbelievable over the top villains with ludicrous schemes for world domination or such were more trademarks than any other decade. Here, the fantasy element is much turned down, as the film sticks to primarily one location in the Swiss Alps, there are no gadgets actually used by Bond, and, to much disappointment, Q's part was reduced to a bare minimum, only saying a few comforting words here and there, but not much else.As for the fiendish plan, well, it's about as ludicrous as usual, but retains the sense of fun from the rest of the series, so you go along with it anyway. Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savales giving a good performance, although it would have been better casting to get a European actor), after his escape from his exploding volcano base in You Only Live Twice, plans to inflict germ warfare upon the world unless they pay him a ransom and recognize his title as a Count for reasons of personal vanity.As usual, it's up to James Bond (George Lazenby) to stop the fiend and save the world. But sadly enough for the world, Bond is a little distracted by the fact that he's planning on settling down, and getting married! Contessa Tracy Di Vincenzo, (Diana Rigg, one of the most inspired bits of casting in the history of Bond movies) Bond's lucky lady, is the suicidal daughter of a rich Italian crime lord, who has nothing left to live for except her love for 007. Sound like the perfect bride? Maybe not, but she invokes a certain sense of devotion in Bond which makes him decide to more or less quit his womanizing ways. Needless to say, Bond does in fact save the world again, infiltrating Blofeld's 'clinic' under the cover of Sir Hilary Bray, a genealogy expert, complete with silly accent. After several trysts with the many female allergy patients, and being exposed for his real identity, Bond escapes in an exciting ski chase, and later returns to destroy the clinic, and meets up with Tracy again. All that is now left for the happy couple is wedding plans.Unfortunately, Bond doesn't get a happy ending this time round . Blofeld returns, a slight bit peeved that Bond has foiled his evil plans a second time, and in a totally heartless act, guns down Tracy as she and Bond drive away from their own wedding. For the first time in the series, Bond actually acts vulnerable as he tries to come to terms with the sudden death of one of the few people he allowed himself to care about. And we're left on that sad note, forced to wonder if Bond will ever be the same again. Strangely enough, Tracy's death is only mentioned twice ever in the rest of the series, with Bond giving almost no reaction to it.As the story is laid out, the plot begins to reveal it's rather obvious holes. Despite the fact that Bond is supposed to be actually IN LOVE with Tracy, he still beds quite a few women patients at Blofeld's clinic. (one per hour in fact) The main plot hole, however, is why Blofeld didn't simply recognise Bond when he arrived under the identity of 'Sir Hilary Bray' at Blofeld's clinic? Bond wasn't really wearing any sort of facial disguise, yet Blofeld seems to simply not notice the fact that his sworn enemy is standing directly in front of him. Perhaps he was due for a visit to the optometrist's, yet that's not much of an excuse...The miscasting of Bond was a major blow to the film. Why the producers would choose a previously unheard of male model in his first acting job to fill the shoes of Sean Connery, the estimated 'most famous man in the world' at the time is utterly beyond me, but it wasn't a decision that paid off. Lazenby's lazy, unenthusiastic performance really slows down the film, and he demonstrates a lack of acting experience, talent and maturity throughout. That is until the ending, when Lazenby perks up a bit, and infuses surprising drama into Bond trying to come to terms with Tracy's sudden and totally unexpected death. The sadness he projects is incredible, contrasting with how little of anything he projected up until this point.The main problem with this movie is that it moves much too slowly especially for a Bond film. The buildup is more tedious than painstaking, and takes a long time to get really involving. (Bond spends most of his time infiltrating Blofeld's clinic simply sitting around) And a lot of the more exciting parts are ruined by jumpy cameras making it impossible to see what is going on, and awful sound effects. Fortunately, there are a couple of good ski chases to keep you watching, but the idea of a bobsled chase is just ridiculous, and it doesn't prove effective here at all.Overall, On Her Majesty's Secret Service carries a sense of drama that is lost to pretty much every other Bond film. If the continuity and flow had been better, and the miscasting of the title character had been avoided, On Her Majesty's Secret Service might have been a genuine, lasting classic like Goldfinger. As it is, it's definitely one of the better films in the series, but still boasts many glaringly obvious flaws. Worth seeing, if only for the tearjerking end scene, a perfect example of how good the movie could have been if it had progressed better.-8/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
89,mentalcritic,The Bond producers get confused,8,6 September 2000,"When Sean Connery announced he would rather broaden his horizons than appear in another Bond film, an intensive search for a replacement began. The question of who would be the new Bond dominated the press to such an extent that the story became immaterial. And that is truly a shame, for what was the first Bond film to be made without Sean Connery could also have been a new beginning for the character, or at least an improvement on the increasingly silly prior episodes and their over-reliance on gadgets, fast women, and car wrecks. Sadly, it was not meant to be, with yet another thirty-seven years before we would really see Ian Fleming's Bond on the silver screen. The problem in On Her Majesty's Secret Service is that while it takes a step towards portraying Fleming's Bond, too many times it shies away fearfully, retreating into a strange hybrid of the Connery Bond and the walking self-satire of Roger Moore. Alas, it took far too long for Hollywood to learn that the more seriously filmmakers took their superheroes, the better the response would be from the audience.The question of who would replace Sean Connery in the role of England's most famous secret agent was asked by just about every news source in the world. The answer that the Bond producers came up with was met with a rather lukewarm, peculiar response. George Lazenby, a former martial arts instructor for the Australian military and a former student of Bruce Lee, bluffed his way into the role. This is especially apparent in his sole performance as Bond, where he is constantly walking around with a look that seems to say ""holy ****, I really got the part?"". Perhaps if he had been given a few more turns in the role, he might have matured into the kind of Bond that Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig have made the preference for more seriously-inclined viewers such as myself. In any event, Lazenby soon began to feel his contract tied him to much more than it did Broccoli Productions, and quit the role, claiming he would find other work. The wisdom of this decision has been demonstrated over time, but hindsight is inevitably better than foresight.What did not help OHMSS much was the indecisive nature of the script. It is clear from the opening credits music that at least the composer, John Barry, thought this should be a darker, less comical Bond than what audiences had previously seen. Yet even before we get our first dose of the actual score music, with what is easily one of the most memorable signature themes ever in a Bond film, it becomes clear that one of the writers thought the audience would not be able to handle a serious Bond. Which is deliciously ironic when you consider that the character was created by a man whose concept of flower power probably stopped dead at investigation of the possibility to kill people with them. Sometimes, the puns and one-liners are so out of place that, much like the humour stuffed into Star Trek V, it telegraphs that someone shoehorned it into the script at the last minute. Granted, the conflict between the two sides is not nearly as bad as was the case in Pierce Brosnan's two big stinkers, but it is a bit like the introduction of a radical new product with a new taste.Wil Wheaton has written on TVSquad that when one is introducing a new product in visual entertainment that may not to be to everyone's taste, the initial presentation can utterly destroy it. This, I believe, is exactly what happened to OHMSS. A darker, more inhuman Bond that coincides with Fleming's writing is not an easy thing to market. Not just because audiences are still being shovelled media that equates to intellectual junk food, but also because that was what Bond producers delivered to the world audience from the get-go. Making a Bond that is not a poor man's Adam West Batman is therefore a difficult undertaking, and should be treated with the concordant respect. It has only been in the previous year that the Bond producers seem to have woken up to this fact. Fortunately, the combination of serious theme music, the presentation of Bond really being in love rather than just using his more manly attributes to further the goals of his mission, and how all of that turns out, elevates OHMSS to be one of the better Bond films.Hence, it is also amusing to witness the publicity materials for Die Another Day and get a load of Halle Berry's claim that hers is the first Bond Girl who is Bond's equal. Given that OHMSS was thirty-three years old at the time, I suppose it is possible that Halle might never have heard of it, but someone should have at least tapped her on the shoulder and informed her that she was talking a big pile of crap. In any case, when one watches OHMSS, one will get the feeling that Tracy Di Vicenzo, as portrayed by Diana Rigg, is more than just Bond's equal. She is the missing puzzle pieces that complete Bond, and there is even a memorable scene in which a ragged, exhausted Bond who has just fled Blofeld's mountain hideaway asks her for aid in escaping his pursuers. Rigg has since been equalled by a couple of Bond women such as Famke Janssen or Eva Green, but she has never been bettered. The finale in which Bond proclaims they have all the time in the world is moving not because of Lazenby's weepy performance, but because of the awesome lead-in created by Rigg.I gave OHMSS an eight out of ten. For thirty-seven years, it was easily Bond's darkest moment, and therefore one of his best in spite of some terrible writing and acting.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
90,jeremycrimsonfox,A Good Movie For George's Only Time As 007,8,21 April 2019,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is an odd one, as the last film had Sean Connery announce his retirement from the main role of James Bond. For this film, George Lazenby, who back then was a model appearing in advertising, was cast as the agent, which he said would be the only time he would play him.In this film, Bond saves a girl named Tracy in Portugal and meets her in her hotel room, he is kidnapped by her father, who is the head of the Union Corse crime syndicate. Refusing to marry Tracy, but agreeing to continue romancing her so he can get info on the whereabouts on SPECTRE's leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, it begins a mission to stop him as the villain plots to hold the world at ransom by using his ""Angels of Death"" to destroy its agriculture if he is not given amnesty for his past crimes.George Lazenby does a good job in this, his first and only time as James Bond. This film has more of a serious tone, as here, 007 is shown to be vulnerable, as he gets scared in some scenes (like the skating rink scene). This actually helps up feel for the man, as he has become like some of us. Also, it has some good action scenes, and the ending, which I won't spoil, is a huge twist.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
91,Joxerlives,An interesting historical anomally,5,17 March 2014,"My batty old landlady used to share a flat with George Lazenby's girlfriend (according to her their other flatmate was actually dating Goodies star Tim Brooke Taylor, must have been an interesting situation). She describes how she would come down in the morning to find him sleeping on the sofa dressed in his underpants of which there were dozens of pairs scattered around the place, Lazenby getting them free because he advertised them along with Fry's chocolate cream bars which there were also a plentiful supply off because he advertised them too. It was with this somewhat idiosyncratic image in my mind that I sat down to watch this film. Obviously Sean Connery was a hard act to follow, Lazenby is almost equally good-looking but nothing like as good an actor. Ironically the one scene I think he does really well is the final scene with Bond's murdered wife, you really feel for him in that moment. The rest of the film is a mixed bag, we have not one but two Avenger's girls, Diana Rigg and Joanna Lumley. The great Telly Savalas is really wasted as a Blofield, the ski sequences are good although Roger Moore's are better. The music is excellent, we have some superb use of the Bond theme and its' variations and the final helicopter assault and bobsleigh chase are terrific. Amazed they got away with the 'He had a lot of guts' gag. Diana Rigg is quite good as a Bond girl, better than some of the screamers we've had before but hardly what you might call a liberated woman yet. So overall verdict, not bad but your glad when Moore comes along.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
92,ODDBear,The best Bond film,10,2 December 2005,"Hands down the best James Bond film of the bunch.George Lazenby steps in for Sean Connery as James Bond, the super British secret agent. Bond once again goes head to head with Ernst Blofeld and tracks him down in the Alps this time around. While all this is happening Bond falls in love (for the first and only time) with luscious Diana Rigg.The best Bond film of them all sports a very capable Australian George Lazenby, who would undoubtedly have made the role his own had he gotten more chances. Since the movie failed somewhat at the box office the blame was all afforded to him. The fact is he's actually quite good, he may not be as ruggedly handsome or charismatic as Connery (but then; who is?), but none the less he delivers on most accounts.This Bond film is also quite different from all the rest. Here, for the only time, you see Bond's office, you see him snap at his superiors (which didn't happen until Timothy Dalton played Bond), you see M's home and he discusses his personal hobby, Bond reminisces about old times and most importantly he shows real emotions and falls in love. And what's more is this film ends on a very downbeat note.All is expertly well handled in the hands of fellow Australian Peter Hunt. Having served as 2nd Unit director, Hunt took director's chair this time around for the only time in the Bond franchise. Hunt allows much time for Bond to fall for Rigg and their relationship is wholly believable and well played out. The romantic touches of the film not only set it apart from the rest but also make it all the better. But action is not far away and the film is chock full of great action sequences; those ski scenes still look great some 36 years later.Roger Moore took over the role of Bond and did a great job and a number of good films. But I still think Lazenby would have have grown in the role and should have been allowed to play Bond more than once.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
93,Beta_Gallinger,Inferior to all five of its predecessors,5,20 June 2008,"After five James Bond flicks starring Sean Connery, the actor was replaced by George Lazenby for ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", the sixth installment in the franchise, though Connery would return for one more official Bond film right after this. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from this first film in the franchise without Connery, since it was polarizing, just like the last two that preceded it. I wasn't too impressed with ""Thunderball"", but was with ""You Only Live Twice"". Sadly for me, I found this sixth Bond movie effort even inferior to ""Thunderball"".James Bond is on another mission to try and track down Ernst Blofeld, the leader of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. After he rescues Tracy Draco, daughter of crime boss Marc Ange Draco, from suicide (though he didn't know who she was when he did it), Marc is impressed, and wants Bond to marry his daughter. Being close to Tracy, Bond will be able to get more information on Blofeld, but he finds himself actually falling in love with her. After getting information from Tracy about Blofeld's plot to spread a deadly virus around the world, the British secret agent's mission takes him to the Swiss Alps, where he goes undercover as genealogist Sir Hilary Bray! While there, his love for Tracy will not help him with his mission, and he will face a number of other challenges, including hiding his true identity! How is Lazenby as Bond? Well, he's certainly not appalling, but compared to Connery, he does not stand out in the role, and is rather forgettable in it. It must have been difficult to replace Connery after five films, and Lazenby may have put his honest effort into it, but maybe they could have found a better replacement. Around the beginning, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" sometimes seems more like a Bond spoof. For instance, the scene where Bond is ambushed inside and gets into a fight. This really seemed like a comedy fight to me, and I couldn't help but laugh! The film also overdoes it a bit with Bond getting attacked and/or abducted early in the film. After that, I was bored for a long time, not finding too many surprises. Towards the end, there are some decent (or at least half-decent) and memorable action scenes, but they come after a lot of tediousness. The story is apparently supposed to be more emotional, but it certainly didn't work for me, except at the end.I can see why some viewers like this film better than some of its predecessors, including ""You Only Live Twice"". It's certainly more realistic than that film. However, for the most part, I was disappointed by various aspects of the film, and I know I'm definitely not alone. Like the last two Bond films that came before ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", this one is over two hours long, which doesn't help the tediousness of it. In fact, this one is even longer than both of them, and it sure does feel like it! While it's not all bad, it wasn't a very good first attempt to make an official Bond film without Connery, and Lazenby deciding not to continue in the role was probably a good idea, as James Bond probably wasn't his kind of role.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
94,vip_ebriega,A second look: ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.,7,28 April 2010,"I wasn't too keen with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE the first time I saw it, mainly because of George Lazenby's rather wooden performance as Bond. Yet when I saw it again yesterday after not seeing it for a very long time, I'm surprised how much OHMSS has aged well. The plot is credible enough (even with the usually tendencies of Bond movie plots to go a little over-the-top), but it's the central story of Bond genuinely falling in love make this one of the more emotionally involving 007 movies, even if it's not the best in the series (although, this remains the most praised in Ian Fleming's James Bond stories). Had Connery accepted to play his role here rather than the dated DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, OHMSS might have been the best of the Bonds.Still, the storyline here is pretty strong, and I feel sorry for not seeing that during my initial viewing. Despite Lazenby's lackluster performance (I was actually bored in some of the scenes he's in), the story actually stays intriguing and involving, with its share of a few great stunts and action. There's a long ski chase and a raid on Blofeld's secret base in the Alps, but it's not the action that made this a personal favorite amongst Bond fans. In fact some of the stunts here are average at best, but are done better in other entries in the series. What makes this one of the stronger entries is the love story in the middle. Although Lazenby is usually wooden, he actually makes a rather convincing lighthearted Bond when he is with his scenes with his on screen love Tracy, played superbly by Diana Rigg. In fact, Ms. Rigg outdoes our own 007 in terms of acting, making her perhaps one of the best Bond girls. Their scenes together are the most heartfelt in the series, making the now well-known heartbreaking ending one of the most personal moments in the long-running series.ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE may not be free from its flaws (an enormous plot hole throughout the film might bother some people), but it's a very satisfying adaptation of one of Ian Fleming's best stories and with a number of great action sequences, it's a pretty good entry in the series and definitely one not to be missed.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
95,one9eighty,"Doing things that ""never happened to the other fellow""",5,24 July 2020,"It's 1969, Sean Connery has hung up his suit, in steps Australian actor George Lazenby as the British super spy James Bond.At the start of this film Bond is in Portugal trying to get some information on S.P.E.C.T.R.E, who have been a thorn in Bond's side over (most of) the last few films. While going about his business, he prevents a woman, Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg), from committing suicide, and somehow ends up paying some of her debt. The woman turns out to be the daughter of a crime boss (Draco), and after some discussions Bond ends up dating the woman. When he returns to his job in London he is confronted by his boss ""M"", who thinks that Bond's pursuits of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. number 1, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas) has become too much of a personal obsession. He tells Bond to stop the hunt, but Bond decides to quit his role to continue the hunt instead. Miss Moneypenny hands in a leave request instead of a resignation - meaning that Bond can continue the hunt all the same. On returning to his new girlfriend, Bond gets some information that might help him track down Blofeld, off he goes to Bern in Switzerland. Finding information there leads him back to London where the trail gets hot - finally Bond has a solid lead on Blofeld. He takes the information back to ""M"" who agrees that Bond can continue the hunt after all. Back to Switzerland under a fake identity, Bond manage to get into Blofeld's Piz Gloria lair, which is an allergy research facility which is curing woman of issues they have. Bond manages to meet some of the woman, and bed them too, before uncovering the Blofeld's intentions. He is planning to use hypnosis and then toxins to threaten the western world. Escaping from the lair he meets Tracy again, the two go on the run, during which time Bond proposes to her. Once able to, they escape restarts but Blofeld uses extreme measures to trap the pair. He kidnaps Tracy and leaves Bond for dead. Returning to London, Bond tries to persuade ""M"" to launch an assault on Blofeld, but he will not do it for diplomatic reasons. Instead Bond turns to Tracey's father Draco for assistance. An assault is mounted on Blofelds's lair, Tracey is rescued, and Bond is but a bobsled distance from capturing Blofeld. Everything kind of gets resolved as Bond leaves Blofeld for dead hanging in a tree. The climax of the film sees Bond getting married to Tracey, and because that's a spoiler in itself let me go one step further and say that on their wedding day she is gunned down because Blofeld was not actually dead after all.Peter Hunt steps up to the director role on this film, having worked in other roles on other Bond films. Richard Maibaum returns to a writing role and is joined by Simon Raven - of course it would be criminal not to mention that Ian Fleming obviously write this and other Bond novels too. John Barry continues to lead the musical score with his iconic sounds complimenting the film exceptionally.After the cartoonish ""You only live twice"" this Bond film was an attempt to get back to being serious. It had a new Bond and wanted to take things in a slightly different direction with having a new Bond lead actor in Lazenby. This film had, and still has, audiences divided, some people loved it and think it was the best of the Bond films; while others hated it and don't even consider it an officially entry into the franchise. There are of course the middle-of-the-road audiences, which I belong to. I neither love it, nor do I hate it - It is just what it is.There is plenty of action and adventure, but there is also lots of cheesy and foolishness to it. A lot of the green-screen is ridiculously dated now, and a lot of Bond's exploits not acceptable in today's world (bedding people randomly while he's in a relationship, slapping women around... hang on, in retrospect that is like the world is now according to the media) - but it's a fun adventure film. If anything, slightly darker than ""You only live twice"", especially the end of the film - something well ahead of it's time as it was only really Daniel Craig versions of Bond that had that darkness in them.The darker elements aside, this was another of the films which Austin Powers parodied from the Bond world. As this film was made in 1969 you have a lot of the iconic 60's looks, fashion and mentalities - at the time it was probably on-point; however, looking back from almost 50 years in the future, a lot of it looks a little dated and camp now.Lazenby does OK as Bond, without really fully exciting me. There are times where he seems to be trying to be like Sean Connery's delivery, but then there are times where he does good with his own stylistic approach. He succeeds in humanising Bond, making him appear less than a super-hero - which is the best part of his performance. The stand-out in the film for me though is Diana Rigg - she commands attention in all her scenes. Even more so than Telly Savalas, who I expected to be the big star. Diana Rigg outshines the lot of them, but then she had screen experience in a similar role from ""The Avengers"" TV series as Emma Peel. Savalas does have a lot of experience by this time, but he's also a jobber having played lots and lots of various role types. This Blofeld just felt a little empty and weak. In addition, Lois Maxwell, Bernard Lee and Desmond Llewelyn are back as Miss Moneypenny, ""M"" and ""Q"".I would recommend this film to Bond enthusiasts. In the world of cinema, it is not a stand-out-experience and there are better swinging-sixties spy capers that score better in the world of film. It is still enjoyable though. It's relatively family friendly, but there are moments where the action isn't that fast so it may drag in parts for younger viewers.In terms of Bond films this is a 6 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 5 out of 10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
96,dglink,Odd Man Out in the Bond Series,8,9 August 2009,"The sixth official release in the James Bond franchise, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" is unique in many ways and ranks among the best of the series. The most obvious change is George Lazenby stepping in for the first and only time to replace Sean Connery as James Bond. The strapping athletic Lazenby is physically right for the part. Although the tall handsome Australian may lack Connery's ease and acting skill, he could have grown into the role if he had persisted, and the Bond franchise may have taken a more physical course rather than the suave urbanity that Roger Moore pursued. The sixth film also relies less on gimmicks than other Bond films, and ""Q"" has no cars, briefcases, or watches to demonstrate. The film's primary ""Bond"" girl is no Playboy centerfold either, but rather the accomplished Diana Rigg, who brings depth beneath the beauty and sparks a convincing romance not found in other Bond entries. Even the film's key song, ""We Have All the Time in the World,"" which is sung to perfection by Louis Armstrong, plays behind the developing love affair, rather than over the title credits.The first appearance of a Bond other than Connery also instigates a touch of nostalgia for the earlier films, and the use of music cues, clips, and gadgets from the earlier Bond films creeps in, although Connery himself is never shown or mentioned. Lazenby makes only one passing reference when he says: ""this never happened to the other guy"" after a close encounter. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is in the mold of the first two Bond films and relies on muscle, action, and plot, rather than gimmicks, to move forward. The chases, which involve skis, cars, and bobsleds, are convincing and exciting. Lazenby certainly appears capable of any feat performed, although the few wise cracks that he tosses off seem contrived and were better suited for Roger Moore. If only to answer James Bond trivia questions, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is essential viewing. However, the film holds up well and is engrossing entertainment in the tradition of the Ian Fleming novels and the early Bond films.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
97,Bob-45,Not a Bad Deal at All.,8,27 September 2001,"To understand the controversy behind `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' one must understand the events so impacting the spy genre by the time of its production in 1969.  After the back to back tremendous successes of `Goldfinger' and `From Russia With Love,' every hack producer and distributor rushed to make spy movies.  There were serious ones (`The Spy That Came in From the Cold,' `The Ipcress File'), satirical ones (`Our Man Flint,' `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' `Get Smart' ), and incredibly silly ones (`The Silencers,' `Last of the Secret Agents,' `Casino Royale').  `Casino Royale' was especially damaging, since it was (VERY LOOSELY) based on a Fleming novel, and used the character of James Bond, 007.  In fact, in `Casino Royale,' nearly EVERYBODY played `James Bond'.  `If we don't know what we are doing, how will the enemy,' was the explanation `James Bond' (David Niven) gave to explain why MI6 was calling all its agents `James Bond'.  To protect their franchise, the producers of the `real' James Bond movies emphasized in their promotion `Sean Connery IS James Bond.'   In a demonstration of  `gratitude,' Connery up and quit the series, leaving `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' which was shortly to go into production, without a `Bond.'  Arguably the most ambitious and difficult to shoot of ALL the Bond films (at least to that time), it's a miracle ANYTHING works in OHMSS. Much of the time it works VERY well, though the shaky underpinnings of the first hour frequently threaten to undo it.  There is so much choppy editing and dubbed dialogue, one begins to suspect he is watching a foreign film. The second hour plus works much better, all the more surprising since it was shot first. One reason may be that the film went WAY over both shooting schedule and budget, and there was enough made up `bad' press to put a great deal of pressure on the producers, first time director, Peter Hunt and star, George Lazenby.  In the middle of it all, Lazenby's publicist announced that Lazenby was not going to do another Bond (Lazenby is credible when he says that announcement was not his idea. One suspects, from the bonus material, that Cubby Broccoli planted that story to discredit Lazenby, should the film fail). Add to all this the films' tacked-on, unhappy ending (planned to be the prologue for `Diamonds are Forever'), which plays completely against the humor of earlier moments, and it's a wonder the film was NOT a dismal failure.  Quite the contrary, OHMSS is one of the BEST of the Bond films, filled with nonstop action, outstanding stunts, incredible sound, the best score (along with `Goldfinger') and a credible enough romance to lend it genuine poignancy.  Lazenby overcame many tremendous handicaps: having to replace one of the best known and popular actors in the world; he was 28, younger than  Connery when he made `Dr. No'; he was completely inexperienced as an actor  (OHMSS was Lazenby's FIRST movie, not just his first starring role); his accent (thick Australian outback) and the INCREDIBLE physical demands (Lazenby did many of his own stunts).  Considering all this, Lazenby is downright remarkable.  Certainly, in my opinion he is better than either the snooty Timothy Dalton or the lightweight Roger Moore were in ANY of their outings as Bond.. The bonus feature on the DVD concludes with strong evidence that Lazenby became a scapegoat, despite the eventual financial success of OHMSS. Lazenby, refreshingly displays no bitterness that his career nearly ended as soon as it began.  He's had a reasonably busy career playing character roles and we have OHMSS. Not a bad deal at all.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
98,DarthBill,Seems I owe this film an apology,8,25 September 2003,"PLOT: James Bond (George Lazenby) must foil Blofeld's (Telly Savalas) latest scheme in addition to developing a genuine relationship with a troubled Italian beauty (Diana Rigg). Will Bond get the happy ending he deserves? I must apologize for the earlier review which was incorrect in regards to the film's box office performance. It was not a box office bomb at all. Turns out it actually did very well at the box office, but research on the proper figures were off. Add to this the fact that George Lazenby pretty much disappeared probably also added to this incorrect perception.Acting wise, Telly Savalas was by far the best of the Blofelds, and an influence on the characterization of Lex Luthor in the animated DC programs by Bruce Timm. In this his one and only outing as Bond, the infamous George Lazenby is actually a very solid Bond, and brings far more physical power & presence to the part than Roger Moore, who would be the primary Bond from 1973-1985 (which even Moore admits was a mistake). Replacing Sean Connery was always going to be an uphill battle, and it's more than possible that had Connery stayed and done this Bond entry, he would have brought more nuance to it, but Lazenby still holds his own and it's a shame he didn't stay with the part. One of my favorite sequences for him is when he's trying to evade the SPECTRE villains in a crowd while bright cheerful Christmas music plays over the action, adding a creepy vibe to the scene as Bond is actually quite clearly afraid, thinking he might not get out of this one. And Diana Rigg is heartbreakingly good as Tracy, Bond's doomed one true love.Action sequences are also top notch, strong musical score as well.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
99,eminkl,"That the series darted straight back to the old, familiar mess of silly names, bad puns and dense rivers of cheese",4,22 April 2020,"The black sheep of the James Bond catalog, for just about every reason under the sun. I suppose we can start with Bond himself, played for the first (and only) time by George Lazenby. An extremely green, unseasoned actor, Lazenby just hasn't the chops to do anything with the character. He's certainly got the right look for the part, and he shines especially bright in the punch-outs, which seem far more vivid and realistic than the fisticuffs of the late Connery era, but in terms of intangibles he's all wrong. He lacks the unspoken confidence and worldliness I expect from 007, the charm and charisma that makes this character who (or what) he is. Like Telly Savalas, who struggles to fit in as the villainous Ernst Blofeld, Lazenby may have fit well enough into a similar film, but here he's totally out-of-place. The plot deserves points for poking in new directions, granting Bond a tangible sense of vulnerability and (of all things) an actual conscience, but I'm afraid that only compounds its problems. The frosty scenery is nice, as are the rampant chase scenes aboard an odd cluster of mixed vehicles, but I don't have kind things to say about much else. That the series darted straight back to the old, familiar mess of silly names, bad puns and dense rivers of cheese in the follow-up, Diamonds Are Forever, is really no surprise. Still, I can't help but wonder what might have been if EON had stuck to their guns and pressed on through this particular set of growing pains.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
100,The_Movie_Cat,The Most Flawed Bond of All,7,27 June 1999,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the most heavily flawed James Bond film, even though it tries to iron out past mistakes.For a start, there is George Lazenby as Bond. Though the producers had no choice in the matter, (Connery had left of his own will), a replacement was the ideal solution to Connery's increasing lack of enthusiasm. However, while Lazenby starts off well, a hybrid of Connery and Moore with the appearance of a young Pete Postlethwaite, his characterisation soon begins to grate. Attempts at post-modernism (notably in the praised opener ""this never happened to the other fella"" and the o.t.t. sequence where we hear Bond's thoughts) are quaint at first, but soon begin to bore. As this is a film that requires depth on behalf of the lead, this oh-so-smug attitude plays against it's internal nature. Another attempt to tone down the increasingly awry series was to cut down on the extravagant set-pieces, giving us a more down-to-Earth, intimate film. Unfortunately, Blofield's scheme is so far-fetched that the volcano hideout of the previous film is exactly what it DOES require. The idea of recreating the basic feel of the series for a new actor is commendable, but there is ultimately no connection with what has gone before, Secret Service not even feeling like a Bond film. Perhaps the weakest link is the production. Editing, audio and design are all extremely ropy, unusual for a Bond film of the era. Yet what really kills the movie is the script. Lazenby is flawed, and inexperienced, but even Connery wouldn't have been able to work magic with the appallingly facile lines Bond is given. The whole film is a series of uncomfortable exposition spliced with repetitive action sequences and perfunctory one-liners. ""He had a lot of guts"" remarks 007, Schwarzennegger-like, about an enemy whose entrails have just showered the camera. Normally capable actors (such as the Transatlantic-accented Telly Savalas, a great actor, miscast as Blofield) are hindered by the leaden script, with Rigg in particular given no opportunity to show the skills that made her so appealing in The Avengers. It's resolution, what could and SHOULD have been a series high-point, feels forced. The film does have some merit, though it's biggest crime, almost unique for a Bond film, is that it has no narrative tension.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

I thought I'd re-watch it as I have not seen it in over 30 years and have heard over and over again that it is an ""underrated, hidden gem"" that is beloved of movie buffs.It still is my least favorite of the James Bond films.Let's start with the direction of Peter Hunt. This film is shot in the ""mod"" styles of the 60's with quick cuts, blurred and psychedelic images that prolong this overly long film (140 minutes) they do not enhance it. The action is slow and the plot is plodding. Not ingredients that ensure success.So maybe a charismatic new James Bond will help?Unfortunately, no. Much of the blame on the failure of this movie has to be laid on the wooden performance of George Lazenby in his one, and only, turn as 007. They make recurrent mention of previous Bond films and this only reminds us of what we are missing by not having Sean Connery in this role. Only the performances of Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas saves this movie from being a complete bore.If you want to watch a good Bond film, watch ANY of the other ones, it would be better than this one.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
102,FilmMan47,The Most Misunderstood Bond Film Ever,5,26 June 2015,"seriously guys i am a huge bond fan having seen all 007 films from 1962 till 2012 i can say this without a doubt that OHMSS 1969 is one of the most underrated & one of the most misunderstood bond film of all time.those people who think Daniel Craig is the real bond or his bond films are good they are either blind or plain stupid Daniel Craig is a insult to James bond persona it is not bond it is a Jason Bourne wannabe.coming back to this project after Sean Connery left the producers hired a unknown man named George Lazenby for the role of 007 this was was his only & last film as 007 due to some reasons he left the role & Sean Connery came back in 1971 with diamonds are forever which is one of my favorite bond film ever along with unofficial bond film Connery did called Never Say Never Again in 1983.i don't need to explain further about this whole thing just get the DVD & watch special features it explains it all very well.on her majesty secret service is a rare film that works well even though it is not a usual 007 film yes it's got sad ending & emotional vibe into it but it explores a very different side of 007 & the depth in the character,his personal life & work etc.the bonus point is the romance element here it is by far the most extreme & effective.editor peter hunt is at the directors chair this time & created the most exiting bond film as far as the stunts & action is concerned no doubt about it once again every scene looks brilliant.The Plot:James Bond meets Draco a man who asks a favor from bond to marry his daughter Tracy & keep her safe from danger in return he would lead bond to the mansion of Blofeld high in mountains where bond will disguise himself as a professor only to find out big plans of Spectre & Blofeld for world domination.i love that angle of bond here personally as agent 007 he is a tough guy & very loyal to mi6 & gets the job done & he hangs out with a lot of women when he gets the chance but when it comes to love bond is not that type of a person who would settle down and start a family of his own his devotion is only to his country & mission is what matters to him the bond but this time he really falls for it like when bond & Tracy in start don't like each other but after some time they care for each other so much & eventually get married in the climax but fate has stored other things for bond.Tracy's death scene got me thinking a lot i mean it guys it shows that James bond is a character lives in moments i mean its in his destiny to have a extreme life his moments are short his love life is short & almost everything he does or he gets into is short & he moves on to another he gets back up every single time no matter how much anyone put him down that is why he is James bond.The Cast:George Lazenby owned this film he is superb as 007 James bond here from the beginning when he first enters the screen smoking a cigarette,Diana Rigg oh my god what an amazing bond girl as Tracy & she gets to do a lot of action here too but one guy who totally stole the show was Telly Savalas he is the best villain here as Blofeld plus he is dangerous but funny too its hard not to root for him at the same time you want James Bond to win they way he speaks & acts deep is so damn cool to watch.Blofeld's mansion is huge & loaded with a lot of hot girls as bond gets there a lot of chicks hit one him but even funnier then this there is a scene i remember where bond reads a playboy magazine but the way he holds it & rolls his eyes onto it is so hilarious.the music soundtrack is don't ask guys it is a masterpiece i tell you & the end song we have all the time in the world by Louis Armstrong will haunt you for life as it is such an amazing song.like i said before i am going to say it again a lot of people just don't get this film & fail to understand it that's why they love stupid Casino Royale 2006 but hate this for no reason but no matter whatever critics or anyone says on her majesty's secret service is a better film any day then new bond films.Overall On Her Majesty's Secret Service 1969 is a film that should be enjoyed for what it is i think it is a fantastic film the pace is slow but its worth it so forget Daniel Craig guys go for this film this is the real 007 my rating is 8/10.Highly Recommended",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
103,afonsobritofalves,Very good.,7,13 September 2018,"I was a bit disillusioned, the film had a weak history (the villain did not have a good motivation, the Geroge Lazenby did not play a big role like James Bond, and the film had rather unnecessary scenes).

105,kenandraf,Surprise surprise!!!,10,11 October 2000,"I expected the worst Bond movie and I have seen them all.I finally got myself to see this one out of curiosity and I was surprised to see how much of a stud George portrayed Mr.perfect.The man looks great because he combines baby innocent looks with killer seriousness when needed.He also was charming too and I am surprised that this was his first movie because he held his own with the acting!He had the natural acting talent!This guy was much much better than Brosnan or Dalton.It was just his unfortunate destiny to be in his prime when there was another guy who also was in his prime at the same time he was and that is Roger Moore.Moore was better than George and I think it was still a good decision to cast replace George with the best man available.It was very very difficult to replace Connery because that was like trying to fill the shoes of Elvis or Ali but George did a good job.Again I say not as good as Moore but he held his own.If only he hit his prime after Moore's term,it would have been perfect.George would have been a perfect Bond for the 90's.Dalton had little charm amd Brosnan lacks size and seems to force his machoness.This George Lazenby guy was a natural Alpha male big time.The movie was good but could have been better with a little more attention to detail like sound,editing and more consistent direction.I did not mind the long running time because the script and screenplay was adequate but small things like believability was not emphasized which is important because they decided to go to a more grounded type of secret agent this time around.The women in the mountain base wearing international costumes and eating international food lacked realism and so was other points like placing Bond in very vulnerable positions that it would be very difficult to believe he got out of(beach fight scene and Blofeld missing Bond's back from close range as Bond took pictures during the raid are some examples).Too bad because there were very good scenes and the story was quite entertaining.Regardig the producer's decision to change direction and create a more human Bond,that was ok because with out Connery,they had a chance to portray a character more like the Bond in the Novels.But it was just not to be because like I said,this guy named Moore was around and a guy like that comes aong very rarely as we all found out when the 90's came along.......",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
106,perfectbond,A missed opportunity,7,17 November 2003,"I agree had Connery stayed on this would stand a great chance of being the best Bond. What a shame. Nevertheless, Lazenby was the one who guided us through the journey of the most personal Bond yet. He was competent I suppose but such a larger than life character demands the best. Diana Rigg, who we actually cared about, was in the top tier of the Bond girls, Telly Savalas was actually quite believable as Bloefeld, and there was a welcome departure from the more over-the-top stunts and gadgets. The score and location cinematography were also quite evocative. Still the feeling of a missed opportunity to create something truly special remains...6/10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
107,jdkraus,On Her Majesty's Secret Service: A 15 year revisit,8,17 December 2013,"For a long time I considered this as one of the worst Bond movies. It's long, dry, and most importantly the new actor does not hold up to the legendary Sean Connery. This has been my perspective of the 1969 film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" for nearly 15 years. Now attempting to wrap up my new year's resolution of viewing all the Bond movies in a single year (with the exception of the dreadful remake ""Never Say Never Again""), I saved this one as among the last to watch. I was so not looking forward to seeing this in my DVD player. When I drew to a close at the final, shocking scene, my outlook of this movie has completely been misconstrued. The fact that this Bond movie is different from the other, tacky, tongue and cheek silliness that Connery and Moore have delivered for over twenty years particularly makes this film unique.Currently working through all of the Ian Fleming's novels, this movie is probably the closest/realistic adaptation to the author's imagination of his beloved character. See, the filmmakers depicted Bond as a super hero of sorts. He gets himself out of impossible circumstances, defeats the villains, and then saves the damsels in distress--a rather cookie-cutter character. In contrast, the real Bond was anything but a hero. Much of his success relied on his wit and a bit of luck. He is a vulnerable individual, just like any other human. The one-time star George Lazenby portrays Agent 007 in this way. He has skill and can make for a great fight, but he is not Superman. On the contrary, he loses the woman he loves to his mortal enemy...Blofeld. Bond can be hurt and devastated. When has Bond ever been seen like this before? Hardly ever. This is what works so well for Lazenby. The scene where he cradles the lifeless body of his wife brings both acting brilliance on his part and a strong method of humanizing this seemingly impenetrable protagonist. From a narrative viewpoint, I relish it. The fact that this movie fairly accurately captures the novel is another bonus to the picture.Lazenby and Diane Rigg as Bond's doomed lover Tracy make a great screen couple. The subtleties in their acting deliver chemistry and stark passions of love. We care for these characters and it crushes us to helplessly witness their fate. Diane Rigg in particular made a strong-willed Bond girl that can never be overlooked or forgotten. Headstrong, good-looking, and a fighter, she was damn near perfect. I am very disappointed in Broccoli and Saltzman in that they completely disregard mentioning her character in the follow-up ""Diamonds are Forever,"" nor do they give us a truly vengeful Bond against Blofeld. Shame. Shame on them.That aside, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" holds other attributes of a great Bond. Telly Savalas has a strong screen presence and makes a more formidable foe as Blofeld than Donald Pleasance in ""You Only Live Twice."" Isle Steppat evokes pure heartlessness as Blofeld's second-in-command Irma Bunt. Even Gabriele Ferzetti makes a great sidekick of sorts as Tracy's father Draco. The set designs by Peter Lamont rivals Ken Adams's work in the first five films and composer John Barry delivered his finest Bond score. His orchestral theme, appropriately titled ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" takes the place of a lyrical song during the starting credits. This set a new standard of music and creates a much darker atmosphere that most other Bond films lack. The action sequences, though sparse, are well crafted, even by today's standards. Sure, the blue screen effects are more than obvious in several instances, but the hand-to-hand fight scenes that Lazenby did by himself without a stand-in as well as the famous ski chases in the Swiss alps are vastly impressive. Who can also forget the ending gun battle or bobsled sequence either?I really cannot say that this is my favorite Bond, for I am still partial to Connery and Brosnan. This is certainly a good one though. it is very character driven and it has a strong emotional impact. If Lazenby had done a couple of more Bond films, I think he very well could have reached a level similar to Connery. He may have lacked the charisma and charm of the other Bond actors, but he certainly knew how to emotionalize the character. If he had starred in other Bond movies, they also would have taken a very different route--possibly for the better. My rating: 8/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
108,qormi,Superior Bond Film,10,9 September 2008,"Someone give George Lazenby credit for being the second best James Bond. Sean Connery showcased his substantial acting talents in the first four films. When he made ""You Only Live Twice"" in 1967, however, it seemed that something drastic happened. Connery was comatose and disinterested throughout. Perhaps he was rebelling against a lousy contract or maybe he was tired of being typecast. Whatever the reason, he seemed drugged and in need of medical attention. Enter Lazenby for ""OHMSS"". He brought new energy and intensity to the role and he looked the part. His acting talents were more than adequate and he had a great supporting cast with Dianna Rigg and Telly Savalis. The action sequences on the slopes of the Alps were riveting and the assault on Piz Gloria was a cinematic masterpiece. Aside from ""Thunderball"", this was the best Bond flick ever. Two years later, Connery was back in ""Diamonds are Forever"", taking up where he left off - in a daze, overweight, looking like a senior citizen, and completely disconnected from the role. It marked the first of the ""silly"" Bond films which Roger Moore perfected over the next fourteen years.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
109,timdalton007,On Her Majesty's Greatest Bond Film's,9,24 February 2005,"OHMSS was the first, last and only film to star Australian George Lazenby as James Bond (the only non-British islander to date). Despite this, the film remains one of the best in the whole film series and is the most faithful adaptation of any of Ian Fleming's original novels.Lazenby is nearly perfect as 007. His fight scenes are a showcase of his physical talent and his acting with Tracy (especially in the scene where the two meet in Bond's hotel room and her death at the film's end) and the scene where Bond nearly resigns from the service are proof that indeed Lazenby can act. His only weakness is the one-liners, where Lazenby is very wooden in his performance, with the exception of ""this never happened to the other fellow"", hurting his performance quiet a bit. Lazenby's performance, despite his wooden one-liner delivery, outshines the two Connery films that both proceed and follow OHMSS.Diana Rigg is the best Bond girl of the series as Tracy. Rigg, a classically trained actress and the co-star of the then popular Avengers television series, shines in the very emotional role. Tracy is not only an emotional character, she is also a tough one, as displayed in the various chase scenes, the ski chase, and the fight between her and henchman Grunther during the battle at Piz Golria.Telly Savalas does OK as the villain Blofeld. Savalas does well in the action sequences, especially the fight between him and Bond on the bobsled run and does very well in the scenes with Tracy leading up to the battle at Piz Gloria. However, Savalas is not good at the sophisticated side of the villain that takes up the majority of his time in the film and comes off as boring in those scenes.The films action sequences are nothing short of stunning. Starting with the beach fight in the teaser and ending with the fight on the bobsled run, the films action sequences stand out as original and exciting, something most action sequences lose as the film ages. The amazing ski chases are well executed and don't waste time as most action sequences do. The effect of the chases and fights are driven in by the excellent music of John Barry. Barry produces his best work for the series with the main titles and the chase music.All around, the performances, the action, the script, the direction, the editing, and the music come to make one of the very best 007 adventures that is a lot better than the two films that it is sandwiched between.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
110,Bogmeister,BOND#6: The Once Upon a Time Bond,8,30 May 2007,"MASTER PLAN: blackmail (again) the governments after sending brainwashed women throughout the world to spread an infertility virus. After 5 Bond films starring actor Connery, this was the first one without him. His replacement, Lazenby, is introduced rather coyly in the pre-credits teaser, rescuing a mysterious lady on the beach and battling a couple of thugs. Bond himself has a mysterious quality here, as his face is partially hidden or in shadows until a few minutes in. This initial sequence contains nearly all the elements which are either bad or good throughout the rest of the film. The good: classy photography, a classy Bond girl, great fights, a physically imposing Bond and a cute Cinderella flavor accentuating the mystery. The bad: in retrospect, there's no reason for the fighting, so the action is there just to show off Lazenby's abilities, not to make sense; Lazenby's one-liners, including his self-introduction ('Bond. James Bond') are seriously inferior to Connery's. Connery made it look effortless and just too smooth, whereas Lazenby struggles, probably to conceal his real accent. We shouldn't even be comparing him to Connery, however; just taken on its own, Lazenby's vocal delivery needed a lot more experience. His physical mannerisms, otherwise, are fine, even his expressions, but it's not until the end that Lazenby finally seems to be growing into the role when speaking; he nails that final scene at the end of the movie, but throughout the rest of the film, it's not that impressive. On the other hand, this being literally his first starring role, he could have been much worse. And would we really have preferred an imitation Connery in the role? What would be the point of that? There is no song sung over the credits, but a now-classic Bond score.This, of course, begs the oft-raised question of how improved Lazenby would have been in a 2nd and 3rd Bond film; based on that final scene, I would surmise that he would have been excellent. But, we'll never know. Here was a younger, more open Bond and, again, less experienced. He certainly lacked Connery's edge - but then, most actors do - that simmering ferocity which suggests a cold killer, a cruelty. So, we had here a more approachable agent, perhaps even more vulnerable (though not feminine) and the story revolved around this notion, in contrast to the previous Bonders. All of a sudden, this is a Bond involved in hurt feelings with his boss, M; we finally see Bond's office, as he wistfully goes through some mementos. It's a little staggering that, after so many films, we are just now getting to know this man a little personally. In the end, there's even a wedding, charmingly, even exquisitely filmed, with all the key players (Moneypenny, M, Q) in attendance as more than just co-workers. That scene where Bond waves goodbye to Moneypenny and throws her his hat is a terrific touch. Also, I'm not sure how well the next, final scene would have worked with Connery in the role; I keep thinking about his attitude when his Bond girl was killed suddenly in the previous one, ""You Only Live Twice"" - a shrug and it's back to business the next minute (then later, revenge, in that cold manner, as we see in the next one ""Diamonds Are Forever""). The filmmakers followed the pattern of ""Goldfinger"" in acquiring an ultimate Bond girl for this, meaning they grabbed an actress from ""The Avengers"" TV show. Rigg brings a lot more depth and pathos to the usually bland part of Bond's main squeeze and her scenes with the new Bond are obviously not par for the course.The plot of this one, involving Blofeld again (back from ""You Only Live Twice"") is pretty good, with much of the mission taking Bond to Switzerland and snowy Alpine mountain tops - fantastic aerial cinematography. Bond impersonates a genealogy professor during the middle act and his voice is dubbed by actor Baker during these portions - rather tacky. The sleek action relies on pure stunts and long chases, making ""You Only Live Twice"" seem quite cumbersome with all its huge sets and weird gadgets. Here, we see Q in the very first scene rambling on about some silly radioactive lint as the only hint of gadgetry, besides a safe-cracking copy machine later, and Bond isn't even present. The fights, while exciting, also have a frenetic, souped up quality, almost spasmodic, due to the quick editing and style; seeing these for the first time might cause eye strain, but they're fun to watch now, with Bond's fist usually whipping around at sonic speed and opponents sent flying. The chases on the skis are great and there's even an avalanche for an epic touch. The next problem with the story is that, if you've seen ""You Only Live Twice"" before this, you'll be wondering why Blofeld doesn't recognize Bond. It's not that glaring because both characters are played by different actors. If you regard this as a single Bond film, on its own, that takes care of the problem. Savalas as the main villain is more physical than the previous actor (Pleasence), able to engage Bond mano-a-mano, but he has his own limitations, coming across like a brutish mobster rather than a genius-level, master villain taking on the entire world. His assistant, Bunt, functions as the henchwoman in this one, rather than the usual henchman, recalling, but not matching the evil Klebb of ""From Russia With Love.""

George Lazenby was the only james bond actor to be the one to get married as james bond.

112,dr_foreman,The book is better (as usual),3,10 June 2007,"I should admit my prejudice right away - I really don't like James Bond, as a character or a franchise. I think his movies are generally too long, not violent enough, not sexy enough, and curiously lacking in tension. And, most of the time, he hardly seems like a spy at all; he just waltzes into casinos, picks up chicks, and gets captured by villains who explain their diabolical schemes to him. It's all rather silly.For years, I heard that Ian Fleming's source novels were better than the films. So, during a recent moment of open-mindedness, I picked up a couple of the books, including ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" And hey, I enjoyed reading it - it's just a potboiler, sure, but Fleming infused it with some energy and creativity. The unusual story involves Bond going under cover (for once) to infiltrate the circle of his arch-nemesis, Blofeld - the infamous inspiration for Dr. Evil.Predictably enough, this film adaptation is not as good as the book. For a Bond movie, it's relatively realistic, but it still includes too many improbable action scenes and ludicrous plot twists that are absent from the source novel. Alas, the book's excellent undercover segment is cut short to make room for these stupid, poorly filmed fight scenes, which often involve embarrassing sped-up footage that looks like something from a 1920s comedy movie.Regardless of whether it's ""realistic"" or not, this movie is just badly done - Lazenby is painfully wooden as Bond, and certain scenes appear to have been edited by monkeys (watch for all the arbitrary cuts; there's at least a million of them.) Telly Savalas and Diana Rigg manage to retain some dignity, but the latter is somewhat miscast as the wild child Tracy, who should really be a much darker and more troubled character.The only part of the book that isn't excessively watered down is the ending, but even that gets messed up a little. Without giving too much away, I'd just like to complain that the wrong villain does the shooting. What's up with that? It's really a shame that this movie is so mediocre, especially since the book is a fine piece of escapist writing. The whole philosophy of these Bond movies is wrong - they're too big, loud, noisy, and dumb. They simply have no edginess in my view, no impact. This should be one of the best Bond movies, but it's only effective for about its last thirty seconds. Most of the preceding material is lame.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
113,LebowskiT1000,Bond is back! But Connery isn't.,7,27 August 2003,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" marks the sixth film in the Bond series and the first without the great Sean Connery.  Prior to seeing this film I was very curious as to how George Lazenby would hold up as James Bond, and I must concede that he did a fine job.  There were quite a few times where I thought his voice sounded exactly like Sean Connery's voice and I thought he filled Sean's shoes quite well.  You have to consider the amount of pressure that must have been on poor George Lazenby, and despite that pressure he was able to pull off a fine performance. As for the other actors, they all did a fine job.  Diana Rigg was an excellent choice for the ""Bond Girl"" in this film, she's a fine actress and of course, quite easy on the eyes.  Telly Savalas was a great choice for the role of Blofeld, perhaps even better than Donald Pleasance's portrayal (I say that mainly because of Donald's voice...not very menacing).  Telly really nailed the character and has a very evil/menacing voice.  Lois Maxwell returns yet again to the role of Moneypenny, playing the role as well as ever, and exhibiting the same chemistry she had with Sean Connery. Bernard Lee and Desmond Llewelyn both return to their roles of M and Q respectively.  Both of whom play their role just as well as their previous efforts, although their screen time is surprisingly small, despite a surprisingly long film. The story in this Bond film is decent, but nothing terribly earth-shattering.  To sum it up, it's basically about James Bond pursuing Blofeld from the previous film and upon finding him, he discovers his new maniacal plan and of course, has to stop him.  What I found extremely odd about the film is that when James Bond confronts Blofeld, Blofeld acts as if he's never met James Bond before.  What happened to the previous film, did he forget about their previous rendezvous?  And on top of that, what happened to Blofeld's nasty scar on his face?  Perhaps this film was supposed to take place before ""You Only Live Twice""...or perhaps it's just bad directing/writing, I'm not sure.  Maybe if I read the books someday I'll more clearly understand this. All in all, I thought this was a fine addition to the Bond franchise, with a few problems here and there, as nearly all films have.  I enjoyed the film very much, more so than I thought I would, and furthermore, this film has some interesting twists that make this film somewhat special in the Bond films.  If you are a fan of the Bond films, than I would definitely recommend checking this one out.  I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading, -LebowskiT1000",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
114,Rickting,A flawed but accomplished entry into the Bond canon,8,12 August 2015,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the first time the Bond series tried to break the mould. They went back to the tried and tested formula with the lacklustre Diamonds are Forever, but this entry is better than many give it credit for. George Lazenby plays Bond for the only time, still after Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He goes undercover in Blofeld's clinic in the Swiss Alps to take him down and uncover his latest scheme. An underrated, occasionally derided entry into the franchise, this certainly has its downsides but it overall works. One of the main issues with the film isn't anything to do with the quality of the film; it doesn't fit in with the other Bond movies of the time. A more realistic and humanised entry which ends with easily the most saddest moment of the Bond franchise, this occasionally feels a bit jarring. A major mistake is allowing the pace to drop while Bond is at the clinic which means this is less rewatchable than other Bond movies. Although, a neat touch is that Bond's habit of seducing women, which has given the franchise quite a sexist feel at times, is what blows his cover although the fact that Blofeld doesn't seem to recognise Bond remains a silly Bond moment to rival Die Another Day.Diana Rigg as Tracy is my favourite Bond girl of all time and by far one of the most memorable and fleshed out. The last hour of snow based action sequences is hugely enjoyable and director Peter Hunt makes this one of the most visually stunning early Bond films. With humanity and emotion, this will be more accessible to some who aren't Bond fans although the more serious tone clashes with the rather silly hypnosis sequences at the clinic. The bobsled finale is superb although George Lazenby is up there with Roger Moore as the worst Bond actor. Wooden, mostly uncharismatic and just not that engaging in general, one can't help but feel that this may have been better with Sean Connery in the role. An unusual Bond movie certainly with a different tone. This deviations from the formula has likely been responsible for its mixed reception but with the best Bond girl of all time, great action scenes and an emphasis on emotion mixing reasonably well with the escapism that defines the franchise, OHMSS overcomes its poor pacing and wooden lead performance with relative ease. Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas as Tracy and Blofeld provide a strong antidote to Lazenby with their strong performances.8/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
115,Aylmer,Polarizing Bond warrants continual re-evaluation,6,16 October 2019,"When I first gave this a gander as a teen following a near-obsession with the Connery Bond films, I was so disappointed and bored by this film that I shut it off immediately after the ""just a slight stiffness coming on"" line, which even at that young age I found ridiculously on-the-nose. I hated Lazenby as he didn't have the edge or the charm of Connery, plus seemed awkward, arrogant, and all his fight scenes even choppier and sped-up than Connery's. Savalas felt like a gimmicky Blofeld and way too much time gets spent at the Alpine location (near where I used to live and ski) so I didn't find it that special.30 years later, my curiosity got piqued again and I decided to give it another go, being a little more fair to Mr. Lazenby considering his interesting story of how a model with no acting experience came to star in one of the most lucrative franchises in history. Watching him from that perspective, he really isn't all that bad if a little wooden at times and his acting is undermined by a large portion of the film where they obviously dubbed his voice. For an Australian, his ""normal"" accent throughout the film sounds nicely transatlantic and he feels in a way refreshingly unassuming, which makes sense considering he's supposed to be a secret agent. He actually gets better as the film moves along and I'm sure he would have become a well-remembered Bond had he decided to return to the role in subsequent films.My gripes now have to come with the scripting and editing. The film follows the book better than any other Fleming adaptations, but it suffers tremendous pacing issues and takes a long while to pick up steam. Considering it was directed by Peter Hunt, who had edited the previous Bonds, the editing often brings up a lot of continuity flaws and draws too much attention to itself. Particularly the opening beach sequence looks great but gets repetitive and weird with the camera just cutting back and forth from the same wide to close shot and back and all from the same position. Many of the later fight scenes suffer from under-cranked camera and a couple stunts further undone by lack of realistic physics. How did Bond jump from that cable to the car hanging from it without getting his hands crushed? How did they escape to another downhill ski slope (above the tree line) on foot right after leaving a house in a forested valley? Also irritating is how idiotic both Bond and Blofeld become when assuming one another is dead without simply walking a few feet in the snow to make sure.However I must admit that Diana Rigg is the most genuinely, confidently, vulnerably and alluringly perfect Bond Girl with Gabriele Ferzetti a very strong Bond Ally right up there with Tiger Tanaka and Kerim Bey. The love story vacillates from being cheesy and forced to feeling authentic and moving and thankfully the great action sequences toward the end of the film smooth things over. The avalanche scene in particular comes as a major highlight featuring some breathtaking 2nd unit cinematography. On top of that, John Barry provides another topnotch soundtrack up there with the best of all his Bond scores.This film isn't perfect by a long stretch and should only be approached in the right frame of mind. Taken for what it is, it contains some unique surprises including some oddly moving moments for a Bond film. It may not quite be the classic that many are making it out to be these days, but ON HER MAJESTY'S is certainly more worthy of a second look than any of the post-Connery Bond movies would be up until THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
116,FilmFlaneur,The Tender Bond,8,20 September 2000,"Reading all of the comments that have preceeded this one, the fans and disparagers of this film seem fairly evenly divided, each with fair points to make. Some hate the weaknesses in 'the Australian Bond' and deplore Savalas' performance as Blofeld. There's certainly truth in this view (although personally I find Lazenby's work acceptable - it's only in comparison with Connery that he suffers.). But the fact that there is so much critical division existing over OHMSS signifies a rare complexity and interest, for those who care to analyse these things, simply unavailable elsewhere in the series. And its reputation has grown, and continues to grow: amongst aficionados, it is THE cult Bond film (although Goldfinger runs it close).. so much so that a director's cut emerged here on video in the UK a few months, involving one or two extra scenes.Excluding the performances of Bond and Blofeld, the arguments around OHMSS arise chiefly because the character of Bond was, for once redefined (dare I suggest it) in a more mature, caring personality. Instead of being cipher for sexism, violence, snobbery and the antics of bald juvenile adventure, Bond here is allowed to be afraid, be without neck saving gadgets and, horror of horrors, to get married. The scene at the skating rink, where Bond is being hunted and hunches into a posture of resignation on the bench (immediately before he is rescued by Tracy) is incredibly affecting simply because, for once, he is *human*, not super heroic. The only word for Lazenby's Bond is 'tender' - and with all of Connery's talents portraying the agent tenderness was not something he can be accused of attempting. This is, too, the only Bond with a quiet, sad ending - an incredibly brave and artistically correct decision by a director who sadly over-estimated his audience's ability to respond to drama and tragedy, rather than the sexual sniggering and spectacle characteristic elsewhere in the series.In this film too, Barry's Bond music is at its apogee. This is the only Bond film to have no opening credit lyrics. One feels almost as they would have been redundant anyway, given the empty headed bravado or sensual sentimentality that most of the other films shout through the overheated lips of Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones and the others. Barry's score (and the poignant 'We Have All The Time in The World') is perfect. The perky march theme created out of the main title is entirely in keeping with the love-irony of the film. And when the main theme returns for the first real time (at the start of the mountain chase as Bond makes his way through the lift room to escape) the effect is magical - proud and stirring, poetic and romantic all at the same time. (A second, just as marvellous such moment occurs when Blofeld's men arrive at the chalet hut used by Bond and Tracy overnight and the two lovers escape down the slopes, fleeing like young lovers from an angry father).In short in this film, Bond has grown up and become human. To condemn OHMSS because it is not like the other films is to miss the point, as it was surely never intended to be like them in the first place. It is a great shame that the makers didn't have the courage to continue in this vein thereafter and further confound the expectations of the genre.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
117,action-6,The worst in the series!,5,7 March 2000,"George Lazenby plays James Bond for the first and the last time. The story and the actionsequences are good, but they can`t save the movie, because Lazenby is not good in his role as James Bond.  In fact, Lazenby is the worst Bond ever!   It is still worth a look if you are a fan, and need to see all the movies. The actor who plays Blofeld is also terrible.4,5/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
118,TheMan3051,On Her Majesty's Reviewing Service,10,21 November 2002,"Directed by long-time Bond editor Peter Hunt this sixth entry in the Bond franchise is quit impressive and perhaps is one of the greatest Bond films next to such greats as 'Goldfinger.'The film stars George Lazenby in both his first and last performance as James Bond. Unlike what most people say his performance is quit decent. It's no Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan but it's alright for a first time actor.
The premise of OHMSS is simple. It involves Bond effort to capture his arch-nemesis Ernest Blofeld, who, is about to threaten the world with a new kind of biological warfare. The film itself like Dr. No, contains no gadgets. But with the interesting plot and action sequences the gadgets are not being missed. The following contains SPOILERSThe character of Tracy, who as we know marries Bond and gets murdered at the end is in my opinion a great turn in the series. Let's remember that this is the sixth picture and by this time you have already began to like the character. So the fact that he is in love and later loses her because of his job is a nice touch. Why? because like I said before, by this time we can identify with the character. And we're always hoping for the best.
Now the reason why I believe everyone excuses this film is because it doesn't star Sean Connery as Bond. This is not only Lazenby's only time playing the role but at the time it was the 2nd Bond and the first film without Connery. So the fact that James Bond falls in love and later loses her is a major turning point and not having Connery, who, especially at the time was seen as James Bond was a major disappointment.END SPOILER4(****)out of 4(****)starsWE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
119,FilmFanInTheHouse,George Lazenby IS James Bond,9,18 December 2006,"When On Her Majesty's Secret Service was released in 1969, is starred commercial actor George Lazenby. Although the film wasn't a success and its star was shot down by critics, OHMSS would go on to be a success years later.Unlike Sean Connery, who was Scottish, Lazenby was Australian. This meant that his lines were going to be different. Although the famous ""Bond, James Bond"" comes out awkward, the rest of the dialogue seems to run well with the film, and you eventually forget about his speech and focus more on the story. Being one the best Bond novels, OHMSS becomes the second longest 007 movie. Before 2006, it was the longest. Running at 2 hours and 16 minsutes, the film can feel a bit slow at times, but makes up for it when Bond is discovered.Diana Rigg is perfectly cast as Tracy. You can easily see why chose to marry her. Although not a great as Donald Pleasence playing Blofeld, Telly Savalas brings his own style to the character. Gabrielle Ferzetti i believe is one of the best casting choices for his characters. He really does feel like a true father figure.The thought of having no title song might seem bad, but its actually a very good idea. The theme song is repeated a lot during the action sequences, but it feels as if its adding something more than taking anything away. We also have the James Bond theme added a lot. It's used a lot more than previous Bond films. The reason probably is to remind us that George Lazenby is the new Bond. Louis Armstrong gives us a wonderful love song in the form of 'We Have All The Time In The World'. There's only two scenes in the film where the songs really sticks out. During the montage of Bond and Tracy together and when Tracy dies. To really tug on the heart strings, they could have placed the song of the credits. Instead we have this tearful song turn into a high and exciting version of the Bond theme. Its not really the piece of music which should appear when Bonds true love is dead.Its very sad that the public back in '69 didn't give George Lazenby a chance to impress them. He could have go on to become one of the best Bonds. Instead he will remain to be known as 'the one time only Bond'. Sean Connery would again be back as Bond will return in 'Diamonds Are Forever'",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
120,dfle3,The greatest Bond movie.,9,30 July 2010,"6th of 23 Bond moviesPlot: James Bond must get close to a crime family in order to hunt down his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. How far is Bond willing to go to get his man? Is he willing to take advantage of a woman who may be vulnerable? Is James Bond the gentleman he thinks himself to be? A TV station here in Australia is currently running a Bond marathon which I've been watching. Had been avoiding this movie in the past because it seemed to have a reputation as a misfire in some respects. Anyway, given with what I knew about some of the plot, I thought it best to get the DVD. It was definitely worthwhile. Didn't really make the kind of notes on it that I have for the previous films but here's why I think this movie is the best Bond of them all: 1) It's the funniest Bond movie I've seen...haven't laughed as hard or as often as I have in this movie. Made a note that I liked Bond's line re Tracy's father's matchmaking. The film has an unusually high number of zingers in it.2) The relationship James Bond (played by Australian George Lazenby) forms with Tracy di Vicenzo (played by Diana Rigg) is the greatest in Bond movies. By that I mean that Tracy surpasses all Bond's other love interests...she actually seems a real person, with a mind of her own...she's not just a token sex symbol for the audience. Bond has very much found his equal in her.3) The movie is genuinely moving. It has heart. Even though Lazenby seems to have been given bad career advice by his agent (by not making any more Bond movies), this has the effect of Lazenby owning this particular Bond at this particular moment in his life. I can't imagine this movie meaning so much for me if Connery had been in it. A Bond movie has never been so real in so many different ways as here...even in the midst of its cartoony elements. With Connery, this moment in Bond's life would have become disposable. And if Lazenby had continued on, for me, that would have spoiled his legacy. The next movie was the rather silly ""Diamonds are forever"" (with Connery) and then the terminally dull ""Live and let die"", with Roger Mooore. For me, it's fitting that Lazenby owns this moment in time.Random notes I made on the film: * For the first time in a Bond movie there is a direct address to the audience by Bond...it serves to acknowledge that Connery is no longer Bond, but also that the movie knows this and will have fun with it.* Lazenby is initially a bit wooden, but that merely reminds me of how wooden and bored Connery came across in his final scene for the previous movie, ""You only live twice"".* Bond smokes in this film...he has a different sort of presence to him...but then again both Connery and Moore evolved their portrayal of Bond...Lazenby never had a chance to.* The movie has some brutal fights...perhaps some of the best or the best up to that point.* Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny is a much more interesting character in this movie...love some of her micro-expressions here and there is a lovely scene with Bond, Moneypenny and M. Unfortunately, Moneypenny reverts to her usual superficial self in the following movies after she showed some truth in this movie.* Watch for the incongruous scene where Bond carries a pornographic magazine in public after reading it! Hmm. The movie does have some other saucy scenes too.* Watch for a stuntman in a scene involving a car explosion at a race...gosh! Was he hurt? * This movie completes the trajectory of what all that stuff about wine was...you know, how Bond is such an expert on it. In this movie he displays knowledge of the finer things in life...e.g. where a certain kind of caviar comes from. Had to look up ""lepidoptery"" when he mentioned it! Anyway, what all these character traits of Bond seemed to be leading to is the revelation that he is an aristocrat...not sure if author Ian Fleming was too, or if this was his wish fulfilment. So, if heraldry fascinates you, there is much in this movie to please you. Back to Bond's lineage...it's stated that an ancestor of his was Sir Thomas, a baronet who died in 1734.* Not sure what the word is, but I think his family's motto (in the heraldic sense) in this movie was ""Orbis non sufficic""...which translates into ""The world is not enough""...a title that would be used for a much later Bond movie.Again, this movie is the pinnacle on the portrayal of a love interest for Bond...the dynamic and cross-examination between him and Tracy is greatly drawn.P.S. Recently The Age newspaper's The Green Guide tv guide/entertainment liftout reviewed this film (17/05/2018) and mentioned something interesting:""The spotlight fell on an unknown Australian model, George Lazenby. He looked the part, but the producers disliked his voice and for most of the film he is dubbed by George Baker. The disembodied voice sounds ghastly. Other than that, the film is a gem, pure Bond of the old school"".That's on page 10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
121,Al_The_Strange,OHMSS Review,8,21 September 2015,"Of all the classic Bond films, this one represents the most drastic deviation. It's a darker, more serious adventure that takes the character to more profound levels of peril and tragedy.Right from the start, the film differentiates itself with its dreary imagery and a hard-hitting fight scene on a beach. Then there's a long, winding series of fights, deception, and intrigue. A good chunk of the film is devoted to a lengthy chase across Switzerland, which includes a ton of skiing, a huge avalanche, and a car chase. It eventually builds up to an all-out battle in the mountains. Then there's the ending, which is the one thing that pushes this whole film above and beyond the normal levels of a Bond adventure. It is a dramatic and profound turn for the character, and it has to be seen to be understood.The story's generally more of the same: Bond has a mission to find a bad guy, reveal the evil plot, then take him out. He spends most of the time undercover, so the thrills and intrigue are much more grounded. The actual plot that's revealed is as outlandish and weird as they come. What matters the most are the characters: Bond is still the man, but the love interest provides a touching flourish that gives the story more weight.Most of this film features good photography, but some shots are a bit hectic. Editing is very punchy, to the point where shots become compressed to mere seconds, and it almost appears agitating (though not nearly as bad as most modern movies, like the Bourne series, or Quantum of Solace). For a film from the 60s, it's pretty wild. Acting is quite the mixed bag. I was never a fan of George Lazenby, but the more I watch the film, the more forgiving I am of him - he embodies the voice and swagger of the character well enough. I'm still not a fan of Telly Savalas, whose portrayal of Blofeld feels very odd and foreign to me. I do love Diana Rigg in this film. Writing is okay. This production has good-looking locales. Some of the sets, props, and costumes are a bit gaudy and weird, and most special effects look kinda bad. John Barry's music score is superb - his main theme is so dramatic, it's chilling. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of Louis Armstrong's love theme.Even though there are odd things to hate about OHMSS, it is a bold film that offers an intriguing direction for Bond, and offers a little more substance to its story that gives the ending a proper punch. For that alone, all Bond fans need to see the film at least once.4/5 (Experience: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Pretty Good)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
122,willcundallreview,A very underrated film,7,7 May 2014,"Rating-7/10On Her Majesty's Secret Service is one of the most furious Bond film's there are and George Lazenby's one and only outing as Bond in which he does a good job in the end. A pretty good film that is close to being a straight good movie but nevertheless does the job well with Bond facing some of his most difficult villains of all time and a Bond girl who could finally get to James Bond's heart and maybe make himLove. The story is full of action, adventure and good old Bond fun with guns, cars and Bob-sleighs? Yes Bob-sleighs feature quite a bit here as the majority of the film is set in a Swiss ski resort. It goes at quite a slow pace at parts but then certain bits can be very fast paced action and well done as well because some Bond stunts can seem just plain fake, but there done quite well in the late 60's flick. Finally I especially enjoyed the more sophisticated Bond who didn't sleep with everyone he met, maybe toned down just the tiniest from Connery's portrayal.Lazenby as Bond is well, well he looks the part and even his hair seems perfect but his acting skills are not as sharp as Connery and even his voice seems to subdued by his surroundings. Diana Rigg as the Bond girl is perfect and she is fine throughout the entire film, the rest of the supporting cast excluding the main villains and Bond are average but overshadowed by the main roles like they should do. Telly Savalas as Blofeld is perfectly quirky and although not seeming evil as previous, he seem's to serve up a rational Blofeld, who doesn't kill so many people as always.Written OK directed like that too it is nothing special and there is not too much that is needed to be said about it all. The stunts do though because they are brilliant although obviously near impossible as we see with every Bond film to date but in any case it was fun to see. I loved the setting the Ski resort which doesn't make it any better or worse but serves to give you a beautiful background with all the things also going on, who knew so much snow could look so great.It isn't without negativity at all and I already said what I thought about Lazenby, but also some people may find the story drags a little and that there are too many skiing sequences but then again they can be fun to see as well. Also the script is ridiculous like other Bond's and put's some crazy scenarios but also one part which is funny is Lazenby when he has his voice dubbed into a posh British accent by another actor(Lazenby could not do the voice) but any way's it doesn't affect loads.I think any Bond fan will like this as it has many things which Bond is known for and makes for a fun watch for even those who have never seen Bond if there around. Also if adventure is your choice then well he does go on an adventure but he stays in one place for long time so maybe not for you people but people can like this game a lot.I give it overall a 7/10 and this is deserved fully, people will find it Good but also poor as well, but I think many people don't like Bond generally or only the modern one's. Just watch it and enjoy it, savour Lazenby's solo role and witness what I believe to be the saddest Bond ever(you will get what I mean by the end).",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
123,majikstl,"""All the precious things love has in store""",6,11 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE: What a mouthful! Yet, it doesn't really mean much within the context of the film. With such a name the implication is that the Queen will have a significant role in the story, either with Bond protecting her or doing a mission specifically for her; which isn't the case. It is a remarkably un-sexy name for a Bond film. 4 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Bond plays white knight to a damsel in distress and meets Tracy, a.k.a., Countess Teresa Di Vicenzo. We also get to meet the new James Bond, a.k.a., George Lazenby. A clever set up for the story and a way to deliver a classic line: ""This never happened to that other fellow."" 8 points.Opening Credits: They flash images from all the previous Bond films across the screen, just in case we get confused because a new man is playing 007. Yes, we get it; it is a James Bond movie. But the motif is time and the images appear to pour through an hour glass -- which also, at first, looks like a martini glass. Pretty cleverly done by pro Maurice Binder. 8 points.Theme Song: It is, if not the best Bond song, at least the most under-appreciated. And interestingly enough, it isn't played under the opening credits, but rather as background for the ""falling in love"" montage between Bond and his bride-to-be. I'm not sure if that is the best use of the music, but that's irrelevant to the fact ""We Have All The Time in the World"" is a beautiful song, yet strangely melancholy in its message of hope and promise. Its poignant irony is underscored by the aged voice of Louis Armstrong, for whom this would be one of his last recordings. It's bittersweet and haunting, the last thing you'd expect in a Bond movie. 10 points. ""Bond, James Bond"": Good-looking in a geeky sort of way, Lazenby seems right a home in the coveted Bond role. Considering the pressure on him, he gives a remarkably poised and confident performance, especially considering that it took even Sean Connery and Roger Moore several films to grasp the role. 8 points.Bond Babes: Bond falls in love and gives up the Secret Service to get married. You need an extraordinary woman to make that believable and they certainly found her in the wonderful Diana Rigg. A fine actress, she also comes to the movie as a cultural icon from her years as Emma Peel on TV's ""The Avengers."" We know she can hold her own against Bond, yet she is subtle enough as an actress to not overwhelm fledging hero Lazenby. It's worth noting that the story bogs down noticeably when Rigg's story is sidelined in favor of the usual Bond intrigue. If only all the Bond girls were this lovely, intelligent and talented. 10 points.Bond Villain: Somehow the creepily nerdish Ernst Stavro Blofeld played by Donald Pleasence in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, has morphed inexplicably into the swaggering thug embodied by Telly Savalas. He's a more active presence, yet oddly less threatening. Certainly less interesting. 6 points.Bond Baddies: With the focus on Blofeld, the film has little room for much more than the usual army of nameless, faceless henchmen. Ilse Steppat as Irma Bunt, Blofeld's second in command, shows her bloodthirsty side late in the film, but otherwise she's just another prudish, middle-aged harpy. 4 points.Plot: Blofeld hopes to blackmail the world (again) by threatening the world powers with an infertility virus that could annihilate entire species, including humans. Bond infiltrates his lair posing as a genealogist. Pretty lame. 3 points.Production values: A step backward to the earlier films. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing; the films were getting pretty slick and glossy and OHMSS has a darker, grittier feel. Alas, it would be the last stand for that type of adventure, as the series would soon embrace both campiness and coyness as its hallmark. 7 points.Bonus Points: Minus 10 points for killing off Diana Rigg. Okay, it was preordained and fully expected considering the nature of the series, but she was the best thing to happen to the series in years. Indeed, they could just as well have killed off James and turned over the series to her: ""Bond, Tracy Bond!"" Yeah, I like that.Summary: There have been many horrible deaths in the Bond films -- by guns, knives, explosions, strangulation, sharks, piranhas and even gold paint -- but nothing quite compares with the way Lazenby committed career suicide by walking away from the series after his one brief moment of glory. Fame, money and a chance to become a cultural icon and he gives it all up and becomes a trivia question instead. It's kind of sad, because OHMSS could have been the start of great things.Bond-o-meter Rating: 58 points out of 100.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
124,michaelarmer,On Her Majesty's Secret Shagging,9,21 March 2020,"A great Bond Film, yeah, that's right, despite all the slagging this film and George Lazonby got, this is the best pre Pierce Brosnan Bond film, and is better than a couple of his, for me only Daniel Craig's Bonds are fully better.
The action scenes are great, only one gadget and not much in the way of fancy cars to divert attention from the drama, and it is reasonably well acted. The music score was the best ever, and it was directed well, well paced, it also had the only time 007 got married and the saddest ending. The authentic locations of Portugal (although not mentioned in the film) and Switzerland (again) add to the quality.It helps having a good actor playing Blofeld in Telly Savalas, George Lazonby is good (I know his acting is not great) despite what people say. The role does not require Shakespearian style acting, it is an action movie, so he fits in well and provides a couple of tongue-in-cheek comments which raise it a little. Diana Rigg is good as Tracy, but not great, Gabriele Ferzetti (an Italian) is her father, he is easily the most handsome man in the film, but they dubbed his voice, he is supposed to be playing a Portuguese crime boss, but his dubbed accent is Italian? Ilse Steppat plays Blofeld's Hench-woman ok, although her dubbed accent is a bit dodgy, despite looking a bit of a monster, Ilse Steppat was extremely beautiful in younger years, and a good German actress, unfortunately she had a Heart attack and died age 52 straight after this, they wanted to use her in the next film.Bond themes:- some are their but others are missing, no Felix Leiter, no Title song, although it had the great Louis Armstrong song 'We Have all The Time in The World' in the middle, M, Q and Moneypenny were in it, just, but the Henchman was a woman, although she did not do any fighting, the nearest to a Henchman doing fighting was the main guard, played by a Russian Wrestler called Yuri Borienko, but he was not featured that much. Only one gadget, a safe cracking photo-copier and cars did not feature much, although Bond did use an Aston Martin DBS Vantage, the best car in the film was Draco's Rolls Royce. Spectre was in it again, obviously, and there was a Casino scene.Bond Girls: - some argue that there were at least 13 in this film, because of all the models used to play the 12 allergy girls, but I only count 3, because of the ones he only had a romantic interest with, Diana Rigg [no. 20] was the main one, and the only one to marry him, of course she had to die, which was the case at the end. The others were 2 of the models, Angela Scoular [no.21] who played Ruby Bartlett (not Barrett as some name her), who pretended to be from Morecambe Bay and had a dodgy Lancashire accent, but who was actually a Londoner, and possibly one of the least prettiest Bond Girls. And Catherine Schell [no.22) (Hungarian, not German as some describe) who played Nancy and was easily the most beautiful, and had a sparkling career in acting. The Chinese girl played by Mona Chong was indicated at, but nothing was shown in the film. Other notables from the Models were Joanna Lumley (English), Julie Ege (Norway) and Anouska Hempel (New Zealand) who had long careers.Continuity was a bit of a problem and there were a few mistakes, that's why I have not given it a full ten, but not too many to worry about, a Great 007 Film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
125,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,1 February 2005,"Definitely one of the most emotional Bond films, and one of the strangest for several reasons. Lazenby plays the role only once, and does an OK job, but he seems neither strong or serious enough to play the character effectively, or is he capable of dealing with the charm or humour as well as the other actors. However, he acts well and ensures that the film has become a strong favourite.Bond marries a Countess in order to gain her family's help in finally bringing down SPECTRE and Blofeld. Blofeld is planning to unleash a germ which will completely destroy life, and he is using Women from each country to complete his plan. He keeps them at his mountain lodge, and gives them subliminal messages in their sleep. Bond infiltrates as a Scottish historian, but soon finds himself genuinely falling for his wife. Bond ends Blofeld's plans, but he escapes, and in a shock ending, gets his revenge on Bond.The film gets marks for its dark finish, and for having some of the best action sequences in the series, and we get to know Blofeld better here than in any other film Savalas gives him an almost jolly edge, while previously he was pure evil. However, his smile is clearly a mask making his deeds all the more frightening. Unfortunately, Loius Armstrong's song is overused, but the theme tune is good. The audience now wanted an end to Blofeld, and began to see Bond in a different light- as a tragic, lonely figure.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
126,theshadow908,The first bad Bond...,5,13 January 2007,"Sean Connery is gone in this 6th installment to the James Bond series, and he's replaced by a nobody named George Lazenby. In this movie, Bond chases Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the leader of SPECTRE, to the Swiss alps, where he has taken the identity of a count. At his Swiss hideout, he is brainwashing a group of women to do his bidding. Also, Bond finally meets a girl that he falls in love with, and the couple end up married, but as it turns out, the marriage ends in tragedy...This movie might have been a little better with Connery, but it's still not that great.First off, every James Bond film in the series up to this point was able to balance action and plot perfectly, making some really good movies. This movie ruins that. Right from the extremely awkward and strange (not to mention corny) opening sequence, the movie does not seem like a Bond film. The new James Bond even makes a corny comment about Connery by saying ""This never happened to the other fellow."" Thankfully, the characters of Moneypenny, Q, and M are all there to keep the movie looking like a Bond film. The plot to this movie is extremely boring, and it gets ridiculous at times, like Blofeld, a ""criminal genius"", is using air headed women to do his dirty work for him. The film makers either made a big continuity mistake or decided to ignore the previous Bond film. First of all, in You Only Live Twice, Blofeld was pale skinned, had a huge scar on his face, and he was Russian. In this movie he has dark skin, a perfect face, and is American. An even worse mistake is that Bond has met Blofeld, and knows what he looks like, yet in this film they don't even know each other. The end action scene is goofy instead of exciting, like the earlier Bond films. The only good thing about this Bond film is that it's interesting to see Bond finally fall in love. I liked the emotional ending where Bond gets married and Moneypenny is shown standing off to the side, heartbroken, and Bond throws her his hat. The very end where his wife is murdered is rather sad, but the emotion would have been even better if it was Sean Connery playing Bond.All the actors from earlier films returning are as good as they ever were. Unfortunately, George Lazenby isn't that good as Bond. His suave British accent is adequate, but his mannerisms are goofy and awkward. He can't deliver the jokes as good as Connery. Telly Savalas' performance of Blofeld isn't even close to being sinister. He's just there, like he's not even important.Overall, this is the first Bond film in the series that wasn't that great, and it marks the very beginning of the downward slope the series went on through the 70s.5/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

129,RiffRaffMcKinley,Connery Shouldn't Have Said Never Again So Soon,3,31 January 2009,"""Casino Royale""'s final half-hour is about as boring as 007 has ever gotten... except for the entirety of this thoroughly irritating 2.5-hour mind-number that reduces James Bond to James Bored.First of all, there's nothing wrong with George Lazenby as an actor... but this role clearly wasn't right for him. He turns 007's most classic lines into a depressingly bad kind of Amateur Night. Of course, he isn't nearly as bad as Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan (yes, you read that correctly), and he's probably hampered by the utter transformation that takes place: of all the times Bond has fallen ""in love"" (i.e., Solitaire, Vesper Lynd, etc.), none was quite so irritating as the obnoxious Tracy di Vincenzo, played by a normally quite talented Diana Rigg.The film flip-flops between very poorly staged action sequences (at least 90% of which take place in the Swiss Alps) and Jim mooning over Tracy to the tune of such songs as ""We Have All the Time in the World""-- which doesn't even sound right in Louis Armstrong's voice. The plot (is an allergy clinic really just the tool of Ernst Blofeld?) is better suited to a cheap knockoff than a film in the actual series. And the villain who comes closest to being even remotely chilling as an evil figure... is named after a cake.Connery was not the best Bond (Roger Moore, come on down!), but he shouldn't have left the series so early. At least with him on board, it wouldn't have been as bad in an otherworldly sense... it would still be deplorable, but at the end of the day, you could have said something for it other than ""oo... pretty colors....""",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
130,OttoVonB,What's Going On Here???,8,5 August 2013,"The 25 (and counting) films of the Bond franchise form a unique franchise in that you can just pick one randomly and end up with anything from a gripping thriller to a doomed romance, sci-fi rip-off or absurd spoof. This is also because many of these films are so steeped in the tastes of their times.Most reviewers here will comment on the merits of OHMSS: it's the most faithful to the spirit of Bond, it's the only one where he does any actual spying, etc. Perhaps. That means giving the film the benefit of the doubt, especially in technical terms, as this is very much a product of the 60s. And yet perhaps the best way to enjoy the film is to revel in its psychedelic ""what were they thinking"" glory.Where do we start? Well with one-shot 007 George Lazenby, affecting in places were he not inevitably compared to almost every other actor to play the part - especially Connery - and all of them better. Again, not to the spirit of Ian Flemming's Bond, but as a screen character. The one-liners sink like the Titanic but Lazenby deserves credit for pulling off the emotional parts better than Connery ever could have. It's the parts obviously written for someone like Connery that fail the most. The parts where the creators tried new things however, are out of this world...There's your typical sped-up 60s scuffle, but now you get it on skis, in a mad who-cares- about-continuity chase between some very feisty stunt-men. There's the ludicrously wild bobsleigh chase with Telly Savalas' Blofeld. Thank God for Telly Savalas! There's Bond sleeping his way through the villain's hostages for info... These are the bits where you can tell that somebody really tried, and probably did so after snorting a few lines. People easily dismiss Lazenby, but it's nearly impossible to forget him with tears in his eyes, an unthinkable thing under Connery's watch. Nobody knows the title song, yet this offers two haunting musical masterpieces for the price of one: We Have All The Time in The World, and John Barry's mad moog-flavored score, the saga's best. If you embrace the madness, there's a lot of fun to be had, and certainly not all of it guilty.Not sure what was going on here, but I liked it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
131,tforbes-2,Impressive,10,27 December 2006,"So many of the IMDb reviews have covered the good points of the film (as well as the flaws) that it is hard to say much of anything that is new. But I think that, had this film come out in the 1970s, it might have fared better critically than the Roger Moore outings, as well as its own outing in late 1969. People just did not seem ready to accept a substitute Bond.And that's too bad.George Lazenby did an impressive job, and having Diana Rigg as one's leading lady did not hurt, either. The overall story does owe much in tone to the 1963 Bond film From Russia With Love: Panoramic, thrilling, yet with personal moments and lots of humanity. Thankfully, we are reminded of how human James Bond really is, and that quality tended to get lost in some of the gadget-laden films. No wonder why Sean Connery got sick of the role.The Bond films looked like they were becoming old hat by 1970, because of changing social standards. Indeed, the following film, Diamonds Are Forever (my personal favourite), was really considered passé by many critics. However, On Her Majesty's Secret Service turned out to become a genuine classic, and deservedly so.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

133,TheHonestCritic,This is one of the most underrated Bond films in the franchise. Does it really deserve that?,10,20 December 2020,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), when I was a child, I didn't really like this film that much, I thought it was just okay. However, the more I watched it, the more it grew on me as I got older and I really appreciated it for what it was! This movie is a masterpiece, all the way from beginning to end and it is now my fifth favorite Bond film. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. Out of all the Bond movies in the series, this one has the most unique storyline. In this one, Bond falls in love and eventually gets married! I won't spoil the ending for those who may not have seen this film, but it's a shocking surprise and make sure you have some tissues with you if it's your first time watching. Other than that, the plot is very exciting and it keeps you hooked all the way through. Blofeld recruits 12 women, cleverly named the ""angels of death"". His plan is to get all of these women infected, in order for them to secretly spread bacteriological warfare when he eventually releases them. Wow, now that's what I call a tension-filled plot! It takes advantage of every potential opportunity to elevate the story and has fun with it. The action and fight scenes are brilliantly filmed and choreographed, the excitement never ceases and you're always guessing what's going to happen next. At 142 minutes in length, it's one of the longest Bond films in the series. But, it's one of the shortest 142 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie. When a long film goes by fast, then you know it's good! All of the acting is superb, from all of the actors and actresses. The best performances come from George Lazenby as James Bond, Diana Rigg as Tracy and Telly Savalas as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The craziest thing about George Lazenby as Bond, is that this was the one and only time he played Bond. Which is a shame, because I thought he did a phenomenal job with the character! He is my fourth favorite James Bond actor, below Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery. I wish George did more movies as Bond, because honestly, if he kept going and grew more into the role, he could've been just as good as Sean Connery. Fun fact: referring to the excellent fight scenes, one of George Lazenby's friends was Bruce Lee, who taught him how to fight. Those skills are shown in all of the fight scenes and really help to accentuate the brutality. Out of all the Bond actors, he was, by far, the best fighter. Plus, he did a lot of his own stunts! George had serious potential to be one of the best Bonds in the franchise. I honestly prefer him over Roger Moore, who is also great as the character. Any way, let's get back to my review. Diana Rigg is incredible as Tracy di Vicenzo. She is certainly one of the top five best Bond girls in the whole series. Telly Savalas does an incredible job as Blofeld. There have been a few others who played Blofeld throughout the franchise, but Telly does the best job with the role. He was cold, calculating, yet suave. Which is perfect for any Bond villain! The rest of the actors and actresses are just as strong in this film. As far as the sets/locations go, they are stunning and give this film a fantastic atmosphere. My favorite location is Blofeld's lair, Piz Gloria, in Switzerland. That is such a cool location, and it's actually still open to the public today as a tourist attraction. Now, that's a place I wouldn't mind checking out some day! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Barry is stellar and it really helps to tie the film together. John Barry is one of my top 10 favorite film score composers and this soundtrack is no different. It's definitely one of the best film scores of the whole series! My favorite part of the soundtrack is the theme song. It's one of the few Bond themes without any lyrics. However, it doesn't need any lyrics to do it's job, yet it speaks such volumes and sets the tone for the plot perfectly. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is an action and spy movie masterpiece. I can watch it over and over again and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it today, or Blofeld will make you his next target!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
134,mnpollio,A great story rendered inert,4,23 March 2007,"With the departure of the iconic Connery from the series, filmmakers attempted to ratchet things back down and present a relatively faithful rendering of Ian Fleming's novel. Many insist this is one of their favorite Bond films (with the caveat of Connery being missing), but either the mists of time have allowed them to elevate it or they are seeing something I have missed. I rank this as one of the more disappointing - all the more astounding since it sports one of the more durable plots of the series.Bond: George Lazenby makes his one and only appearance as Bond. I don't wish to browbeat the poor man, as anyone who followed Connery was likely to be torn apart, but he truly is inappropriate. He is entirely too lightweight. He never seems comfortable in the action sequences nor does he have either the physical or emotional heft to define the role. He much reminds me of a stand-in inserted into the action until the real leading man shows up. Perhaps he would have grown into the role over time, but thankfully we will never know.The villains: Telly Savalas becomes the second actor to attempt to define the Ernst Blofeld role in progressively weaker performances. Ilse Steppat fares a bit better as hench-woman Irma Bunt, although she appears to be aping Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb just a tad too much.The women: Diana Rigg provides the film's only true enchanting element as the classy Countess Tracy Vincenzo.The action scenes are nothing spectacular. The entire sequence with an undercover Bond attempting to infiltrate Blofeld's mountaintop lair, populated by a bevy of buxom babes, is increasingly silly, especially when one considers that Blofeld already knows Bond's appearance from their earlier conflicts and his disguise is so thin. The film is well-written, but it is in the execution and the casting that it falls apart. The ending would have entirely more impact with a better actor in the lead. The thread that holds the most interest is the romance angle, which functions as its own separate plot and only tangles in with the spy antics in the final third of the film. The less said about the ghastly Louis Armstrong theme song, the better.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
This was a very slow moving Bond film... and a very poorly written story like they were upset they had to do a Bond without Connery.
Lazenby truly wasn't bad probably better than Moore and Savalas did the best with what he was given, (every role he's played he's been Kojak) an evil Kojak doesn't pull off well.
1. Bond and Blowfeld met in ""You Only live Twice"" what's with the ridiculous cover, and Kilt?
2. Even when in 1969 what type of father tries to convince an agent, that his daughter doesn't need a psychiatrist but a man to love her like a man! LOLThis is a film that tries to be legitimate but it's still lunacy on a Moon Raker level without the humor. I also have to hear some other guys voice over Lazenby when he's undercover? Does a kilt, glasses and an accent make you unrecognizable to someone bent on your destruction since Dr. No? From Russia With Love they put on Bond masks to practice killing him!
With a story like this you can't blame the actors just a horrid story line from a continuity perspective.
Dark Bond, Serious and sardonic Bond or whimsical and clever Bonds don't get married that alone kills the Bond mystique.

141,stormhawk2021,"Not perfect, but a realistic Bond film",7,27 June 2017,"Sean Connery retires from the 007 role and incomes Australian model- turned-actor George Lazenby to fill in his massive shoes. Does he succeed? OHMSS was the first in the franchise to attempt the depiction of a more-vulnerable James Bond and this movie also breaks one of the franchises biggest clichés at this point...James Bond gets married to the Bond girl! This movie has a lot of good things going for it. The cast is very well-rounded. Diana Rigg plays Tracy, daughter of a mobster and the woman that Bond falls in love with, and she is fantastic. Equally fantastic is Telly Savalas, who replaces Donald Plleasence as Bond's arch nemesis Blofeld. I think Savalas is my personal favorite actor to play Blofeld because he feels more like a person that can exist in real life. The ski-chase action set pieces are also a joy to watch and first-time director Peter R. Hunt does a pretty decent job, at times giving the proceedings a very 60's trippy vibe. Not only that, but John Barry offers some of his best music compositions for this entry. It's just a shame about Lazenby though. Lazenby's lack of acting experience really sticks out like a sore thumb and in a way, perfectly demonstrates the fact that playing 007 is not as easy of a feat as one might expect. Despite having a decent chemistry with Rigg, Lazenby's performance just left me cold due to his lack of one- screen presence and it doesn't help that most of his dialogue was awkwardly dubbed in post-production due to his heavy Australian accent. The only time Lazenby displays any sincere acting chops is in the film's heart-breaking ending. Despite Hunt showcasing decent prowess for a first-time director, his weakness lies in filming hand-to-hand fight sequences because the editing gets so choppy and the bizarre camera angles really brings unintentional comedy to some fights scenes. Also this movie was just way too long for me and could have used a better editor at the helm because I found myself bored a few too many times, especially during the drawn-out second act in which James Bond is undercover in Blofeld's lair. In the end, a part of me deeply admires how much this film attempted to shake things up with the franchise but in the end it's unique elements never end up combining into a satisfying whole.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
142,jonathanruano,On Her Majesty's Secret Service,7,28 September 2009,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is not the best instalment in the James Bond series. The new Bond, George Lazenby, is a dull fellow. There are some great scenes where Lazenby's Bond is rebellious and irresponsible, but they hardly compare with the rebelliousness of Sean Connery's Bond. Lazenby's Bond also comes across as cold, which is an interesting development, but it is too bad that he could not be as cool as the previous Bond also. Yet even with a duller Bond, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" has some wonderful moments. That part in the film where Bond's love interest Tracy (Diana Rigg who plays her role brilliantly) comes back to Switzerland and shows up on skates to rescue 007 (who is at his wit's end in a skating arena) from his enemies is one of the best love scenes (if it could be call that) ever put in a Bond film. You will never see any other Bond girl showing that kind of initiative. Then there are the action scenes which are truly fantastic, partly because of John Barry's brilliant score, but also because of the original direction of Peter R. Hunt. Critic Pauline Kael has called Peter R. Hunt an ""action wizard"" and from watching the action scenes it is not too difficult to imagine why. Hunt is especially good at filming and editing action scenes so that every visual you see lasts for a few seconds and it seems that the fighting is occurring at a much faster pace than is really the case. The chase sequences on skies are also remarkable. Unfortunately, film directors since then have drawn the wrong lesson from Hunt's film, which is that any James Bond film can be turned into a commercial success if you put in enough chase scenes. But before films relying on chases came along, Hunt achieved a balance between exciting chases and plot and character development.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

And Diana Rigg wanted to get over her Emma Peel character in The Avengers so it was a good deal indeed to see her. And Telly Savalas does a great interpretation of Blofeld...The story is a cliff hanger when Bond gets discovered by Blofeld's hoods.

We never learn the answer, despite the fact that Bond's cover story hinges on it and that M takes the time to remark on the strangeness of it. Lazenby is a poor choice for the role of Bond. He exudes youth and fecklessness, as when he flips through a Playboy magazine while trying in vain to appear nonchalant. The only really good aspect of the film is Diana Rigg's portrayal of Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo, Bond's only wife so far in the series. Self-assured, experienced, erudite, and capable of defending herself, she is the benchmark by which Bond women should be measured.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
146,rparham,"This film's uneveness is no longer a ""Secret""",7,13 November 2006,"After five films, Sean Connery had decided that he was done with superspy James Bond and hung up with Walther PPK (although not for good). Producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were not about to let the series die, however, and began searching for a replacement. The one they selected was Australian model George Lazenby, who took over the role for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Lazenby would prove to be inadequate to the task, however, and his single entry would be the longest Bond film yet, and unfortunately longer than it needed to be. Some think On Her Majesty's Secret Service, save for Lazenby's presence, is the best of the series, but the film is too long and lethargic in its pacing to really deserve that title.On Her Majesty's Secret Service finds Bond crossing paths with self-destructive Theresa (Diana Rigg), nickname Tracy, who is the daughter of an international crime boss, Draco (Gabrielle Ferzetti), who pleads with Bond to take her under his wing and right her dangerous course. Bond initially refuses, but eventually finds himself falling for Tracy. Meanwhile, he is on the trail of SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas), and discovers him holed up in Switzerland, running a clinic for women with severe allergies. Bond infiltrates the clinic and discovers that Blofeld has brainwashed the girls to be used as his agents once they return home.On Her Majesty's Secret Service is one of the more ""serious"" Bond films, eschewing some of the outrageous gadgets and over-the-top action sequences for ones that are a little more grounded, and that aspect is fine. However, director Peter Hunt and screenwriter Richard Maibaum have also crafted a film that is simply too long and drags at enough points that by the time the film begins winding down, you are ready for it to be over. Part of the problem is the fact that the villain's plot, brainwashing girls at the school, is rather pedestrian and fails to be very compelling. This element quickly only becomes a footnote, though, as the film then goes through several other sequences and plot developments that saps much of its strength. The film isn't too complicated, there is just too much and it goes on too long.No discussion of On Her Majesty's Secret Service is complete without examining George Lazenby's turn as Bond. He is, undoubtedly, the weakest actor to fill the role thus far. His performance is not a complete waste, it is acceptable, but falls far below the level of every other actor ever to take the part. This hurts On Her Majesty's Secret Service more than other Bond films, because here an important element is the relationship between Bond and Tracy, and he just can't sell it. For her part, Diana Rigg is one of the more memorable Bond girls, much more self-assured and independent than many who would end up opposite 007. But their romance, which should be touching, just ends up falling flat. Telly Savalas also does not really stand out as Blofeld, Donald Pleasance's turn was much creepier in You Only Live Twice.On Her Majesty's Secret Service has lots of great action sequences, and they can be entertaining while in progress, but the overall momentum of the film is so limp that they just serve as just temporary respites from a film that just overstays it's welcome. Also missing is humor, which was a key ingredient in Connery's films, and while many will claim that this hems closer to the original Ian Fleming character (which I won't debate), the humor in the previous Bond films was a important element, and here it is all but missing. I prefer my Bond a litter harder-edged, but not completely humorless.If some of the fat had been cut from the screenplay, and Connery had been in the role, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have been a decent entry in the Bond series. As it stands, it is a just okay one, but could have been capable of much more.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Now it seems people are seeming to like it for it being closer to the book than any other Bond movie has, and in my opinion I am a bit mixed.There are many recognizable jokes about the recasting of Bond in this movie that if you pay attention to are really funny (Except for the montage one which was boring and pointless) and those sort of jokes they felt were important so people got used to the new Bond.As for the acting of Bond in this movie, George Lanzenby certainly is NO Sean Connery, to be honest I don't know why they would have casted him, an Australian model who had little to no acting experience and they decided he would be the best Bond, but despite these setbacks I must admit he does a good job although I do prefer the other Bonds over him.The Bond girl in this has a lucky award, she is the first Bond girl Bond has ever decided to marry, and the sad ending in this is the first of only two films where he has fallen in love and lost all within a matter of seconds.As for the film compared to the others before it, On Her Majestys Secret Service I fell can not be deemed better or worse, it is better in some ways with the different feel to bond, and worse in some ways as in Lazenby and the montage scene at the end.Overall, Lazenby is alright by this is definitely not my favorite Bond film.

At least they could have provided some relief from watching this guy or may I say bearing him. If it weren't for the names you'd never guess that this was a Bond film.The villain was poorly written. Just like the entire film. The plot seemed interesting and motivated me to pick this up to watch, but the execution is just so poor, it's not even funny. This is the worst possible execution of a plot such as this.There are some people calling this as the ""Best"" Bond or ""one of the best"" Bond films or Top 5. I was watching its trailer on YouTube and there was this comment saying that this was the best Bond actor ever. Period. And absurd stuff like that. I don't know where are these people coming from. They must have either worked on this film or be the lead's relatives or also possibly be high on crack. There's no way a sane person can like this third class film.Just don't watch. I wasted 2 1/2 hours watching this so that you don't have to waste yours. Even if you are done watching every goddamn thing, I don't know. Maybe pick up a book. Go out and sit in front of a tree and watch it grow. But don't watch this abomination.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
151,son_of_cheese_messiah,The oddest Bond ever,5,7 October 2010,"By oddest I do not necessarily mean worst. Fact is, I really don't know what to make of this.Plus points: the introduction of a new Bond in the role vacated by Connery, obviously caused a big rethink in the franchise. No such ""reboot"" would occur again until Casino Royale, which has many similarities to this. No gadgets. There are many action sequences, removed from the formulaic patterns in other films. Diana Rigg makes for one of the most interesting and sexy heroines in the series (and she cannot really be called a Bond girl). Likewise Telly Salvalas is uncommonly charismatic as the villain. The music is also perhaps the most appealing to appear in any Bond. In particular the ""we have all the time in the world"" motif is most affecting.Negatives: Lazenby lacks the presence of most others to have played the part. The action scenes are often choppily shot. There are long passages when nothing much happens; in particular near the start the scenes with Bond and Tracy do not really go anywhere fast.The plot is rather incomprehensible too. And of course, the downbeat ending is infamous and must have left the original audiences with a puzzled and disappointed feeling. Blofeld was caught in a tree but no one went back to pick him up? Then he is not mentioned again, so we assume he's either dead or in custody, but then he just happens to be driving by after Bond's wedding and shoots his wife? As far as expressing grief, Lazenby is far too bad an actor to pull that off. So one is left with a sour taste at the end.Having said that, it is commendable they tried to do something a bit more original even if it is less successful than the later Casino Royale.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Lazenby makes a good first showing and I would like to have seen him go on to do ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" too bad he was eventually replaced by Moore who made Bond into a cartoon buffoon. I find this movie full of suspense, beautifully photographed with great action scenes. Diana Rig is wonderful as always, the best Bond girl by far. The supporting cast is exceptional.

153,aura772,"Not bad, but not the best.",7,8 October 2007,"George Lazenby is no Sean Connery that's for sure. He is not as unpredictable and charming as Connery's Bond is. At some point, he is talking more then Connery and is so predictable.The other elements in the movie were good. The effects were good, the script was awesome. It's unbelievable that James Bond got married! His wife was shot and then he started crying... That was sooo sad! James Bond is like one of the most known lovers in the world, and he was getting married! Lucky lady, because a man like him would never settle for anybody that's not special.However, it is of course the relationship between Bond and Tracy which gives the film its emotional heart. OHMSS sees Bond fall genuinely in love for the first and only time, and personally I found the film's romantic scenes both tender and touching, particularly for being so unexpected in a Bond film. The casting of Diana Rigg as Tracy helps immeasurably in making us believe in this romance, as she is a rare example of a proper actress taking on the role of a Bond girl, and her dynamic, spirited performance makes it easy to see why Bond would fall for her and marry her. It also helps the film's tragic conclusion, itself unique in the Bond franchise, pack far more of an emotional punch than might otherwise have been the case.This one might be the most unique Bond movie of all.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
154,vailsy,probably the most underrated Bond movie of all,8,4 November 2012,"6.8 IMDb rating puts this among some of the worst early Bonds which is totally not true. Obviously when this was released audiences were disappointed that Connery had not reprised the role, and now people rate it poorly because they do not recognise Lazenby as a well known Bond There is a lot to like about OHMSS though, it has a distinctly modern feel about it compared to many of the Bond movies that came after, for example a majority of the skiing shots are real and very good, the lighting is excellent and even tricky effects like the part where one of Bond's pursuers falls over the cliff look pretty bloody good Lazenby's Bond is low tech and tough, sound familiar? Very much like our modern day Bond, Daniel Craig.. some of the scenes in this movie are very similar to Casino Royale actually including the beach intro. The fight scenes are very close and tightly choreographed It also has Kojak (Telly Savalas) in it who in my opinion was the best Blofeld. It also has Joanna Lumley and the very beautiful Diana Rigg (Emma Peel, The Avengers), who is probably the best and classiest Bond girl ever The movie is a hidden gem among the Bond catalogue and it is rated by many hardcore Bond fans as the best of the lot. One wonders what might have been had Lazenby continued in the role. Instead we got Diamonds are Forever and then Roger Mooore..It is certainly amongst my top 5 Bonds (alongside Dr No, The Spy Who Loved Me, Goldeneye and Casino Royale).

Telly Savalas as Blofeld??? I like Kojak, but this just seemed like terrible casting. He doesn't fit the bill, and his well-known persona distracts from the role. It is like having Anthony Hopkins play Ace Ventura. Great actor--stupidly matched role. Lazenby is not a convincing Bond in many parts of the film. He seems more like the genealogy bozo he is masquerading as, instead of 007. Then, he gets married, only to have her shot up by Blofeld. There is a luge chase-scene which is just goofy, among many other random sequences. The whole plot about a bunch of robot women that will spread a virus across the world was surreal and bizarre. There are no memorable henchmen that really stand out, and the movie is so damn long for no reason. So much time is spent at the ski resorts, wooing the countess, visiting the beach, fighting in hotels, and exploring Blofeld's lair while wearing a kilt for an hour or more-- It honestly feels like 2 or 3 separate movies and scripts that were poorly edited together with little reasoning. Also, the fight scenes--- LOL--- Every time Bond hits someone, it is as if they speed up his punches, and he gives some super combo uppercut that looks phony with fake sound effects, as if he is a character on Killer Instinct or Street Fighter video games. It is so noticeably bad and strange-looking, that I can't believe they kept that in the final shots. It reminds me of Chuck Norris watching the episodes of Walker where he jumps onto a helium balloon from another balloon in mid air, or jumps on a moving airplane and forces it to pull over, etc. Did he really watch this and think that it was action gold??????? Apparently so. I love 007, and I like a few things in this film, but it was way too cheesy, and Lazenby was more feminine and silly than Roger Moore, who himself pushed that side of the character quite a bit. Connery, Brosnan, Moore, Dalton, Lazenby, Craig= in that order. Craig is a boring killing machine cyborg, btw, who might as well have been played by a robot, Jason Bourne, or Jason Statham.

157,Brucey_D,Bezants!,9,8 September 2017,"Bond (Lazenby) goes after Blofeld (again), foils his evil plot for world domination and in the process falls in love with Tracy (Rigg).This is one of my favourite Bond films certainly, possibly my favourite Bond film. Opinion is divided over the merits of Lazenby but I think he makes a good fist of it. Too bad he couldn't stand the limelight; he arguably went through the full gamut of emotions concerning 'being Bond' in one film that other actors (like Connery and Moore went through in several films.The film isn't overly reliant on daft gadgets and the action sequences are -although not perfect- quite believable on first viewing and well-paced.Telly Savalas makes a pretty good bad guy, but his accent is at odds with other Blofeld representations. Savalas actually had fairly generous ear lobes; his 'surgically removed ear lobes' are almost certainly just folded back. I don't think Savalas is shown in close rear view unless wearing a hat, else this would be obvious.One thing that is pretty obvious if you have ever been to the alps is that they are not arranged so that you can leg it on skis from a chalet near a road one minute and be descending a short while later from the top of a mountain at high altitude. Nor is it likely that a few seconds after leaving a place like Piz Gloria, a.k.a. the Schilthorn (on foot) you will find yourself at the top of a bobsleigh run. But such are the liberties taken when making a film of this sort.Whilst it is possible to go through the film in slow motion with a fine-toothed comb and find various dubbing and continuity errors, it stands up very well when you just watch it in the way intended. The editing is on the whole very well done and generates a fine sense of pace which is appropriate for each scene.The ending....ah...

158,carologletree,"Lazenby isn't Too Bad, Neither is the Movie",8,7 January 2016,"This film is quite controversial. When it first came out, it was heavily criticized for starring George Lazenby and for being a love story. Time has been kind to the film, however, as many people are going as far as saying that this would have been the best Bond movie if it had starred Sean Connery, with others saying that this is the best Bond movie regardless. My view on it is that this is a very strong movie with some flaws.Let's start with Lazenby. I actually don't think he's that bad, especially considering how inexperienced he was at this time. Yes, he isn't as manly as Connery, as funny as Moore, as edgy as Dalton, or as sly as Brosnan, but I feel that he gets the job done. Who knows, if he had been given a chance to do more Bond films, he might have gotten better.One major flaw is that Bond and Blofeld are acting like they've never met each other before. The reason for this is because in the novels, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is where they first come face-to-face and is the book before ""You Only Live Twice."" They were trying to follow the book the closest that they could. While I respect that they were trying to do that, they didn't need to follow that part of the book, because in the movies, they already had them meet previously in ""You Only Live Twice"". Following that part of the book made for a really awkward continuity error.I found the film to be very overlong with the first hour of the film being quite slow-paced. I also didn't care for the subplot with Blofeld brainwashing the women to do the dirty work for him.However, the main plot of the movie is very believable and compelling. The action scenes are some of the best in the series. The bobsled sequence was simply unbelievable.Diana Rigg's Tracy is one of the few Bond girls that has a real personality, and her chemistry with Bond has some real spark because of how believable it was. Telly Savalas was pretty good as Blofeld, although he is sorely lacking the menace that Donald Pleasence gave to the role in the previous movie.The music score by John Barry in this movie is quite possibly my favorite music score of the entire series and ""We Have All The Time In The World"" by Louis Armstrong is a sweet and tender song.Of course, the ending is undeniably heart-breaking. I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it.I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like a lot of people have been saying, but this is a very strong film overall with a lead actor that was unfairly judged.RATING: B+",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
159,Ibuk,On her Majesty's secret service-pretty good effort,8,16 June 2008,"I have to admit I wasn't always a fan of this entry, I found it rather dull and had hardly any action. I saw it on the DVD shelf at my local videostore and decided I should give it another go. I am seriously glad I did, every time I watch it I seem to appreciate it more. OHMSS was a very unconventional Bond movie, it showed a more personal side to Bond that none of the previous movies had failed to achieve. George Lazenby was a fine replacement for Mr Connery, who quit after YOLT but then got brought back in for DAF. Diana Rigg was rather good but Teddy Savalas was brilliant as Blofeld, in fact one of my favourite actors to play that role. The musical score which features in the opening sequence is one of my favourites. The scenery on the alps was very impressive indeed especially when Bond is being chased by Blofeld's men. The tearjerker finale was very impressive and remains in my opinion one of the best endings to a Bond movie. OHMSS is a very good Bond movie that I am ashamed to say I once disliked.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service is just superb I put it in the top five Bond films easily. Although I must admit I do wonder just how great it would have been if Sean had appeared as 007, maybe then people would have accepted Bond getting married as they had grown to know Connery after five appearances as 007.

No. With his wooden acting, terrible accent and most of all, lack of Connery charm he's the biggest disappointment in this movie.

A deep, romantic moments, combined with the powerful ending. So deep that we didn't even miss the Q, till he showed up at the end.

After being called into seem M and being relieved of duty he is offered the unexpected chance to find out exactly where Blofeld is from the father of one of his previous conquests. After going undercover to find out exactly what is going on he finds Blofeld with a plan more extraordinary than any he has previously hatched.This is the film that is sad for a number of reasons, the first being that we never got to see what Lazenby would have done after this (I always wondered what a more serious approach would have done for Moonraker) and also it is sad that Sean didn't do this one, as the script is one of the finest of the entire series, with one of the most amazing moments when Bond is cornered, trapped, with no way out and Diana Rigg shows up looking amazing and his face is a picture as he suddenly realises he is not alone. Many comparisons have been made between this and Casino Royal, and for good reason, as they take Bond to places he hasn't gone before, In this it takes him on a path to being something that he has never been ...Happy. We see this also in Royal and his reactions both ways when he feels he is betrayed and when he is loved. Many women have shared his bed, but few shared his soul, and if you were ever going to get a beautiful woman to do that then Diana Rigg would surely have been it, beautiful, stunning in the green dress and worthy of spending a lifetime with.Not gonna be everyone's cup of tea and Lazenby's performance is branded as either wooden of supreme. Personally I think anyone would have struggled after Connery, and he does a reasonable job, the direction by Peter Hunt is great and it's sad that he kind of got shafted after the box office being inferior to Connery's. The other big star of this film though is the music, with a John Barry score that is just mesmerising, the opening them when you hear it so recognisable and has been used countless times in trailers and on TV, the most prominent recent use being on the Incredibles trailer. It is Barry's best work and carries the film with an air of menace that is palpable right till the end.The ending of this film though is the thing that marks it as different and makes for a film that is not afraid to shock and not give the standard Hollywood ending that everyone expects.

163,Davalon-Davalon,Bond. Deadly Bond.,1,14 October 2006,"This happened to be the one Bond film I had never seen. I don't know why, I just hadn't gotten around to it. Well, now I know why. This movie (and that's a questionable term) is absolutely deadly. I got through about 20 minutes of it before being hit by an incredible desire to go to sleep.First off, there's no ""theme"" song in the beginning, just some God-awful meandering tubas or bassoons trying to make things ""exciting""; they don't. Second, we start off with a questionable chase which ends up with Bond (an absolutely dreadful George Lazenby) spotting ""Tracy"" (Diana Rigg; stunning, yes, talented yes, but in the wrong movie) stumbling off into the ocean in heels and a sequined gown (she oddly kicks off her heels before attempting to ""drown"" herself -- gee, why didn't she just toss all her clothes?). Bond attempts to save Tracy and is rewarded by being attacked. All this takes place on a bright summer day, so bright that it is hard to see who is doing what.After this supposedly ""exciting"" opening, the movie drifts from slow to fast to slow to fast, with some incomprehensible story line about Tracy being the daughter of a crime lord who wants Bond to marry her. The scene where Bond and the crime lord ""chat"" about Tracy goes on and on and on, with both of them smoking and chatting and doing NOTHING.Then, after some supposed shenanigans with Tracy, a couple more smash-up fights, and a showdown between Tracy and her father, Bond and Tracy are suddenly in some sort of 1960s Georgy Girl romance, where they run on the beach and twitter and coo, and ride horses, and take walks through lovely gardens with fountains. Great. When exactly does the movie START? While George could certainly throw a punch and looked comfortable in his tuxedo, he had absolute no charisma. I kept waiting for Sean Connery to enter the frame and say, ""That'll be enough, Mr. Lazenby. The REAL James Bond will handle it from here."" Sean Connery has it all: looks, charm, sex appeal, charisma, a sense of humor, fighting skills, acting skills -- his close second was Pierce Brosnan. Other than these two great stars, it is a real wonder that this glitch in the Bond series did not do the entire franchise in.There may indeed be something exciting after the first twenty minutes, but other than acting as a sedative, I cannot possibly recommend this film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
164,C22Man,The real secret is just how good this is,7,7 July 2015,"Bond Review.Title: A bit long winded in all honesty, but sounds appropriately stylish.Pre-Titles: Bond is driving in Portugal when he notices a woman running into the sea to commit suicide. He manages to save her, engages in a fight with two thugs and watches her flee. This is a brilliant opening and easily one of the series best. The fight is as vicious as you could want and is shot with great intensity. We are also introduced to our new Bond in a stylish way.Theme Song: John Barry provides the instrumental theme and it is fantastic, a great call back to the first two films. It uses a distinctive synthesiser sound to great effect and just has an exciting sound to it, getting you ready for the action that lies ahead.Plot: Bond is given leave and is asked by crime syndicate boss Marc- Ange Draco to propose marriage to his daughter Tracey, and in return he will tell Bond the location of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bond later learns that Blofeld plans to release a deadly virus and must balance the mission with his love for Tracey. This a different kind of story for Bond and a welcome change to the formula. It is really interesting to see him fall in love with someone and it is believable, plenty of time is given to develop the romance between the two. Blofeld's scheme is a bit over-the-top, but it works fine at providing the main mission for Bond.James Bond: George Lazenby does a serviceable job in his only outing as Bond. He is a little wooden when it comes to delivering certain lines and looks uncomfortable with many of the quips. However, he does look perfect for the role and he certain has a physicality that can't be denied. Lazenby handles all the action well and does a much better job than many say.Bond Girls: Diana Rigg is excellent as Tracey, easily one of the best female leads. Tracey comes across as someone very competent and intelligent, she doesn't need Bond to look after her and she has a dignified quality. Rigg expresses the Tracey's emotions very effectively and you genuinely believe that Bond would fall for a strong woman like her.Villains: Telly Savalas takes the Blofeld role and does a very good job. He plays Blofeld much smoother and more like a gangster boss, compared to Pleasence's sinister turn. It works fine for this film and Savalas always knows how to engage the audience by his expressions alone. Ilse Steppat does a great job as Blofeld's number two Irma Bunt, she has an understated menace that works well and gets involved with the action too.Support: Gabriele Ferzetti brings plenty of swagger and charm as Marc-Ange Draco. He has enough charisma to convince you that Bond would be drawn to him and he is a useful ally throughout. Bernard Lee is excellent in a slightly bigger role as M, whilst Lois Maxwell is also very good with more to do as Moneypenny.Action: Some of the series' best action is here. We get to see Bond take part in some really rough and brutal fights, with plenty of manoeuvres used that add great variety to the fight scenes. The ski chase is shot excellently and the stock car race is a lot of fun, there is certainly an intensity to the action pieces that makes them even better. The climax is suitably big and is again shot very well, so that it doesn't get cluttered like some of the previous climaxes.Score: John Barry is as good as ever and provides another score filled with intensity, but one which smartly incorporates a more romantic sound given the context. Louis Armstrong's song ''We Have All the Time in the World'' is a very pleasant tune and fits into the montage of romance perfectly.Production Values: The direction from ex-editor Peter Hunt is absolutely spot-on. He keeps things well paced and flowing despite the long running time. The film never gets boring and I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. Some might find the middle section with Bond impersonating Bray a bit long, but the dialogue is interesting and the film creates an engaging environment in Blofeld's base. The locations are all excellent, with the Swiss Alps captured beautifully on film and used effectively when needed. Hunt also has a great eye for shots and there are many striking visuals, mainly with the ski scenes. The writing was good too, as said the romance feels genuine and the final scene is truly upsetting. Some of the effects are ropey, especially the bobsled chase, but most of the stunt work blends into the film seamlessly.Conclusion: On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a very impressive entry to the series and all the right elements come together to make a great Bond film. Lazenby is a bit iffy, which is understandable given this is his first major role, and the middle section or film in general might be too long for some. But apart from that everything else is fantastic. Diana Rigg is easily one of the best Bond girls, Telly Savalas makes a convincing Blofeld, the writing is effective and the action sequences are truly superb. This is a thrilling Bond film and many continue to underrate it for some strange reason. It would have been interesting to see what Lazenby and Hunt could have done with another film if given the chance.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
165,KFL,James Bond--human with human foibles? Blasphemy!,7,15 January 2001,"I myself am tired of the usual Bond-as-Superman fluff, with our hero never showing fear, or affection, or even hatred, for that matter. Even comic-book heroes are more ""human"" than that.This Bond, played very well by George Lazenby, shows fear, doubt, perhaps even a slight bit of self-doubt, and gets in deep enough with one special girl (Diana Rigg, aka Emma Peel) to finally tie the knot. All of which is no doubt anathema to the hordes of Bond-fans who want their man to be a martini-swilling, ladykilling automaton of sorts. Lazenby is as good as, perhaps better than, any of the other Bonds in their first outings, and is probably better here than Connery would have been.
This is one of the very best of the Bond movies, perhaps *the* best, despite excessive length (at two hours and 20 minutes), rather poor editing, and the rather ghastly man-eaten-by-snowblower sequence.And, yes, this assessment includes the ending. Especially the ending.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
166,Mikew3001,Still my favorite James Bond movie!,10,23 May 2002,"There are Bond movies that everybody considers as ""classics"" of the series, such as ""Goldfinger"", and there are also 007 films like ""OHMSS"" that people do only love or hate. This sixth Bond movie was the first one without Sean Connery who left the series in 1968 for other challenges. The problem was that NOBODY could have replaced Connery in a completely satisfying way as the audience was used to his him for many years and had high expectations.The producers decided for handsome, but unknown Australian George Lazenby, being 29 years old at that time - an advertising model who has never played in any movie before, not even in any TV series, B-movie flick or theater play.Peter Hunt, the editor of the first four Bond movies and second-unit director of 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"", took the direction and made the Bond movie that was closest to Ian Fleming's original movie. The story is fine, and there is a sad love story of James Bond marrying and losing his wife (played by Diana Rigg of the Avengers) in the only unhappy ending of the whole series. Hunt takes a far more psychological approach to the Bond figure, similar to Timothy Dalton's Bond approach in the late 1980's.The action, chases, fights and especially the trailer with a breath-taking beach fight are some of the best of all Bond movies, and the photography and editing are outstanding. Lazenby is really convincing in the fighting scenes, having been an martial arts instructor in the Australian army before. The skiing and bob chasing sequences were ahead of its time, and the unusual and impressive winter setting of the Swiss mountains is fascinating and fits perfectly to the sad background love story behind the Bond and Blofeld plot.There are also truly psychedelic moments with colorful backgrounds, purple casino wallpapers and weird sequences with Blofeld (Telly ""Kojak"" Savalas) hypnotizing some high society girls to become his satellite operated remote control slaves to conquer the world with a deadly virus.John Barry's sound track is one of his best, featuring the sad ballad ""We Have All The Time In The World"" by the late Louis Armstrong and the rousing instrumental theme ""OHMSS"" which was perfectly remade in big beat techno style by the Propellerheads in 1997.Although Lazenby did a very fine job for a beginner, critics and spectators disliked him. Lazenby couldn't handle bad reviews and critical remarks and decided to leave the series after the release of this movie. Additionally, he was badly advised by his managers who considered James Bond as an unfashionable and unsuccessful role model for the seventies - and were wrong. So he turned down an offer of the producers in early 1970 to remain James Bond for four more films until 1977: ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""Live And Let Die"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" - one of the biggest mistakes in the history of cinema ever.So it was Sean Connery's turn for another Bond job for four million dollars in 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and finally the start of 45-year-old Roger Moore's 007 career in 1972. Nowadays, many James Bond buffs consider OHMSS as one of the best movies of the series, exploring new frontiers, new styles and a new plot besides the standards established in the more successful Connery movies before. For me, it still remains a very special Bond film - and my most favorite as well, despite or because of Lazenby.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
167,movieman-200,One of the most underrated Bond films in the franchise,8,12 June 2005,"At 140 minutes, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) represents something of both a departure and a finale for the James Bond series. Certainly, it is the longest of the Bond adventure films. But it is also the last of the stylish ultra 60s chic flicks from a franchise increasingly more bent on developing elaborate gadgetry and caricatures instead of characterizations. After Sean Connery's contract elapsed, producers Cubby Broccolli and Harry Saltzman did their best to woo the bankable star back into their fold but to no avail. Presented with the daunting task of 'discovering' the next J.B., Broccolli and Saltzman eventually settled on fashion model, George Lazenby who had yet to add film work to his list of professional credentials.Fearful that Lazenby would be a jolt to the system and the franchise, the pre-screen poster art featured a faceless Bond as part of its marketing campaign. What most people forget today is that OHMSS is probably the single most detailed and fully realized Bond film in the entire series. For it treats the character of Bond, not as the cardboard cutout of a superman, but as a genuine human being with very real needs to love and be loved.From the onset the film is careful not to replicate Connery's persona in Lazenby's characterization. In a plot entanglement very much reminiscent of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, Bond is assigned the task of wooing sexually frigid Contessa Teresa 'Tracy' Vincenzo (Dianna Rigg) by her father, shipping magnet, Draco (Gabrielle Ferzetti). Although Bond and Tracy's initial meeting is both disdainful and action packed  the eventually romance that blossoms between them is quite genuine and moving. But before Bond can pop the question, duty calls by way of impersonating Sir Hilary Bray. Bray, it seems, is scheduled to have his coat of arms reviewed by a respected personage atop a mountain retreat. Instead, what Bond finds is that his old arch nemesis, Ernes Stavro Blofeld (on this occasion cast as Telly Savalas) is plotting a toxic game of mind control, using a bevy of neurotic lovelies as his hypnotized harbingers of doom.Director Peter Hunt must be given credit for producing a very textually dense  though never boring - film that seamlessly blends all of these narratives threads. The action sequences are masterful set pieces that rank among the best in the series  including a toboggan/ski run chase and auto race that ends only after Bond and Tracy have entered a legitimate motocross event. What is, perhaps, the film's greatest oversight is that Connery could not have been persuaded to partake in this outing.As Bond, Lazenby is decidedly more wooden than Connery. And yet, removed from Connery's hype  Lazenby is quite adequate in the role. His emotional response to Tracy's murder is a highpoint that neither Connery nor Moore ever achieved in the role. Yet, there is no denying that in keeping with the history of Bond as a character, Lazenby is something of a road show distillation, instead of becoming iconic and galvanic in the part. When all was said and done, OHMSS was a modest success at the box office, but a decided disappointment to the franchise when compared to the previous receipts for Bond films. Hence, Lazenby was out and Connery reluctantly returned for the next Bond outing, Diamonds Are Forever.MGM/UA's transfer on OHMSS is quite pleasing. Colors are rich, saturated and well balanced. Contrast levels appear somewhat bumped up during several sequences with blooming whites and pale blacks. Overall, however, the picture fairs very nicely with fine detail realized throughout and a general lack of age related artifacts. There are a few instances of edge enhancement but nothing that will distract. The audio is mono  a genuine disappointment. Extras include a very thorough documentary on the film and its place in the Bond canon, audio commentaries, some promotional junket materials and the film's theatrical trailer.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
168,pswanson00,tedious,3,20 November 2020,"I've seen Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig in the Bond role, but I'd never seen this film. I found it to be tepid, and really not very interesting.
The choreography of the fight sequences was poor, almost down to the level of the Biff! Pow! of a bad martial arts movie. The one highlight was the ski chase, which kept my attention. I did not foresee the wedding at the end, but -- once that was accomplished -- I was not surprised by the immediate death of the bride...except that I have no memory of a deceased wife ever having been mention as part of 007s history. There were relationship-related scenes which were slow and sappy, and certainly not anything I expect from James Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
169,enochsneed,The most cinematic Bond movie?,10,2 October 2007,"This is the best Bond film and features the best Bond: tough, certainly but also emotional, vulnerable and not simply a suave indestructible adventurer. George Lazenby is terrific and I could throttle him for not continuing with Bond.Apart from the change of lead, this film also stands out as having some of the most cinematic moments in the whole series, such as the use of flowers as a motif for Tracy's character, and a very striking flashback as Bond relives her kidnapping by Blofeld's thugs.The cinematography is first-rate with wonderful mountain views giving a sense of space and grandeur to the action. Two shots are particularly worth watching for: an avalanche of snow exploding against an outcrop of rock, and a helicopter blowing up snow with its blades, silhouetted against an alpine sunrise. Location filming also makes a great contribution to the reality of the story. There are no fantastical Ken Adam sets here, when we see the helicopter flying away from Piz Gloria (directly outside Bond's window, an incredible shot) we know the man is truly alone.The arguments for and against this film will no doubt continue, but even the complainers must surely agree it is a beautiful film to watch.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Whilst the humour and sense of adventure and fun is ever present, it takes it into a more serious tone, in which the gravitas of SPECTRE's reach is well-known and the stakes are higher than before, again strengtened by the tragic twist at the end.This will stand out as one of the more different Bond-films, and that is only said with the highest accomodations!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

173,michelerealini,An underrated Bond,8,9 October 2005,"""On Her Mahesty Secret Service"" (""OHMSS"") (1969) marked the first 007 picture without Sean Connery in the leading role -he quit the series after ""You only live twice"" two years before. At that time it was unbelievable to see someone else playing 007... Producers chose Australian born George Lazenby to replace him.An unconventional plot and the contrast between Connery and Lazenby performances spoiled the film at the time of the release: it was felt like a failure, without a charismatic actor and too away from the spirit of the previous adventures. The film has been revalued since, today it is considered one of the best of the series.The movie is the most faithful adaptation of a Ian Fleming novel. Bond goes to Switzerland for destroying plans of SPECTRE boss Ernest Stavro Blofeld, who wants to blackmail the world by spreading a lethal virus. Meanwhile Bond falls in love for the first and only time and gets married...OHMSS is a brilliant, lavish film. Screenplay, sets, action scenes, cinematography and music are more accurate and luxurious than ever. And for the first time we discover a vulnerable hero, with ""more human"" feelings. It's the most moving and dramatic episode of James Bond.George Lazenby performance is not bad , but he has not the charm for being a real cinematic hero. I know OHMSS is pure Fleming, but this is a too ""human"" 007 for movies.By the way I like the movie because it's very different from the others of the franchise. It's a very underrated and unlucky film. It neither got the same success of the others nor brought chance to George Lazenby. It's a pity.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
174,fletch5,Thrilling Bond flick that belongs to the top,9,22 September 2000,"This is unquestionably the most argued Bond (both the film and the actor) of all. In my opinion, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" ranks among the top in the series. It's more action-packed than it's predecessors, and a major improvement over the previous film ""You Only Live Twice"", which was a poor effort. The film is enterprisingly and pretty successfully directed by Peter (R.) Hunt. It offers a spectacular chain of incredibly thrilling action sequences after another, starting from Bond's escape from the machine room.George Lazenby is good-looking and copes with the role pretty well, but lacks the charm of Sean Connery. Diana Rigg is clearly the best Bond WOMAN (there aren't too many of them), but Telly Savalas' Blofeld was a bit disappointing. A strange little thing is that his cat appears only briefly.It's a real shame that this film has such a bad reputation. It should be seen by any Bond fan, with no prejudices.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
175,rjsf96,"""This Never Happened to the Other Fella""",9,28 October 2015,"George Lazenby's first and only outing as James Bond is another 60s success. Despite the absence of Connery, Lazenby fills 007's shoes nicely and On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a spectacular entry that would not be matched in quality for many years.After Blofeld's explosive escape in You Only Live Twice, Bond enlists the help of Draco. He makes Bond an offer, to marry his daughter and then Draco will give him information regarding Blofeld's hideout. Bond finds himself in the Swiss Alps to stop Blofeld from destroying crops and killing animals throughout the world.Perhaps it's On Her Majesty's Secret Service's scope that gives it its edge as well as its runtime and doses of action. But it remains a fan favourite for many. Bond is a more fragile and vulnerable character this time around, swayed more by love and marriage than the other incarnations. Its swift action ensures it remains entertaining for all of its 142 minutes.The love interest Tracy remains one of only two Bond girls to actually make Bond fall in love. This time he cares about her wellbeing. This version of Blofeld by Telly Savalas remains the most believable, he has a sadistic quality to him and that's even without the facial deformities of the previous incarnation. Because he lacks scars he has to rely upon his acting ability to satisfy and needless to say that he does.If Lazenby is not always up to much when delivering his dialogue then he does impress during the frequent fight scenes. There is weight to his punches that he throws and when he is given enemies to come up against he does not disappoint in the slightest; whether he is beating up henchmen on solid ground, traversing down the Alps on half destroyed skis or steering frantically away from oncoming gunfire.John Barry's score is entirely different for George Lazenby and is quirky as well as using a striking guitar during the main theme, ensuring that it remains distinctive.On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the most divisive Bond film yet created. If you can get past the absence of Connery and the fourth wall breaking introduction of Lazenby and enjoy it for what it is; a fast efficient thrill ride then you are sure to be intrigued and compelled throughout its lengthy but altogether satisfactory runtime.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
176,MattHankinson,One and only,9,14 November 2020,George Lazenby obviously has a lot to live up to being a new bond but he certainly doesn't disappoint. Leading the line in one of the most iconic films in my opinion. We see Bond vulnerable romantically and even confesses his love and gets married. Famous Tragic events then follow.But first impressions are great. Great voice. Great look. Breaks fourth wall and says it doesn't happen to other fellow in the opening scene.Some great moving scenes such as ski'ing and demolition car racing. But overall George Lazenby does a absolutely fantastic job in his only bond film but before I watched it I thought he only did one because he didn't suit the role but that is certainly not the case.,On Her Majesty's Secret Service
177,Deusvolt,"Here is a vulnerable and consequently, very human Bond.",8,16 December 2004,"Critics and ordinary fans of Bond movies hated this one because Lazenby did not display the usual savoire faire and comic humor of the other actors who portrayed the secret super agent. What we get here instead is a very vulnerable James Bond in terms of difficulties in warding off his enemies but more important, emotionally. For the first time, Bond is shown in a love scene that is not evocative of lust or a skeptical sense of duty (as in ""for king and country"" to exact information and cooperation from a lovesick female) but in a loving and romantic sense for a wife. The fans' disappointment notwithstanding, this episode of the James Bond series is important as it establishes the persona of the ""other Bonds"" in subsequent episodes. I remember one where Roger Moore flares up when he is cruelly reminded by a protagonist of his dead wife. This film also has the best theme music notwithstanding the original James Bond theme first introduced in Dr. No. On Her Majesty's theme feels strangely empowering. It was used again in Casino Royale (with Daniel Craig). It was in an action scene when after suffering some setbacks, Bond gains the upper hand and pursues the villains. In my estimation, the theme from Dr. No is best used (as it has been) to establish the Bond persona, a cool, dangerous guy on our side on the track of evildoers. The Majesty theme (which is actually majestic) should be used when after the bad guys had done their worst, the implacable super secret agent goes after them. The ski chase and shootout scenes are marvelous. Lazenby, by the way, was a champion Olympic skier and had the physical wherewithal and skills.Diana Rigg, still pretty but somewhat a bit ragged in the tooth, to play the spoiled daughter of a Spanish Don, is a bit affected in her acting although she came through credibly as a tragic heroine.It did not have a happy ending and seeing it on its first release at Christmastime in the Philippines was quite depressing. Nevertheless, this Bond movie is worth seeing because it is different.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
178,stp43,The Strongest Story In The Bond Series,8,10 September 2003,"Warning - possible spoilers.Sean Connery's decision to leave the Bond series after 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"" led to the decision by Eon productions to try a comparative newcomer as the signature secret agent.  Given that George Lazenby did not return to the series after this film helped make the film something of the forgotten child of the series, although the passage of time has proven good to the film; its very real strengths have gotten more notice over the years.Unlike many Bond fans I dislike the ""Who is the best Bond?"" squabbles that have arisen over the years because all five actors involved added something to the character.  George Lazenby deserves more credit than he gets for his one-shot role as he adds a nice touch of greater humanity to the role.Eon worked to make clear in the Maurice Binder title sequence (one of only two Bond title sequences, the other being ""From Russia With Love,"" where the film theme song is entirely instrumental, a surprisingly good mixture of classic John Barry wall of sound symphony with engaging Dave Clark Five-influenced bass and even some humorously cheesy horn in the lead) that while the performer portraying him had changed, it was still James Bond, as footage from ""Dr. No"" (Joseph Wiseman and Ursula Andress), ""From Russia With Love"" (Daniela Bianchi), ""Goldfinger"" (Gert Frobe), ""Thunderball"" (Adolfo Celi), and ""You Only Live Twice"" (Mie Hama) scrolls through the sequence as reminder of Bond's past adventures.  This reminder also shows when James enters his office (the first such scene in the Bond series) and finds some mementos of his past cases, complete with appropriate John Barry cues.Despite this, the film also revels in its famed in-joke in the prologue. James is passed on a country road by a red Mustang, whose driver stops at a beach and tries to drown herself.  James rescues the girl and for his trouble is attacked by two toughs whom he beats up while the girl makes good her escape.  Watching her leave, James mutters, ""That never happened to the other fella.""The young woman is the daughter of Sicilian crime boss Marc Ange Draco, and her name is Teresa, but she is better known as Tracy.  Tracy is played by ""The Avengers"" veteran Diana Rigg, the second ""Avengers"" alum (Honor Blackman, Cathy Gale in the early-60s incarnation of the Patrick Macnee series, being the first) to portray a Bond girl.  When Bond finds her at the casino of the hotel at which he is staying, he is attacked by one of the two toughs again - the two toughs being her bodyguards.  After dispatching him Bond confronts the girl, but it is not until he is taken at knifepoint to meet Draco (this after yet another fistfight with the bodyguards) that he learns her identity and also the reason for crossing paths with her.  Marc Ange Draco wants James to marry his wayward daughter, and he has something else to sweeten the deal - possible information on SPECTRE. 
James agrees to date Tracy, and the more they date the warmer their relationship becomes, and with Marc Ange Draco's help James finds a key clue in an examination of family trees (using research into his own family tree as cover, the crest of his own family bearing the phrase The World Is Not Enough).  During this research the film engages in its funniest in-joke, with a Playboy magazine, the in-joke being that for all their suggestiveness and risque quality, the Bond series never portrayed truly gratuitous sex and nudity.  James research leads him to Switzerland and an institute on allergies that is merely cover for a germ warfare smuggling attempt by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (a miscast Telly Savalas, though the future Kojak star does well enough in the role that it is not a total loss).  James must escape, and he gets help from Tracy.  When the two are trapped overnight in a blizzard, they find that they truly do indeed love each other, but they may never live enough for marriage, as a ski chase through the mountains leads to pursuit by Blofeld via a gigantic avalanche and capture of Tracy.During the film James' relationship with HMSS had begun to crack - quick thinking by Miss Moneypenny salves the wounded pride of both James and Sir Miles Meservy and repairs the relational damage both men had flirted with - and with Blofeld holding Tracy James must go on his own, by contracting Marc Ange Draco's international construction and demolition company for a job involving considerable aerial activity to properly plant demo charges. 
This in turn leads to perhaps the most exciting chase sequence of the entire Bond series, a backbreaking and well-photographed slalom pursuit down the mountains that ends with an opportune rescue dog that is shooed away to get the brandy.  But the real key of the film comes afterward, as the unthinkable happens and James and Tracy find the full poignance of the song title, ""We Have All The Time In The World,"" in what is unquestionably the most emotionally charged ending of the entire Bond series.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

When I read the book On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I believed I had found the best James Bond thriller of all with a very human 007, so I wanted badly to see Sean Connery do this one. It almost happened.Unfortunately, Connery bowed out at this point, so vague lookalike George Lazenby was hired to play the most coveted hero role of all time.This really.hampered.my.enjoyment of the film.The fact that.

That would have been spectacular.So while it is perhaps one of the best screenplay in the series, I would have preferred that this is the one that made a swan song for Sean Connery than the less satisfying and downright silly Diamonds Are Forever that set the stage for many of the silly Roger Moore outings.This is why it gets only seven out of ten from me.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Their paths cross once again and it isn't long until they fall in love. To his dismay however, 007 is relieved of his mission to locate Blofeld, with MI6 citing his failure to track the supervillan down. Bond takes it upon himself to assume the identity of a genealogist who is currently studying Blofeld's family tree, before heading to Switzerland. He discovers that Blofeld has set up a clinic where he is supposedly ""curing"" young women of various food allergies. After his cover his blown, Bond learns that Blofeld intends to use the women to spread a virus which will devastate the world's crops, unless the United Nations pardon him and recognise his title as Count De Bleuchamp.The first and last outing for Australian George Lazenby, who stepped in to replace Connery after the latter declared he was ""finished"" with Bond. OHMSS will always be remembered as ""the one where Bond gets married"" or ""the one where Bond's wife gets killed"", and it is much deeper than most of the other movies given it's romantic backstory. To most people, it comes across as boring and old fashioned and it's also one of the longest Bond movies, however it will always hold a place within my top 5 Bond movies. Louis Armstrong's We Have All The Time In The World is truly sublime, especially given the movie's context and some of John Barry's greatest work is also featured here. The instrumental title piece is riveting in itself and even more so when it kicks in during the action scenes. Said action scenes are also spectacular and the exhilarating ski chase is a proper thrill-ride. This movie also has some of the best fights in the entire series, here they're a little more violent and slapdash which works to the film's advantage. I am always invigorated by both the anarchic car chase during a stock car rally as well as the chaotic bobsled chase and fight at the end of the film. We are also treated to a dangerously thrilling avalanche in which Bond is almost buried alive, not to mention the climatic attack on Blofeld's mountaintop clinic which was also amazing. The mammoth proportion of chaos and destruction in the film's action sequences is just awesome. Lazenby does a fine job playing Bond here and acquits himself brilliantly where the stunts and action are both concerned. He seems to be more than proficient at hand to hand(he broke one of the stuntmen's noses during a screen test)which is why the fights are so terrific. I would have loved to have seen him progress in the role of Bond and it would have been interesting to see him in the next film, Diamonds Are Forever. The brilliant Telly Savalas has his turn at Blofeld and certainly doesn't disappoint.Wrapped in a moving love story, the 6th Bond movie is a very impressive actioner as well as an outstanding effort.

I've seen all of them in order a few summers ago. The fight scenes in this are laughably bad, the director who David Lazenby swindled his way onto the set should have known better and it really shows as every throw that he does is all choppy like the Steven Seagal movie he released in 2008 called Kill switch. I got so bored watching this I started cutting my nails and only soldiered through it because I was 6 or so movies into this series that was on my bucket list . There is nothing to make me watch this again even if I was given my own bond girl after.. but jokes aside this was at a time where almost every James Bond film had a different Ernst Blofeld (think Dr Evil in Austin Powers) so when they had the big reveal about Blofeld I had no idea who he was and why this dramatic music or so was played. Everything about this movie was boring and forgetful down to the title. Even if Sean Connery was in it he couldn't have saved this.The only thing close to a spoiler for this is knowing Blofeld is in it but he was such a staple in the earlier movies it's kind of expected like martinis being shaken.

183,simonparker1990,"Sadly Underrated, one of the best Bonds!",10,19 March 2007,"I have been watching the past twenty Bond movies in order. So now after seeing every single last Bond movie (well with the exception of Casino Royale spoof and Never Say Never Again) I have decided to post a review of my favourite out of the series. And surprisingly, the movie that I have decided is my all time favourite Bond movie is On Her Majesty Secret Service! I absolutely despised this movie for years actually, in fact I was dreading coming round to watching it again, but I thought I'd still endure it and see whether it has grown on me at all. And surprisingly it has, a hell of a lot. On Her Majesty's Secret Service in actual fact turns out to be the most moving of all of the Bond movies and features some of my all time favourite moments. The movie is a lot different from the Sean Connery Bond movies that came before it, I suppose its a shame that Connery didn't stick around to play Bond in this movie because it would have been interesting to see where he took the character when he's given more to do with the role other than just to witty one liners and get on with the plot.On Her Majesty's Secret Service's plot revolves around two things, the first of which is Bond's romance with Tracy Di Vicenzo, and the second which is Blofeld's plot to unleash a virus on the world unless he is pardoned for his previous crimes and his title of count is recognised. The first plot strand about Bond's romance is ultimately the most interesting, many people find the first hour of the movie to be extremely boring because of the romance, however when I re watched it I found it to be a lot different and very moving. Mainly the romance is believable and Tracy is portrayed so brilliantly by Diana Rigg that its impossible not to be swept up by the scenes. The second plot strand is not that believable, this actually proves to be one of my slight moans about the movie, Blofeld's plot is a wee bit extreme just so he can be pardoned. However this plot strand does also feature some impressive action sequences, some delicious dialogue sequences and very memorable moments. When the two plot strands finally collide in the conclusion it definitely stands out as one of the best in Bond movie history. The tragic conclusion surrounding Tracy's death after she has become Mrs Bond is the biggest piece of character development in the series for Bond. Its a scene that still has a huge impact to date.Now then, the major reason I used to hate On Her Majesty's Secret Service was because never for a minute believed that George Lazenby was Bond. I found him to be dull and trying way too hard to make an impact. However, when I re watched the movie I was surprised to find that Lazenby was in actual fact a pretty decent Bond, he's by no means up to the standard of Connery, Brosnan or Moore, but he stands strong with Dalton who was equally as underrated. Lazenby relishes the romance and action sequences and he works particularly well throughout the movie. Admiteddly the introduction to him never works as it seems to be trying to hard to show he is like Connery and by giving him too many one liners. His interpretation of Bond is a bit different and the script kind of lets him down by trying to give him too many jokes. Apart from that he makes a very good Bond. Telly Savalas is nowhere near as effective as Donald Pleasance's Blofeld, but he works very well in the movie and the action sequences with him are very well done. But the ultimate star is still Diana Rigg who is easily the best Bond girl in the series but also has some of the best sequences. She is brilliantly played and her tragic death is a superbly moving moment.On Her Majesty's Secret Service is not a perfect Bond movie, but for originality and the fact it tries something completely different in the Bond series it earns my utmost respect.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

185,marthawilcox1831,A Touching Ending,1,23 February 2014,"The worst of the 1960s Bond films. It is way too long, George Lazenby can't act, and Diana Rigg wasn't at her best. For a start, they cast the wrong person by having a male model as Bond. He has no presence, nor does his face or voice register any emotion. Lois Maxwell looks older in this film. It is beautifully shot, but not a beautiful film. Honor Blackman may have progressed from 'The Avengers' to become a Bond girl in 'Goldfinger', but she also had 'Jason and the Argonauts' under her belt and looked better in colour than black and white. Becoming a Bond girl was an advancement for her. With Diana Rigg, becoming a Bond girl was not a progression from 'The Avengers' as she was better as Emma Peel even in black and white.The only redeeming feature in this film is the ending when Bond gets married but Tracy is killed. Despite Lazenby's bad acting and horizontal voice, the death scene still works and is better than the film as a whole. It's not the acting, it can't be the directing, so it must be the writing. I'll have to read the novel to see if it is Ian Fleming's writing or Richard Maibaum's screenplay writing.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
186,glenn-aylett,For the last 40 minutes only,6,2 April 2021,"I've always considered On Her Majesty's Secret Service a fairly dull Bond film that drags for the first two thirds of the film, with little action and too much talking, and in parts is like a love story between Bond and Tracey. Also George Lazenby is poor as Bond, with a wooden delivery, although the homage to earlier Bond films is nice when he finds artefacts from earlier films in his desk.However, OHMSS really hots up in the last 40 minutes with the stock car race, the battle at Blofeld's mountain retreat and the fight between Bond and Blofeld on the ski run being as good as anything in a Connery film. Also Diana Rigg has elements of her Avengers girl era when she convincingly fights off a hernchman and knocks him out.Then to me the main reason to watch is the tragic ending when Bond marries Tracey and she is gunned down by Irma Bunt in a passing car. Bond for once is shown with feelings and has tears in his eyes as he cradles his dead wife in his arms, something that has never been seen since. Indeed, the teaser in Diamonds Are Forever is based around Bond seeking revenge for Tracey's death.On the whole, though, OHMSS is a below par offering with Lazenby's portrayal as Bond, at least earlier in the film, being weak and the film takes a long time to get into its stride.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

But despite so many links to the past (Blofeld, the M/Q set-up) this just doesn't quite feel like a Bond film.  Lazenby is perfectly adequate, but spends a lot of the film is disguise as Ruth Rendell's Inspector Wexford.  And (not a spoiler if you know anything about Bond) he gets married.  It's an intriguing oddity in the Bond canon, which is why it's probably my favourite.  And it's got easily the best ending of any of the franchise.  ""I think he's attempting re-entry"" doesn't even come into it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
188,Turanic,One of the best,8,11 October 2021,"So I sat down to watch all Bond Films and oh my, this is one of the best ones... Let's start with the fact that George Lazenby had pretty tough shoes to fit in after S. Connery so that might be the reason film is so visually impressive ... Filming Switzerland is always a big win, but filming Switzerland in Bond is a double win... When you watch all these shots in 2021 you know there is no CGI, just stunts and explosions... Overall one of the top 5 bond experiences, a must see!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
189,jaybizman,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" - A stylish outing for Lazenby.",8,7 December 2020,"IMO, George Lazenby's (one and only) Bond was for a 50 year old movie
quite advanced for its time, great photography, scenery and an action filled plot.
Lazenby had a black belt in Karate, so was pretty adept at hand-to-hand unlike
the other Bond actors. Producers wanted to offer Lazenby a multi-picture Bond deal, but his Agent was against it and so angered Broccoli/Saltzman that they said 'he'll never work in this town again.' - not quite true, but close. Lazenby had a hard time securing roles and (thankfully) proved to be a good businessman.It was nice to see the late, great, Telly Savalas (Kojak) as the new Blofeld,
Dame Diana Rigg did a superb job as the feisty Tracy and one of my fave moments was listening to Louie Armstrong singing the haunting 'We have all the time in the world.' Many don't know that Louie was in bad health when he sang that song and passed away soon after. He asked the Producers if he had done a good enough job, and they said yes.The story involves a bevy of beauties who were cured of what ails them, but of course, there is a devious reason for this. You'll see.One thing happens to Bond in this movie that was never reproduced for 50 some years - no more on that, and the ending is a bit of a shocker. Easy 8/10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
190,Katz5,Best '60s Bond after Goldfinger,8,6 April 2021,"Nearly as good as Goldfinger mainly because of the story - Bond falling in love and getting married.....we all know what happens at the end (even if you haven't seen the film), but it's still engrossing. As for George Lazenby, Connery was clearly getting bored with the franchise by the time You Only Live Twice was released. Seeing someone new as Bond must have been jarring to audiences in 1969, who in the end were not very interested in Lazenby, who at least does not attempt to copy Connery's mannerisms. He's a different kind of Bond - more athletic, chiseled, deadpan. And he gets high marks for the finale of the film - his acting is quite natural. The plot involves some crazy plot by Blofeld (played this time by Kojak) to have deadly toxins circulated into the air and waterways by supermodels, who are being brainwashed in his lair high up in the Alps (a long way from any hollowed out volcano). It is a nutty story but the relationship between Bond and Diana Rigg's Tracy, the daughter of a gangster who hires Bond to infiltrate Blofeld, keeps it somewhat grounded. Also no pop song over the opening titles - this was going to be a different Bond completely. Although the song ""We Have All the Time in the World"" (at one point considered the title of the movie) is heard throughout the film, instrumental and vocals by Louis Armstrong. It would be Armstrong's last studio recording before his death. Connery (and Roger Moore) fanatics have grown to hate this film because of its star, which is unfair. Would they have preferred an actor who totally mimicked Connery?",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
191,mmuggi,One-and-gone Lazenby,3,5 June 2020,"This movie introduces a new Bond in the form of George Lazenby, and considering that there was his first credit, he actually did really well. He brought some more human and love to James Bond, but was also a sleazy guy in some scenes. Furthermore, he also removed some of the class that Sir Sean Connery brought to the table. This Bond shift is also referred to by Lazenby at the end of the opening scene after Tracy (Dame Diane Rigg) left him. However, it must be said that this opening scene was completely indifferent to the rest of the film, and frankly made no sense.It's Peter R. Hunt's directorial debut, and it can be seen at times. For though it is filmed very similar to the previous films, there are a ton of speed-up visuals and there are never any real exciting fight scenes. Actually, there aren't really any exciting scenes, and even at the scenes that should be the trademark of this movie (The Skiing Flight), it just doesn't turn out to be something that works particularly well. This is despite an otherwise good work by the cameramen.However, there is one scene that actually made the impression, and this is the final scene where Tracy, after she gets married (married !!) to Bond, is shot and killed by Blofeld (Telly Savalas) and his right hand Irma Bunt (Ilsa Steppat), who actually had her first English-speaking role in this film as well (she died shortly after the film's premiere). It was an unexpected scene, just as it was unexpected that Bond got married at all. (At least Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) still has a chance.Overall, a movie that stands out compared to the previous movies, with a new Bond, a more laidback relationship with gadgets (there were virtually none). Finally, it should be said that two hours and a quarter is far too long for a Bond movie.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
192,Marx_Bros_Fan86,The best example of an underrated film I can think of,8,15 April 2009,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (OHMSS) is one of the most interesting films in the Bond series, for the movie itself and its history. Producers Broccoli and Saltzman tried to make the movie in 1963 or 1964, but it kept getting delayed. By the time You Only Live Twice rolled along Connery became bored with the role and said ""never again."" It was for the better. His performance in YOLT was very lazy. Connery was replaced by George Lazenby, an Australian model with little acting experience. Lazenby is the main reason this movie gets such a bad rap, and I would be lying if I said he was the second best Bond after Connery. I'm one of those weird Bond fans who likes all of the Bond actors for one reason or another, but Lazenby would be last on my list. This does not mean he was terrible though. His delivery needed work but he was one of the more physical Bond actors and could really deliver a punch. I think he could have been a decent Bond if he had continued.OHMSS works because it has a great story. You Only Live Twice went too far with the gadgets, so the producers decided to hit the ""reset"" button. They went back to the down to earth spy story method of Dr. No and From Russia With Love. Bond has no gadgets, just his brains. This is the first time we really get to know Bond the man, rather than Bond the agent. When M takes Bond off the Blofeld case, he is so offended he resigns. Moneypenny changes his letter to say ""two weeks leave"" instead of ""resignation,"" which gives him the chance to locate Blofeld. Bond meets Tracy di Vicenzo, whose father is a criminal boss. He romances Tracy at first just to learn the whereabouts of his arch rival, but a romance develops that becomes the affair of his life. Diana Rigg is the best actress to play a Bond girl, and I am not exaggerating in any way. Her character actually has depth; she comes from a troubled family and had a rough time growing up. She attempts to commit suicide in the first scene. Bond unfortunately cannot stay with her forever. He disguises himself as Sir Hilary Bray, a geneaologist, and infiltrates Blofeld's base. Lazenby's voice was dubbed in this sequence and it doesn't work well, but it does not last long. Bond learns that Blofeld's plan is to brainwash ten women and have them plant biological weapons for him. Telly Savalas plays Blofeld. He does not have the evil genius quality of Donald Pleasance but he is the only Blofeld who was an actual physical threat to Bond.The action scenes are sped up in typical 60's fashion but they are still very fun. OHMSS has the best skiing action scenes in the series. Peter Hunt, the editor of all the previous Bond films, took the director's chair and it is thanks to him that we have these great action scenes. The final assault on Blofeld's mountain base is classic Bond. John Barry wrote the score, and his opening theme is my favorite Bond theme in the series, and the last one with no lyrics. The ending is heart breaking, much more powerful than a certain scene in Casino Royale.Rumors have surfaced that Lazenby was fired, but he was actually offered a seven film contract. His agent told him that the Bond series would not last into the seventies so he turned it down. What a mistake! OHMSS did not rake in as much money as You Only Live Twice but it made $87 million worldwide and was highly acclaimed. Connery returned in the inferior Diamonds are Forever, probably the most outlandish Bond film to date at the time. What an unfortunate turn for the series.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
193,tstudstrup,Worst Bond movie ever!!,1,25 October 2018,"Siiigh!!!This is one of the longest Bond movies ever. A running time at 2 hours and 22 minutes. No real action untill an hour and 33 minutes into the movie. I dont count fist fights as action. And the real action is boring and ruined by awful greenscreen cloesups. Like the rest of the movie It just goes on and on and on and on.This is the only Bond movie with George Lazenby. And thank god for that. He may look like Bond but he is not Bond. If you, like me hate Daniel Craig as Bond, Craig will come off as a decent Bond compared to Lazenby. Lazenby may talk the talk, but he does not walk the walk. At the age of 29, he is still the youngest actor ever, to play Bond. Funny thing is, he looks like he's about 50 years old in this movie.And this Bond hits the woman he claims to love. Her father knocks her out. Both because she's being disobedient. I dont like that.Worst part of the movie is the very very long part of the movie where Bond is at Goldfingers headquarters undercover. He wears a scottish quilt as part of his cover and goes on on, to unattractive women (that are suppose to be babes) about his familys coat of armes. And sleeps with two of them. Untill Goldfinger exposes him after what feels like about an hour. And even after that it takes what feels like half an hour more, before the first actionscene happens.Even if you are a Bond fan, this is the one movie you can skip. Just like you can skip Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and many of both Sean Connerys and Roger Moores movies.Pierce Brosnan is still the best Bond ever. Even Brosnans last and ufortunately not very good movie: Die Another day, is a 1000 times better than Lazenbys one movie.Because Pierce Brosnan IS Bond.And replacing him with Daniel Craig was the worst decision so far made by Barabara Broccoli.Skip this one. You will have moire fun watching paint dry.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
194,CalDexter,A great 007 yarn ruined by prima Donna mentality and silly plot holes,5,30 June 2007,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a great James Bond action adventure intermixed with long boring bits that are meant to be full of tension and suspense.It does not help that this sixth entry is also regarded as the 'infamous' one with George Lazenby as 007. Quite frankly, Sean Connery's shadow dominates this movie in a huge black cloud. As good as he looks in terms of athletic ability, Lazenby is devoid of charisma and personality.Thats what the producers get for hiring a male model who was really only in it for the money. Its been stated that Lazenby quit the production halfway through because of really bad advice about the future of the Bond genre...this shows in most of the film except for the fight and action sequences. However, the scene he has at the end is pretty good, but it does not make a great Bond performance.John Barry's brilliant score for the title sequences is one of the best ever. It even sounds like thriller music and it has been used in many comedy send ups as much as John Williams classic Jaws score. The ski sequences are absolutely brilliant and well photographed by Willy Bogner,a former Ski champion. His method of motion photography was a enjoyable starter of what was to come later.The plot holes in this film are various, but what really makes my blood boil is the fact that James Bond and Blofeld have already met in the previous film. And when Bond meets Blofeld 'disguised' as Sir Hilary Bray like he is as 'The Count' its just plain ludicrous they don't recognise each other. This is just lazy imagination on the writers' part.The casting of Telly Savalas as Blofeld is another mistake. They already cast Donald Pleasence in the role. Now, as a Bond fan, i see Ernst Stavro Blofeld as an important villain in the series. So having him played by three actors over three films is just mental.This was surely also the beginning of the end for plot continuation in the 007 canon, as Bond's actions (as Connery!!) in the pre credits sequence of Diamonds Are Forever don't confirm his reasons being tied to the famous climax of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Despite all these flaws, i'd still watch Lazenby in OHMSS any day than Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, at least Lazenby LOOKED the part!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
195,henrymadman,Great Film.,10,7 June 2007,"What was wrong with Lazenby any way that he had to be in only one film because if you think about it can you imagine Sean Connery in this film or Roger Moore or even Pierce Brosonan, No with out him this movie wouldn't be any good.I love Skiing and so this is one of my favourite bond films. Out of 10 I'd give the first ski chase 9/10 and the second 10/10 because I like the bit when the guy falls into the snow thingy and lots of blood comes out the other end and then George Lazenby says ""He didn't have the guts"".This is Blofeld's best movie for me closely followed by You Only Live Twice. He is just so evil and I like his side kick Irma Bunt, in a way she reminded me as a German Rosa Kleb! Over all this movie is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
196,cordaro9418,A new Bond for a new Bond,8,10 September 2008,"This was the Bond film that Sean Connery waited for... but never played. He long wanted a serious romantic epic piece to range his Bond against... and when he got it, he passed it up.Enter George Lazenby: The only actor of the 'official' Bond films to get a one-shot vehicle. Having done a far better than expected job, George let the sudden fame swell his head, leaving Cubby Broccoli to deflate it for him.Take out the 007 gets married aspect, and you still have a great Bond epic. OHMSS took us to places we hadn't seen Bond, and bettered a few of the ideas we already had of him.Harsh, cold, adventurous and not looking back, Lazenby brought a great service to Flemming's creation.Often lost on many Bond listings, OHMSS is in all truth, one of the better 007 films and does what Connery's sandwich films couldn't, reach Bond epic.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
197,98nurdinm-1,Beautiful Film,8,19 January 2005,"For many, OHMSS is the Bond Film to forget. No star actor in the role, a different style of Bond story and a tragic ending seem to be the ingredients to put an audience off this film.This reviewer's message is simple, then: NUTS TO YOU! This is probably the most beautiful film in the entire series. We are taken back away from the gadgets and huge set pieces, and brought back to the secret agent and human being that is James Bond.Bond meets and falls in love with Tracy Di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg). Her father, a notorious gang leader, has information to the whereabouts of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas). the evil genius plans to hold the world to ransom until he is pardoned for his crimes to humanity. Bond infiltrates and eventually succeeds in stopping Bolfeld's scheme. He and Tracy marry, but Blofeld and his assistant, Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppart) are waiting around the corner...BOND, JAMES BOND: Is played with considerable charm and skill by George Lazenby. The man had some mighty big shoes to fill after the resignation of Sean Connery, and he fills them pretty well. The only drawback is the constant referring back to Connery's films, constantly reminding us that this is a different actor playing 007. The line ""This never happened to the other fella"" seems completely out of place if we are supposed to believe that every actor who has played Bond plays the same character.EYE CANDY: Diana Rigg is gorgeous as always as the ill-fated Mrs Bond. (Remember her in The Avengers? Oh, Mrs. Peel...) The chemistry between the two leading actors is wonderful and very sweet, and you can really believe that the two characters are in love with each other.BADDIE: Telly Savalas is an interesting choice to play the leader of SPECTRE, but a good one. However i do think they could have explained why his appearance is different a little more. Then again, this IS the Bond world, where we have different actors playing Bond and his CiA counterpart, Felix Leiter. Oh well...OVERALL: One of the best looking Bonds to look at. It is a real pity that ""Diamonds Are Forever"" happened after this film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

This film has one of the best if not the best Bond girl. This film is visually stunning with a great soundtrack. The action and chase scenes are quite good. The villain is good, however I would have thought he would have recognized Bond. It has a pretty good plot. One of my biggest complaints is George Lazenby himself. He felt a little wooden in his performance. He delivered on the action and the final scene when his wife was killed. He might have improved if he had done more films.

200,Ed-from-HI,This realistic version of Bond Gets both 'Shaken & Stirred' in Equal Measure (by his authentic equal) Diana Rigg!!,9,31 August 2019,"This is perhaps the most 'realistic' and 'personal' James Bond film (prior to the tremendous 'Skyfall' from a few years back).Originally released circa1969 (although I remember first seeing this on ABC TV in 1988, then a few more times after that on VHS/DVD) ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" did not have the same level of Box Office performance as the earlier 'Sean Connery' movies, but it contained Four unique 'enhancements' =1) A more realistic, down-to-Earth scenario whereby James Bond actually loses some of his patent over-confidence, and actually 'resigns' from the British M-I-6 secret service!2) Bond falls in love, and even marries a woman he considers his complete 'equal' in nearly every way (played by the incredibly charismatic Diana Rigg, who fully matches Bond in the areas of charm, confidence, intelligence, bravery and especially thrill-seeking!)3) This story has a much darker (even melancholy, to some degree) tone about it - with the Finale actually a bit hard to bear, and unlike anything you will see in any other Bond film, before or since.4) The Music composed by ingenious John Barry is particularly awesome, and you even get to hear a quite moving original Song sung by the immortal Louis Armstrong! (just can't beat that!)Seriously, this version is quite 'different' from the conventional portrayals = George Lazenby is realistically 'low-key' (wouldn't you think real undercover spies should be hard to detect/notice), and he has genuine interest in getting to really 'know' the exceedingly beautiful Teresa ""Tracy"" Draco-di Vicenzo (aka Diana Rigg) = she is not simply a 'Bond-girl' pin-Up/ screen-Saver!
They seem authentically & believably drawn to (and made for) each other - most intriguing!But don't misunderstand there is plenty of fast-paced action (and the typical explosive 'smack-down') in the penultimate scenes (with a very subdued and painfully realistic Ending).Also, Telly Savalas is exceptional as the evil (i.e. the Real Dr. Evil to be exact) Mastermind: Ernst Stavro Blofeld! But even the villain here seems more complicated & multi-dimensional than usual (Savalas being a truly exceptional master-thespian!)I always liked those Movies that presented a more realistic rendition of the true life of a Spy/ secret service Agent, and the idea that it certainly was/is a real job, with genuine consequences - and not simply an excuse to sit-around a Roulette table all-Day, sipping martinis (shaken, not stirred, of Course!)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
201,Ron-181,The poorest of the Bond series !,5,22 June 2000,"Despite an outstanding supporting cast this movie falls well short of achieving the quality of the other Bond movies.  From the very start things lack the normal excitement of a Bond type film. Even the back ground music didn't seem to fit. George Lazenby may have looked like a true Bond type, however he quickly showed this was his first motion picture, giving an uninspired acting performance throughout. A Tired,unexciting and thoroughly poor script insured this films ultimate failure.  Even the beautiful women could not compare with the girls in other Bond flicks.  Diana Riggs and Telly Savalas tried valently to save the picture but in the end there was just to many short comings. The photography of the Swiss scenery was the only enduring quality in the entire movie.    Obviously the producers recognize there failures as Lazenby never appeared in another film as James Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
202,Funky A,Wow! One of the best Bond films ever...,10,1 February 2000,"...Maybe the best. I am not quite sure. This is a great Bond film to watch. It is the only Bond film with George Lazenby and the only one by director Peter Hunt, but it's great! Diana Rigg is a perfect Bond girl(Emma Peel meets James Bond, wow again). Sadly, most people overlook it because it is the only Lazenby Bond and they guess he did only one because he was not fit for the role. It's true he tries too much to be a Connery clone, but that is wath the producers wanted: a replacement Connery. Maybe if he had done another Bond he would have made his own Bond but he still does a very good job as Bond. It is also true that some camera angles during combat sequences are weird, but this is minor since the rest is excellent. Well, maybe Telly Savalas was not as good as Donald Pleasance as Bloefeld, but he still did a great job. If you hate the other James Bond films, you probably won't like this one either, but if you love Bond movies and haven't seen this one, you will love it.

Very entertaining.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
204,TimBoHannon,Delivers far more!!,10,4 March 2003,"After ""You Only Live Twice"" concluded, Sean Connery announced that he was tired of playing James Bond and would leave the franchise for good. Many Bond fans thought that this development would kill of the series. ""How can it ever be the same with Connery leaving the role that made him a premier Hollywood superstar?"" they wondered. Thus, United Artists began one of the biggest talent hunts in history. In the end, over 400 actors tried out for the part after Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore turned it down.The winner came as a shock to most people. George Lazenby, a successful Australian model with minimal acting experience, became the next James Bond. Although Lazenby bought a Rolex and had a Bond haircut, it was his physical strength and incredible talent in fight choreography that won him the part.As a film, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is one of the two most divisive Bond films, the other being ""Licence to Kill."" Some think that this film, called OHMSS for short, is one of the most intense and exciting films in the series. Others reject it, complaining about its length and Lazenby's performance. I side with this movie's admirers. ""OHMSS"" is highly entertaining and includes some of the greatest stunts ever recorded on film. John Barry's heart pounding musical score enhances the journey, and it also contains a beautiful love story involving Bond. Yes, you did not misread that. James Bond loves a person, not just their physical beauty.One day, Bond (Lazenby) is driving down a coastal road in Portugal when he notices a bright red car on a deserted beach. Curious, Bond spots a beautiful woman (Diana Rigg) walking directly into the turbulent ocean. After bringing her to safety, Bond is confronted by two hostile men, whom he subdues, but not before the mystery female leaves. That night, he sees the same girl in a hotel and gets to know her, learning that her name is Tracy. He later meets Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti), the girl's father, a remarkably wealthy man who heads up a large, mafia-type syndicate. Draco informs James that Tracy is mentally disturbed after the suicide of her disloyal husband. He adds that he sees Bond as the type of person who can fix her life. Draco then offers Bond one million pounds to marry her. When Bond refuses, Draco offers information on Ernst Stavro Blofeld's (Telly Savalas) whereabouts. Taking pity on Tracy, Bond gets to know her better and the two begin to love each other. Temporarily leaving her to pursue Blofeld, Bond goes to a private allergy clinic on a mountaintop in the Swiss Alps, where Blofeld has been rebuilding his organization, and concocting a new grand scheme, for the last two years.In every way, ""OHMSS"" is a winner. All of the right ingredients exist in full force. Closely following the Ian Fleming novel, the plot is among the series' best. The action is taut and intense, the drama high, and the villains superlative. The skiing stunts in the two mountainside chases are awe inspiring. They are unmatched in not only the later Bond films, but in any film. The added bonus, the beautiful love story between Bond and Tracy, makes the film that much richer.As far as Lazenby is concerned, the man was the right choice. Granted, his acting was still somewhat unpolished, but believability is there. The emotional scenes with Tracy are where he really shines. Lazenby really sells Bond's love for her. He relies on more subtlety than Connery did, but it works. His astounding ability in fight choreography is rarely, if ever, matched in any other Bond film. The hotel room fight, while short, is awesome. Had Lazenby done more than one movie, his acting eventually would have come closer his peerless aptitude for great action.Lazenby's Bond has the highest moral compass. Tracy's antics, especially stealing his gun, provide enough provocation for him to kill her, and Connery's Bond might have considered it. Even when he has no obligation to see her, he follows her can so he can comfort her. After briefly giving into temptation, another encounter convinces him to give himself to her alone.The supporting cast also turns in masterful performances. Diana Rigg does an outstanding job as Tracy. She is both strong and vulnerable at the same time. Rigg flawlessly sells Tracy's pure love for the Bond. She is also breathtakingly beautiful. In the eyes of this writer, Tracy is the greatest of the Bond women.As far as the villain is concerned, Telly Savalas is a menacing arch- criminal. Blofeld in ""You Only Live Twice"" is dorky, but Savalas' version is visibly evil and visibly in control. Savalas' evil yet charming voice is perfect for the part. ""OHMSS"" occurred before ""You Only Live Twice"" in the novels, so Bond and Blofeld do not recognize each other. That detail is the perfect antidote to erase the memory of Donald Pleasance's misguided performance two years before.Unfortunately, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" failed to approach the monster box office showings of its two predecessors in the Bond series, and many moviegoers did not like Lazenby. There were also rumors that he alienated some people on the set, although their veracity is suspect. Some sources say he was offered a seven film contract, others claim he was fired. Unfortunately, Lazenby left the part after one movie.As time has passed, some people have lightened their criticism of Lazenby, and the movie has begun to find wider acceptance. The great action, villain, and Bond girl provide a winning combination, and director Peter Hunt knew what he had. Both Savalas' villain and the film itself would stand as the best in the series until ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" arrived 28 years later.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
205,Magenta_Bob,Different but disappointing entry to the series,4,6 February 2010,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is arguably the Bond film furthest from the usual formula, but, unfortunately, also one of the weakest entries. First of all, criticizing George Lazenby might be a bit like kicking on someone who is already down, but it is really easy to see why he only made one film as James Bond. While not as bad as some make him out to be, he lacks the elegance of Sean Connery, the wit of Roger Moore and the sheer attitude of Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig, not to mention undeniably wooden.The film plays out more like a drama than an action or a spy film, which is not a bad thing per se, but it simply isn't dramatic enough to justify its choice of style or pace. Particularly the part that takes place in Ernst Stavro Blofeld's (the villain, played by a surprisingly pale Telly Savalas) facility suffers from terrible pacing and is neither entertaining nor involving. Bond's various love affairs might evoke a chuckle, at best. I found myself eagerly waiting for some kind of action or change of pace, and when it finally arrived, it was just as tame (albeit admittedly impressive for its time).That's not to say that the film is a complete failure, however; the ending is genuinely touching, although I do think that the sudden cut to the usual Bond theme takes away some of its emotional impact. I also like how it explores a more gentle side of the character that we usually don't get to see. All things considered, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is refreshing as a departure from the somewhat formulaic series, but disappointing in that it doesn't work as well as the formula.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
206,Gerardrobertson61,Need to reconsider this film,8,5 January 2020,"George Lazenby's Bond is different to Connery's but then along came Roger Moore, would have been interesting to have seen Lazenby in the Moore movies.I tended to stay away from this movie, and I will admit, this week was the first time I had watched it through, did I enjoy it, yes. Is it the best Bond movie ever, the jury is out on that verdict.OHMSS in my opinion was better than Thunderball, but not as good as Goldfinger or Dr No. It was a more personal movie for Bond, and although at time a bit cheesy. What I noticed was the way Lazenby did fist to fist fighting with the bad guys, it seemed at lot more realistic than Connery, the stunts were up from previous films, it's the romantic link between Bond and Tracy that made me cringe a couple of times.
I will read the book and see how close the movie follows, also think I will need to watch it again to fully appreciate this Bond classic.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
207,MlleSedTortue,The finest of classic Bond,9,24 December 2020,"Out of the original series of Bond films, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have to be my personal favourite and the one I'd consider to be the best. While it seems to have garnered a better reputation over the years, it doesn't appear that the film has the same amount of love as the other Connery entries. It certainly deserves it because in many ways I find this film to be better.George Lazenby was the fresh faced newcomer, not really having any acting experience prior which does bring down his performance. With that said, it's hard to picture Connery in the role. Mainly because this Bond has some simple, but welcomed character development. It goes hand in hand with the Bond girl Tracy, played by the late Diana Rigg, who's the first Bond girl at this point to have some more substance to her character. The romance between Bond and Tracy is developed and it's ultimate conclusion gives the film some emotional weight that tends to be lacking in the original films.Over-course what truly stands out is the musical score from John Barry. Forget the James Bond theme, the theme for OHMSS is the definitive spy theme.All of this is what really makes OHMSS special, as it posses all the classic and fun antics of the Bond formula at the time while delivering some simple but appreciated characterization.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
208,marcotiero,Decent entry,6,11 May 2020,"A decent entry in the franchise, but don't see the hype from the other reviewers.Lazenby isn't the worst James Bond and the movie starts well, but the whole romantic, falling in love in the first half of the movie doesn't really do much for the story, pretty much just thrown in as filler.Then, when Bond poses as Sir Hilary, he's basically the prototype of Christopher Reeves Clark Kent, a few years before Reeves charmed is with his bumbling Kent.The premise is decent but I feel that a lot of filler was added to cut down on the amount of action we were accustomed to in the prior Connery outings.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
209,cartesianthought,This epic stays rooted in Fleming's writing.,8,26 December 2015,"Connery was widely influential, but by the late 60's he grew tired of the role. Lazenby, the unknown comes in, and does the role very well for someone with no prior acting experience. He adds a more emphathetic human aspect to the role, making Bond tying the knot in this one all the more believable. His chemistry with Rigg's character was stiff, but good enough considering the problems they had on set.On Her Majesty's Secret Service tones down the silliness, as well as the gadgets, and focuses on telling a story faithful to Fleming's novel of the same name. Savalas gives the role of Blofeld more physicality, making for well-shot ski chases. Between the action, the fight scenes, the fantastic score by John Barry and the iconic ending, this has stood the test of time as one of the better Bond films.History vindicated this one.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
210,Pelrad,Too many flaws for comfort,6,24 January 1999,"At the beginning of the film, Bond decides to ignore M's advice and go after Blofeld who escaped from the volcano in the previous film. It was strange that Bond thought he could waltz into Blofeld's new Swiss base unrecognised by the SPECTRE crime boss, when he was face to face with Blofeld in the previous film! And Blofeld, after standing face to face with Bond in Switzerland, still had to put 2 and 2 together before he realised that it was 007! Hmmmm ... strange. Besides this great flaw, I thought it was unusual to have Lazenby, not hiding his distinctive AUSTRALIAN accent, pose as the ENGLISH agent. Perhaps those not living in the Commonwealth (U.S. fans) can't tell the clear difference between the two accents. Mel Gibson might as well play Bond! Lazenby's jitteriness and unnatural tenseness with women didn't impress me either. The one-liners, so often hilarious in Bond films, seemed to fall flat in this one. As far as Telly is concerned, he seemed too level-headed to be the sinister Blofeld.Well, after all these complaints, I still liked the film (though only just) primarily for the great bobsled chase and seeing Bond cry at the end of the film. But, all in all, this was not one of the better Bond films.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
211,MovieJunkie1976,All Bond. No Bull.,8,16 December 2014,"***Warning!

212,Theflyace,Bond Month #6: The Hidden Treasure of the Bond Series,8,10 October 2013,"Of all the 23 Bond films so far, this is the hidden treasure of the series. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is actually one of the better, if not the best, Bond films. Contrary to popular opinion (even half of them haven't even seen it) about the film being of poor quality, this was actually the last of the greater ones for a long time. It has a very engaging story, good acting, and just the right amount of drama and thrills that would satisfy any movie-goer.In this entry in the franchise, James Bond (played for the first and only time by George Lazenby) is once again hunting Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who has been ""breeding"" a beautiful group of girls called his ""Angels of Death"" to spread a virus across the world unless the UN and all other actions leave him alone and recognize him as a powerful count. But for me that's the B-story, the main story (surprisingly) is Bond's courting and romance with Countess Teresa, nicknamed Tracy (played by the lovely Diana Rigg). It initially begins as a ""Bond fling"" but ends up becoming a genuine romance between the two. Add her father Draco, who is an ""honest business man"" who can actually help James in the mission itself. It actually leads to the most shocking twists in the whole franchise, but the less you know about that the better. This film is almost completely different from the others that came before and after it. Sure it has a bit of formula, but there are different tweaks and approaches to it that make it very enjoyable. Most of the credit for this film has to go to Director Peter Hunt. He had served as the editor for all the movies before and is credited for helping the films stand out because of his rapid-fire editing and quick cutting style. This was his dream to direct OHMSS (as its stylized) and finally got the chance. He and the writer Richard Maibaum really charbroiled this script to make it the best it can be. It's also shot differently from the others. Instead of using overly lavish sets and huge cinematography, its uses more subtle sets and more realistic cinematography from DP Michael Reed. Another unique aspect that was lost in the series until Goldeneye was its actual attempt at CHARACTERS and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT and EMOTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS. It works beautifully and you feel for what's happening to these people.Now we come to the controversial aspect of the film, George Lazenby's performance. Many people felt that he was not Sean Connery, therefore he is the worst Bond in history. Not true. He played a different kind of Bond for what the movie was trying to do. He's tough (especially the most physical Bond actor in a fight) but he's also human and vulnerable. Is he the best? No. However, he is good compared to some of the others.Tracy is the first Bond girl that has become my ""go-to."" She is one of the best Bond girls of them all, and for good reason. She has class, she's tough, she's refined. Oh, is she a brilliantly written and acted character. Diana Rigg is amazing and the chemistry between her and Lazenby really shines well. She is also not just a model stuck in there to look pretty, she is a very good and respected British actress, hell she was Emma Peel on ""The Avengers"" in Britain. Good training!Blofeld is much better here than he was in You Only Live Twice. Here he is played by Telly Savalas, who is a far more sneering villain than the childish and silly looking Donald Pleasance. He's not great, but he is at least good. He sans the typical preaching his plan to Bond, and Bond really has to piece it together like a spy in an espionage thriller.So On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It is very faithful to the book on which it's based. Is it a little longer than most? Yes. However, its still not plodding like some of the others. There's less gadgets in this, which is great because Q actually has more character traits than giving Bond the get out of danger deus-ex-machinas that he is known for.So this is one of the best. No question. The viewer-ship of this one should increase. its a really good one. Don't judge it if you haven't seen it.Now the next Bond ""movie"" that follows.... HELP!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
213,jtfsouth,The Dark Times,5,19 July 2000,"This is what I consider the ""dark time"" for the Bond series. This was ""in my opinion"" the worst Bond film to date. As much as I may blast the movie, I own it on video cassette. The movie just seemed to go by a little too slow and the story lines didn't seem to keep me in suspense very long. This Bond (Lazenby) seemed to be what others have said ""A Little Dorky"".

216,Speechless,"Strange, lackluster Bond movie (SPOILERS)",5,3 December 2000,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the forgotten child of the Bond movies, reviled by most fans of the series.  In spite of everything people have said about George Lazenby, I personally think the movie fails because it's too long, and because it has one of the worst endings in the history of cinema.Parents who are reading this review, be warned: the film features a moment of grotesquely cruel violence rarely glimpsed in this series.  In one of the skiing sequences towards the end, one of Blofeld's henchmen is crushed and torn apart by a snowplow, which proceeds to churn out red snow with little chunks of flesh.  Bond watches this spectacle and quips, ""Well, he had a lot of guts.""  Since the Bond movies have a reputation for being mostly harmless family entertainment, you have to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking when they devised that twisted little moment.But it's the ending that really infuriates me.  For some reason Bond actually falls in love with Diana Rigg, even though she's the same as every other Bond girl, and they get married.  What follows is one of the sickest movie endings I've ever seen.  After saying a couple of lines like, ""What a beautiful future we have in front of us,"" Rigg's character is randomly shot in the forehead, and the film's final image is of Bond cradling his dead loved one in his arms and crying.  Then the fast, happy, exciting Bond music bursts up and the credits begin.  What were they thinking with an ending like that?  It's a BOND movie--the whole point is to leave the audience feeling reassured and satisfied.  That ending is like a sick joke, designed to thumb its nose at everything that has gone before; it would be unacceptable in any action movie, but in a Bond movie it's just cruel.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
217,CooperCom,Better than it's reputation,7,30 November 1999,"A good Bond-film with good effects and good actors. Not the best bond-film, but a decent one. One thing that is negative with this film is that it last to long before something happens. But besides from that I think this one manages to thrill the audience as most of the 007-films do.

218,petsteph1,Classy Movie - a Ground Breaker,8,25 August 2007,"This is a very cool movie. I'd just watched Roger Moore in three of his Bond movies and had become a bit dulled down to be honest. Rog is good to watch and likable but most of the plots were pretty comic book and a long reach from Dr No. Then of course Roger isn't Sean and I was raised on Sean, so I expected to not like George Lazenby much. I was surprised. The funny thing with George is that when he is just being 007 he is pretty unexciting, but when he is masquerading as someone else he is very, very good. I guess he got some bad direction - something along the lines of 'Be yourself when you're Bond. YOU are Bond...' When he is being anyone else he is a very engaging actor. I blame the director. Anyway, this is really a VERY good movie - in fact it seems to be ahead of its time. The supporting cast is STUNNING. God, Diana Rigg - awww - yum. Telly Savalas as Blofeld is fantastic. Everyone is actually very good including the very beautiful women who are a part of Blofeld's master plan. The stunts are stunning. The skiing is gripping. The plot - yes, it has a plot - is a bit fragmented but at least it has a plot. I think this must've been the Bond movie they watched before they shot casino Royale with Daniel Craig as Bond. (That is a benchmark movie!) This one is too. Maybe nobody does Sean better than Sean but George did a fine job and I am sorry he didn't make another.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
219,Wwmbrd,Lazenby does his best,5,20 September 2021,"Decidedly not my favorite Bond film. Lazenby does a passable impression of Connery, but Sir Sean he is not. The editing in the movie is terrible, with jump cuts, shaky cam, non matching daylight scenes, and scenes that watch like a cross between an early kung fu movie and Adam West Batman KERPOW! Action. The characterization is also lacking, given that the main girl Tracy, portrayed by the lovely Diana Rigg (Olenna, Game of Thrones), disappears for half the movie and is largely irrelevant other than to start the plot- then is made artificially important later on. Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the most famous Bond villian, also has machiavellian plots in this movie, but made even more far fetched with his Anakin Skywalker-level illogical thinking. Nothing really works about this movie... no wonder it's been largely forgotten in the Bond franchise.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Great locations.

222,theskylabadventure,One of the most important Bond films,8,6 January 2008,"George Lazenby seems to split Bond fans down the middle - they either love him or loath him. Personally, I'm somewhere in between, but I do consider OHMSS one of the most important Bond moments and, in many ways, one of the best films.The most striking difference about this film is the tone, underpinned by the unthinkable notion that James Bond could fall in love. Despite Lazenby shortcomings as an actor, the relationship between Bond and Diana Rigg's Tracey is completely believable, and this is what gives the films its clout, even today.The set-up is nothing new. Blofeld plots to brain-wash and hypnotise a group of conveniently sexy young women and use them to spread a virus for which only he has the cure. It's all very well until the hypnotism scenes, which ripped off the laughably bad ending from The Ipcress File (on which Peter Hunt, OHMSS's director, was the editor).Location wise, the film-makers struck gold in Switzerland. Consequently, this film is graced with some of the best ski-chase sequences of the series and some beautiful cinematography too.Some of the fights are a bit clumsy, and the editing seems particularly cack-handed in places. Ironically the director, Peter Hunt, had been the editor on four of the previous Bonds. The editor replacing him was John Glen, who went on to direct five Bond films which were among the best as far as action goes.This is really only a small gripe though, as this film is not about the action but about character. Not until 'Casino Royale', nearly 30 years on, would we see a Bond this vulnerable again. Shame really, especially given that they subsequently followed this film with the light and largely pointless 'Diamond Are Forver'.Whatever you may think of Lazenby, this film is an essential part of the Bond saga and, for my money, a genuinely moving piece of dramatic cinema as well.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
223,kylopod,Worst of the Bond films I've seen,2,16 February 2006,"If there is an enduring mystery, it is why so many people consider this movie one of the best, if not the best, in the James Bond series. I first watched it shortly after re-watching some of the early Bond flicks like ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love,"" both of which hold up well today, even after having been imitated and satirized countless times. The inferiority of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was evident to me in just the first few minutes, which feature a repetitive and almost incoherent sequence of events where Bond goes about his business and keeps getting suddenly attacked by henchmen hiding behind the curtains.What immediately struck me was the stunningly bad acting from Sean Connery's replacement George Lazenby, as he woodenly delivered the standard one-liners. I know I'm not the only one who has had this reaction. But I keep hearing people say things like, ""Well, Lazenby was bad, but not as bad as Timothy Dalton."" That response leaves me bewildered. Dalton may not have been right for the Bond role, but he's a classically trained actor who had an impressive résumé long before being cast as James Bond. Lazenby wasn't an actor at all; he was a fan who somehow won himself the role, perhaps because of his looks. It's true that people with no prior acting experience have been known to give fine performances. Playing an action hero doesn't require great thespian ability, anyway: Arnold Schwarzenegger has demonstrated that again and again. But Lazenby lacks even a basic screen presence. He walks with the grace of an elephant (actually, that statement is highly unfair to elephants), and he sucks energy away from the screen. His one redeeming quality is that he's a fine athlete. He should have been the stunt double.Unfortunately, this film calls for more acting chops than the usual Bond flick, because it deals with Bond falling in love. It features scenes of high drama, but Lazenby blows them all because he is unable to show the needed level of complex, understated emotion. If Lazenby was to appear in any Bond film, I would think this one would be the least appropriate candidate.The movie deals with Bond's romance by having one of those video sequences where we see the two chatting and enjoying themselves together in various casual locations, but we don't hear anything they're saying. The message is that they're falling for each other, even if we don't have a clue why or how. This type of sequence is a sure sign of amateur direction. We need to experience the relationship along with the characters. That's one of the purposes of movies.The sequence occurs early in the film, then the girl promptly disappears until much later. It's just as well, since there's no chemistry between the characters, not even for a moment. The center of the movie involves Bond disguising himself as a Scotsman and traveling to an institute where people are receiving weird hypnotic suggestions about loving the flesh of chickens. I'm not sure if the humor here is intentional or not. But there's no excuse for scenes like this, considering that the earlier Connery films managed to avoid camp.What do people see in this film? Presumably that it has good action sequences. There's a nice chase scene through the snow, but it doesn't compare to the best parts of ""Goldfinger,"" and it comes after two hours by which time I was already getting fidgety. Telly Savalas is well-cast as the villain, but he makes too few appearances, and there isn't much about his mad personality or snide dialogues with Bond. He's all business. The movie contains no scenes remotely as exciting as the fight with Odd Job, or the dialogues between Bond and Goldfinger. Or that fantastically filmed scene in ""From Russia With Love"" where the agent is following Bond and we see his face appearing in each of the train windows successively. (Now that is good direction.)Sometimes I had the feeling that the people involved in the film knew it was terrible and were trying to sabotage it. I've seen only a handful of Bond films, but I'm guessing that this is the only one that shows 007 looking into a Playboy magazine. (What is the world coming to?!) I suspect it's also the only one to make a joke at the expense of Bond's manhood, when the ""Scottish"" Bond drops his kilt in front of a woman and she immediately bursts into hysterical laughter--supposedly because she is surprised to find out that the ""rumor"" about Scotsmen and kilts is true. As Dr. Evil would say, riiiiight. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is a disgrace to the series and doesn't deserve any more respect.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
224,Dock-Ock,This never happened to the other Fella,10,2 October 2001,"Let me give it to you straight, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is an absolute, 100% triumph. All the elements work well, firstly there is Peter Hunt's direction. Hunt should have been handed the Directors reins on a Bond movie long before this. He adds action and excitement and blends this in the most stilted and calm manor. In truth On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a return to the less Gadget and Comic Book laden world of the likes of Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice, and echoes the Flemmingesque thriller world of Dr No and From Russia With Love. Those who dont like the first two additions to the Bond series dont flinch, On Her Majesty's Secret Service has a strenghth and style beaming with enegy and excitement twinned with realism. never seen in a Bond Film before or since.This will always be remembered as George Lazenby's go at Bond. It is also remenbered as the one Bond that flopped at the box office. Well, on a budget of $9million and with worldwide grosses of $80million, hopefully the notion of disapointment will disapeer. There is also the fact that the Video and DVD versions of the movie consistently outsell all other Bond Titles worldwide. George Lazenby is an absolute revelation as Bond. I had my doubts but was still interested to see how he did. Lazenby rivals Connery in the Romantic and Action scenes and does pretty well with the dramatic scenes. In truth he is the most under-rated Bond. He makes a very believable Flemmingesque Playboy. He looks good in a tuxedo, on ski's, with women, in punch ups. Lazenby is helped by a strong support cast. Diana Rigg is beautifull and very believable as the Contessa, Tracy, with whom our James falls in love with, and eventually marries. Rigg displays a full range of acting and beauty to make her the most memorable of Bond Girls, and for one, wich i dont mean to sopil, inparticular. Telly Savalas is a very creepy, chilling and enjoyable Blofeld. It could be said that he is the most memorable of Blofeld's. He is obviously having the time of his life with the part and it is a pitty he didn't play the character in future outings. There is also the return of M, Q in a rather quiet outing this time, and a Moneypenny, heart broken at the notion Bond could marry anybody other than herself.Now, if you add to all the above some of the finest action set pieces in motion picture history you have an idea of the scale of this epic. The Alpine sets, and Skiing and Bobsled chases really bring out the purest sense of adventure. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the most memorable Bond Movie from my Childhood. I remember watching this one Christmas eve with my Grandparents, and their house looked very much like Blofelds Alpine Fortress [Without the Ladies, alas]. The movie has really thrilling ski chases, you really do believe a man can ski, and once more think you are skiing with him.This is very much THE Christmas Bond movie. It is also soaked with some delightful christmas themes by the master John Barry, composing perhaps his best Bond theme. We Have All the Time in the world, sung by Louis Armstrong is a beautifuly moving song, made all the more so by Tracy's fate at the end of the movie. There is also Barry's rousing On Her Majesty's Secret Service Theme, unlike anything ever heared in cinema's or movies before.But it is the realism between the characters and the story that helps make On Her Majesty's Secret Service work. By far the most under-rated of the Bond movies, and a strong contender for the Best Bond Movie of all time. This is the greatest. Bond movies should try to be to be like this in future. Go and see it for yourself, dont listen to the the negative reviews. You have all the time in the world.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

From its dedication to adapting the book reasonably faithfully to the stunning sets and Barry's outstanding score, this is a true delight of a James Bond film. Where Lazenby once grated for not being Connery, he now shines for precisely that reason, giving us our first look at a more vulnerable Bond, capable of making mistakes and not at all invincible when up against the odds.Diana Rigg shines as the first self-determined on-screen Bond woman, matching/outdoing Lazenby in every scene. It's immeasurable how important she was in making Lazenby a great Bond, especially in the non-dramatic scenes which could so easily have been unconvincing, had she not kept his acting honest and on track. Telly Savalas also brings great gravitas and physical threat to Blofeld and hits all the right beats of the master villain.The ending is gut wrenching and brilliantly filmed, the only pity being the edit back into the James Bond theme rather too soon after the iconic bullet has been fired. This feels very jarring when perhaps a bit more silence would have felt more appropriate. Either way, it brings to an end a fantastic and completely unique entry in the franchise that's now a firm favourite for me!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

227,donaldgilbert,A Risky Bond Film,7,1 August 2001,"My question is this: we know ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" would have been a more successful film if Sean Connery starred as Bond in place of Lazenby, but would it have been a better film?  Well, it certainly would have made the ending more significant; imagine the credibility of seeing Connery's womanizing and chauvinistic Bond in such a vulnerable situation. I think too that, had Connery decided to retire as Bond after THIS picture (and especially after it's final scene), it would've added a certain importance to it's place in the series, as well as Sean Connery's participation and departure from it.""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was somewhat unique compared to it's predecessors.  Connery was no longer there, of course, but other things were noteworthy, as well:  M was curiously more stern, unsympathetic and insensitive towards 007; there was no real use of gadgets (Q didn't even appear until the end of the film); and the relationship between Moneypenny and Bond seemed more serious than the playful flirting of the previous films.  Moreover, as some have mentioned here, the pace was slower and more patient (I never found the film boring), and there was less grandeur to the villains (which I thought went over the top with ""You Only Live Twice"").
""On Her Majesty..."" was a risky Bond picture.  I suspect, given the failure at the box office, the producers spared no expense (including getting Connery back) in resurrecting the popular aspects of the series.  I think Lazenby is guilty by association, however, which is somewhat of a shame, because I felt that he was a fine James Bond, overall.  I would make a much bigger case against the director and editor of the film for using bad cutting, cheesy overdubs, some horribly choreographed fight scenes and obviously fake blue screen effects to make the film look cheap.  For that reason, I gave the film only 7 out of 10.

229,obrofta,The Best Bond Film,10,21 September 2005,"I know it's like stirring a hornet's nest to say which Bond is best. I have no problem with those who argue Sean Connery is the one and only Bond. However, he didn't play in this film, and Lazenby's comic quip that we would forget the ""other guy"" (Connery)...well, I did...for ONE film only, this one. The reason, alas, Lazenby didn't perpetuate this lasting feeling wasn't just because of his ""one-film stand"", but because the producers decision on Dianna Rigg (even if she refused they should have BEGGED her to do another). Sacrilege!!! If Grace Kelly was the most elegant actress to grace (excuse please) the big screen then I bid we open a new category called action films, and place Dianna Rigg as the most elegant action star of all time. Yeahhh!!! Talk about stunning. To see Dianna go from the free wheeling wide-eyed grinning race car driver in one scene to the weepy bride shows some of the breadth of this actresses' range, and it is considerable.Lazenby was perfect. I'd say he could have done a film with Connery as 007 and Lazenby as a double-naught compatriot, I was that fond of Lazenby's performance. He was a real life secret agent of sorts anyway - Australian Special Forces, Martial Arts Instructor (wonder why we didn't see more of THAT in the film? - probably saving it for the next several - oh well). He seemed a little stiff at first for the love parts, but the Louie Armstrong music and horseback riding scenes not to mention that one scene where Rigg pulls the outside portion of the dress over their heads on the beach(Dianna, TAKE ME--PLEASE!)softened George up just fine.Favorite Scenes Bumper cars on snow and ice with real wheel drive, go Dianna, GO! Lazenby on sled approaching the hilltop complex machine gun ablaze! Lazenby and Savalas fighting on the sled run-very cool!

230,DMP-2,"Unfortunately underrated, Surprisingly Excellent.",7,12 December 2000,"This film has ups and downs. The first 30 minutes are good, but for about next 30 minutes or so it goes into to a downward spiral. But, Luckily its picks for the last Hour, and this is the longest bond film yet at 2 hrs and 21 mins. George Lazenby, definitely the worst actor to play Bond, but he certainly deserves more credit than has been dealt. Its been proven that models can't always act, ""Charlie's Angels"" try it, and it didn't work either. Probably the best performance in the film is Telly Savalas, I have never seen any of the other actors who played Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasance, Charles Gray, and John Hollis) give such a startling performance. Diane Rigg (Avengers) played one of the great Bond girls, definitely Bond's favorite. Its a shame this film did poorly at the box-office, it only made $22,000,000. But, by todays standards that would have been $103,000,000, thats better than Licence to Kill (1989) (another Bond deserving more credit) and Never Say Never Again (1983)'s 46,000,000. Still, this film has probably some of the best and most modern action scenes. Some of the actions scenes paved way the magnificent opening sequence in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Which would pave the way for classic Bond ski-films, For Your Eyes Only (1981), A View To A Kill (1985) (although he switches to a Snowboard), and Licence To Kill (1989) (Technically, he's waterskiing, but thats still groundbreaking for Bond films), and The World Is Not Enough (1999) (Although we learn not all actors that play bond can ski). Its a shame they did this film so badly it seems the producers forgot about the ending, because Diamonds Are Forever (1971)(a great  Bond film by my standards) should have been a revenge film, it may have  actually taken away the discension casued by its humor. I know a lot of people dislike it for that. Its also a shame that ending of this movie was forgotten for so long, until briefly revisited by Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). It wasn't revisited again until For Your Eyes Only (1981), which was probably then only film that ever really revisited it, even though fairly briefly (I still want a revenge film). It also was briefly revisited on the 20th anniversary in Licence To Kill (1989) by Felix Leiter.This a great film its at least in the top 8 Bond films. Even though it didn't seem so on release, it is a vast improvement over its predecessor You Only Live Twice (1967).",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
231,rutherfordh-81993,A Shame George Lazenby Didn't Do Any More,7,1 November 2020,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service has changed opinions over time. It is now seen as one of the very best, but that certainly wasn't the case when it was first released. It boasts very good actors such as Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas, and George Lazenby is very good, even though that isn't necessarily a widespread belief. It has great locations such as Portugal and Switzerland and is very faithful to the great book by Ian Fleming. The action is mostly good, but is sped up far too often. There are some bits which aren't catching, and it can sometimes to difficult to follow. Overall though, it is a very strong film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
232,mattymatt30,"The film is not bad, and the same goes for Lazenby",7,21 March 2004,"'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is much maligned by many, along with the replacement of Sean Connery with George Lazenby, but I don't think they deserve the bad rap. Lazenby was in a tough position replacing Connery, try replacing Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones or in comedy, Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau(which will sadly be attempted by Steve Martin, after Alan Arkin failed years ago). It's tough to replace an actor that has become so identified with a role, but Lazenby did pretty well. Bond is not King Lear, and Lazenby had the looks and presence to pull it off. For me, what really killed the Bond films was the aging and eventual departure of all the supporting Bond extras in the later Bond films, such as Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny and Bernard Lee as M. This film still had the ingredients that made the early Bond films successful, and the story was plausible as well.  As one that loved the classic Bonds, anything after the early Roger Moore films just didn't have that Bond film 'look', and the video game era Bond of Brosnan makes Bond have the depth of an empty Martini shaker. My main criticism of this film however, is in many of the fight scenes and their editing. They really were choppy and mixed up, and attempted to show action by dazzling viewers with quick, confusing cuts from all angles. Lazenby could have grown into his role as 007, but has now been relegated to the list of failed Bonds.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
233,aernest,Bond Film With Everything But A Bond,6,3 August 2010,"SO much controversy around this film - is Lazenby good or isn't he? Sadly, I come down on the side that says he isn't. He's not as bad as Moore at his worst, but that is faint praise indeed. I find him adequate, but stiff. And I just hate the way he looks (yes, shallow, I know...). He's far too mannikin-y for me - Bond should be, well, handsomer. But this movie is hitting on all cylinders in every other aspect - the score is superb, the story great, the bad guy appropriately loathsome, and the locales exotic. Dame Diana Rigg serves as the BEST Bond girl ever and fittingly, the only one who ever becomes Mrs. Bond. Oh, gosh, if it'd only been Connery in this movie...",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
234,duncanbrown-76733,ONE OF THE GREAT 007 MOVIES,9,21 May 2021,"The opening sequence is one of the best ever scenes in a James Bond film. The way Bond drives his Aston Martin along the road, with the Portuguese coastline alongside it is excellent camera work. What makes it dramatic is hearing Monty Norman's James Bond theme music during the time our hero is driving his car, and then he sees a beautiful woman overtaking him in her red sports car. That scene is identical to Goldfinger and Goldeneye.The best is yet to come, because Bond realises that the woman is going to kill herself. Like the knight in shining armour he saves her, and then he introduces himself, by saying that famous line in cinema history, ""My name is Bond, James Bond.""
It is follow by one of the best fight scenes in the film. Why it is so good, is because when our hero takes on the heavies, it is set on a beach in the early hours of the morning. It is impressive when they fight it out in the water. The splashes and the aggression is so powerful you feel that you are in the film itself.It is the first of many impressive fight scenes in the film.One of my favourite scenes is where James Bond is at the casino table, where unexpectedly he meets Tracy again. It is a good game of cat and mouse, combined with seduction that makes the scene one of interest. It is clever the way it is played out. To use a gambling card game is a good way to present a scene in a film that shows manipulation and seduction. It has been used in other James Bond films such as Dr No, Licence To Kill, Goldeneye and The World Is Not Enough.The whole film itself is a constant interplay of cat and mouse, not only with Bond and Tracy, but with Blofeld and Tracy's father Draco. The plot is associated with the fictional word of James Bond. Which is so far removed from the real world of espionage.As with any James Bond film that as Blofeld in it, the plot is usually the same. In this one he threatens to poison the world if he is not given a free pardon for his past crimes. He uses this kind of threat of blackmail and extortion, in other James Bond films being You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever and Spectre.That has always been the psychology and philosophy within his persona.George Lazenby's does a bad job of imitating Sean Connery as James Bond.Diana Rigg is excellent as the troubled Tracy. She plays it so well, that you can understand just how complex a woman she is. All of the Bond girls, whether they are good or evil have always been troubled and complex, whatever characteristics they have had.In this film there are no winners. James Bond doesn't get what he wants, because the woman he marries is shot dead by Blofeld's henchwoman. Blofeid doesn't get what he wants by destroying the world.This is better than some James Bond films like Die Another Day and For Your Eyes Only, but not as good as Goldfinger and Thunderball.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

236,sterlinrivera-2000,My Least Favorite Bond Film,7,5 January 2020,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service would actually be my least favorite James Bond film, but it's still a good movie. When I first watched it, I didn't really care for it, but watching it again, I liked it a lot more this time around.The movie is about James Bond (this time played as George Lazenby) joins forces with Tracy Di (Diana Rigg) to battle SPECTRE in the Swiss Alps. The leader of SPECTRE, Ernst (Telly Savalas) is launching a plan, which is to create a warfare that can kill millions, so Bond and Di must foil his plans.This is my least favorite Bond film because George Lazenby I felt was a huge step down from Sean Connery. Lazenby kinda felt like a wannabe and failed. I didn't care for him to much as Bond as he didn't really have the right personality for the character. Also, the pace was slow at times, and could of been trimmed down a little bit for the run time.But what I did like about the film was it had some pretty good action, and the story was smooth. Also the rest of the cast was fine, but again, Lazenby just didn't click with me. He's my least favorite actor that had played Bond.But nonetheless, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is simply a good film for what it was.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

I had seen bits and pieces throughout my childhood but never sat down to watch it all the way through. I always heard this wasn't a great movie but that recently had again somewhat of cult status for Bond fans, specially since it was the only Bond appearance of George Lazenby. I must say I quite enjoyed it. Its such a beautiful film - the cinematography is really a staple of the Bond series - and probably one of the best at it. Although Lazenby is not the best performer, the cast around him, specially Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas, really make this a very fun watch, and I must admit the last scene impacted me - not to Craig's CR standards - and was the most convincing thing he did on screen. You could really feel the pain and sadness. The action scenes, though quite dated - with jump cuts and changes of pace - still feels brutal and intense in some places, and I think that physicality really was the strongest suit of Lazenby's Bond. The slow pace throughout the film really paid off in the last half an hour. The Bond series holds a very special place in my heart, and OHMSS is no exception. The excitement of listening to the Bond theme during a set piece is an unique feeling on all cinema.OHMSS is a treat to watch.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
238,tonynworah,An excellent high octane Bond adventure,8,9 February 2011,"One Her Majesty's Secret Service still remains one of my most favourite James Bond movies. It was the film that introduced an unknown Australian model called George Lazenby as the debonair agent 007, following the iconic Sean Connery's first exit from the Bond franchise.In this sixth Bond installment, 007 is on the hunt for his arch nemesis, Enrst Starvo Blofeld, the head of the world wide criminal organization known as SPECTRE. Fate brings him into contact with Draco, another criminal boss who is the head of the Corsican Union, the French equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia. Both of them strike an unholy alliance. In return for Draco using his contacts to find out the whereabouts of Blofeld, Bond will marry his only daughter, Theresa. To sweeten the deal, Marco promises to give him a dowry of 1million pounds on the day of the wedding. As the charming Draco puts it, he has no reason to give information to an employee of Her Majesty's Secret Service but may give it to his future son in law.With Draco's assistance, Bond posing as a genealogist penetrates Blofeld's lair in the Alpine mountains of Switzerland where the environment is as dangerous as the enemy itself. Blofeld himself is now posing as a count doing some research work into finding a cure for allergies.Typical of all James Bond movies, there is a bevy of gorgeous girls. In this movie the girls representing almost every race in the world are angels of death orchestrated by Blofeld to carry out a diabolical corruption of the world's agricultural industry.When this movie came out, reviews were mixed and mostly negative. Pepole were still not used to the idea of a different person playing Bond but with the passage of time, the movie shows why it is a classic.First, the movie eschewed all those fantastic plots of world domination and in Lazenby we see a grittier, more down to earth Bond. For the first time since Dr. No, there are no survival gadgets for Bond to rely on, not even a gun. It is just his fists and wits against a bevy of gunmen and a terrain that is dangerous as the enemy itself. A lot of credit must go to Peter Hunt who as much as possible stuck faithfully to Fleming's novel and was still able to eke out an action packed suspenseful thriller without any reliance on gadgetry.Check out the ski scenes which still remains the best and most suspenseful ski scenes in all the Bond movies accompanied with a wonderful score by John Barry. That score is among my favorites movie scores of all times. A gritty suspenseful score that for the first time, I enjoyed more than the traditional James Bond theme.George Lazenby's performance may be average but his interpretation of James Bond was more realistic than the super cool Sean Connery (whom I still idolize nevertheless). You could see his emotions thinly veiled because of the circumstance he finds himself in-his anger with M who forces him out of Bedlam (an operation to hunt down Blofeld), his tenderness with the emotionally disturbed Theresa Draco, his fear when being pursued by Blofeld's henchmen, his helplessness as for once he has to depend solely on a woman to survive, his agony at the loss of his loved one at the end of the movie. Lazenby displayed a Bond that was not a superman but just an ordinary man as depicted by the Fleming novels.Telly Savalas of Kojak fame easily stole the show as the charming Blofeld. He departed from the menacing specter of Donald Pleasance's Blofeld in You Only Live Twice and displayed a physical presence that could easily match Bond in physical combat. That being said, Pleasance still remains my favorite Blofeld of all times.Using the precedent set by Goldfinger, the producers hired gorgeous Avenger girl Diana Rigg to play the ill fated Theresa Bond which she did solidly. She was not the typical helpless girl relying on Bond to save her. In one of her greatest scenes, the movie makers surprisingly and wisely made her sit behind the wheel instead of Bond in order to outrun Blofeld's men; she skis with Bond to evade capture and defends herself against two henchmen with just a broken bottle. Her performance and Savalas' performance were enough to cover Lazenby's acting shortcomings which were not much by the way. It is a pity that Lazenby did not continue with the Bond role after his agent convinced him that the Bond franchise had no future. I'm sure he would have made a great Bond actor in the future Bond films.Of course like most Bond films, there were some illogicality, chief among them being how come Bond and Blofeld did not recognize each other after they had both crossed swords in You Only Live Twice. This was a big plot hole which has never been explained to me.Also there were hints of racism in the movie when the angels of death were given their nations' traditional gourmets to dine on. The dark skinned Jamaican girl was given a banana, a fruit traditionally associated with monkeys and which has been a bane of racist jokes against blacks. That scene up till now rankles me whenever I watch it but I put it down to the attitude of the sixties then. Now, in this era of political correctness, I seriously doubt any Bond movie would allow such a racist gaffe.Despite all this, OHMSS is a high octane adventure movie. The main action starts in the second half of the movie and never stops until the last tragic scene where Lazenby shows that he had the potential of making a great actor.I recommend this fine movie to all Bond fans.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
239,connorbbalboa,Underrated? Nah.,8,10 February 2017,"Most modern critic reviews say that this Bond film was under-appreciated when first released and that it has held up better over the years. While I certainly don't dislike On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I must say that I don't think it's as good as those critics and Bond fans make it out to be. Everyone says it was an attempt to make Bond more emotionally-sensitive and serious than previous films, but it comes off to me as more of a half-hearted attempt. It's more like a prototype for later Bond films that would try this like Casino Royale.To get it off my chest, I will say that George Lazenby, while he does put in a very good effort, is no Sean Connery or Daniel Craig. My first problem is that (not to sound racist) he looks too American for a British Secret Service agent. Also, a lot of his performance seems to be mimicking Connery's, trying to replicate a suave personality, but lacking the ruthlessness that Connery was able to pull off. Although to be fair, in the scene where Lazenby's Bond reacts to his wife Tracy's (Diana Riggs) death, he pulls it off very well; he also can fight good, it seems.Here, the plot is that Bond is offered a considerable sum of money from a European crime lord if he marries his daughter, Tracy. While Tracy is reluctant at first, she and Bond get to know each other, and, after preventing an evil scheme by famous Bond baddie Blofeld (Telly Savalas), get married after it seems that Bond is ready to give up being a ladies man secret agent with a license to kill, until Tracy is murdered that is. The idea that Bond would want to get married and give up being a secret agent who beds any woman he pleases is a very good idea, but unfortunately, for a considerable amount of time after getting to know one another, the Bond/Tracy relationship is tossed to the side in favor of Bond tracking down Blofeld, and it seems that Bond declares his love for Tracy too early. Others have pointed this out as a criticism and I agree with those people. Really, after the scene with Bond and Tracy at the bull-fighting ring, all we get is a montage of them being happy together before Bond has to find Blofeld.Blofeld is not a very good villain here. While he does try to kill Bond himself at points, unlike previous entries in the series, he makes some very stupid decisions, such as leaving Bond in a room where he can find a way to escape after revealing his secret plan and falling for the ploy where Tracy's father and Bond, via radio communication from a helicopter, say that they are carrying blood for the Red Cross. I don't expect a smart Bond villain to fall for such a thing. Blofeld in You Only Live Twice, while having an underwhelming and rushed first meeting with Bond, was able to see through the scheme involving his fake death.The action scenes are shot very well most of the time, although a couple of them are shot more in the manner of the ""shaky cam"" of some of today's action films, and it can get very confusing. Another gripe I have is that while the director, Peter Hunt, said repeatedly that he wanted his Bond film to be different, he must not have been confident in this objective because in the first several scenes, mainly, there are quite a few references to the previous films with Connery that don't fit at all. The opening credits sequence features footage from the previous films, Lazenby's Bond, after seeing Tracy drive away from him during their first meeting, says ""This never happened to the other fellow (referencing Connery's Bond),"" and there is even a pointless scene where Bond tries to resign so we can get a look at objects from three of the previous films, which I doubt he would have been able to keep as souvenirs. It's like the filmmakers were too afraid of people wondering what happened to Connery and decided to make references that acknowledged that his Bond and Lazenby's Bond are the same character.Despite the negative criticism I've given, I do acknowledge what this film has tried to do with Bond. However, it cannot be completely excused of its flaws that keep it from working completely. A storyline about an emotionally-sensitive Bond stripped down to his core was done much better in Casino Royale nearly forty years later. In my mind, if you're going to try to make Bond more of a serious character in his films, go all the way, or don't go for it at all.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

242,Pinback-4,Long live Lazenby,9,1 October 2000,"This is the Bond film that stands apart from the rest of the series, and fans either love it or hate it.  The reason it stands out, of course, is the casting of George Lazenby, a model who had never done any acting.  He is perhaps a bit too young, but he fits the ""look"" of Bond perfectly.  He can also hold his own against the other four Bonds in the fight scenes. Ironically, it is Lazenby, along with Timothy Dalton, who most closely resembles the James Bond in Ian Fleming's books.  It's interesting that they're the ones who were mostly rejected by Bond fans, making only three films between the two of them.  It's a shame, because Lazenby is pretty good here, and it's safe to say that he would've grown into the role if he went on to make more Bond films.  This is the first film in which Bond is not a larger than life hero.  He doesn't have any gadgets to help him out of a jam and must use his fists to take care of bad guys (see the impressive hotel room fight).  James Bond is much more vulnerable, and Lazenby's lack of acting experience and occasional discomfort actually work to the film's advantage.  If you look carefully during the scene at the carnival where he's being chased on foot, he's actually scared!  This is also the only Bond movie where Bond falls in love and is willing to give up his career to get married.  He even tries to resign near the beginning of the film, something he wouldn't do again until LICENCE TO KILL twenty years later.  (These two films have much more in common than you might think).  The film is the longest one to date, at two hours and twenty minutes, and surprisingly, there's not a whole lot of action until the last forty minutes or so.  The movie really takes its time during its midsection when Bond is undercover at the Swiss allergy clinic as Sir Hilary Bray, a heraldry specialist.  The plot has Bond tracking down Blofeld and trying to stop him before he brainwashes ten women from around the world  to contaminate crops and livestock.  Bond enlists the help of an organized crime boss, who is the father of Tracy, the woman he falls in love with.  The action scenes are among the best in the entire series, especially the stock car race and the fight on the bobsled run.  Peter Hunt, who edited the previous films, proves himself a solid director.  The supporting cast of Diana Rigg, Telly Savalas, and Gabriele Ferzetti comes off very nicely, balancing Lazenby's inexperience.  The music and cinematography are top-notch.  The ending is all the more poignant because this was Lazenby's last scene as James Bond; it would've been nice if he got to seek revenge in the next film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
243,CosmicDwellings,Very Good!,9,13 January 2001,"The sixth Bond outing and most definitely one of the best scripts and it doesn't really faulter that much without Connery, even though he might have given a better performance than the unknown George Lazenby.When viewing this film today with Lazenby as Bond , I have total admiration for this guy who stuck out his neck, and ego, to proclaim himself as the new James Bond over Sean Connery,who obviously was the established actor who had made the role his own over the previous years. But, love or hate George Lazenby, he definitely is James Bond in this one and pulls it off superbly. Would Sean have done a better job?...I'm sorry, but we'll never know now...I think in part what made this movie was the quality of the script (Bond getting married-wow!) and from that it certainly was a different Bond in every respect. Once again as in previous Bond films we have a fine supporting cast which was another winning factor. Telly Savalas has got to be the most favoured actor to play Blofeld amongst the other actors portrayals throughout the years?... Diana Rigg, fresh from her TV work in 'The Avengers', is magnificent as Tracey,and surely was a role model for future Bond girl co-stars.There's some nice action sequences and good humour thrown into this film throughout, and I think it's an important piece to acknowledge in the history of the James Bond phenomena. We've also got a great opening sequence as well as John Barry working on a great instrumental theme tune along with Louis Armstrong making his mark with the love theme, 'We Have All The Time In The World'.I would have liked to have seen this movie remade in later years starring another underrated James Bond-Tim Dalton.

244,jlabine,The Best James Bond Film (without Sean Connery)!!!,10,25 August 2000,"Sean Connery is James Bond, there is no subsitute! Now, that I got that out of the way, the 1969 United Artists release ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", is the best James Bond film. One time J.B. film editor Peter Hunt, made his directorial debut with this film, and for a debut film...it's truly amazing! With the previous films, it seems as if Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli were quite content to discard Ian Flemming's original novels, and subsitute it with flashy production costs and new scripts (a notion that is still being practiced to this day). Now this is by no means really bad (being a BIG FAN of both movies and novels, I have no real complaints), but it was fantastic to see that (for me) this film combines the greatest qualities of both. Now there's no argument that ""O.H.M.S.S."" was the worst received Bond film (it grossed the lowest box office earnings!), and that it (to this day) still rankles quite a few Bond fans to the point of anger. So in the end, ""O.H.M.S.S."" remains a cult favourite amongst fans of the movies and especially those of the novels (it's my all time personal favourite!). This film rids itself of ALL the unnecessary silliness that's prevalent in the later films. It has a harsh seriousness, that was one of the virtues of the novels. This James Bond is a moody, romantic, fallable, darker, and even more athletic than the previous films. He's very much a human, and not so super-human as in the other films. I quite like the scenes in where he tries to resign, when he's feeling under appreciated (would Connery's Bond even care?). This is a real moody Bond. And to be honest, I don't think Connery could have played a Bond like this. It's through George Lazenby's lack of actor's confidence that fits well with this insecure more human Bond. George Lazenby (a former model and car salesman) had only acted in a few comercials, before he was cast to play Bond. Considering his previous experience, he does amazingly well in his first outing. Though, I do quite laugh at film critic Danny Peary's description of George Lazenby as resembling a ""bland cartoon generated version of Connery"". But in all reality, there is really only one Sean Connery. And Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Bronson are not him either. So, knowing that Connery would not come back, who were their choices? Michael Cain or Patrick MacGoohan, maybe? Well, we got Lazenby. And I feel like he gets a raw deal from the critics. I'm actually a bit of a fan of his cult filmography. I like the fact, that no matter how many critics bash his performance, he still gets out there and tries to make a name for himself as an actor. Cheers to Lazenby! Anyways, he's not so bad, especially when it comes to the action scenes. He's very believable kicking the baddie's a**e*. And when we get to the ending, he looks like he's getting close to the funny farm. Now this is Bond I like to see! James Bond nearly has a mental breakdown on his wedding day! The rest of the cast is fantastic as well. The beautiful Diana Rigg (who adds a large dose of class in anything she appears in) as Tracy, is the feisty daughter of crime lord Marc-Ange Draco (played by the great Gabriele Ferzetti). Bond's interest to find arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leads him to Draco for information of Blofeld's whereabouts. For information of Blofeld, Draco has persuaded Bond to court his daughter Tracy (whom Bond already more or less does of his own free will), because Draco thinks of it as therapy for her. His search eventually takes him to the top of the Swiss Alps, where Blofeld (strangely acted by Telly Savalas) is hiding out at Piz Gloria blackmailing the world with Fist Omega (germ warfare!!!). His means of dispensing this terror comes in the form of (allergy ridden) beautiful women from all over the world! What a GREAT story!!! Sounds like an Avenger's episode! Well, it may sound a little over the top, but director Peter Hunt actually makes it work with a real seriousness. The cinematography by Michael Reed is at times breathtaking and wonderful. The escape from Piz Gloria, (ski chase scene) is tense, and you begin to actually fear that Bond might actually get caught (and usually Bond films are anything but tense). The music score is probably John Barry's BEST, especially the main title theme!!! And this film stays so close to the book, that really the only changes made are for the better. I know that a lot of Bond fans will disagree, but I can't recommend this movie enough! I love the way the plot is allowed to develop, rather than just be another eye candy spectacle. It also has a sort of European look to the film (possibly due to heavy dubbing of the actors?), which makes it sort of stick out from the other Bond films. It's time that ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" received it fair dues as the Best Bond film, and that George Lazenby wasn't all bad. And for all those who think this is boring, don't bother reading the books. Because this movie is a pretty close aproximation of the novels. Highly recommended on all counts!!! I give it a 15 out of 10!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The sixth 007 movie is without a dout the best. Fantastic plot details, great fight senes, and action sequences that will take your breath away. And Tracy is the best Bond girl. The only problem that 007 fans had with this movie is that George Lazenby was the least interesting Bond. Which isn't really true.

246,bock_g,Certainly one of the best.,10,17 November 2010,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) is the first Bond film to replace Sean Connery and the only film which Australian actor George Lazenby portrays the role of James Bond. This film is probably the most faithful adaption to the Bond novels, giving the film a sense of realism and drama. James Bond is on a search for his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (portrayed by Telly Savalas) who had merely escaped his death from the previous film, You Only Live Twice (1967). He encounters a beautiful countess named Tracy (portrayed by Diana Rigg) who is the daughter of Marc Ange Draco (portrayed by Gabrielle Fazzetti), boss of a huge crime organization called the Union Corse. Due to Bond's detour, M (Bernard Lee) suspends him from the mission, Bond responds to almost resigning from the Secret Service as he is saved by Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) who writes to M that he was going to take a several-week vacation. As Bond falls in love with Tracy, he also finds connections to Blofeld through a College of Arms professor, Sir Hillary Bray (portrayed by George Baker). Apparently Blofeld is disguising as a Count running a clinic in the Swiss Alps that supposedly cures allergies of all kinds. Bond infiltrates Blofeld's base disguising as Hillary Bray, encountering beautiful girl patients (""Angels of Death"") from various countries. Bond discovers the psychic therapy the patients go through while sleeping with one of the patients. Bond's cover gets blown and is captured by Blofeld, who reveals his plan to spread a pandemic that could wipe out the world through his ""cured"" patients. Bond escapes the base through an elaborate and well-choreographed ski chase as he encounters Tracy who helps him escape from Blofeld's crew. Later that night, Bond proposes to Tracy (something we will never see in a Bond film) and plans to quit his job after this mission. Unfortunately, their time is cut short as Blofeld kidnaps Tracy after another ski chase. Bond and Draco rescues Tracy and blows up Blofeld's facility. Blofeld breaks his neck during a bobsled chase with Bond, but manages to survive. Bond and Tracy get married and are happily driving down the road until a sudden machine gun fire from Blofeld's henchman Irma Bunt (portrayed by Ilse Steppat) fatally hits Tracy. The film ends with Bond in tears (another thing we'll never see in a Bond film) over his blood-shed Bride, as he murmurs to a traffic cop that ""We had all the time in the World"". This film was financially successful, but did not make a profit as much as its predecessors did. The critical response was somewhat positive, but was negative towards Lazenby's portrayal of James Bond. I would give a lot of credit to the filmmakers (especially director Peter Hunt) who polished Lazenby into a fine Bond. Considering how Lazenby did not have any acting experience prior to this film, I would give him credit for portraying that very emotional and tender side of Bond. Lazenby also matched that physique of a Bond, as it is portrayed through the excellently choreographed fight sequences. Despite those feats, Lazenby quit the role of Bond from a bad career advice from his agent who saw no future into the Bond films. I would also praise Lazenby for not parroting Connery's take on Bond, as most actors would most-likely parrot their predecessor's approach to the character. This film would not have been as good if Connery was portraying his rough and cold-hearted edge of Bond. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a great film with great action, story, and music that defines the true essence and pleasure of a Bond film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
247,jonny_mcclatch,My least favourite Bond.,3,4 February 2020,"There are many reasons this film didn't achieve what it should have for me, George Lazenby simply wasn't the right actor for the part. He didn't make the role his own and never looked convincing in it, the same has to be said for Telly Savalas who isn't a bad actor. He simply wasn't right for the character, he was a more physically imposing version of Blofeld which was an odd choice considering how previous films had panned out.The worst part is that the actual premise of the movie isn't bad, Diana Rigg was an excellent choice for Tracy. One thing I do have to credit Lazenby with is his acting in one of the most important scenes of the entire series, the death of Tracy which was really well done. The problem is the rest of the movie around it, something about it doesn't fit with the rest of the Bond franchise in the same way the original Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again didn't. In an odd way I feel things may have been a bit different if he got more than one movie under his belt, trying to replace Connery was always going to be near impossible. In the long run he ended up in between arguably the two best Bond actors which didn't help but may have eased Roger Moore's transition into the role.Out of all the movies this one would be a great choice for a remake, it worked for Casino Royale and there's a good enough story for it to work here.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
248,tomasg-69814,"Actually, One Of The Best.",8,23 January 2016,"It has been written so darn much about George Lazenby's brief career as James Bond. He was the model who slipped into acting, the producers wanted him to sign a contract for seven movies, but he acted real bad and cocky between shots, he didn't see a future for James Bond on the big screen. He thought the concept was watered-down and the era now called for more revolutionary movies as Easy Rider. And so on. So what? Just imagine if G.L had went on all trough the 70's, making a 007 every other year until 1981. Then passing on to one Timothy Dalton (he was an object very early for the production team) who full-fills a four movie contract which starts in '83 and ends in '89. (Meaning these two actors splitting up the ""Roger Moore-era"" films between each other, without Moore himself never happened as Bond, of course. He entered a half- ass cop show after The Persuaders, in 1972, which lasted some four or five seasons.) Then the gap as we already know it until '95, entering Golden Eye/Brosnan, and then it goes on in the order as we know it today.A wild thought, uh? But, anyway, I always have liked this movie, always will. It has a great fan-club of it's own among some 007-fans. The screenplay is great, the directing of Peter Hunt is great, Telly S. portraits E.S. Blofeld good. (Bald as we want the evil man to be for the right feeling...) Diana Rigg as the strong, independent, but also fragile and erratic woman, is also great. (Both in looks and acting.) The love story - who's equivalent not be repeated (almost) until Casino Royale in 2006 - gives a human deep between action shots as the thrilling ski race and the Piz Gloria showdown.George Lazenby himself never did anything quite bad in this movie, in my opinion. Remember him good for his one shot, it's there in the log whether you like it or not. You can also enjoy the lacking of (unnecessary) gadgets if you want. (But it's a fun scene when Lazenby/007 cleaning the office's desk out of ""keepsakes"".) One of my personal favorite Bond's.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
249,louiss,Still The Best Bond: Spoilers,10,16 June 2001,"James Bond has been a part of my life almost my entire life. I have seen every EON produced film in the cinema prior to television. I have read all of Fleming's novels and a few by Gardner. I anxiously wait for the next installment between films. My favorites have changed as I have grown up. The one constant is that On Her Majesties Secret Service has been and I believe will always be my favorite. The first thing that must be mentioned is the performance of George Lazenby. Lazenby's casting in the series has been perhaps the most controversial event in the entire series. The most obvious reason being he was the first to replace Connery. I can't think of any film series in cinematic history in which an actor so strongly anchored down a role that replacing him would be almost sacrilegious! After all look how long Connery floundered after he left the series. As the promo stated Connery Is Bond !! Lazenby is the best Bond after Connery. Why ? To start with Moore, Dalton & Brosnan all lacked the physical presence of Connery specially Dalton who I think I could kick his ass. Lazenby on the other hand looked solid in a tux and very convincing in fight scenes as well as walking and moving with a confident arrogance about him. After all Bond films are first and foremost action films. Lazenby's acting was a bit stiff but I believe had he continued the role he would have improved with age and been able to carry the series for many years as he was the youngest ever to portray Bond. Overall Lazenby's performance was far better than Moore who nearly destroyed the series with his contempt and buffoonery. Dalton was very good actually resembling the literary Bond more than even Connery but again he lacked any physical presence or humor. Brosnan could be the best next to Connery if he bulked up a little.OHMSS represents the last serious Bond film ` if you can call a Bond film serious ` before a long period of silly almost self parody entries starting with Diamonds Are Forever and ending with A View To A Kill. OHMSS is perhaps closer to a Fleming novel than any other entry and yet is also the most visually cinematic. The majority of the action is in the Swiss alps and the cinematography is the best in the series. Bonds accent in the helicopter to Piz Gloria is breathtaking. Of all the locations I've seen in Bond cinema a view from Piz Gloria is the one I hope to someday experience. The plot or scheme SPECTRE Ala. Ernst Stavro Blofeld of spreading biological world destruction with his brainwashed angels of death is refreshing after the endless atomic and nuclear bomb threats rehashed over and over again in previous and future entries.  The truly unique element of OHMSS of course is Bonds serious relationship and marriage to Tracy. Who else could capture Bond's heart and measure up to his bravado other than Diana Rigg or should I say Emma Peel?!. A lot of people have commented ` too bad Connery didn't star in this film just think what he would have done ` If Connery signed on for OHMSS I GARENTEE the formula would have been that of You Only Live Twice and the marriage and seriousness would have been dropped. This is not to say Connery wouldn't want to do it that way but Broccoli would have balked and stayed with a proven formula which was resurrected with DAF. OHMSS is also completely void of gadgetry. I don't favor having or not having gadgetry in a Bond film. I think that alternating its presence through the series has been a good idea. I believe that its absence in OHMSS is a big plus for several reasons. The previous four films starting with From Russia With Love through You Only Live Twice went from introducing gadgetry to oppressing us with an overabundance of it to the point of turning James Bond into robot that pushes a button to dispose of his enemies and escape every danger. By dropping it from OHMSS Bond is allowed to use his mental and physical skills to solve his problems most notably when escaping the giant cogs of a cable car mechanism.  This also provided Lazenby the opportunity to display his physical assets. Had the gadgetry been employed here his performance would have suffered more.What really makes OHMSS stand out is the action. The pre-credit fight and subsequent fight in Tracy's hotel room are fast and furious. A trademark of early Bond films but sadly lacking in latter Bond films. Although there is a long gap between these two fights and the next action sequence Bond's escape from Piz Gloria the last 30 minutes or so we are treated to some of the best action sequences ever staged. Two ski chases, a car chase, another fight, a real avalanche, a helicopter raid on Blofeld's institute and a bobsled chase. The editing is rapid fire and all of the action is fast and energetically intense blended with Barry's magnificent score and Reed's lavish cinematography. The ski chase has since become a reoccurring action piece in later Bond films however only the pre-credit sequence in The Spy Who Loved Me compares and that was the best and only exciting action scene in that film.
The ending is another source of controversy? Why? I don't know how else could it end? Unless they intended to make this the final Bond film could I see Tracy not dying otherwise how could the series continue? Remember this was made in 1969 everybody died at the end of a movie in 1969. Unfortunately OHMSS was not a big success and the finger was pointed directly at Lazenby. There were consequences that proved to be good and bad from this. To the good the producers managed to get Connery back one more time. To the bad Lazenby was through as Bond ` by his own choice `. How was this bad? I had to put up with Roger Moore for 12 years and seven films, all of which are on the bottom of my Bond rankings. The series also never again departed from the usual formula again until License To kill another excellent but different Bond film. Like OHMSS it was also a box office failure. I think real Bond fans like both of these films but the general Bond public will only accept the formula established by Goldfinger. I believe it serves the series well to depart occasionally from traditional formula and OHMSS did it exceedingly well. When compared to today's action films, OHMSS stands up very well while I think the other Bond films of its time have lost some of there impact and if you look at films by Bay & Woo which I hate you can see an attempt to edit action fervidly. They fail miserably by over editing to the point of making the action incoherent. OHMSS stands out for being fresh unique and ultimately the most exciting Bond film ever.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

George Lazenby is Bond! The voice, the hairstyle, the body, the charisma, the total package!Never mind the acting pedigree or his short acting background at the time, this was the movie. If you lived in East Anglia UK, you could not see this movie for years, as it was constantly screened on London TV. I was green with envy with school-friends, that had 2 TV aerials. Telly Savalas, Dianna Rigg, Louis Armstrong plus the gadget less story, what a combination. OK I hear the purists shouting expletives, on reading this. The constant statement that this movie did not gross enough at the box office, is futile. 8 Million cost, grossing 80 Million, nice earner in my book.Every scene is near bard perfect. The story, the action, the girls, just eek-ed quality,cosmopolitan charisma. That hooded blue cagoule, George wears in the ski scene, is a real fashion statement, of the gentlemen action man, at his best. The music, the love story. The haunting opening scene was just magical. It will never be repeated, it is not meant to be! It was history and synchronicity,to the brand, explored at its best.

252,gerard-21,"A For Effort, C For Outcome",6,30 May 2000,"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster. The best portrayed characters of the movie are those of Tracy and her father. But the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with Lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor. This movie is too long (140 mins.) for a Bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until Bond's mountain escape, where it begins to pick up. This film tries very hard, but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but I always get a sense of something missing when watching this one.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
253,lostinaction,A new fella but James Bond is still the same!,9,19 November 2008,"Just watched On her Majesty Secret Service. A great Movie with a good plot, great music, marvelous winter sport action and a fine cast. Only George Lazenby disturbs. He cannot act and you see (hear) it in most of his scenes that he has troubles. OMG what a masterpiece this would have been with Sean Connery. Roger Moore could have started with DAF which is more Moore like as a Movie for Connery.Back to the Movie. The Introduction of the new Bond after Sean is with a nice Fight at the sea and with a great One Liner at the End: ""This never happened to the other fella"". The Skiing Chases are still terrific to watch. IMO only the scenes at the opening sequence of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME are coming close. I read some chapters of Ian Flemings Novel and the James Bond of the Book is more passive as the 007 of the Movie. In the Book James Bond doesn't know who Draco is in the Movie he knows everything (OK at least one thing not!) about him. It's fun to see the differences/similarities between the novel and the film.I liked the cast with Telly Savalas as Blofeld, Diana Rigg as Tracy and Gabriele Ferzetti as Draco. Don't understand any complaints about them. Of course Donald Pleasance was remarkable as Blofeld but I always liked Savalas Blofeld more than the Blofeld in DAF.

Don't get me wrong, Lazenby is more than credible, but he is utterly diminished by the film's grand scope. After 40 minutes of relaxed and confident introduction, OHMSS reaches top gear with four overblown climaxes that generate more energy and punch than all Bond movies put together.

256,jawlaw,An unjustly maligned film,10,8 June 2004,"Most people think Connery was the best Bond of all. I think he clearly was.Unfortunately he quit before the books all found their way onto film--or at least the titles of the books.Lazenby was brought in to replace Connery. I think he did as well as anyone could be expected. He had a hard act to follow but rose to the occasion. He succeeded in keeping the character of the agent consistent with that which Connery had created. Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan have all created new characters that have but little connection to the persona created by Connery. Each was named ""James Bond"" but each was hard to connect up with the character Connery pioneered. This break in character does not happen to Lazenby. Though he was the novice actor, he did the best of anyone in maintaining the personality of Bond as Connery has envisioned and created it.Actually OHMSS was a good script and a well executed movie. Had Lazenby remained in the role, I believe Connery's hold on the role would have been lessened. It is easy to criticize this film, without really considering its attributes. For my money, Lazenby was a good replacement, the script was well written, the gadgets were kept within reason, the fight scenes were well edited, and the action scenes very exciting. Lazenby was as macho as Connery and, like Connery, kept the character of Bond from being a one dimensional ""comic strip"" hero. The ""other fellows"" simply did not achieve this. I never really believed Moore, Dalton, or Brosnon could carry on a believable fight scene. I felt like I was personally capable of kicking their butts and could not believe that they were really capable of beating up the ""tuffs"" that they were pitted against. However, Connery and Lazenby never did an unbelievable fight scene. I thought their movements were athletic, lethal and manly. It is a shame that Lazenby did not remain in the role. His toughness and suave presence would have been so much better than Moore in the later movies.My only criticism of the film is that Donald Pleasance should have been reprised as Blofeld. Pleasance was sinister and cerebral. Savalas was dunderheaded and low brow. This break in character screwed up the continuity of the ""arch villain."" It is no wonder that Pleasance was the model for Myer's ""Dr. Evil."" He defined the role of Blofeld in the same way that Connery had defined Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
257,crazychap,The best non-Connery Bond,9,10 November 2008,"In 1967, after the release of You Only Live Twice, Sean Connery tells the media that he's had enough of James Bond and is stepping down from the role. After playing the same character five times in a row, who could blame him? The result is finding a successor worthy of his standard. Among the contenders are young Shakespearian actor Timothy Dalton, Roger ""the Saint"" Moore (who also rivalled Sean from the beginning) and a relative unknown named George Lazenby. In the end, Lazenby becomes the new James Bond.After two over-the-top Bond films (1965's ""Thunderball"" and 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"") in which the plot and humour became second-fiddle to action sequences, this film has exceeded my expectations. George Lazenby is actually a worthy successor to Sean Connery; although Connery had more edge and humour, Lazenby's performance shows more range. The art direction, the special effects are all top-notch (not just for 1969) and do deserve some nominations, and the music score is among the best of the saga. Diana Rigg is, in my opinion, the best Bond Girl since Ursula Andress from the original (""Dr. No""). M, Q and Moneypenny are also given a lot more to do in this one, and their presence in the movie is welcomed as usual.I know what you're thinking: How dare you praise such a ""bad Bond""? But you have to see it to believe it. Most people have derided this movie without even seeing it and mostly of the fact that Lazenby, under poor advice from his agent, did not reprise his role for the next one. Whoever that agent is, he must be shot for giving him false advice.My only complaints are that the movie is VERY long (142 min NTSC/136 PAL) and the pace is a little slow at times. Blofeld is well-written and is given a lot more to do than the last one, but I'd prefer to have Donald Pleasance reprising the role since Telly Savalas is less convincing and too ""American"" for me. Nevertheless, these flaws are of no importance.In short, this movie is a masterpiece among Bond films and the only one worthy of Dr.No and Goldfinger. If you want a movie that combines both smart storytelling, well-made production values and also great action scenes as well as likable leads: This one is for youI personally would have wanted Lazenby to reprise the role at least a second time.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
258,spinin,"What was once an underrated Bond film, is now overrated",6,12 July 2021,"James Bond (George Lazenby) falls in love with a Mob boss' daughter Teresa (Diana Rigg), while simultaneously going undercover and infiltrating Blofeld's (Telly Savalas) allergy research facility in the Swiss alps, hoping to uncover his new plot and to stop his arch-nemesis once and for all.I've gone back and forth on this film. When I first saw it as a kid, I was underwhelmed and really missed not seeing Sean Connery or Roger Moore in the iconic role. Upon repeated viewings, I grew to like the movie and even started to consider it one of the better ones in the series. Based on my most recent viewing, I am finding myself very critical of the film once more.To start, Lazenby really falls short as James Bond. He has enough of a screen presence for the role, but truly lacks the acting ability. I'm not sure which actor would have been best for this movie, one of the most tragic ones in the series. In a way, perhaps it is good that it was Lazenby, as this film really stands apart from the rest in terms of the love story that unfolds. And as such, perhaps it is good that it was a one-time thing for another actor, rather than another Sean Connery movie. Having said all that, Lazenby isn't believable as a love interest to Teresa (Diana Rigg). He comes across as goofy, and not very believable as James Bond either. He is outshined by nearly every other main character in the film and out-acted by Rigg, Telly Savalas, and nearly anyone else he shares the screen with. Which results in a pretty good story, with memorable characters, but not a very good James Bond story. Things just happen to him here and Lazenby lacks the conviction to sell Bond as a sly and charming man of action.The movie has one of the best scores in the series and has a lot of memorable scenes, but it isn't any of the action scenes that stand out. Lets be honest, it's only the weight of the love tragedy that makes it memorable. Savalas makes a good Blofeld. However, the scenes where Bond is undercover in his Swiss alp hideaway go on too long and are at times as boring as Sir Hilary Bray, the man he is impersonating. Both Lazenby's portrayal of Bray, and the dubbing of his voice, really weaken his overall performance in this movie. During all of these sequences it is easy to forget that one is watching a James Bond film.A lot of the action sequences really suffer from the shaky cam techniques and quick jump cuts that are used. I found this to be terribly distracting and disorienting. The bobsled scene in particular was great in idea and poor in execution. All the suspense is lost because of the choppiness of the editing and the terrible back-screen projection.This could have been a great Bond film, but the execution and Lazenby's portrayal are both very off. I don't buy that Teresa would fall for him. I don't buy that he is a competent agent with a license to kill. And toward the end, Bond makes a stupid mistake with Blofeld, giving him an opening for the tragedy that eventually transpires and allowing him to roam free once more. On the plus side, Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat) was a good addition as Blofeld's henchwoman.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

260,jackhamel1987,"By far, the most underrated Bond Film.",9,7 April 2013,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in my opinion, is one of the best Bonds and has never received the credit that it truly deserves. I think it boasts the best plot since From Russia With Love, some fabulous locations, some absolutely superb actions scenes, and surely if not quite the most iconic Bond girl, Diana Rigg as the finest Bond girl who so easily captures the heart. Of course, it also stars George Lazenby, who is the man who divided opinion more than the Berlin Wall divided East and West Germany. I personally think that for this film, he is the perfect choice, and I think he's even more underrated than them film itself. And that is a great shame.OHMSS starts with our new James Bond (Lazenby),saving the life of suicidal Tracy Di Vincenzo whilst presumably chasing the trail of Blofeld. He and Tracy meet again later at a casino, where he once again rescues her when she can't pay a debt. Finally, after 'repaying' Bond, she disappears and Bond travels back to London. Whilst in London, Bond is told by M to drop the Blofeld case because of the lack of progress. Appalled, Bond attempts to resign, only to discover that Moneypenny applied for 2 weeks leave instead. This granted, Bond travels back to Switzerland, coming across Tracy and her powerful father who help him track Blofeld to the mountains of Switzerland, where he is planning to launch a Biological chemical attack unless he is pardoned for his past crimes. This, of course, isn't acceptable to Bond and he attempts to stop Blofeld. The plot point that sets this aside from all other Bonds, is that he falls in love with Tracy, and after thinking he has stopped Blofeld, he marries Tracy, only for her to be killed by Blofeld in the final scene. The elephant in the room with this film has always been George Lazenby as James Bond. He is either a man you will like in the role, or dislike. I personally think that no other actor in the Bond serious could have acted this as touchingly or as sensitively as Lazenby, and I think that he suffers because he is so different to Sean Connery. Connery's Bond was ruthless with a touch of dry wit, who took what he wanted and left what he didn't want. Lazenby, in contrast, shows that Bond isn't a superhuman - he's just a human. No gadgets here, just a decent man trying to do the right thing, who falls in love and pays the price for it. He shows that Bond does care about the women he beds, that he does feel emotion for colleagues and those around him, and that he takes his failing very personally. I have tried to imagine the final scene of this film with every other Bond, from Connery to Craig, and I just don't think anyone could have done that scene as well as Lazenby. He was a very, very worthy Bond who had the hardest job in being the man who originally replaced Connery. Some think he didn't do it. I think he did. I also think that had he continued, the franchise wouldn't have had suffered quite as badly with some of the later 'camp' Bonds.Diana Rigg also shines here as Bond's only real love interest, the ill- fated Tracy. And, let's face it, when she rescues Bond on the ice-rink, you can see why I think she stands out as the best Bond girl. She has grace, charm, and is resourceful and brave. She is exactly who Bond would fall for. But, as we know, a married Bond would have ended the franchise, so there is an inevitability that it will all go wrong for her. Diana Rigg acts this so superbly, and you just can't help but have a soft spot for her. The plot is also another serious strength here, and the idea of a biological attack on a country is very, very relevant and believable. Blofeld as a villain is almost second to this, though I do think Telly Savalas has a certain understated sense of evil about him. This is all backed up with some brilliant, thrilling actions sequences such as the scene in the lawyer's office, the scene on the slopes, and the final scene. It also has some very human scenes as well, taken Bond away from the comfort zone of arch-villains and crazy plots, and placing him in a very close, personal situation. And to top it off, there's a really sharp score by John Barry. If you like this film, you'll know what I mean when I say that this is underrated. If you don't, give it another chance, and rather than compare it to Connery, who is a different Bond, just watch it as a stand-alone feature. You might be turned by Lazenby's human performance. 9/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
261,MondoMirth,It's Such A Long Way Down,7,4 January 2020,"Peter Hunt does a great job making the action scenes stand out from not only the rest of the film, but also of all other 60s Bond iterations. Bond doesn't use as many convenient gadgets, He actually comes up with solutions from everyday things. The ways Bond acts and the things he does make him seem deadlier and more trained than Sean Connery's Bond. There are some bad dubbings and audio cuts throughout the movie, but besides it being a little slow at points and having a few unnecessary scenes its a watchable film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
262,trekfan2001,"Good story, bad actor.",6,14 June 2003,"*** May contain spoilers ***OHMSS has an above average 007 story, the action is good, there are plenty of girls, great locations and the usual one-liners. So what could be wrong with this movie? To put it simply, the acting is terrible in this film.
George Lazenby is a pathetic actor and why Broccoli and Saltzman hired him is beyond comprehension. IMHO Lazenby's biggest problem is that he tries too hard to be Sean Connery and it simply doesn't work. The one-liners sound ridiculous when he says them and the rest of the dialog just sounds like he's simply reading the lines. Fortunately this was his one and only effort at playing 007.As for the rest of the cast. Telly Savalas is an ok Blofeld, Diana Rigg is a good bond woman, Gabriele Ferzetti does a good job as Draco and the rest of the cast (Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn, Lois Maxwell) do their usual good job. However, I found the girls in Blofeld's ""research centre"" to be *extremely* annoying. If anything, I think they did as much to ruin this film as Lazenby.I also think that the wedding from the novel should have been left out of the movie. I think a better way to do it would have been for Blofeld to kill her before he escapes from his hideout during the attack. That way we could have seen Bond fall in love with her and still have her killed. Maybe it then could have ended with Bond informing her father about her death. IMHO the ending as it was filmed simply didn't work. Lazenby did a poor job acting that scene and I think it was out of place in this style of movie.Anyway, OHMSS is not too bad if you can ignore Lazenby's attempt at 007. I rate it 6/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
263,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Hardly the classic it's been built up as (SPOILERS),8,22 June 2005,"When Sean Connery left the role of James Bond after the release of ""You Only Live Twice"", most critics agreed that the spy would finally die. Connery was seen as the glue that held the series together and while he was a fantastic Bond, the actual quality of the films was what made them classics. Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Salzman realized this and started looking for a new man for their next epic film, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". After a lengthy auditioning process, they found Australian model George Lazenby, hoping that he would eventually sign a seven year contract. Unfortunately, this was not to be and Lazenby quit before the film was released.In the ensuing years OHMSS was seen as a massive financial flop when the opposite is true. The film went on to become one of the top-grossing of 1970, but to this day the critical merits of the film are being debated. Some criticize Lazenby's performance and the love story; others go on to say that it's a masterpiece. I have overall come to appreciate it as a good entry into the series, even though it fails in some departments. My main gripe with the movie is the plot line, which is faithful to Ian Fleming's (overrated) novel. From the beginning, there's already a setback: Bond saves a girl from suicide and then meets her again in a casino. The problem with this is that in the book's time line, it's the other way around. By not following this outline, the fight with the thugs makes no sense (a half-baked explanation is given, but it's barely enough to answer this jump in logic). We're presented with a similar situation when another heavy attacks Bond in a hotel room for seemingly no reason other than to throw in a fight scene. Both cases end up looking like ridiculous coincidences. Incosistencies like this are rampant throughout the first half.On the subject of the fights, they're probably the most interesting in the series. Unfortunately, ""interesting"" in this case doesn't equal ""comprehensible"". Like ""Quantum of Solace"", the sped up editing in these scenes is bizarre and jarring. It's a shame too, because the choreography is great. Anyway, Bond is soon on the trail of his arch nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (this time played by Telly Savalas of ""Kojak"" fame) and travels to the gorgeous Swiss mountains to investigate, discovering that the madman is plotting biological warfare this time around.As I said, the plot is taken directly from the Fleming work and is one of the least remarkable in the whole series. Blofeld's entire plan relies on whether or not a dozen naive girls can follow his exact instructions. While it provides a convenient cover for his alias, wouldn't some SPECTRE agents be able to carry it out? How would they distribute the poison? Would it spread? Why is Bond wearing a kilt? These questions (except maybe the last one) riddle the plot with so many holes that it becomes impossible to take the threat seriously. The film also features a love story with Tracy, played by Diana Rigg. The novel crowbars it into the narrative and we don't get a good idea of their relationship, but director Peter Hunt puts a large focus on it, even going so far as to include a montage with Louis Armstrong's ""We Have All The Time In The World"" playing over the images. This helps define the Tracy character as a strong-willed woman who's more than a match for 007, even though (and I realize that this is probably a controversial statement) I find Rigg to be uneven at times.Besides the romantic sub plot, the other most mentioned aspects of OHMSS are the ski chases. Although they're no doubt great, they go on far too long and interrupt the ""serious"" tone of the movie. These scenes, along with the one where Bond breaks into a lawyer's office to find important information, could've been edited down for a more compact final cut. The latter, especially, while it contains one of John Barry's finest cues, might as well have been replaced completely with a shorter scene, where Bond gets the information he needs from the Heraldry, not that I mind the running length anyway.The verdict on George Lazenby is unfairly negative. He did a good job considering the pressure on him, his lack of acting experience, and the supposed lack of support from Hunt. The final scene in the movie works partly because of his heartfelt performance and with time, he would have matured into a great Bond. His main failing (being dubbed over by another actor) isn't even his fault; Hunt sometimes went overboard by dubbing in someone's voice when the character's mouths didn't even move. Furthermore, Lazenby's vulnerability works perfectly for the film. Supporting players like Savalas (the best Blofeld), Gabriele Ferzetti as Tracy's mob boss father Draco, and Ilse Steppat as the villainous Irma Bunt all hit the right notes, while John Barry composes one of his best film scores and Maurice Binder creates another mesmerizing title sequence.The climactic final battle at Blofeld's lair is exciting, but the real climax is when Tracy is brutally gunned down. While James Bond obviously isn't going to settle down, the bleak nature of how her murder comes about is expertly handled by all (except when the James Bond theme plays immediately after), so it's a shame that it's completely ignored in the proceeding camp fest, ""Diamonds Are Forever"". So while the series' time line is thrown completely out of whack, the sense of realism coming off of the previous entries in the Bond canon is a refreshing return. My opinion towards the film has changed over time and while I still don't see it as a masterpiece, it's not as terrible as I once thought it was and I would definitely now recommend it. 8/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
264,Raxing,A Bad Movie.,1,19 December 2020,"Do not believe the revisionists that pretend like everyone missed this ""gem"" of a movie and that is ""underrated"". This movie is awful. The movie is two hours and twenty two minutes, but it drags like it is four hours. The action scenes are so poorly shot that more than half the time I couldn't tell what was going on. The characters are boring and suck the life out of every scene. The way the movie is shot makes it look like it is low budget, but the budget was actually the same as Diamonds Are Forever. There is simply a big difference between a good filmmaker and a bad filmmaker that doesn't know what they are doing. The movie starts with no clear sense of direction and meanders that way for what feels like an hour. They start us off with no context and at the end the beginning still makes no sense. They couldn't even get the music right. They started the movie without a decent theme song and failed to use good music during the film.

265,joebondo,Plot with a twist but Connery or Moore was needed,6,6 November 2020,"As a lifelong Bond fan who left the series after ""Skyfall"" (the worst Bond movie I've ever seen and one of the worst movies I've ever seen period) this movie always fell through the cracks fir me. I've always heard mixed reviews of George Lazenby as Bond. I watched OHMSS the other night for the first time so I'll get into it.The plot has a unique twist, while Bond is pursuing the bad guy he actually falls genuinely in love. One of the few Bond movies Bond has a personal agenda (License to kill also comes to mind). I give the unique plot a rating of somewhere between an 8-9. However I was not impressed in the least with Lazenby's portrayal of Bond. I kept thinking if Connery could've hung in for one more Bond then quit, this might've been Connery's pinnacle as Bond but unfortunately we'll never know. It's too bad because I hear Connery grew tired of playing Bond yet the first half of this movie was a little different than his previous films and I think he would've enjoyed it.Lazenby just seemed out of place and not because he was replacing Connery because Roger Moore stepped into the role of Bond quite well. Lazenby's portrayal of Bond was awkward. His funny one liners were flat. He was a bit too lanky, I thought, for the role. Everything he was doing in the film just didn't seem natural. In one scene where he was trying to hide from Blofeld during a village festival his face displayed fear & trepidation. Connery never displayed these emotions as Bond but rather displayed a look of concern in his face instead when in a similar situation.It seemed like a lot of the fighting scenes were edited or speeded up. As with all Bond films there are some scenes that are incredulous that is needed to make the scenes work. There were a couple scenes in this movie that were just a little over the top & flawed. In one scene Blofeld causes an avalanche to stop the fleeing Bond & Tracy. So an entire mountain has an avalanche and Bond & Tracy get buried away in it. Blofeld spots them with his scope not far away. How convenient. Then he sends 2 henchmen to pickup the girl only. But wait, why not just kill them both or at least kill Bond? He was the one you & your men were chasing and he's the one who knows your secret plan and can blow the lid off your entire operation? Nah, we'll let him go. I'm sorry but that should've played out differently. In another scene Bond is chasing Blofeld in a bobsled. Bond's bobsled crashes and he thrown. Thrown all the way around back to Blofeld, who by this time is way ahead, back into the bobsled path enough to grab hold of a plus 100 mph bobsled? Please! All I ask is for a little more creative credibility when constructing these scenes. As I've said all Bond films have certain scenes that are ingenuine but these were definitely over the top.Overall the movie was above average. Once again a very good plot but a bad portrayal of Bond. Ironically if Connery would've stayed for this film then left and Lazenby's only film was Diamonds are forever, that film might've very well suited him better. This Bond film was ""personal"" and Bond fans had already established a connection with Connery in the role in its previous films so it would've been natural for Conney's Bond to fall in love and not a first time Bond.Definitely the saddest ending of any Bond film I watched. I didn't think Lazenby was very convincing in that final scene either.I didn't like George Lazenby as James Bond. That's just my opinion. You be your own judge. But I am glad that Lazenby took the advice of his agent and ditched the series after one outing.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
266,asdodge,Re-evaluate this ignored classic,8,12 December 2008,"This movie was PANNED by critics and accused of being a bomb in the theaters (it returned 10-times the production cost- but did not get the grossly huge returns of the previous two Bonds). The on-set turmoil between Lazenby and others, as well as his announcement he would not return even before the movie premiered had more to do with the film's lesser receipts than it being a poor movie.Had Lazenby stuck around, he may have out-Bond Connery. Lazenby was better looking (more handsome and less rough) and more in line with the novels' descriptions of Bond than Connery. However, the tides are changing and now that there are 22 Bond films (from EON), folks are more willing to recognize the quality of movies outside of Connery.The story and scripting are top notch, and once two divergent story lines merge, it gets better. The plot to OHMSS is based on the return of Blofeld and his schemes of world domination. The rumors of Blofeld running an allergy clinic and demanding recognition of some noble's title he claims is due him brings Bond in to investigate. Bond also comes across one Tracy Di Vicenzo (Dianna Rigg), a manic-depressive who rebels against the authority of her crime lord father. The father offers information and aid to Bond in exchange for Bond courting his daughter ""to dominate her."" Bond discovers that it is THE Blofeld and that Blofeld is up to no good (what a surprise!) and must work to stop him and his 'Angels of Death."" along the way, Bond actually falls in love with Tracy, leading to a climactic and shocking end-game in the story.Lazenby is fine as Bond- maybe not quite as comfortable as Connery had become and, even before filming he was being hounded for not being Connery. Yet, he has a charm and a smoothness even Connery did not have (though close) and was a good choice to replace Connery, as he was similar in looks, mannerisms, etc.The big question was Telly Savalas as Blofeld- probably the least appreciated version of Blofeld, Savalas is an able actor and is diabolical enough, just not as deeply sinister as we imagine Blofeld should be. Also, his voice was not dubbed, so there is a flat American accent and not the rolling, crackly voice of the other movies. Even Donald Pleasance (Blofeld in ""You Only Live Twice"") put in a good accent (though again, not as cruel as the first couple of hidden-faced #1/Blofeld characters). Savalas does a fine job, very fine... but it just seems off a tad with the American accent and mannerisms.A change from the formula is that the main henchman is a large woman- Irma Bunt. Otherwise, all the ingredients are here for an action-packed thriller straight from the Bond Formula Machine, just no Connery this time. An enjoyable movie, moreso if you can get over the obsession with Connery. Give it a second 0or even first) chance. It will not disappoint you if you like the Bond movies.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
267,theonewithallthecontacts,"Perhaps, if Lazenby could have stuck around...",9,4 December 2012,"Already by now the series had begun to get very familiar with itself, and James Bond had already been taken tons of places and fought countless of different villains. The first two Bond films were very realistic and ""spy-ish"", while the last three was quite over the top but entertaining none the less! On Her Majesty's Secret Service took the Bons series where we had never seen it before: with another actor than Sean Connery to play James Bond! When filming You Only Live Twice Conney had stated that he wouldn't return to play James Bond. Already then the search for a new began. Hundreds of actors were considered but George Lazenby eventually got the part, to much negative comments from the public. The movie itself proved to be awesome, though!Peter Hunt, the skillful editor of the previous Bond films, were brought in to direct. Peter Hunt directed On Her Majesty's Secret Service with finesse and endless dedication! It's a shame that he was never truly acknowledged with his work on this movie. The movie was realistic as the first two, and still it stood out from any other in the series. It was kind of a love story... more or less! Still, it contained tons of the action, humor, ski chases and the same stylish feel that we've come to expect from a Bond movie! The movie begins with Bond hot on the trail of Blofeld. But on his search he encounters Tracy di Vincenzo, the daughter of a certain Marc Ange Draco! After developing a relationship with Tracy, Draco is able to give Bond information about Blofeld's whereabouts. Bond's search leads him to Switzerland, where he encounters a devastating plot that could eventually extinguish every living specimen on Earth! The plot is very well told and expertly handled by Peter Hunt. The plot is arguable a little boring in the first half of the movie, but that is more than made up top in the second half! The movie then explodes into a big proportion of plotting, action, humor and romantics with a satisfying ending that you'll never see coming! George Lazenby appears in his first and only outing as James Bond! He's certainly not as good as Connery, but he has the same style and presence in the action scenes. He's got no prior acting experience, so with that considered he does a remarkable job! A shame he left the Bond universe when he did. I think, that had he stayed he could had possibly become one of the most beloved and best of all the Bond actors. But done is done, and Lazenby were quickly forgotten. At least he was part of a good Bond movie. Diana Rigg is Tracy di Vincenzo and she's awesome! She's beautiful, a good actress and she has wonderful chemistry with Lazenby! Her character is given much depth, and you'll easily care for and like her! My second favorite Bond girl, right after Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana Romanova! Telly Savalas plays Blofeld this time, our main villain. Savalas delivers a cool, realistic and laid back performance as Blofeld, but as the first actor since Donald Pleasence to approach the role... I think of him as kind of a let down. Savalas is a fantastic actor and I like him as Blofeld, but Pleasence as Blofeld was the definitive one... in my humble opinion. Ilse Steppat is our nasty ""henchwoman"" Irma Bunt! Steppat is good actress and I like the character, as I think of her as the female version of Savalas' Blofeld! She's given a satisfying amount of screen time, and she is so nasty that she is in fact very memorable! A good throwback to the fantastic Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb! Gabriele Ferzetti is a brilliant supporting character in this movie as Marc Ange Draco! Can't give him much more credit than that! We have return appearances by Desmond Llewelyn, Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell, and they're all awesome!On Her Majesty's Secret Service is one of the boldest Bond movies ever! It tried something completely new and refreshing, and it all paid off in a very much worthy entry in the Bond series! Some things in this movie is kinda' lame and a bit boring, but when it ensues it doesn't last long! The movie has picked itself up by then! I always think of On Her Majesty's Secret Service as one of the most complex and satisfying Bond entries to date! It had the romance brilliantly carried to life by Lazenby and Rigg, the first ever ski action chases which are expertly more superior than all the new sequences in the newer Bond movies, the same Bond humor that we like, the stylish feel, the great character development, the realistic script and one of the best, satisfying and most emotional conclusions to a Bond movie that we had never seen before! All in all, On Her Majesty's Secret Service stands as one of the best Bond movies to date, and a wonderful movie by itself! This movie was On Her Majesty's Secret Service.. and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!9/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The villain intends to sterilize the world if his demands are not met. Lazenby, in his only appearance as the super spy, is acceptable, but film itself is superbly paced, yet not fast-paced. At times it even achieves a kind of poetic, melancholy quality, which is unique for a Bond movie. Superb, colorful sets by Peter Lamont; it's too bad only one film of this series was made in the late 1960s. Fine score by John Barry, Louis Armstrong's 'We Have All the Time in the World' is especially lovely. While all action scenes are good, the final sequence is particularly stunning. Film is remarkably well edited by John Glen, who directed five Bond films himself in the 1980s.

271,straker-1,The best Bond. The best Bond girl. The best Bond movie. Full stop.,10,2 January 2007,"Ever since it was released, On Her Majesty's Secret Service has been tarred with the brush of 'flop'. It's an awful movie, people would say. George Lazenby can't act, and thank God Sean Connnery came back to save the franchise's bacon in the next film. Not one to follow the herd, I decided to see OHMSS many years ago and find out what apparently made it such a terrible motion picture. I was rather surprised to discover that far from being the worst 007 movie, it was in fact the best one of the entire series....and that most of the people who bag it clearly have not actually SEEN it.As a Bond movie guide once put it, OHMSS is probably TOO good to be a Bond film. Rather than copy the cartoon antics of You Only Live Twice, Service plays it straight, keeping strictly to the Fleming novel and avoiding the tedious reliance on gadgets and supervillains with super weapons that turned Connery's last two films and most of Moore's efforts into farces. Likewise, George Lazenby's superb 007 is stripped down to the basics - a physical man handy with his fists, but also an intelligent and sensitive human being. It is very hard to see Connery's Bond handling the romance angle of OHMSS with the ease that Lazenby's does. Bond #2 has been called 'The Human Bond', and thankfully these days this is no longer meant as a back-handed insult. Diana Rigg as Tracy, the 'Bond girl', is a revelation. She's highly intelligent, independent, falls in love with Bond in a realistic manner and doesn't put up with his casual sexism for a second. Add to this Rigg's aristocratic beauty, and you have a Bond girl unsurpassed in the film series (though Michelle Yeoh in TND comes close). Likewise, Telly Savalas provides the definitive portrayal of series ubervillain Ernst Blofeld. Here in OHMSS, his plan is wholly plausible, a factor absent in the ones hatched in the movies immediately before and after it, and is in fact far more frightening and malevolent than nicking spaceships or zapping cities with a death ray. Savalas plays Blofeld with a cold, insouciant menace - like all good actors, he knows that to be a truly successful baddie you don't scream and rave.Is Lazenby a good actor in OHMSS? Well, it would be wrong to say he was brilliant in this field, but for his very first acting effort it is nothing short of amazing - and the bitter irony is that had he done Diamonds Are Forever (as he was asked to...he wasn't fired, but in fact quit owing to some hideously bad advice from his agent), his acting style and his version of Bond would have matured and gained a following. As it is, Lazenby's sole outing as Bond merely holds open prospects that were never realised. Can he act? Of course he can, and well.Lengthy but never boring, gritty, wryly humorous, genuinely romantic, true to the source novel and possessing the two best tunes in Bond theme history (the title piece and Louis Armstrong's beautiful swansong We Have All The Time In The World), this is a *damn* good film. In cold terms of production values, calibre of acting and scripting and sheer general panache this is in no way a 'bad' film. It is certainly far superior to the two cheery disasters that followed, and Lazenby is lightyears ahead of the supposedly 'better' Bonds that Moore and Dalton incarnated. A complete masterpiece on all levels. Best Bond film ever. Best Bond girl. Best Bond. Lazenby rules! :)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

274,wmennisny-617-254276,"Great Performances, Improbable Script",6,28 November 2015,"First the good news: George is a GREAT ""James Bond"". He embodies all the masculinity and swagger without obnoxious overtones that make his version of Bond, possibly, the best of all who have played him. His age is much more appropriate to the character than either Connery or Moore to be sure. He looks GREAT wearing a tuxedo as well as a ski suit. He also did a great job as the erudite English scholar sent to investigate Blofeld's pedigree. Diana Rigg is also very good in her role as ""Mrs. Bond"". The problem with the film is really in the script. After establishing the beginnings of a rapport between Bond and his girl, he leaves her for half the film while he travels to Switzerland in search of Blofeld. A series of adventures ensue that, in typical Bond fashion, provide a lot of chasing but are based on many improbable scenarios. One must also ask how or why James Bond would marry the scion of a crime syndicate. On many levels the film is entertaining and it's an admirable entry into the genre but it drags a bit too long in the center and finishes very abruptly. It started out with my thinking I would love it and I ended up only liking it. I do wish that George had played Bond longer, however - he's great on the screen for sure.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Clearly the worst James Bond movie (I've seen almost all of them). Worst actor, worst women, worst director! Savalas does a good job as Ernest Stavro(!) Blofeld. It's funny how he persuaded the producers to give Blofeld a Greek middle name! Perhaps the one Bond film where Bond is not the star. Only to watch for historical reasons! A pathetic 6/10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
276,mcfische,The best 007 film I've seen; 10 out of 10,8,12 August 2003,"May Contain Spoilers""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was the first time that a new actor besides Sean Connery portrayed the secret agent 007. The film in it's initial box-office release was the second-lowest grossing Bond film at it's time, although it was not a box-office faliure, and now is regarded by many as one of the best Bond films. I personally feel it is THE best Bond I have ever seen, even better then ""Die Another Day.""This film has a different look to it than any other Bond film, and unlike ""Thunderball"" the difference in the production cast and crew doesn't isolate the film; it enhances it. The film has a very classic, lavish, ""40s"" look to it. I think even then that style was old-fashioned, but it works very well. Director Peter Hunt made a good choice to have this film remain very close to the original Ian Fleming novel because, although I never read the book, I can tell that the decision resulted in a great story. The film focuses less on gadgets on action and instead strives on story and character. There IS plenty of action in the film, but that's not what the film is about. It's about the story. The story has action, it has a little of 007's style of humor, it has sadness, and for once, real romance. The ""world domination"" plot had only once been used before in a 007 film; ""You Only Live Twice."" Now the villain, who for the second time is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, desires a title and a full pardon. If he does not get his way; the world economy will be destroyed through the destruction of all forms of crops with bacterialogical warfare.The new James Bond, George Lazenby, obviously had a lot of pressure. He wasn't an actor, he was not prepared to be a star of a major film, and he had to live up to the very high standards of Sean Connery. He does it perfectly. I don't think Sean Connery could've played James Bond in the way George does. His James Bond is humorous (the typical 007 wit), he can be deadly (almost drowning a thug, killing two guards, disobeying orders) he can be frightened (scene before the car chace and after the ski chase) and for the first time, truly compassionate (truly falls in love and marries a woman). The new Bond girl, Tracy de Vicenzo, is played wonderfully by Dianna Rigg. After two films since ""Goldfinger"" with pathetic women who can't compare with Pussy Galore, Tracy surpasses her as a woman equal to Bond. She can fight like Pussy, and she also resists Bond's advances initially. However, she is not won over with a single kiss. Bond has to make love to her over a large period of time. She isn't the first to come to Bond's rescue, but she doesn't blow their cover. She's an even more reckless driver than 007, and can drive like that without wreacking the car. Blofeld has changed with the new actor. In additon to his plastic surgery, he now does more of his work himself, and is no longer the completely calm, Eastern-european accent talking villain of earlier. He is more witty and charming. It is established that two years have passed from ""You Only Live Twice"" to OHMSS, and the characters M and Monneypenny show age. Q seems to have aged a lot better. The rest of the cast does a fantastic job.The typical Bond plot has alterations here. Bond does not simply meet two or three women and get them to love him. He actually makes love to a single woman. The woman working for the villain here is not pretty. Irma Bunt is an old lady, but she's a tough one. A lot of the gadgetry is gone in this film, with the exception of a device for opening a safe. Bond goes undercover in this film as a nerdy baronet from the Collage of Arms in London (incidentally, Bond finds his own family crest there, with the motto ""The World Is Not Enough."") And the grand finale, Bond is married at the end of the film. However, the film ends on a tragic note when Blofeld murders Bond's new bride. It is this tragedy that will help audiences understand the cold dark exterior of MI6's 007. The effects of Tracy's death are not seen enough in Roger Moore's films, but Timothy Dalton (although I've never seen him as Bond yet) sounds like the way Bond would act after something like this.I have only two minor complaints in this film. I thought Telly Savalas did a great Job as Blofeld, but he just doesn't compare to Donald Pleasance. I liked the song ""We Have All The Time In The World"" but they could've had a better singer.The two complaints I have do not ruin the film. The ultimate Bond masterpiece; the best I've seen.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
277,OHHLA,The Bond film you +don't+ know (and probably should),8,1 December 1999,"Much ado has been made about the fact that George Lazenby was an inexperienced actor; as unready for a major motion picture as he was for James Bond.  This may be true, but it doesn't show in his portrayal of the role.  His brief stint probably has more to do with a fickle post-Connery audience and a personal feud with Broccoli than any actual shortcomings on his part.  Lazenby handles all the classical Bond elements well: the suave way with women, the witty quips, and the amazing ability to avoid the most tenacious flurry of bullets.More to the point, this is perhaps the most personal and less ""tech happy"" of all the Bond films.  It's really a shame many Bond fans never have and never will see this classic film.  Bond is not just the legendary British agent with a taste for fine champagne and fine girls - he is a committed man who will do anything to save the woman he loves and wants to marry. Ironically and perhaps fittingly, this is the one Bond movie where 007 doesn't really get what he wants.  He saves the world, but at a very high cost to himself.Incidentally, the funniest moments occur during the bobsled shute chase; wherein Bond dispatches one foe to a tree and remarks, ""He's branched off,"" and moments later when he flips off the path and a friendly St. Bernard comes to his rescue.  ""Never mind that,"" says Lazenby/Bond when the pooch gives him a lick, ""go and get the brandy!""True James Bond. :)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

279,Induswa,Very good Bond film,8,12 May 2019,I had never seen this movie before today figuring Lazenby was going to be bad in it.He is not great at the beginning of the film but as the movie develops I found myself warming up to him and by the end I really liked him.He's good with the ladies and excellent in the action scenes. And the action is well done.The pace moves right along all the way through. The last third really had me hooked.It's a much different sort of Bond film. Lazenby has a good down to earth quality to him that plays well. He's not nearly as sophisticated as Connery but that's what I liked about him.I think the movie is well directed. Diana Rigg is good. Kojak makes a decent villain but in the end Lazenby carries the picture.It's too bad he didn't get a second chance to play Bond. That was his choice which he said he later regretted.,On Her Majesty's Secret Service
280,ztruk2001,The most mature and exciting Bond film,8,18 March 2005,"I've always liked the James Bond films. The formula, which is loosely modeled after Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest seems to never wear its welcome. Even today with the latest installment of one of cinema's longest running franchises, there's still fun to be had in watching the British Secret Agent with his license to kill foil the plans of a black hat menace with eyes set upon world domination, while still finding time to bed down the most beautiful creatures under the stars, drive the best cars, and toy with the coolest gadgets. Yeah what's not to like about the Bond films? That said however many of the Bond films don't really work outside the franchise as stand alone movies. Entertaining sure, but not really a quality product on their own. Goldfinger and From Russia With Love are generally considered the two best movies of the series. Sean Connery in the staring role is to many the only true Bond. However there are a few Bond cultists out there, who'll make the argument for On Her Majesty's Secret Service as being the best 007 film. I'll join that small group. For the sixth Bond film unknown actor and Australian model George Lazenby stepped into Connery's shoes. It's the only Bond film he would be in and as an actor he might be the least talented of all the Bonds, but in regards to the film itself, Lazenby plays Bond very well. Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas play the supporting roles. Rigg as the love interest and Savalas as Bond's arch nemesis Blofeld. The story of this Bond film is relatively simple when contrasted to the others. Bond has been hot on the trail of Blofeld for several years and to no success and he's thinking about retiring. However he meets Rigg and must abandon the British Secret Service and work for a rival crime syndicate in order to penetrate his way into the secret fortress of Blofeld and SPECTRE nestled away atop the Swiss alps near a skiing resort town. What sets this film apart from every other Bond film, besides Lazenby, is the maturity of it. We still get the suave, womanizing, gambling, and charming Bond, but with a hint of vulnerability and seriousness lacking in the other films. It's a very well paced and consistent film. We get the sense that none of it is filler. Every moment either serves to push the film along story wise, provide great action, or to supplement the realistic romance between Lazenby and Rigg. As a stand alone film it would work extremely well, but within the context of being a Bond film, I'd stake the claim in describing it as great. It's the one time we can actually view Bond as a human being, who is really capable of falling in love or losing a battle. There is little double-cross and few gadgets that trademark the series but it contains just enough of the quintessential Bond flick to please both Bond enthusiasts and those just wanting a darn good action film. The romance is believable and tender. Much could be said of the chemistry between the two leads. This is not a whirlwind fling, as is in most other Bond flicks with the mandatory female. In the other movies the girl is simply part of the formula. In On Her Majesty's Secret Service the girl is an essential part of developing Lazenby's version of the Bond character. By having Lazenby meet up with Rigg even before the title sequence and staying with her through the picture until the final tragic and mature ending, the writers have done a great thing. On Her Majesty's Secret Service also has some of the best action sequences of the Bond films, and like everything else in the movie it's semi-grounded in reality. The escape from Blofeld's trap on the skiing cables is brilliantly staged and followed by a remarkably well edited and choreographed chase down the mountain ski slopes. The speeding bobsleds, the two-fisted hand to hand battles, the bell shed and the helicopter attack, are handled with great care and believability. Telly Savalas is the least cartoonish of all the Bond villain portrayals. The most human. All in all On Her Majesty's Secret Service is one helluva of a ride and a solid film. Goldfinger is the most celebrated of the Bond movies, but the one and only time Lazenby stepped into the character's shoes shows the most mature Bond film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The script is well written and paced and offers new surprises for a new Bond thrill-ride adventure! Also, I plaud the decision to use make a Bond movie without the use of gadgets and tricks up Bond's sleeve. Like the Sean Connery Bond movies, the excitement is just as enlightening and satisfactory without with these elements. Prior excitement of gadgets like the Aston Martin DB5 was satisfying and enjoyable, but future Bond movies starring Roger Moore relied heavily on gadgets and fans grew tiresome of this. While the performances and casting is noteworthy - as is the well written story - the biggest let down of On Her Majesty's Secret Service is poorly edited action scenes. The movie opens with Bond rescuing main character Tracy from an attempted suicide on the beach, in which Bond decisively rescues her only to be followed by a brief intrusion of two opponents - followed by a weakly edited fight scene, which looked fake and unalarming. Other additional fight scenes in which Bond encounters Draco for the first time and another before Bond escapes Blofeld's fortress in the Swiss Alps, are lazily edited and not great.All criticism aside, On Her Majesty's Secret Sevice is nothing short of amazing and delivers non-stop thrills, spectacular drama and a joyful ski chase.

George Lazenby does exceptionally well- no actor can expect to fill the shoes of the previous, but what can you do? He is great. Better than Moore? YES! Better than Dalton and Brosnan? Easily! He's his own Bond in a very good film. It's also the saddest of the Bond movies. With wonderful choreographs, scenary (the alps) beautiful women including Diana Rigg, a creepy Blofeld, and the music.... just the music alone really kickstarts this film. Listening to Louis Armstrong and the Christmas song almost bring tears. True to the book by Ian Fleming for the most part, this represents a last in the Bond movie series- staying faithful to Fleming, and to trying to advance and further the Bond story without parodying itself and making a mockery by living in its own legend.

I won't give it away here, but he actually utters the phrase ""He had a lot of guts"".But you know what? All told, this was a pretty good Bond movie...and George Lazenby turned in a solid performance. Which begs the question: Where is George Lazenby? Well, according to his credits he did the voice over the a Japanese Anime cartoon a couple of years back. And what do you think Roger Moore is doing right now? Probably doing coke off of some stripper's chest and sitting on a fat bank account courtesy of those James Bond DVD royalties. Talk about injustice.So that bit of semi-comedy aside, I would recommend this one.

Lazenby is perhaps less effective than some of the other big-screen Bonds, but he brings a more understated humour to the role than Moore did, while remaining true to Connery's slightly ruthless hero.

287,LennyRenquist,Lay off The Laze!,10,7 September 2003,"Connery was excellent as Bond. There's no way anyone, not even the most staunch Fleminghead, can dispute that. He was cool. Very cool. Hairy as a yeti, but very cool.The Laze was cool, too. Just a different KIND of cool. He had that 'X' quality. That LAZE quality. He was every bit as good a Bond as Connery. Just not as good an actor.But then, Rodge studied at RADA. And he was CRAP.The Laze was the first Bond-as-action-hero. Being an athlete, and a practitioner of judo, rather than a bodybuilder (Connery), a lummox (Rodge) or a weed (Little Timmy Dalton), he convinced in the action scenes. He was nimble, smooth with the ladies, and looked way cooler in a kilt than Connery, an ACTUAL SCOTSMAN, ever would.As for the movie itself, yes, it IS the most book-faithful of the series, and that's because it doesn't NEED jazzing up. You've got your maniacal supervillain (Telly Savalas' Blofeld easily surpasses Donald Pleasance's lame-o effort) hiding out in an alpine fortress masquerading as an allergy clinic, in order to hypnotise a group of clueless babes into waging biological warfare on the world; Bond finding him with the help of a Union Corse boss, in exchange for the promise of marrying his troubled, stubborn, not to mention stunningly sexy, daughter (Diana Rigg, in fine form), who he realises he really does love and wants to marry anyway; then posing as an effeminate genealogist to gain entry to said fortress, and having to solve the serious pickle of how to bed all the hotties while pretending not to like girls, and simultaneously kind of being in love with someone else. Add to that a ripping night-time ski pursuit, car chases aplenty, the best Aston Martin of the series (a COMPLETELY GADGETLESS DBS), bullfighting, a wonderfully gaudy casino, radioactive homing lint, curling, a homicidal lesbian and an adorable St. Bernard...This movie has EVERYTHING!The dawn raid on Blofeld's stronghold is nothing short of FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC. It's far better than the ninjas-on-ropes bit from You Only Live Twice, the underwater shambles from Thunderball, or any other ""...and they all storm the place..."" scene you care to name.I can't say this is the BEST movie in the series, because that's a matter of taste. I'll just say this. I like all the Bond actors in their own way, and the same goes for the movies (even those horrific Moore ones from the mid-80's). OHMSS is my FAVOURITE. It has all the classic plot elements (tied around a unique story), all the gloss, all the glamour, all in ONE MOVIE. Not to mention super-tight editing, pretty scenery, two (count 'em: TWO) Avengers, and that St. Bernard, who really WAS adorable.If only The Laze had done Diamonds are Forever, he obviously wouldn't have gained the stigma of being the ""one-off"". Also, Connery wouldn't have embarrassed himself, and the movie might have actually been GOOD (Well, better than it was).The Laze did a FINE job. So LAY OFF!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
288,milstar,Bond goes down,3,24 February 2013,"Worst movie in Bond franchise. I can't get why people love it so much. Maybe because someone described,unusually human and love story and the fact that Bond is playing by someone anonymous rather than Sean Connery. I strongly believe in mythology and tradition and when I saw it for the first time(I was 15)I shooked my head in disbelief. From the moment he (Bond; Lazenby)introduced himself to Tracy I knew this is not gonna be any good. Lazenby looks dumb and talks numb, it is apparent lack of his acting skills. action sequence look unreal. On lower level than all previous Bond movies. Telly Savalas as Blofeld is very good, but he portrayed his character on lighter tone, opposing to sinister previously done by Donald Pleasance. Much of the film is boring, you'll need to wait an hour to see action. Romance also ruined the film and it's epilogue is sad. This is the only one Bond without happy ending. Many folks say that Connery couldn't pull ""we have all the time in world"", I wouldn't agree. No gadgets, movie is too long(almost 2 and half hours). In overall, this is not ""typical"" JB. Different actor, romance, no gadgets, different style of making, lenght and sad ending. Not like Goldfinger, whose first four words are foreshadowing its value and remain to be the best Bond ever.

290,namideo,"Not necessarily underrated, but certainly overlooked.",9,31 December 2008,"Being the 007 fanatic that I am, I see it as not only a pleasure, but a responsibility to take a moment and critique such a film as a criminally overlooked as this one. I'd be surprised if some of you have even heard of this film, let alone seen it. You're not likely to see it on store shelves or playing on television. Why? That's what I'd like to know. It got good reviews. It earned six times it's budget at the box office, and was more successful than the majority of the Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan films. There are few movies that are as critically acclaimed, by critics and fans, yet as socially outcast as this one.First thing's first. Is it great? Well, I'll leave that up to you, in the end. Although, before I get into details, let's travel back in time real quick to 1968. Sean Connery retires from the role of the world's greatest secret agent, and the film industry's most financially lucrative hero of all time. After 40-something years and six different actors all together, people tend to forget the impact Sean Connery's leaving the role had at the time. It'd be like Harrison Ford not playing Indiana Jones. Or trying to imagine somebody other than Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. Who can do Dirty Harry other than Clint Eastwood? You know? It just didn't compute with audiences at the time, and filling the shoes with an unknown model who's only film credits included a chocolate commercial certainly didn't appease many people. And with the 70s on the horizon, and the tuxedo clad Brit facing competition from long haired, American hippie idols, like Robert Redford and Peter Fonda, expectations for the new Bond were low.All things considered, OHMSS, with the exception of its star, features perhaps one of the most qualified casts in the series' history (actors ranging from Shakespeare to Fedrico Fellini) a script that bares the most resemblance to Ian Fleming's original literary works, and the most high octane action sequences encountered in a Bond film, or any film, at the time. In short, it was pretty much the full package.The story follows a more conflicted 007...his arch nemesis is on the loose, he wants to retire from his job, and he actually thinks he might be loosing his heart to a lady for the first time in his life. While developing a serious romance with the daughter of an international crime boss, Bond quickly finds himself once again on the trail of his arch rival who escaped in the previous film, which takes him to a suspicious research facility, secluded in the Swiss Alps, during the Christmas season of all times. Bond has to put his holiday plans on hold to uncover the mystery, which threatens the safety of every living thing on earth. We get locations, plot twists, the series' first ski chase, an explosive finale, and Bond popping the big question to his adventurous girlfriend. If nothing else, it's a Bond story like none other.Regarding George Lazenby as 007. While perhaps not the best Bond in the franchise's history, you'd have to have some ridiculously high expectations to give him too much flak. I would say Lazenby is the most limited actor to play the role. Probably because he wasn't an actor. He was a self-made businessman, an internationally successful model, and an ex-Australian Special Forces officer. Basically, he did everything other than acting. He was an obscure choice for sure, and aside from being in the right place at the right time, he was able to sway the producers with his charisma, height, brutality, and perhaps most importantly, the arrogance to think he could hack it, no prob. And I mean that without sarcasm. I don't think it was intentional to give the largest slice of character development James Bond had ever been given to the least experience actor available, but all things considered, Lazenby actually makes it work and brings the character down to a much more human scale than Connery ever did or would have done. He's not a superman by any means. Despite being able to pack a hard punch (being the only actor to have hospitalized his own fight scene choreographer) we see a more vulnerable Bond in this one, which is one of the reasons I decided to write this review in the first place, seeing as this is the new popular trend for this hero, as seen with the new Daniel Craig films. Not so popular in the late 60s though, at least, not for Bond. But again, we see things we didn't see in the Connery movies. We see Bond improvise more in hazardous situations, we see him frustrated, uncertain, even scared at one point. Even passionate. His love interest isn't another loveless conquest. He actually gives a damn about this woman. Nor is she (Tracy is her name, played by Diana Rigg) completely helpless like countless other ""Bondgirls."" He comes to depend on her quite a bit to get him out of tight spots, particularly in the movie's key car chase, in which she does the driving, not Bond. TOUCHE! My personal opinion? I love this movie. It easily ranks in my top 5 favorite Bond films. Likewise, I have yet to show this film to a single person who didn't end up liking it. Some of the Bond films that are often criticized for being weak or the worst in the series are usually hindered by campy humor, unbelievable story ideas and special effects, or ideas that came off as cliché and formulaic. If there is one thing that's safe to say it's that you won't find any of that in this film. It distinguishes itself for being out of the ordinary and daring in it's approach.

It's not necessarily my favorite Bond film, as I like different ones on different levels and for different reasons.I don't know that this is the *most* under-rated Bond film, but it is certainly under-rated. It seems that the dislike a lot of people feel for Lazenby in the role blinds them to the movie's other virtues.Like another reviewer noted, it's a bit more down to Earth and realistic (or less *un*realistic) than many of the other science-fictiony, comic-bookish Bond pictures. It's comparable in some ways to 1981's _For Your Eyes Only_.I think I read somewhere that the big, climactic helicopter raid on Blofeld's mountaintop fortress was at least partly inspired by an actual incident during WWII: a glider raid led personally by Hitler's favorite commando, the monocle-wearing, duelling-scar-faced Otto Skorzeny, on a mountaintop castle/prison in northern Italy, to bust Mussolini out of jail there. Even if that's not true, the helicopter raid is very thrilling.I guess I bought this movie mainly because I still have a crush on Diana Rigg. She's not necessarily the best Bond Girl of all time (although she *is* the only one I know of that Bond married), but she's pretty good. I like the part where she goes after Blofeld with a broken bottle. Even though she's playing a very different character here, I thought I saw a little of her Emma Peel come out for a second there.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
294,Orpington,"Not perfect, but a realistic, classic Bond",7,17 August 2004,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service will probably always remain the most controversial entry in the Bond series, thanks both to its unusually human and romantic story, and the notorious casting of novice actor George Lazenby as OO7. Some think these elements ruin the film, while others hail OHMSS as the best Bond ever. I wouldn't go that far in my praise, but for me this is still one of the classic Bond films, true to Ian Fleming's original vision and arguably showing OO7 in a more realistic light than any other film in the franchise.To get the Lazenby issue out of the way first, it is certainly true to say that he lacks the charisma of the man he (temporarily) replaced, Sean Connery, and his impossibly chiselled jaw is somewhat irritating. However, he does look the part, and for a first-time actor he turns in a remarkably assured performance, particularly in the fight scenes but also in Bond's more tender moments, most notably in the highly emotional finale. If Lazenby had gone on to make more Bond films (and it was his own decision not to do so) he could well have developed into a very fine OO7, but as it is I still find his performance in OHMSS perfectly acceptable, and not damaging to the film in any way.The film itself represented a conscious attempt to get back to Fleming after the increasingly extravagant antics of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice. Director Peter Hunt, who had edited the classic early Connery films, was very keen to remain faithful to Fleming's original story, and as a result OHMSS has an unusually strong emphasis on character and plot, with the gadgetry and humour found in most Bond films largely jettisoned. Rather like From Russia with Love, OHMSS feels like a real spy adventure, as Bond tracks Blofeld down and even adopts a disguise as he infiltrates his arch-enemy's Alpine hideaway, Piz Gloria. Where this film is unique, however, is in the level of emotion it invests in OO7's relationships with others. We see this early in the film when Bond quarrels with M and submits his resignation, a sequence which really brings out the affection which both M and Moneypenny have for him, but which M especially prefers to keep concealed. This affection is brought out again near the end during Bond and Tracy's wedding, when Q sheds his normal exasperation and shows us his fondness and respect for OO7.However, it is of course the relationship between Bond and Tracy which gives the film its emotional heart. OHMSS sees Bond fall genuinely in love for the first and only time, and personally I found the film's romantic scenes both tender and touching, particularly for being so unexpected in a Bond film. The casting of Diana Rigg as Tracy helps immeasurably in making us believe in this romance, as she is a rare example of a proper actress taking on the role of a Bond girl, and her dynamic, spirited performance makes it easy to see why Bond would fall for her and marry her. It also helps the film's tragic conclusion, itself unique in the Bond franchise, pack far more of an emotional punch than might otherwise have been the case.Of course, the film has more going for it than just an unusually human Bond.Hunt directs with great skill, and the Alpine scenery that dominates the film looks absolutely stunning. There is no shortage of great action either, the highlights being a tense and gripping ski chase and an equally thrilling bobsleigh pursuit. Telly Savalas makes for a very effective Blofeld, understated and sinister, and his Rosa Klebb-like henchwoman Irma Bunt is played with relish by Ilse Steppat. There are also echoes of FRWL in the character of Draco, Tracy's father, who is a charismatic Bond ally in the style of Kerim Bey. Special mention should be given to John Barry, who produced his greatest Bond soundtrack for OHMSS. The opening instrumental theme, with its sombre and foreboding tone, sets the serious mood of the film, while the classic We Have All the Time in the World, sung by Louis Armstrong, is the perfect soundtrack to Bond and Tracy's doomed love.However, while OHMSS is undoubtedly a classic Bond film, it just falls short of my personal top five for two principal reasons. The first of these is that the film is too long, primarily because the central section, where Bond infiltrates Piz Gloria in disguise, is dragged out for far longer than was necessary. Blofeld's plan to use beautiful women as carriers of a devastating eco-virus is the other main weakness, because it is totally preposterous and does not fit into the film's serious nature. I must admit also that, good as Lazenby is, I do wish Connery had agreed to make this film, because with him on board, and a little more editing, I think it could have been the best Bond ever, even beating FRWL. As it is, OHMSS is still a very strong film, its bold deviations from the Bond formula paying off handsomely. It is just a crying shame that it did not perform better at the Box Office, because this would encourage the Bond producers to shift to the high-camp, comic style that would dominate the franchise during the 1970s; sadly, it would be more than a decade before a serious, Flemingesque Bond would reappear on the big screen.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
295,I.K,The most grossly underrated Bond movie.,10,6 November 1999,"I find it unbelievable that OHMSS is so underrated as it is. When one thinks how crappy films Moore made, like for example ""The Moonraker"" or ""A view to a kill"", it is bad taste to claim that OHMSS is among the worst Bonds ever. The movie marked the end of the era of the more realistic and serious Bond films. The movie is a real gem, it has far more style than the movies which came after it. It also follows Fleming´s original story unlike the rest. In short, Lazenby did a good job as Bond when one thinks this was his first film ever. Rigg, who had more experience in acting does equally some fine acting as the one and only Mrs. Bond. Savalas clearly enjoys his role as Blofeld and has far more criminal and sinister look than Pleasance had. The plot is among the best and the scenery is fantastic. The film also has the premier ski chase scenes which offer some great action. The movie is a bit too long but if you really enjoy the Bond movies you dont notice it. I give the movie 9 out of 10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
296,josephkinion,James Bond must stop Blofeld from killing millions of people with a deadly nerve gas,10,29 October 2016,"James Bond driving his Aston Martin DBS on a Portuguese coastal highway. Suddenly, a woman in a red Mercury Cougar convertible roars up behind him and overtakes him. Soon, he comes across the same car parked along the side of the road. Using a telescopic rifle sight, Bond spies her walking into the tall waves of the Atlantic Ocean, appearing utterly lost. Realising she is intending suicide, Bond drives down to the shore, runs into the surf and plucks her from the sea. He brings her back to consciousness and introduces himself as ""Bond, James Bond"" (simultaneously revealing his face, in the same manner as Sean Connery was revealed in Dr. No). Two men then surprise the pair and separate them - Bond being led away at gunpoint and the woman at knifepoint. In short order, Bond gains the advantage and defeats them - trapping one under a boat, snaring the other in a fishing net. Meanwhile, the woman takes Bond's car, drives it back up to her car, jumps into the Cougar, and speeds away. Bond comments, ""This never happened to the other fellow"" (the only time the character breaks the fourth wall in the official series, although Connery as Bond does so at the end of the unofficial Bond film, Never Say Never Again), initiating the title credits sequence.
After the title credits, Bond checks into a hotel; in pulling up to the hotel, he spies the mysterious woman's red Cougar parked in front of the hotel. Inquiring about the car's owner, the manager advises him that the car belongs to Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo. Later, Bond encounters her gambling at the casino. She makes a bet she can't back, and when she loses, Bond rescues her by paying it. Tracy invites him to her room to thank him; however, when he arrives at her room, a thug emerges from behind Bond and brawls with him. After defeating him, Bond returns to his room, there finding Tracy awaiting him. After Tracy threatens to kill him for a thrill, Bond disarms Tracy and questions her about the thug in her room. Tracy disavows any knowledge of the thug; an unconvinced Bond slaps her across the face. Bond suggests that the presence of those men indicates she may be in trouble; Tracy has nothing to say, but seduces Bond in payment of the casino rescue.
In the morning, she is gone (leaving full payment for her casino loss and a red carnation); she has checked out of the hotel. Later that morning, as Bond leaves the hotel for a round of golf, he is kidnapped by several men including the thug from Tracy's room and led at gunpoint to an awaiting Rolls-Royce. The men take him to a dockside office building, to the presence of Marc-Ange Draco the head of the Union Corse, one of the biggest European crime syndicates (second in size only to SPECTRE).
Bond recognizes Draco immediately and provides Draco with a fairly complete profile of himself, but Draco reveals one hidden item: Tracy, the woman Bond rescued is his only daughter. Draco describes Tracy as a problem child; he also thinks Bond can resolve her emotional instability. Though Bond believes Tracy needs a psychiatrist, Draco insists that she needs ""a man to dominate her"". Draco asks Bond to marry Tracy; in return, Bond will receive a personal dowry of one million pounds sterling in gold on their wedding day. Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy at Draco's birthday party under the agreement that Draco reveal the whereabouts of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE.
Returning to MI6 headquarters, M informs Bond he's been relieved from Operation Bedlam (tracking and killing Blofeld). Angered by the slight Bond impetuously dictates his resignation to Miss Moneypenny and returns to his desk to clear out his keepsakes. Recalled to M's office, he is briskly informed his request is granted. Leaving M's office, he discovers Moneypenny requested a fortnight's leave instead, knowing Bond didn't really want to resign. Realising he can pursue Blofeld on his time off and not quit MI6, he thanks Moneypenny and heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal.
At the party, Tracy discovers Bond's deal with her father and strong-arms Draco into providing Bond with the information he requested. Draco tells Bond that several of his Union Corse men recently defected to Blofeld, and that the connection is Gebrüder Gumbold, a law firm in Bern, Switzerland. Distraught, Tracy runs away in tears; Bond catches up with her and wipes away the tears from her eyes. From that moment, they begin a whirlwind romance.
Bond and Tracy, who are falling in love, go to Bern with Draco to investigate Gumbold's connection with Blofeld. Searching the lawyer's office, Bond finds Blofeld's correspondence with the London College of Arms: Blofeld is attempting to lay claim to the title 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp' - de Bleuchamp being the French form of the Blofeld surname. His College of Arms correspondent is genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, who confirms Blofeld's pursuit of the title and agrees to co-operate with Bond. The discovery is the solid lead he needs; he visits M at home and is granted permission to chase Blofeld.
Posing as Bray, Bond visits Blofeld, under pretense of verifying the genealogical and physical characteristics of his de Bleuchamp ancestry. Blofeld has established a clinical research institute atop Piz Gloria, an alp in Switzerland. Disguised as the effete, foppish Bray, Bond meets 12 beautiful young women from around the world. They are patients of the institute's clinic, ostensibly undergoing unorthodox psychological and immunological treatments for food allergies and phobias. In fact, the women are unknowingly being brainwashed to distribute, at Blofeld's command, bacteriological warfare agents throughout their parts of the world. They are, in fact, Blofeld's Angels of Death.
James Bond's lasciviousness betrays him to Blofeld henchwoman Irma Bunt, who captures him during a second visit to the bed of one of the ""patients"". Blofeld tells Bond his escapades have revealed his true identity; he also reveals a blunder that the real Hilary Bray would not have made (Bond identified the wrong church as the repository of the de Bleuchamp birth records). Bond escapes imprisonment in the cable-car machinery room of Piz Gloria, viciously subdues a guard, then escapes by skiing down Piz Gloria; Bond is spotted escaping and is chased by Blofeld and his henchmen. He reaches the village of Mürren during its winter festival and there encounters Tracy, who is in Switzerland looking for Bond (having been told his whereabouts by her father). Tracy acquits herself well in helping Bond escape, greatly impressing Bond, and together they flee in her Cougar. They finally escape their SPECTRE pursuers in a frantic car chase ending - for their pursuers - at an ice-track auto race. A blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond declares his love for Tracy and proposes marriage to her; she accepts. Next morning they ski away, but Blofeld has tracked them down. Blofeld creates an avalanche, deliberately sacrificing some of his own men, to shorten his pursuit of the pair; he succeeds in incapacitating Bond and capturing Tracy.
Meanwhile, Blofeld holds the world at ransom with the threat of destroying its agriculture, using his brainwashed patients to release bacteriological agents which target vital types of livestock and food plants. His price is amnesty for all past crimes and recognition of his 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp' title. Despite Bond's pleas, M will not allow Bond to lead an assault on Piz Gloria, as the Prime Minister has deemed such a plan too risky. As Bond realises that without the radio complex at Piz Gloria to signal his patients, Blofeld's plan will fail, Bond contacts Draco to arrange a ""demolition job"" of Piz Gloria. Bond joins Draco and his Union Corse henchmen in a mercenary helicopter assault on Piz Gloria, in hopes of destroying the facility and rescuing Tracy.The raid is successful, and Bond and Blofeld are the last to escape before the institute is detonated by Draco's assault team. The pair engage in a furious bobsled chase down Piz Gloria, with Bond leaping onto Blofeld's bobsled after he destroys Bond's bobsled with a hand grenade. In the fistfight aboard the bobsled, a distracted Blofeld is snared by the neck in low overhanging tree branches, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Bond loses control of the bobsled, which flies out of the run, but Bond survives unscathed and meets a St. Bernard dog.
Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, with Draco's men and M, Q and a tearful Miss Moneypenny present. (During the best man's toast, Bond wipes the tears from Tracy's eyes in exactly the same manner as hehad at Draco's birthday party.) They drive away in the Aston Martin, but the couple stops on the roadside a few kilometres later so he can remove the wedding flower decorations. As Bond and Tracy exchange protestations of love, a black Mercedes sedan driven by Blofeld in a neck brace drives past; Irma Bunt leans out of a rear window with a machine gun and shoots Tracy in the forehead, killing her instantly.Moments later, a motorcycle policeman finds the grieving groom cradling his dead wife; fingering her wedding band, Bond turns and tells him everything was quite alright and that ""We have all the time in the world"". (The phrase was later used as Tracy's epitaph, as seen in the graveyard pre-credits sequence of For Your Eyes Only in which James Bond finally avenges Tracy's murder by killing Blofeld.)",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

That's the only, only problem with the movie. Sure, it's a big one, but there are so many, many reasons to enjoy this despite that flaw. And by ""You Only Live Twice,"" Connery was kind of phoning it in anyway, wasn't he? So you have George Lazenby, who actually isn't as bad as film historians claim. Sure, his lines are at times garbled (no doubt by his accent as much as by the insistence on finishing the film on time.) This movie is a non-stop action ride with many, many thrills. It's moody, it's a true Bond picture. You'll love it. It keeps surprising you, delighting you. You'd never think a stunt sequence can get better and then it does.

It is also the most serious and personal of the series.  The escape/action sequences in this movie are easily the best I've ever seen in a Bond:  they're stunningly directed, far more realistic than usual, and actually fit logically into the greater story of the film.    The screenplay gives us a deeper, more serious Bond than we've seen before (or since):  we see a struggle between the traditional womanizer and the man who has tasted true love for the first time.  I also like the fact that there are fewer goofy one-liners than usual.One element is missing:  a great actor playing James Bond.  George Lazenby is good in fight scenes and action sequences, but his lack of previous acting experience shows up elsewhere.  We can only wish that Connery had stayed on for this movie; then it would have been perfect.

301,mdouglasfresno,Worst Bond Ever? I don't think so...,6,3 February 2007,"Sure, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" does have it's ""ups and downs"". I agree it's far from the best Bond movie ever. But to those posters who claim it's the worst, I would have to wonder just how many Bond films they've really seen. Anyone who can rate garbage like ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" or ""Moonraker"" as BETTER than OHMSS is crazy. Those two pathetic efforts easily take the award for poorest Bond movies ever. I personally rate ""Moonraker"" as absolute rock-bottom because it's more a filmed cartoon than anything else, both in plot and in totally out-of-place slapstick comedy. True, ""Golden Gun"" has the horrid shenanigans of the redneck sheriff; but at least he didn't START OUT as an evil henchman and degenerate into excruciating comic relief the way Jaws did. Just check out the scene of Jaws falling in love with the dumb little German girl, as romantic music swells, if you don't believe me. Or the scene were a pigeon does a double-take at the sight of Bond's gondola hovercraft! At least OHMSS stuck to Bondian witticisms for it's humor (even if Lazenby couldn't deliver them half as well as Connery), rather than showing such lowbrow cornball hokum.In fact, while Roger Moore was a better actor than George Lazenby, he was given precious little to work with during his tenure, and had to endure the worst Bond pics of the series. The Moore films were not only a disgrace to Ian Fleming's novels, but to the earlier Bond movies as well. OHMSS stands up favorably to any of the Moore movies.OHMSS is definitely a ""mixed bag"". Lazenby is not very believable as Bond, but he had the bad timing of taking the role right after five Sean Connery efforts. Heck, who (including Roger Moore) wasn't going to suffer in comparison with Connery? The ads for ""You Only Live Twice"" had it right -- ""Sean Connery IS James Bond 007""...now and forever. As for Lazenby, he was just adequate, nothing more.Diana Rigg is one of the two best Bond girls ever (the other being Honor Blackman of ""Goldfinger""...interesting how both appeared in the fine British TV show ""The Avengers""). However, Angela Scoular as Ruby is probably the worst (with the possible exception of Britt Ekland). She could hardly be considered good-looking (especially next to the other gals up there at Piz Gloria) and that silly French poodle hairdo is sooooo icky! Makes her look like a clown. Why Bond wastes his time and energy on her, when there's so many nice dishes he could sample from, is a mystery. I kept hoping she'd be the obligatory ""sacraficial lamb"" that all the Bond films seem to have, with the chilling Irma Blunt killing her after discovering Bond had bedded her. That would have been a logical move, since Blofeld would have to suspect she was ""compromised"" as an agent by Bond, and such a killing certainly would've fit into the ""sacraficial lamb"" formula of the whole series. Oh, well...The lack of a vocal main theme during the opening credits might have proved a mistake, had John Barry not come up with such a driving and exciting instrumental. This theme stands up with the ""greats"" of the Bond series. On the downside is the utterly out-of-place Louis Armstrong, singing ""We Have All the Time in the World"" used in the montage where Bond and Diana Rigg fall in love. No offense to Satchmo, but to hear him in the middle of a Bond picture is rather jarring. The opening titles aren't bad, even if there is the rather patronizing inclusion of characters from the previous Bond films (sans Connery, of course); great use of the usual naked silhouettes along with icons of the British Empire, such as Britannia w/ Trident and Crown.One scene that tried too hard to tie in Lazenby with the Bond series and DIDN't work was where he's cleaning out his desk and comes across relics of past cases (i.e. past movies). Since Lazenby wasn't in those movies, the scene comes off as ludicrous.Telly Savalas is a weak Bofeld; better to have had Donald Pleasence reprise the role. The plot is over-all merely adequate. The scene were Bond cracks the safe to copy documents, while mundane, is at least more realistic spy work; something one might imagine a real secret agent doing. All in all I'd rate OHMSS as good, but not great, Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

It showed a *real* James Bond, who actually shows fear and love. The settings are awesome. Lazenby is fresh, and cool...and gives a reality to the part where sometimes Sean Connery comes across as 2D (Connery's acting in the later movies a but sub par as he is clearly over the role).OHMSS *definitely* has the best Bond woman, Diana Rigg's Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo - and the relationship between the two is the most endearing and memorable of any of the Bond films. Diana Rigg is arguably the strongest actor to play the role...and gave it more depth than any other. Many say this has the best soundtrack, with involvement of Loius Armstrong, Hal David and the Amazing John Barry.The settings, the snow action scenes, the amazing soundtrack, the two main stars all make this a brilliant James Bond.

303,pbbuffyhugs,Best Bond Film Ever,10,11 January 2006,"Ask any true Bond fan to name their favourite film in the series and chances are it'll be this one. Everything about this film is outstanding. The locations, the story and the music (in my opinion John Barry never topped this) are all top notch. George Lazenby was always going to take some flak for taking over from Sean Connery but some of the things written simply aren't true, he was a good Bond and it's such a shame he only made this one. If Connery had hung around for this one it wouldn't be the classic it is. Lazenbys Bond was less the super human than the previous outings but that was only because the producers decided to make the character more in keeping with Flemings original concept, not Lazenbys fault, and in them doing so have made this the best film in the series. It's also been written that this film was a box office flop, again not true... because of the films running time of over 2 hours 20 minutes it simply meant most cinemas had to drop one showing a day to what was the norm back in 1969, if it was such a failure 'Diamonds Are Forever' wouldn't have got the green light to be made. As it stands because this is Lazenbys only Bond film it makes it unique - definitely not the disaster some people made it out to be. Diana Rigg is one of the series best actresses and Telly Savalas makes a terrific Blofeld, far better than Donald Pleasence or Charles Gray and the story is easily the best and most coherent of all the films. The one downside in an otherwise flawless film is that the characters of Bond and Blofeld fail to recognise each other despite meeting in the previous film, however the writers probably thought that as both roles were played by two different actors the audience would let it pass and to mention it now is merely nit picking at an amazing film that once it gets going never lets up. The ending is by far the best ending of any film in the series and is genuinely moving, you really care about these characters and if it's a shame Lazenby didn't make another then it's equally criminal Peter Hunt never directed another one. Sean Connery may be the best Bond of the 60's but this is easily the best Bond film of the 60's and nothing since has managed to top it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The reasons I say this are the movie stuck very very closely to the original book,Bond depended more on his own skills than gadgets and weaponry to overcome obstacles and opponents and it humanised the character. Lazenby was great as Bond certainly better than most critic's think (and I think most critics are paid to be negative anyway) and it would've been great if he would have played the role a few more times (as by now everyone knows he regrets not doing!)Had he have stayed in the role it would've prolonged the dumbing down of the character as played by Roger Moore in the later 70s & 80s films. Telly Savalas was a great villain and the scenery was excellent. The ending was superb and it would've been great to see Lazenby play Bond in the next film seeking his revenge against Blofeld.

307,col_rutherford,The Most Overlooked Bond Film is Also One of the Best,8,14 June 2003,"""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is the most overlooked Bond movie, perhaps due to its disappointing box office upon its initial release and the fact that its star, George Lazenby, had the unenviable task of replacing Sean Connery and then backed out of the series after only one picture. Many retrospectives give it short thrift and it rarely appears on TV. That said, OHMSS has developed a cult following over the years and is also one of the best films in the series in my opinion, ranking only behind ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia With Love"".Agent OO7 romances a troubled contessa (Diana Rigg) whose father (Gabrielle Frezetti) is a Corsican crime lord with information regarding fugitive SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Salvalas). Bond then goes undercover in Blofeld's hideout, a mountaintop Swiss allergy clinic, and exposes a plot to contaminate the world's food supply.After the outlandish spacejackings and volcanic lairs of 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"", this was a return to the basics for the Bond franchise. OHMSS boasts frenetic but realistic action sequences and tons of suspense, while the hi-tech gadgets and cheesey jokes are kept to a minimum. Lazenby lacks Connery's acting ability and charisma, but he has chiseled good looks, is believable in the action sequences, and manages to play a more human and sensitive OO7 than Connery ever did (as opposed to being invincible, Bond actually looks SCARED when he's cornered by the bad guys!). At the core of the picture is the only genuine love story in the franchise's history. Rigg is a classy and capable ""Bond Girl"" who brings out Bond's tender side. Meanwhile, Salvalas provides a Blofeld who is both mentally AND physically menacing, unlike ""You Only Live Twice's"" diminutive Donald Pleasence (the inspiration for ""Austin Powers'"" Dr. Evil) and ""Diamonds Are Forever's"" strangely effiminate Charles Gray.Most people already know how OHMSS' ending is a classic piece of Bond lore. For those who don't, let's just say it's unique in the series and represents the last time the franchise had any creative spark before descending into decades of self-homage at best and self-parody at worst. In the 34 years since OHMSS' release 13 more Bond films have been released, but none of them have mattered.8 out of 10.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
308,tapswedar,A Classic,9,30 June 2008,"This is the most underrated Bond Movie of the whole series. Lazenby was the man to take over for Connery and its a shame that they wasted so many movies on Roger Moore. If you like casino Royal with Daniel Craig then you should love this one because they are both dark and stripped down unlike the glammed up Moore, Dalton, and brosnan ones. If this one is not above or on par with the Connery movies then why is it the most difficult to get a hold of. It the first bond to really focus on story line more then action sequences. Not to mention it was the only bond to end without bond winning. If you are a bond fan this is an absolute must see.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
309,kidcrowbar,Better Lazenby than Moore,7,29 April 2002,"While not the best Bond movie by any means, OHMSS would be the last decent one for many years. The Bond franchise had already started to slip with the silly You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever would be worse. Then there was the seemingly endless supply of bad Roger Moore movies. While Moore would eventually make a couple of good Bond movies (though the only one that comes to mind right now is View To a Kill) none of them come close to OHMSS and Lazenby makes a much better Bond.The movie does have flaws. It's badly paced and Telly Savalas is a comic book version of Blofeld.  For all that, it's watchable and even quite entertaining in places which is more than can be said for Live and Let Die or Man With A Golden Gun.So yeah, after the first four classic Bond movies, OHMSS was probably the best one until Dalton took over the role.

311,Enforcer686,Criminally underrated classic Bond,9,4 December 2010,"Having been a huge Bond fan since I was a mere lad in the early '80s, I still don't know why I just recently saw this film for the first time in 2010. I suppose I must blame the fact that it is criminally underrated and under promoted. It's very rarely shown on TV except on holiday Bondathons (I love those!) and casual fans typically know nothing of it. I've always considered myself more than just a casual Bond fan, so I finally ordered the Ultimate Edition DVD recently and I INSTANTLY ranked this among the all time greats of the series. Wish I had seen it earlier, but no matter, I will view it many more times over the years....Lazenby's Bond was much more realistic and true to the novels, a human being that is far more talented than most, but not a superhero and in this movie not armed with numerous gadgets. He certainly played the role with dignity and it's a shame he didn't return for at least one more. But I am glad that Roger Moore was able to enter the series in his prime shortly after this rather than waiting until later, so it worked out.Beautiful places have always been an integral part of Bond films, and it doesn't get more beautiful than the Swiss Alps. I'm going to make a point of visiting Blofeld's headquarters (a real restaurant) one of these days. It must have been quite an undertaking to build it in such an isolated place as they discussed in the DVD extras. I also love Bond's modernized Aston Martin in this film and the look of the film in general is just fantastic. And for home theater owners, the avalanche scene sounds absolutely amazing on a powerful system! I thought pictures on the wall in my theater room were going to fall! SPOILERS: This film is unique in that Bond falls in love marries for the only time in the entire series, but being Bond, it was bound to end badly. A touching scene, the only real one in the entire Bond series actually. His wife was a very memorable and charismatic Bond girl and now I can put into context the visit that Roger Moore made in the beginning of For Your Eyes Only. Bottom line, if you're a Bond fan, having this in your collection is mandatory.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

In my view peter hunt is maybe one of the top 3 best directors ever done a bond movie, and it shows. We all know that George Lazenby had not done any movies before this what he had done was commericials. But becouse George Lanzenby had the greatest director/editor he did hide the fact that he was no actor. But over all George Lazenby is a fantastic bond.Since Eon have based the bond films on the novels by Ian fleming but they had never used flemmins stories from a-z they did make up the story as they felt was right. But in OHMSS they are following the story that flemming did write and it is so done so fantastic and beliveble that this is in my view maybe the greatest bond film ever made, very sad that George Lazenby could have been one of the best bond actors.Even today this is a bond film I always love to watch, wish we could have more bond like this.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
314,jim_skreech,The shape of things that sadly didn't come,10,2 October 2014,"General consensus states that this is the worst Bond film. Why? Because it starred George Lazenby. Who wasn't Sean Connery. The film is too long and Bond cries at the end. If you take a look at any one of the one star reviews on IMDb, the reviewers usually have a point, even if they have focused in on the worst elements of the film. However for OHMSS the one star reviews stink of ignorance, an inability to appreciate cinema that dares to stray from a narrow formula, or to understand that there was more to Bond than Connery and his gadgets.Much venom had been aimed at Lazenby before the film's release - he did not have acting experience, he'd become arrogant from his instant fame, and most importantly, he was not Sean. Lazenby was not outstanding, but for a first timer he made a solid Bond, and it's a real shame that he opted out of the series, as I think he really would have thrived in the role with a little more experience. Instead the fans got what they wanted and Connery returned overweight and fatigued in Diamonds Are Forever.The reason the OHMSS haters have no credibility is because they fail to appreciate that, Lazenby aside, this is an outstanding film. Diana Rigg as the troubled, but fiery, Tracy; Telly Savalas not playing Blofeld as a bug-eyed lunatic, but a suave cultured Eurovillain, and Gabriele Ferzetti and Ilse Steppat are excellent. John Barry's pioneered the use of electric guitar and synthesiser in the superb soundtrack, and Louis Armstrong's swansong 'We Have All The Time In The World' adds deep resonance to Bond and Tracy's doomed romance.The action scenes come thick and fast in the second half, and whilst the generic Bond would effortlessly dispatch the villains with one of his new gadgets, Bond actually looks like he's up against a challenge this time. His escape from Piz Gloria and finally to safety showed a Bond that was vulnerable, that had to use all his cunning and adrenaline to escape from Blofeld's mob.One of the most critiqued scenes is the final shot where Bond and Tracy are fired upon straight after the wedding, Tracy hit and killed by the gunfire. Lazenby had the right amount of sensitivity to break down and cry at that scene, it's hard to imagine macho Connery being able to do the same with any credibility. The greatest disappointment with the follow up, Diamonds Are Forever, was that Bond should have acted with uncontrolled rage against Blofeld; instead, he displays all the anger of a man who's been rickrolled, and Blofeld has all the menace of the cast of Rainbow.It is a great tragedy that Lazenby walked away from the Bond franchise, and despite box-office success, the audiences were not ready for this new era of Bond. Lazenby's no-nonsense Bond would have fit in perfectly with the meaner, less-optimistic hangover of the 1970s; the audiences however wanted Roger Moore's feel-good brand of light comedy, and the stripped-down, serious Bond only got to make a return in For Your Eyes Only.This is a fine film, and one of the only ones that I will gladly come back to watching. For all that have been put off by the negative press, ignore it and make sure you watch what is my personal favourite from the Bond franchise.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
315,sledgehammer86,Far better than many would make you believe,9,20 January 2013,"The sixth entry of the James Bond series has been widely criticised for various reasons, but in truth it was never given a fair chance being the first movie without Sean Connery. It is a far better movie than many of the reviews would make you believe. Granted, one-timer George Lazenby is not the ultimate Bond, but he is capable enough and fits the script well. Looking beyond Lazenby there is a lot to admire though. The Alpine sets look wonderful. The action scenes are very well done. There is a great villain. The Bond girl is actually a good actress. John Barry's instrumental theme is the best of the series. Best of all though, the script (unlike a lot of other Bond movies) and direction are very strong. It is also the most human and personal Bond script (staying quite a bit closer to Fleming's novels than is usually the case), with a true depth to the characters unlike any other Bond movie.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The cast is inspiring: Australian actor George Lazenby makes a refreshing performance in the last of the sixties era for Bond Films as the 00 agent himself, along with the Avengers star Diana Rigg as the suicidal but lively Tracey with Telly Savalas (who would later go on to star in Kojak and The dirty dozen films) as the megalomaniac Ernst Stavro Blofeld Watch out for Gabrielle Ferzetti as crime-lord Marc Ange Draco, short-lived Ilse Steppat as Blofeld's henchman and Joanna Lumley as one of the Piz Gloria ladies.

Regardless, this doesn't ruin On Her Majesty's Secret Service in any way to warrant a serious complaint as far as I'm concerned. As with the positive reviews this film received, I agree with most all of them. For one, George Lazenby replacing Sean Connery as Bond may have displeased some but I think he did just as good of a job and would not have minded a bit if he became the next Bond for a few more films. This movie also had some enjoyable action scenes; some of which would later get mimicked in future Bond installments. The bond girl is by far one of the best. To be a little more specific, this bond girl plays a significant part in the Bond series as a whole that no other bond girl shares. However, I won't reveal why that is because I don't usually give spoilers for the courtesy of those who haven't seen the films that I review. The ending alone for this movie got several mixed reviews but I can say with certainty that had it not ended the way it did, the Bond franchise might have come to an end.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
320,dst-thomas,Simply too darn long.,4,9 May 2011,"With adventure #23 now in production and the cold war long over, the Bond series has both grown long in the tooth and succeeded (finally) in reinventing the anachronistic British Secret Service hero and his missions.Unfortunately, completists must be somewhat familiar with ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Weighing in at an incredible 142 minutes, this movie is short on actual story and long on endless chase scenes and battles. In its day, chase scenes and fights with lots of ""gags"" and very high production value were highly entertaining. Today I find them just another reason to hit the fast forward button, because, ya kinda know what happens. There are literally too many of these extra long sequences to count.The star of the film settled into an uncomfortable position. He had to follow Sean Connery's incredible charm, and although he is cast and written more to Ian Fleming's portrait than Connery was, the contrast between Connery and Lazenby, as written, is stark. Lazenby is a competent actor, and I feel that anything you might not like about his portrayal can be blamed on the overall production. Diana Rigg, at the height of her film career, is just lovely as Bond's soul mate. Introduced into the Bond story line is his face to face introduction with his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and Telly Savalas does his best at creating the loony megalomaniac. Also introduced is the Bond family crest containing the motto that translates to ""The World Is Not Enough"" - If you've ever wondered how that got to be the title of a Bond film. Also in an unusual breaking of ""the fourth wall"", Bond looks into the camera early in the film and says ""This never happened to the other fellow"", (meaning Connery).Beside the problem of simply not having a lot of story element - mind you, what there is is just fine - the movie is plagued with being an unusually tragic Bond story. Worse - as produced, the film follows ""You Only Live Twice"". As written, ""You Only Live Twice"" follows ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". At the end of the novel ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", Bond has a complete nervous breakdown and ""You Only Live Twice"" picks up with that and takes him to Japan where he completely loses himself in the Japanese culture on his way to his eventual recovery. It redefines his entire character. So because of the out-of-sequence productions, that story element is missing from the film ""You Only Live Twice"". This is magnified when Connery, now really showing his years, reemerges as Bond in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" with the enormous tragedy Bond just faced in the preceding film sketched in to the opening sequence. As a result all hope of true storyline is lost to those who had read Ian Flemings' novels as they were originally published. If you're enamored with endless combat and chase sequences filmed at the state of the art decades ago, this film's girth may not bother you. For me, if the film were well under two hours it would be much more enjoyable - but it is what it is and it sits in its place in filmdom's James Bond historical record. I would so love to give it 7 stars because it really does deserve it on almost all levels of merit.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

It's sandwiched between Connery's two weakest films. The weak link, of course, is George Lazenby, the first non-Connery Bond. Lazenby had no acting experience and is wooden in many scenes; but he's very good in some of the more emotional scenes, including the greatest ending of a Bond film. The film is filled with great fights, a great car chase and the first (and still best) skiing sequence. Telly Savalas is, surprisingly, the best version of Blofeld we've seen to date. Diana Rigg's Tracy is the all time best Bond Girl. For the first time, there's romance in a Bond film. The film was ahead of it's the in that it provides a deeper portrait of Bond.

I'd seen the soundtrack album around record stores, but had never seen the film in the theaters or on tv (and none of my friends had either) When it came around in the mid 70s on a double bill (with 'Diamonds Are Forever') I finally had the chance to gratify my curiosity about this 'lost' 007 adventure. I was totally floored by this film!! It had a great plot, great villain, the BEST Bond girl, and absolutely THE best stunt and action photography in any Bond film before or since!! Add a poignant ending that made me cry out loud in the theater (and still does when I watch it on tv) and you have one of my fondest moviegoing memories. Still, I'd talk about this film with friends and they all shrugged it off saying Lazenby was lousy and the film was too long. Gradually they talked me into believing them, that it hadn't been as good a film as I remembered. Then in the early 80s I caught it on television (possibly the network TV premiere) and I kept saying to myself I'd been right before! This WAS one of the best Bond films!! Nothing has shaken this conviction from me since, and each time I see it I find new things about OHMSS that I love. With each repeated viewing Diana Rigg becomes more beautiful, the stunts become more incredible, the cinematography more breathtaking and Telly Savalas is a great Blofeld (much more believable than the other actors who played him) Even Lazenby's performance as Bond holds up well, though he doesn't have the screen presence of Connery. In some ways, though, Lazenby's uncertainty in the part adds a degree of vulnerability to his performance and more heart to the story. Geez, the more I think about it the more I wonder what's not to like about this one?

Bond films are famous for their action, action is no where to be seen in the first hour and a half of the film, except for a lame Pre-title sequence which is not up to the standards of Goldfinger, or The spy who loved me.

325,RNDorrell,"One of the best Bond films, with a stand-alone star",8,27 November 2017,"This was the sixth Bond film, and the only one starring George Lazenby as Bond. He was surprisingly good, despite a pair of outwardly jutting bat ears and a slight edge of goofiness. Lazenby had been an unknown male model before winning this role, then he ridiculously declined to ever act as Bond again, a decision he later publicly regretted.So, its stand-alone nature makes it unique in the Bond catalog, but on its own merits, it's one of the very best films of the entire series, with a sinister Telly Savalas bringing actual physically threatening demeanor to the role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and Diana Rigg as a captivating heroine, a Bond girl with evident brains, guts and ample self-determination. It features a taut, no-nonsense script, with a tongue-in-cheek opening teaser sequence. (""This never happened to the other fellow,"" the other fellow being Sean Connery, who had walked away from the franchise after ""You Only Live Twice,"" then returned in one later last official performance, ""Diamonds Are Forever."")Savalas was menacing and smoothly evil, this time Blofeld is threatening global destruction of major foodstuffs crops as the means of an enormous extortion scheme, biological warfare to be delivered by a cadre of brainwashed beauties, Blofeld's Angels of Death. The flick boasts rich location settings in Portugal and Switzerland, plus some of the best alpine action scenes ever filmed in the entire Bond series, capped by that wicked fight during the long, long bobsled run. The score by John Barry was excellent, as was Peter Hunt's direction.Critics at the time found Lazenby merely passable, but I found him to be droll, emotive and athletic in the proper proportions, big ears or not. Savalas and Rigg brought their late 60s star power to bear, and the result both shakes and stirs, especially with the shocking ending. This film is among those few in the Bond series that is worthy of repeated viewing, it's right up there with ""Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Skyfall.""

For once, the action is quite heartstopping: we are treated to the fight on the beach at the start, the brilliant skiing scenes, and Bond's assualt on Blofeld's mountain retreat.  The film doesn't rely on gadgetry, like many of the other Bond films: instead it looks to acting. For many, George Lazenby is seen as appalling in this film.  I disagree with this comment; he is as convincing at the fight sequences as he is at the love scenes, and is more than a match for Connery's Bond.  Diana Rigg is gorgeous and witty as the Contessa, and what of Blofeld's 'angels of death'? For me, Telly Savalas is the ultimate Blofeld.  He is much more active and sophisticated than Donald Pleasance in You Only Live Twice.  In fact, Savalas plays a convincing adversary to Lazenby's Bond.

Almost 20 years later and having done some research on Bond movies i can reaffirm my childhood opinion,this IS the best Bond movie rivalled only by""From Russia with love"".Lazenby plays 007 like there is no tommorow(quite ironic).He sometimes seems a little stiff when delivering his lines(it was his first acting job)but he has 2 major advantages:the way he moves is fantastic(he was a model at that time)and he is in a leauge of his own in the action scenes.The supporting cast is definately the best in any Bond movie:Diana Rigg is by far the best ""Bond girl"" even,her part is way bigger and more serious to be labelled as another Bond girl anyway,and Telly Savalas is in terrific shape and is only rivalled by Gert Frobe(goldfinger).The setting is definately inspiring and the action scenes truly memorable.The chase scenes in the snow and the assault of Draco's forces(along with Bond)at Blofeld headquarters are simply unforgettable.As for the sound score,it captures the essence of Bond as much as the original Bond theme does(no wonder it was made by the same composer) The only 2 reasons i can find for this movie's""failure"" are that people weren't ready for a replacement to Connery and that the ending was not a happy one (a first and last for Bond movies).

Last night I gave it a chance though, and was blown away. While Lazenby is no Connery (in fact, for the first half of the film, he's almost no Moore, either), by the middle of the film he was 100% Bond...James Bond. The plot is terrific (although I would have liked to see Pleasance back as Blofeld instead of Telly Savalas, who had no sense of menace to him) and the last hour and a half is as good an action film as I've seen. Diana Rigg is my new favorite Bond girl, and the locations are beautiful and used with purpose. Some of the 'one liners' are hysterical, although one callous remark after a particularly gruesome death goes a bit over the line. The director's experimentation with undercranking wears a bit thin, but he does some nice work, too. There is one scene where Bond is staring out a multi-paned window. We can see his face through the upper left pane as he reminisces about a recent event, shown to us in the other panes. It is very subtle, and a beautiful idea wonderfully executed. This is also the only Bond film I've seen that even comes close to  being Fleming's creation (the next closest is Dalton in License To Kill). Bond purists may disagree with my selection for best Bond film, but you can't argue this: if you give the film a chance, you'll find that Barry's score is without a doubt his best. Period.

331,joe d,Probably The Best Of The Bond's,10,24 March 1999,"OHMSS is my favorite of the Bond series, and I really wish George Lazenby had continued as 007, for I think, in time, he would have developed his character as well as Connery's.  I also feel had Lazenby continued in the role, the mood of the films might not have changed from action to comical (as beginning with Diamonds Are Forever).You can see the limitations of Lazenby's acting ability clearly in the movie, his dialogue is limited in key scenes with Bloefeld and Dracco, and he really did not dominate these and other scenes as Connery, Moore and the others would have.  However, as other people cite, he stepped into a role which we all felt belonged to somebody else.  Sean Connery WAS James Bond to us in 1969, anybody else was doomed to fail (critics longed for Connery when Roger Moore took over the role, also).  So Lazenby, who had no prior acting experience, was thrown to the lions.  We all still wanted Connery.  Today we can see that his was an excellent Bond, true to the character of Ian Flemming.The film speaks for itself.  First rate, mature and plenty of action and story line.  The music probably is of the finest composed by John Barry for the series.  For it to carry this much weight without the appearance of Sean Connery and the others speaks highly.But again, do not knock George Lazenby's performance.  It is a shame that we will never know how he would have developed as an actor and as a Bond since he quit the series due to (what he says) was poor advice and never got such an opportunity again.  It would have been only after a few performances that we truly could say he would, or would not, have been able to carry on the series.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

While taking over the world with an unlikely weapon is permissable and having a dazzling array of gadgets is defacto, this film offers none of these things.  In fact Blofelts plan is more laughable than any of the other unlikely screams in the entire series.

335,kylezeb,Best Bond Film Yet,10,22 December 2001,"ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICEOn Her Majesty's Secret Service is far and above the very best Bond film to date.  The plot is easily the best of the long-running films, it actually has to do with espionage and a little bit of spying unlike the more recent Brosnan ones. The action is second to none, not only in the Bond Films but in all movies in general. The humor is very much present but is not the main focus, as it would be later in the series especially during the early Moore films and the incredibly bad Diamonds Are Forever. There is enough romance in this film to satisfy any woman as the romance between Bond and Tracy is surprisngly sweet and tender. In what is very rare for a Bond movie the film is actually realistic, Blofeld's plot is really not all that fantastic and is easy enough to beleive.  John Barry's musical score is wonderful as with almost every other film he has done, and the main theme is particularly memorable.  Also, the film is perfectly paced despite the fact that it is the longest of all the James Bond films.I don't care what other people say, Gerorge Lazenby made a great James Bond, in fact I don't think the film would have been as good if Connery was the lead.  Diana Rigg is absolutely superb as the Bond Girl, not only is she great to look at, but her character is well-written, she actually as a great deal to do with the plot of the film (which is something you can not say for other Bond Girls), and she is an incredible actress.  Gabriel Ferzetti as Draco is second only to Kerim Bay(From Russia With Love)as the very best Bond companion The usual MI6 actors are back doing their usual excellent job. Telly Savalas is really the only disappointing aspect of the film acting wise as Bond's chief nemesis Blofeld.  While Savalas does not embarass himself he is terribly miscast as Blofed who should be European, not an American gangster.Other then Telly Savalas I have very few complaints about the film. There are some minor complaints about the editing and direction of the fight scenes, the camera pulls in and out way to fast; it probaly would've been a better idea to film those scenes in a more straight forward style. Another problem is the voice dubbing is quite noticeable as it was in all the 60's Bond films. (Though it wasn't quite as bad as You Only Live Twice in which every woman in the film other then Moneypenny was dubbed!)  And finally, I don't really care for the plot device in which Bond sleeps with every woman in Piz Gloria even though I realize it was his job.Many people say that Goldfinger or From Russia with Love are the best Bond films, but upon careful anyalsis it should be clear that OHMSS is the clear winner for that title.  All of the elements clicked just right to make one of the best movies in the late 60's.

337,astonmartin7,Arguably the best Bond film,10,17 February 2007,"The Bond film that got away, in effect. Unless you were around in the 1960s when the Connery Bonds were released, you grew up watching them on TV or video. I was never too excited to screen the Lazenby one-off when I was growing up. First watched it at age 12 and found it long and boring. In my late twenties, I fell in love with it.OHMSS screams out 1969 to me every time I watch it; it's very ""adult"" in a way. Although the film-makers still kept in the patented Bond humour, there were plenty of interesting characters, settings and plot-lines.Lazenby is perfectly fine as 007 and I would have liked to have seen him in more entries in the series. Telly Savalas is one of the best Bond villains because he's very smooth but his character's malicious intent is very palpable. On top of it all, there is the great Gabriele Ferzetti (from Antonioni's L'Avventura and Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West). He has the best line in the film regarding Diana Rigg's ex-husband: ""He killed himself, and his mistress, in a Maserati last summer!"" That line indicates to me the height of rich, bourgeois 1960s European decadence begun a decade before with Fellini and Antonioni.Kudos to director Peter Hunt for seemingly following his vision and making a Bond film to be proud of after all these years.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Notice a striking comparison?Director Peter Hunt really struck a verve on this James Bond film, becuase it follows the book/s so closely and carefully that its like watching the book in motion.This movie was most probably destinied to fail, because of the fact that it lacked the legendary Sean Connery in the title role. I think that if Connery had gone ahead and made this film, then, it would have been so much better, but, he didnt, and that's unfortunate.So, George Lazenby steps into the role, and he portrays (in my opinion) James Bond ten fold what Connery does. His swarve and carisma can truly be defined as how James Bond is meant to be.Diana Rigg (from The Avengers) is quite good as a Bond girl, and makes a solid effort throught the film.Telly Savalas was a HUGE mistake to play Blofeld, in my personal opinion. He just didnt have that charisma or feel that Donald Pleasance did in ""You only Live Twice"".The exotic locations really save this movie, and credit should go out to the cinematographers who filmed the beautiful landcapes. The excellent escape scenes in this film are a tribute to the beautiful scenery.The music in this film also keeps the pace flowing, great stuff!If you havent already, go see ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", it is definitly worth a look.

If you save the world, frequently, you don't make it out the other end. Or you lose something near and dear to you. Something that can kill you emotionally. In the case of this film Bond loses Tracy. The love of his live. Taken from him by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It must be understood, that no matter WHAT Bond may do to Blofeld in later films or books, that will never change. Blofeld has won. Bond has lost. He saved the world, but lost his soul. Lazenby portrayed this perfectly. Had he been given a chance to carry on the story as it was supposed to be (in ""You Only Live Twice"") we would have had a perfect epic the likes of which we did not get until ""Casino Royale"" and ""A Quantum of Solace"". Even the abysmal ""Diamonds are Forever"" opened with a not to the real plot, but no more then a nod. Lazenby's Bond was very true to the book and the character.

He doesn't exude Bond's playboy-ish quality, and the idea of Bond getting married is ridiculous in the context of the film screen series.

343,pawtrax67,Merry Christmas 007....,10,27 December 2010,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service had a lot stacked against it.First of all to look at the context, Sean Connery got tired of the role of 007. So the producers needed a replacement. But, how in the heck to you send someone to match up to Connery???Next, it was 1969. Movies were moving in a different direction. Spy movies were now becoming a mockery of themselves with In Like Flint, Casino Royale, and others. So with all this stacked up against it, and a very merciless British media, what were the odds the first Non-Connery movie would be successful? Well upon release there was mixed-reviews, and despite the fact the movie cost $7 million to make and made $87.4 million gross, it was viewed as not as successful as previous Bond movies.My view? I first saw the heavily edited ABC TV version, and figured with all the editing it really didn't make much sense, and although I liked the winter sports angle. But I felt well I guess they didn't want us seeing much of Lazenby. Fast forward a couple of decades later, I pick up a box set of James Bond DVD's with On Her Majesty's Secret Service in it. Since I had only seen it once, I was curious to see if it was really all that bad.What did I find? A great script, with lots of character development, and ""gasp"" real spy work done by 007. Lazenby played 007 not as Mr. Suave, saving the world type spy. But as a human being with real foibles and weaknesses. Diana Rigg was fantastic as the woman who is pretty much Bond's equal, and not as an air-headed bimbo who's there just as a notch on the bed. The rest of the cast was great. The women were beautiful. Beautiful locations. And the action sequences were excellent. (For the exception of the sped up scenes and choppy action sequence when he meets Draco for the first time.)There are some quirks (What Bond movies doesn't have them?). Why is Blofeld so intent on getting his title, instead of power and world domination? Why was Tracy acting suicidal? Why would bodyguards attack her and Bond? Why was M so antagonistic? 007 has saved the world and done big jobs before, why be so uptight about Operation: Bedlam? One other beef was probably just the fashions of Lazenby in the beginning of the movie. Then again it was 1969.Overall I gave the movie 10 out of 10 as one of the best films. Yes, Telly Savalas was an odd choice for Blofeld, but he gives it his own menacing charm. I think the press should have issued Lazenby an apology, because for a guy in his first movie, he did a great job. I like that the current Bond takes his cues from OHMSS. I'm just not sure if anyone could have saved the disaster that was known as Diamonds Are Forever. So maybe Lazenby would have only lasted one more film anyways. But I'm pretty sure the tone of Diamonds Are Forever would have been different, and perhaps better as just a straight revenge yarn, with diamond smuggling as a source for Spectre's criminal activities.Judge for yourself.

In this film James Bond is again fighting against SPECTRE. He is after Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Without going too much into details the story is a typical for a Bond-film. SPECTRE´s goal is more or less to rule the world and Bond is trying to stop that.As it was already said, this film was Lazenby´s first one and after just watching many films where Sean Connery plays Bond, one realises how Lazenby is not able to match the ""other fellow"". Where as Connery was charismatic and cool, playing a bit cocky 007, Lazenby is just a shy guy, facing the impossible task of filling Bonds shoes. Diana Rigg is playing the Bond girl in Tracy´s role and she does ok. She is not as good as Honor Blackman in the Goldfinger but still she does perform quite well.The film has some quite nice action scenes but generally speaking the fight scenes where not as good as in previous films.

348,chelb,A Very Very Good Bond Movie,8,19 December 2001,"This is the 7th of 22 Bond movies, counting one currently in production and two ""unofficial"" ones.  This is the only Bond movie to star George Lazenby as James Bond and he was the second actor to play James Bond. I gave this movie an 8 out of 10, it was very good.  I want to say that the makers of the Bond movies, Broccoli and Saltzburg (spelling?) bad-mouth Lazenby alot after this movie was made.  I would like to say, however, that this is unwarranted criticism as George Lazenby did a fine job in the role. He is a different bond from Connery or Moore, but he is a very good James Bond and a good actor too.  He was saddled with a script that made him act a bit silly and even had a silly voice dubbed over his, for some reason, when his character impersonates a professor later in the film.  I think the producers are at fault for anything seen as wrong with the Bond character in this movie.     This movie has a teaser in which Bond fights some men on a beach in Portugal after trying to save a woman swimming there.  He wins the fight but the woman drives off.  The script has Bond turn to the camera and say, ""That never happened to the other guy!"" in reference to Connery, who came before. This is the only time the ""4th wall"" in the Bond series is broken.  Later, there are gadget and music references to the prior Bond movies.  The producers were probably very very worried about making Bond movies without Connery but these references were carried off quite well. In the main body of the movie Bond must stop arch enemy Blofeld from falsely claiming an inheritance and from using biological warfare, through unknowing and beautiful female agents, to disable and dominate the world. He is planning this through a mountaintop chalet in Switzerland.  Also, a rich man sets up Bond with the girl in the teaser so that they can date.  A very interesting thing happens for a Bond movie...Bond falls in love with her and later marries her.  I will not spoil the ending but that is very very unique too. There are many snow based adventures and chases in the movie and the action is a 9 of 10.  The British actress, Diane Rigg, plays the female lead and I would give her a 9 of 10.  She is sexy with beautiful eyes and nice legs.  She is also smart and has alot of character development.  The plot is good but a bit silly and goofy in points and there is a slow point towards the end.  I would give the plot a 6 of ten overall but a 10 of 10 for uniqueness in a James Bond movie.  There are no words in the title theme music.  There is a song sung later in the movie by Louie Armstrong though, and the soundtrack is excellent.  It is a perfect 10 of 10 and is the best James Bond soundtrack.  The villain Blofeld, this time played by Telly Sevalas, is pretty good but too direct.  I give him a 7.5 of 10.  Overall, I rate this very unique Bond epic a highly respectable 8 of 10 and if you get rid of any biases beforehand and try to watch this as just a movie you will see that George Lazenby did a terrific job and was a great James Bond. Also, remember that this movie made a large profit and that it now outsells all the other Bond movies on VHS and DVD worldwide because it has some deeper character development in it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
349,jake87,The Bond that almost killed Bond,6,4 April 2002,"`On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is the James Bond movie for those who don't like James Bond movies. That's the secret to the vehement opinions this movie still sparks. Taken on its own terms, OHMSS is a flawed but entertaining action-romance. Certainly, all concerned, including Ian Fleming, recognized that the highly successful Bond formula was becoming entirely too formulaic. Sean Connery had dropped out, with greater consequences than anticipated, and this gave the producers a chance to stir things up. That the attempt was a partial failure can be traced in part to fans' resistance to change. But there also are the matters of a somewhat miscast cast, a long, involved plot and a downbeat ending (which will not be described here). Where the Bond recipe offered Connery smoothly dispensing frat-boy bon mots in the true spirit of the Sixties, OHMSS presented male model George Lazenby delivering similar lines woodenly. Lazenby represented reckless casting _ the idea that the look was more important than the acting _ but he is not a total loss. George does have the right physique, and handles the action scenes tidily. His obvious discomfort in early scenes, especially in the boudoir, eases a bit as the movie continues. His willingness to present a tender side, even spoof himself, is more than Connery managed. But if Lazenby improved as an actor, his ego won him few friends behind the scenes. That likely contributed to his variable chemistry with his leading lady. It's untrue that the Bond formula required the `girls' to be nincompoops. But the competence of previous female leads, such as Honor Blackman, was undercut by their silly names and subplots, as well as by their ability to stuff wild bikinis. Unfortunately, while it might be a blessing that other Bond women were not later asked to play Medea, it's relevant here that the lovely but boyish Diana Rigg clearly couldn't hope to fill their bikinis. An experienced actress, she's got more than enough talent to turn the troubled Tracy into a memorable character. But a spoiled, depressed heroine who isn't instantly overwhelmed by James Bond is another startling departure from form, no matter how nuanced the performance. It doesn't help that Rigg's unconvincingly pushed-up and padded figure obviously leaves Lazenby unmoved in the early love scenes. Trying to generate a trace of sexual tension, Rigg must act for two. It takes the movie a while to recover, and the many dubbed scenes in the first half further slow the momentum. Telly Savalas to the rescue. With his riveting ugliness and top-dog swagger, Savalas has the right phsyicality to make a menacing Blofeld, even if his grating accent expunges the `international man of mystery' effect. Still, Savalas and Rigg seem to enjoy their scenes together, and Ilse Steppat makes a great henchwoman. As the movie goes on, all the good and bad guys and gals get their shares of scenic action, especially in the Alpine setting of Piz Gloria. And of course, fashion houses still are trying to take over the world with atomizers... All in all, OHMSS is an interesting sidetrip for James Bond, and worth checking out if you've got a long afternoon that you're licensed to kill.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
350,jake87,Lowered Bond rating,6,4 April 2003,"(Minor spoilers.) For a movie that drew catcalls and yawns upon its release, OHMSS has attracted a rabid cult following over the years. Some reviewers go so far as to insist that it is the `best' Bond film.Cooler-headed imdb voters have rated it about right, as a very watchable but far from great movie. While overly long and not always compelling, it does have its interesting sections. Ironically, while Ian Fleming and the Broccoli/Saltzman producing team tried to shake up the Bond formula, the best bits in this film are the formulaic parts.As other reviewers have pointed out, the screenplay adheres closely to Fleming's book. That's not always a good thing. In trying to deepen his comic-book hero, the author was in over his head trying to graft a tragic love story onto Bond's usual conscience-free shenanigans.Casting has always been a sticking point with this film, and it might charitably be described as odd. When it comes to George Lazenby, there's no sense beating a dead career: he wasn't a great choice, but after all, James Bond isn't King Lear.Lazenby is adequate for an action-adventure star. He has the physique, and his Bond is asked to show more emotion than Sean Connery's ever was. Of course, even his Scottish accent had to be dubbed as Bond goes undercover as Sir Hillary Bray. Lazenby can't truthfully be described as anything more than a model trying within his limits to act. (As for his downward career path, George has only himself to blame, alienating the producers, director Peter Hunt and co-star Diana Rigg. Twenty years later, Lazenby was still giving interviews denying he was as `petty and paranoid as Diana claimed.')In the book, Bond has some dramatic chance encounters with Tracy Di Vincenzo, and becomes intrigued by the spoiled, self-destructive daughter of a Corsican mob boss. The ennui-drenched, Euro blonde bombshell described in the book would have been perfect for Brigitte Bardot. The first choice for the part, Bardot instead generated sexual voltage with Connery in `Shalako.'In Bardot's place, Broccoli and Saltzman for a second time turned to an alumna of `The Avengers.' That worked fine with buxom Honor Blackman in `Goldfinger,' perhaps the most genuinely sexy Bond film. But Blackman fit the Bond `girl' mode, while cleavage-challenged Diana Rigg represented another departure from the formula. There were logical reasons for the choice. An intelligent, experienced actress, well-known from TV roles, it was thought Rigg could carry Lazenby through his scenes.But the arch, astringent Rigg seemed far more comfortable with her Emma Peel TV character than with bored sex-kitten Tracy. Rigg struggles to convey anything beyond mild depression, and her scenes with Lazenby produce more of a minor humming than sparks. Gabriel Ferzetti, dubbed in as Tracy's father, seems completely unrelated to Rigg, but does look good.Meanwhile, Telly Savalas has the physical menace of super-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but none of the character's panache. Fleming burdens him with a silly subplot, trying to establish a noble lineage, that makes Blofeld seem more of a social climber than a master mind. But Blofeld's actual menace, dispensing models with atomizers to take over the world, has succeeded in real life. Since this movie's release, fashion has driven all remaining traces of common sense from our planet.But like this movie, I digress. After a rambling first hour, OHMSS gets going with some great, action sequences. Alpine Piz Gloria is one of the best settings used in a Bond film. First-time director Peter Hunt was known for staging and editing, and probably he was more comfortable with that than working with actors. While some of the ski sequences are archaic looking now, at the time Hunt was very inventive. Technically, OHMSS was a leap forward for the Bond films, and much of the excitement still comes across, even as that messy plot keeps intruding.While supposedly in looove with Tracy, Bond nevertheless finds time for tomcatting around with Blofeld's lovelies. True to series form, Lazenby chases anything in a skirt, a bit unsettling since he's wearing a kilt himself. (This apparently paralleled the course of Rigg-Lazenby relations offscreen, contributing to her disdain for him.) But for Bond fans, this is a reassuring reminder that we don't have to think too hard here.Perhaps it would have been better for all concerned if Bond went off with one of the models (Joanna Lumley?) while Tracy settled in with Blofeld. But that's what might have been, in a better world or a better movie. What we're left with here is a Bond film that takes some interesting, peculiar and leisurely detours en route to a downbeat ending. It's a different approach for the series, and the effort deserves appreciation even though its success is mixed.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

353,ThomasHayden,One of the best,8,6 March 2005,"Giving the series a radical twist after the glorious Connery's farewell to 007 movies in You Only Live Twice, the producers intended for the first time to introduce a new take on Bond, returning to the literary roots of the character, as originally described in Fleming's novels and short stories. So Maibaum this time faithfully adapted one of Fleming's most successful and appreciated works: On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The screenplay is so close to the book that actually the movie is somewhat contradictory with previous Bond installments: Bloefeld and Bond don't know each other (???), and, in order to make the plot line look more logical, by changing the physical appearance of the villain, the part was given to Telly Savallas, who looks too amiable to be the bad guy, instead of the scarred and terrific Donald Pleasance. The plot is also very different from what the usual fans expect from Bond movies, being mainly focused on the romance between Bond and Tracy during the first half, then moving to Bloefeld's stronghold in Switzerland, and ending with 45 minutes of extremely exciting, non stop action.The film's pacing is pretty irregular. The romance is probably the best part, at the best of Bond tradition, mainly thanks to Diana Rigg's inspired performance as Tracy, perfectly depicting an emotionally unbalanced, yet appealing and glamorous, woman. Lazenby's OK (at least at this part of the movie), but he lacks the masculinity and roughness Connery showed, what ultimately damages the movie, specially during the disastrous sequences which take place in Bloefeld's research facility in the Swiss Alps, which are laughable). There's nothing remarkable about them. (what a silly conspiracy!!), but 45 minutes spent, which make the movie overlong. When everything seems ruined, the film revives and takes us on a wild ride on an action packed roller-coaster (ski chase, Bond and Draco raid on Bloefeld's base), with a brief romantic rest as Bond and Tracy talk about their future life in common (Bond a journalist?),a very touching scene. The ending remains as one of the top Bond moments, tragical and romantic. The stylish pre-credit sequence is equally brilliant,showing the natural elegance and ""joie de vivre"" we all associate with Bond. A question: what if Connery had accepted to play Bond this time? I think this could be the best Bond movie ever made. But the producers came up with a martial arts expert with no experience in acting, which sadly overshadows many good points(on Lazenby's defense, it was his first performance), but this film still intensely shines as an interesting, strange gem in the Bond canon.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
354,ernst_s_blofeld,Finally being appreciated for what it is....,10,26 February 2007,"The BEST Bond film to date.Peter Hunt was very courageous to stray from the formulaic and give us this Bond masterpiece. I think the resentment to this film by some shows just how predictable and unimaginative the masses demand their motion pictures be.Everything from the outstanding theme, to the cinematography, to the casting and a respectful adherence to Ian Fleming's Novel make this the Bond film to be measured by not Goldfinger. And given the new slant by the newest Bond, Casino Royal(2006), it seems a given that the franchise seems determined to abandon the Connery formula in favor of the sophisticated Hunt/Fleming model.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
355,jpahren,The best? no way--I don't get it,3,12 March 2011,"(lots of spoilers here--but if anyone is reading this, it's probably cause you already saw the movie and want to know why someone might hate it)I'll admit it's not the worst--there were some pretty dismal ones in the 70s-80s, but I could barely watch this one.The ending--the final assault, and then the big twists with ""Bond in love""--is actually pretty good, and worthy of Bond-history note. But getting there is so painful.Maybe someone can explain it to me what the heck is going on to set this up--It seems that we have a big-time mobster whose daughter (Tracy) has run amok, and he thinks a ""real man"" like JB can straighten her out simply by marrying her (reasonable enough). So he sends some henchmen to bring JB to him to explain the proposition. But then it looks like they used *Tracy* as the bait to catch him! Huh? Somebody explain how that makes sense. And these 3 guys really seem intent on killing him, so why doesn't he kill them? JB actually committed murder in Dr. No--why does he let these schmucks off? (we came close to true JB when he slapped Tracy--that part was good).So then he falls in love with the b***. Why? I don't know, but it happens to the best of them, so I'll let that one go (and he does bed her).Anyway, back to the plot--he infiltrates Blofeld's lair OK, and--what luck--it is filled with dozens of beautiful women! And I guess he forgets that he's in love, because he actually beds two of them (up to now JB movies has just the Bond girl plus one), and is all ready to take on more (another cool point--doing two of them back to back). Anyway, it was painful getting through the intros and the dinner scene--I almost fell asleep!I like good JB plot, don't necessarily need the action--Dr No and FRWL are two of my faves--but unlike other reviewers, I felt the plot in this one stunk. Finally the action comes and starts picking up this movie, and after the ski chase JB looks like he's trapped--but what luck! The mobster has sent his daughter into this mess and she rescues him--what a Dad! And she just happens to land in front of him the exact second he needs help! Ugh, I can't take it. I'm willing to suspend disbelief as much as the next guy, but come on.In sum: GREAT music, *some* classic locations and action, cool establishment of the skiing Bond, cool ending, but far too much pain to endure to get these points. Lazenby stunk--looked like he was trying to look like Connery, but be someone else (lord knows who).And finally, Blofeld totally got away, with his evil plan in place--so why didn't he act on it?",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
356,SnakeEclipse,"Different Story, but definitely some of the best action sequences form the old era.",7,19 December 2005,"OK, a lot of my friends simply shoot down OHMSS because it isn't Connery, Moore, or Brosnan. Let me put all the Bond actors in line. Connery and Brosnan do it the best out of any Bond. Connery for the old, and Brosnan for the new. They just mirror each other in talent, charisma, and just plain kick ass. Dalton, eh, I won't p*ss on Dalton, but I won't praise him much either. he did what he could. Lazenby is probably the worst actor for Bond next to possibly Dalton, but I'll give him the kudo that he can LITERALLY KICK ASS. I don't think I've seen anyone fight as fast as he did as Bond in this movie. Plus he made the action sequences make the audience just want more.Story. well. I guess this movie could be for Bond what attack of the clones is for Star Wars, a love story. However, this one is more in the ballpark of Bond since he is all for women, and it is a change of pace for him. After Tracy got killed, it just ties together every time someone asks him about losing a loved one, and not just Tracy, but his parents as well. It just makes sense when I watch any other bond movie after this one. The whole clinic thing was a little bit boring and repetitive though, and it kind of made me go: ""I could really use an explosion right about now"" at times. However, it made a watchable movie, and I thank Lazenby for his action contribution, but I'm glad he only did one, and I think we need Brosnan to do one more before he gets TOO old.7/10",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
357,carlos_b84,Lazenby was not that bad....,7,17 August 2005,"TNT has been running all Bond films. Last weekend, the time came to finally watch the infamous George Lazenby film. Many people (my dad included) had told me this movie was weak, and that the Australian actor sucked. Of course, being so slighted a film, I had to watch it to see whether all that was true.Bond gets involved with a girl who turns out to be the daughter of a criminal lord, who wants his daughter, rebellious and whimsical, to be tamed. To that, she proposes the Commander to marry her. In exchange, he will provide information on the whereabouts of Blofeld. Bond flirts the girl, who in order to get rid of 007 makes his dad spit out the info. However, Bond remains interested, but has to move to Switzerland (or somewhere snowy) to find Blofeld.I think the word is ATYPICAL. At least from my point of view, Lazenby's Bond does many things that I haven't seen any of the others do (I exclude Timothy Dalton here, since I have seen his films a long time ago but I don't remember anything). At the beginning, when he saves the girl, she gets away without thanking him (""This never happened to the other one""). Moments later, Bond kissing Moneypenny (a fact that I thought could only be attributed to virtual reality, as in ""Die Another Day""). Time later, when 007 is escaping Blofeld's troops in the snow, fear draws on his face. I take it that this is due to Lazenby's poor acting skills. Connery, Moore or Brosnan managed to keep panic out of their faces in a difficult situation.I watched a TV special about Bond that said that Lazenby was crucified only because he came after Connery. Anyone in his position would have suffered the same critics. He did rather fine, though his acting needed improvement in some points. He did most of the action scenes himself, and he did them rather well. Before seeing this, I was wondering why a model was cast rather than a British actor (Oliver Reed in ""The Assassination Bureau"" plays a simile of Bond). However, the results are good so who can blame them? Too bad Lazenby felt too big headed after this movie and dropped out.Diana Rigg (""The Assassination Bureau"", ""The Avengers"") plays Tracy, the woman who will be the only one to make a true impact in Bond's heart. She is by far the most beautiful actress of the 60's, and a great actress too, and her being here makes the film all more better.The film is very entertaining, and I enjoyed it more than some of the previous films, like ""Thunderball"" (too much underwater) or ""From Russia with love"". There's plenty of action and it has one of the finest endings I have ever seen. So don't hate Lazenby. He did his best and was good at it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

But incredibly, I had not seen OHMSS until today.First of all, the OHMSS theme is by far the best Bond theme of them all. I loved the background music to the infamous ski scene in The Spy Who Loved Me (Bond '77) but that wasn't the theme music.George Lazenby put in an acceptable performance. It's hard to believe he was only 29, he looks much older. There was something lacking in his performance though, I just couldn't quite put my finger on it.The middle of the film is a little slow (the whole Sir Hilary thing), but it picks up momentum eventually.I thought OHMSS was a decent Bond film overall.

361,SomebodyToListenTo,Definitely The Worst Bond Ever,3,13 November 1999,"I rented this movie with the best of intentions.  I had seen The Spy Who Loved Me and Diamonds Are Forever before this so I expected OMSS to live up to the quality of the prequel and sequel to this movie.  What a disappointment!This movie has not aged well.  It's too long and it looks more like the Avengers than Bond.  Dianna Rigg and the title sequence are an proof of this. Elements which made Goldfinger, Thunderball and The Spy Who Loved Me great were missing from this movie.  No big fights, no world threatening situations and no insanely evil villans.Continuing my last point, Savalis was a total disappointment.  He seemed more like a hotel manager than a the head of SPECTRE. He didn't get that much screen time.  And when he did, he just lectures the audience.
The one possible saving grace of this movie is the last 20 minutes or so. There is action, there is purpose; Bond has to rescue his soon-to-be wife. Unfortunately, this is another let down.  There is no pace and when the chase ends it is just Bond and Blofeld.  And the wit that Connery used when he disposed of villians is reduced to a poor one line joke when Lazenby says it.The storyline was just not believable.  The seems to be no driving force in this movie which raises a number of questions: Why would Blofeld ever meet Bond face-to-face?  Why would Bond ever marry?  Maybe this is the true Fleming Bond but it is not and never will be Connery-Bond.
There was no shortage of potential for this movie. There were good actors (Savalis and Rigg).  There were exotic locations.  It just never materialized.This movie is not worth your time and don't rent it.  You will regret it. Definitely the worst Bond ever.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

There were 3 of us in the audience. It is still probably the best double feature I have ever seen. ""O.H.M.S.S."" is one of the very best 007 films of all and George Lazenby is excellent as Bond. He is scoffed at as a forgotten James Bond, but the film loses no credibility with him in the starring role. John Barry considers his score for this film as one of his best and it is certainly memorable. His love theme ""We Have All the Time in the World"" is one of the loveliest songs ever written.

Well, yesterday I decided to go ahead and watch this film on Spikes Bond marathon and I am not only convinced that this is one of the better Bond films, I now see why the producers chose Mr. Lazenby for Bond. In watching this film I actually found myself wondering what could have been had Mr. Lazenby not bailed on this franchise because of bad advice from his manager.The film on it's own is easily one of the most entertaining. The story was tight and the action was very evenly paced through out the whole film. The writing was extremely tight and again I have to say that Lazenby makes the film. Mr. Lazenby has the suaveness of Moore and masculinity of Connery. After watching Diamonds Are Forever and You Only Live Twice it seems extremely clear that Connery needed to move on from this role and that it needed a fresh face. Ultimately I think Moore did a fine job in picking up the mantle but who knows what would have been had Lazenby stuck with Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

369,portland295,"The Best Bond, Connery not included",10,27 December 2000,"Out of all the 19 bond films I have seen, On Her Majestys Secret Service(O.H.M.S.S.) is the best one because mainly of the Bond Girl, the villain, and the severely overlooked George Lazenby. First of all, Bond finally has a girl that he doesn't have to lust over. Tracy (greatly played by Diana Rigg of the Avengers)was the first ever Mrs. James Bond. One of the more stronger and more athletic Bond Girls, She seemed to be a perfect woman for James, not that Marc-Ange Draco said she needed somebody to rule over her(i think that was the quote). It was the way the reacted to each other. When they met in the Hamlet in Switzerland, Tracy seemed delighted(and Bond felt delighted because the Piz gloria goons were after Him).Then there is Blofeld, played by Telly Savalas(soon to be Lt. Theo Kojak). He is by far the best Blofeld. He is more apt to do more than Donald Pleasence's character. Blofeld was a part of well known ski chase, and a bobsled race in the end. Could you imagine Pleasence doing that? Telly Savalas never had that horrid scar on his eye, but no earlobes(which it looks like Pleasence's character didn't have earlobes in the first place) and he never had hair like Charles Gray. Then imagine Charles Gray skiing. That never would happen. That is why certain characters such as Dr. Evil have formed from Pleasence's eye and suit(maybe also Dr. Julius No's suit too, but anyway). This role for Telly Savalas has put him as a well known actor, and it wasn't for his missing earlobes(in real life, he has earlobes).Then, there is Lazenby, the most underrated James Bond 007 out there. If Lazenby is so bad, why was he picked? He was seen by Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli or Harry Saltzman with a James Bond style haircut and he was put in as Bond. I think he didn't do a too awful bad of a job. He  Certainly better than Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton. And if people would just get over that he is not Sean Connery or a veteran actor. If they aren't a good actor they call him a turkey. Then people go and ask themselves: if this was Connery or Moore, would this have been better? The answer in my mind is no. George Lazenby was perfect for this movie because he is the emotional Bond. He is the only Bond that can be emotional and some people don't make fun of him for it. People would have problems with Connery or Moore doing that. If people get minds, cut Lazenby a breakThis is my most favorite James Bond movie. ***** out of *****",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
370,wht1knight,Hidden Jewel,9,12 January 2006,"This is a film that has been unfairly rated and I consider a hidden jewel in the Bond series. The critics have unfairly punished George Lazenby's performance in part because it was his first major role and then he made the mistake of departing the series after one movie.First, the music score is excellent! Forget the song by Louis Armstrong. The opening music theme just gets your attention. It is action, it is danger, it is Bond! Adding to that, the collage of past villains and women who scroll down the hour glass frame and the audience has one last chance to pay tribute to the past and look forward to a potentially good future.Second, the balance of humor and drama is perfect. In my humble opinion, Lazenby is not stiff. His humor is dry, but the timing is good. Though he does not have the delivery of Connery nor Moore, his with practice he would have surpassed them. Physically, his fight scenes were realistic, yet he delivers the witty comment credibly. Diana Rigg and the other cast members have good chemistry and they too also deliver the needed balance of humor and drama with charm and style.Third, there is Lazenby himself. This man has been tragically maligned for decades since he made this movie. His acting was good. His physique was good. A lot of people have jumped on the tired-old-band wagon of bash Lazenby in part because he quit the series after one movie. As Bond, he was more rugged than Moore or Bronson, more romantically human than Connery or Dalton.Let's be honest. Could you see anyone else be romantically involved with Diana Rigg? Moore and Bronson would have been laughed out of the bedroom by the former ""Mrs. Peele""! Connery would have been arrested for battery. Dalton, maybe would have had a chance, but it would not have been believable. Lazenby was the right choice.The problem with this film is Broccoli. He changed too many variables. New actor. New format for M, Q, Moneypenny. Bond gets married! A strong female lead (only surpassed by Honor Blackman). Too many things. Blame Broccoli.Then there is Telly Savalis, who portrayed a good crazy but real Blofeld! Who loves ya, baby? He should have been Blofeld through out the series! Lastly, the female lead was great. Only Honor Blackman has been stronger. Ever since OHMSS, the female leads have either been witches, wenches, bubble brains, or so flat that they are like puppets. Michelle Yeoh is athletically strong, and would rank third, but she did not have the fun classy sex appeal of Blackman nor Rigg.Sadly, it will take at least a generation before people realize that this was a very good film, with a good story, good cast and good music.In my opinion, Lazenby has been punished because he quit the franchise too soon, and we as Bond fans had to endure Diamonds Are Forever, For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker, Goldeneye, and License To Kill.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

372,Mr Lombardo,A fascinating glimpse of what Bond might have become!,10,27 April 1999,"Far up! Far out! Far more! This is Bond at his dazzling best.  We have a plot which is scarily believable for once and this is the movie that made skiing a staple of the Bond franchise with a mammoth chase across the Swiss alps.  A big chunk of this film is taken up by the love story but this is 'compensated' for with an extended running time.  This movie isn't weighed down by the gadetry which has flawed so many other Bond movies.  In fact OHMSS features a rather prophetic conversation between Q and M  when Q states that the future lies in computer analysis.  The fight sequences are something special - so brutal and full of energy.   You'd be hard pushed to find better staged fights in Western cinema.  In a word, awesome.  Another highlight of this film is John Barry's score which I rank as one of his best.  And it was a good decision to have Louis Armstrong's 'All the Time in the World' as the main song rather than something contrived to incorporate the films title.  Diana Rigg also serves up the only three dimensional Bond girl in the entire franchise.  Even though the part was written differently to those of other Bond girls it was a smart move to give the role to an actress rather than a model.  For all that sets OHMSS apart from other Bond films, the one thing that will be remembered about it is that it is the one that stars the 'failed' Bond Lazenby.  He looks the part, but he lacks the sheer presence of Connery.  Whoever took on the part after Connery was going to be critically mauled but in retrospect he wasn't too bad - certainly no worse than any of his successors in their debuts.  I'm sure he would have grown into the part if he hadn't got cold feet and skipped town.  One of the more remarkable things about this film is its insight into Bond the person. Just little things like his obsession with Blofeld, his argument with M and his petulance when he 'quits' the service.  We also see his softer side - mementos from previous adventures and how his feelings evolve for Tracy. One of my favourite scenes is one that has Tracy rescuing Bond turning the cliche on its head.  Blofeld's men are closing ranks on Bond at the ice rink.  One shot has a look of terror on his face.  Bond has been scared before but never terrified as he is here.  It's quite a haunting image. He just sits down on a bench, capture almost inevitable, just seemingly giving up when Tracy having tracked him down, skates up to him appearing before him taking on an almost angelic form.  The ending, while not a surprise to anyone who read the book, is still one of the most moving I've ever seen. Lazenby plays it to perfection.  It would have been very interesting to see what Connery could have done with the part.  I'm not sure he could have handled the love story aspect of the story though.  Connery is Connery, Connery was never Bond - Bond was Connery.  I'm not sure Lazenby was the best choice, OHMSS really required an actor.  The ending provided Diamonds are Forever with a tantalising premise which was squandered by the film. Bond out for revenge - we got this in Licence to Kill but it really should have been with Diamonds.  If OHMSS had performed at the box office I'm sure we would have got a very different Diamonds to the jokey approach they adopted and pursued through the Moore era.  OHMSS provides a fascinating glimpse of what Bond might have become!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
373,cathytreks,One of the best James Bond Film made.,10,15 March 2005,"It's the first entry to star someone other than Sean Connery in the lead role; it's the first instance of Bond threatening to quit the British Secret Service; it's the first and only time Bond ever marries; and it's the first and only Bond issue to bring a tear to the eye. It's also the lengthiest Bond ever (142 minutes). Let's start with George Lazenby. When Connery called it quits, a worldwide search went out to find a replacement. Curiously, the producers came up with Lazenby, who had never acted before. Okay, he's a bit stiff at first and he could be set in a window to sell clothes, Which, in fact, was pretty close to his former job, a model. However, he grows on you more as the film moves along and so even more than Connery he did look and sound like the fellow the producers had wanted all along, Cary Grant. The only reason they had gone with Connery in ""Dr. No"" was that Grant's asking price was out of their range. So Lazenby looks and sounds great, although Lazenby said he was surprised during the film's premiere to find that his Australian accent had been looped. Anyway, appearance and voice aside, Lazenby wears a tuxedo well, he looks great in a casino playing baccarat, and smartly sits behind the wheel of an Aston Martin.The plot is pretty straightforward. Bond rescues a beautiful young woman, Tracy (Diana Rigg), from an attempted suicide and from a group of thugs. Her father, Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti), turns out to be a big-time crime-syndicate boss who offers Bond one million dollars to marry his daughter. Bond agrees to consider the offer if Draco will help him locate the whereabouts of his arch-enemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas), the evil head of SPECTRE, who is threatening to release a virus on the world. In the course of events, Bond romances Tracy, finds and defeats Blofeld high in the Swiss Alps, and then returns to get married. All in the line of work for a super agent. Everything in it is so good including Lazenby, and the lovely and talented Diana Rigg, fresh from ""The Avengers"" TV series, makes one of the best Bond heroines of all with her combination of beauty, intelligence, and charm. Interestingly, Honor Blackman (Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger"") was also a product of ""The Avengers,"" obviously a program noted for its strong female leads. Savalas makes a believable Blofeld for a change. Savalas takes the part and flies with it. He was perfectly evil and as malign, perhaps, more vicious, as chooses to carry out the role in a quietly sinister fashion! One of my favourite lines, ""We'll head him off at the precipice."" LOL , In addition to the principal actors, the usual supporting cast is on hand: M and Q and Miss .Unlike many of the 007 films, this one gets off to a fairly slow yet welcome start. That is, director Peter Hunt prefers to build up the relationship between Bond and Tracy before starting in on too many ski chases, car chases, bobsled chases, or avalanches. When these events do begin, though, they are among the best of their kind. The scenes in the high Alps are spectacular in the extreme!That final run down the mountain is a sure crowd pleaser. One major difference between the early versus late Bond movies is that in the earlier ones fewer things blow up. I suspect this has something to do with surround sound and the spectacular CGI effects directors can now pull off. Unfortunately so to a degree perhaps?This and that: Lazenby accompanies his transition to the part with a bit of self-deprecating humor. After losing the girl in the initial fight scene, he comments, ""This never happened to the other guy."" At another point in the story, Bond investigates his genealogy and is told that his family motto is ""Orbis Non Sufficit"" or ""The World is Not Sufficient,"" more loosely translated as ""The World Is Not Enough""; hence, the title of the much later film. The motto is written beneath the Bond family crest, which depicts three golden balls. Bond continues to crack double entendres, maybe not with the same snap or conviction of his predecessor. For instance, after the particularly bloody death of one of the villains, Lazenby quips, ""He had lots of guts."" Not quite up to form, what?...but so what, and the immortal Louis Armstrong sings the movie's love theme, ""All the Time in the World,"" which would be the last song the great jazz artist ever recorded. Finally, Q (Desmond Llewelyn) mere token appearance at Bond's wedding, tells you that this adventure is relatively free of gimmicks, gizmos, and gadgets! The director wanted to stick as closely as possible to Ian Fleming's novel and make the film more realistic than the several Bond releases that preceded it and come after....and in many ways they did! This is one of the best Bond film ever made and is memorable in the series of films.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
374,sweet_em_sexy,The Best Bond Film,8,17 February 2000,"If Sean Connery had starred in this Bond film it would have been beloved by all, but the addition of George Lazenby to the Bond index has become a cultural joke, but why? I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but I absolutely LOVE it. I sat myself down over the period of a week or so and watched every Bond movie ever made, even dragging a friend to the movie theater to see The World is Not Enough and I have come to the conclusion that this is the best Bond movie ever. George Lazenby was screwed from the beginning, which other Bond has had to run around in a kilt??? Although he isn't as sexy as Connery or even Timothy Dalton, he has a quiet intelligence that certainly Roger Moore never had in any of his 007 outings. This is the only one where Bond ever seems to have a heart and soul as he gives his love to Diana Rigg, who is absolutely breathtaking in this film, completely holding her own against Bond. When she skates up to him in the middle of film and saves him I cheered. She is stunning during the end sequence against Blofield. Smartly written and subtley written this movie truely gives Bond a heart and a vendetta to score against SPECTRE. A must see to truly appreciate the Bond. franchise",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
375,derami100,Different but not better,5,19 October 2008,"OHMSS is probably the Bond film that has discussed the most. Basically you either hate it for being different or you love it for being different. I personally have got nothing against a James Bond film that a more romance than normal (Casino Royal was great) but here I think the makers often couldn't decide which way to go.For example: Most Bond films start with a huge action sequence. Here there is an action sequence. But it is not a huge stunning scene. It's Bond saving a woman he has never seen before from an apparent drowning and than getting attacked by two mugs he has never met either. He beats them up. Cut. Maybe it is explained in the book but I felt there was no tension or suspense in the scene.Than follows a very long passage about Bond and the woman (Tracy) falling in love. Again, not a bad thing but some pieces of dialog were just not very good, which would have been fine for a normal Bond movie but I felt they were trying to get an emotional love story across but didn't have the script quality to do it.When the actual plot begins to continue it gets slightly better but I found the dinner scene really funny, for the wrong reasons. Bonds outfit wasn't so much the problem. He was there undercover so what do you expect? The women were doing their very best to seduce him and Lazemby didn't really look quite the part. For me he clearly didn't have the charisma to pull the scene off. What happens next is in my opinion even worse. Bond decides to have sex with two of the women, obviously forgetting he has spent the majority of the movie falling in love with Tracy.When he does reunite with her he shows no regret at all that he has cheated on her which would have been more realistic. The action scenes in this part (skiing, avalanche) on the other hand are amazing and really made up for the lack of action in the first 1 1/2 hours.After that I don't have any more negative points except for the last scene. The scene itself is great and LAzamby does a really good job and it is emotional but that music ruins it. The James Bond theme, in my opinion, just doesn't fit the scene.But it has to be said, I admire the producers and director for going in a very different direction with this Bond. Sadly it didn't really work out.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
376,FrankFaz,Best Bond Film?,9,28 February 2010,"For me it is. No laser beams, no ""hollowed out vol-kane-O."" Just story and solid acting.I wish Lazenby had the chance to do more films so we would have a body of work with which to judge him better. I thought Brosnan had surpassed Connery in Goldeneye, but the rest of his efforts were laughable. With two in the books, I think Dan Craig is the best, with George Lazenby second, then Connery. I have hardcovers of all the Fkeming Bond novels and I think Dan Craig is the closest yet (fat and away) to Fleming's alter ego!And how can you beat Diana Rigg as THE BOND WOMAN (he married her for chrissakes.However, I could have done without Savalas as Blofeld.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
377,zdog26,Atrocious,1,29 July 2013,"Let me say one thing before I rant. I am a giant James Bond fan. I have grown up watching the classics as well as always going to see the new ones when they come out in theaters. I have also read the books and to those who say that this Bond is close to the ones featured in the books must have been reading a very different series then I was. It took me quite awhile before I got around to this one. Holy crap, where do I begin? This was terrible. James Bond has never been more laughable and it was awful to see the greatest hero in cinematic history be destroyed. The ending was rushed and his reaction was ridiculous. The film was far too long, even for a Bond film, and was unusually boring. I didn't care one bit for the characters and the lone bright spot was Diana Rigg (Olena Tyrell!) as Tracy. I think it is safe to say that I am utterly confused at all the praise this has received. Best Bond film? Are you people out of your minds?

378,pheonix2279,One of the BEST bond movies,10,10 January 2012,"This is an absolutely brilliant Bond movie and sadly the most underrated or overlooked.I think because George Lazenby only did the one bond movie people automatically assume he was a bad bond,On the contrary he was great as bond.He made bond into a real person and not a superhero that other actors showed bond as.Diana Rigg stars the ultimate bond girl who is strong,clever,bonds equal but also she wins his heart and apart from the new Casino Royale is the only woman that bond truly falls in love with and so the audience care for her and that makes the ending the only truly sad,almost tear jerking moment in all the bond films.The action scenes were very good such as the ski chase and bobsled scenes,George Lazenby also looks very good during the fight scenes and he also briefly learnt martial arts from Bruce Lee in 1973.Telly Savalas was also great as Blofeld,Though not as truly sinister as the great Donald Pleasence,Savalas was suave,sinister and was more hands on with action so he was as impressive as Pleasence was.Overall this is a brilliant bond movie and George Lazenby was the most believable and showed bonds human side and its a shame he did not do more because this is one of if not the BEST bond movie ever.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
379,sean-devitt,We needed one more Lazenby.,7,27 November 2012,"After watching Skyfall I decided to take another look at the Bond back catalogue. OHMSS is one of those movies that truly stands out from the rest. It's the only one staring George Lazenby as Bond and the only one directed by Peter Hunt.I have heard so many conflicting stories about what happened on set and why Lazenby didn't come back that I no longer know what to believe. What I can say for certain is that these guys made a unique and valuable contribution to the Bond series. In my opinion the untrained actor Lazenby brought more depth to the Bond character in one movie than the 'other fellas' did in the other 22.There are some things that look wrong but aren't the film makers fault. For one thing Bond and Blofeld don't recognize each other when they meet. The reason was that OHMSS was written before You Only Live Twice and they decided to follow the book without acknowledging the continuity error. Another problem was that Lazenby was under pressure to imitate Connery in some scenes. His ""my name is Bond"" introduction to Tracey in the opening sequence looked forced and unconvincing. This was understandable as Connery WAS James Bond to the average movie goer and this was the first time EON made a movie without him.Lazenby was at his best when he was just being himself (just as with Roger Moore). He blew Connery (and his successors) away in the action sequences and he played the role of a man in peril very well. In none of the Connery movies was there EVER the impression that he was in any danger or that he cared about any of the women he met.There are many who say that Connery should have stayed for OHMSS but I'm glad he didn't. Connery was a great Bond. There wouldn't be 23 movies if it hadn't been for what he did in the first 5 but I doubt he could have played the love story with the plausibility of Lazenby and audiences wouldn't have accepted him being so broken at Tracey's death at the end of that movie. I think they would have changed the story to suit Connery and audience expectations of him. I also doubt they would have cast Diana Rigg opposite Connery. They wouldn't have suited ech other at all.Also it was clear as early as 1967 that Connery wasn't aging well. He seemed to add 10 years between Dr No and YOLT.Looking at OHMSS it is clear that in some scenes Lazenby is wooden. On the other hand he excels in others. Personally I think it's a shame we didn't get to see one more Lazenby Bond. Diamonds Are Forever was a terrible movie with an even older looking Connery in a comedy adventure film that almost completely trashed the legacy of OHMSS. DAF with Lazenby going after Blofeld would have made for an awesome movie in my opinion and we would have seen what Lazenby had learned from his first outing. But it was not to be and so we got the return of an old Connery who was then replaced by an older Moore.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
380,bwilson-308,The best James Bond,9,21 December 2010,"Forget all the discussion about why George Lazenby had only one outing as James Bond and appreciate this for what it is: a perfect adventure film to delight in when wanting something to relate to either in deepest winter around Christmas time or else when the weather is sunny and things are so different.This film transcends so much of the other Bond material: it has wit and humour without the cartoonishness of other films, a James Bond who is capable of tenderness unlike the brutal thug that is Daniel Craig's characterisation, a genuine central romance and tragedy which pulls at the heart strings of those who care, stunning scenery, unforgettable music and some of the most exciting action scenes in film.There are, of course, weaknesses - James Bond's exploits with the girls detracts, in my view, from the central romance and causes the action to lag. But that only contrasts with Diana Rigg's Tracey who is so refreshingly different from other James Bond girls - a genuine characterisation of a strong-willed young woman who loves James Bond intensely. It is also lovely to hear this classically trained English actress speak poetry to Telly Savalas's Blofeld.This is not cartoon mayhem. It is, of course, fantastic adventure, but it also brings characters and events that we care for and can relate to. The gadgetry is set to the side and we can concentrate more on the central action involving people in one of the most involving action films ever. My subjective feeling is that it is the very best in the series, its serious edge enhancing rather than diminishing it.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

The Bond series should have ended here before all the Moore/Dalton/Brosnan bloated pap of the following years. Why? Diana Rigg simply - THE girl of the 60's, the best girl of the spy genre in the form of Emma Peel in the Avengers TV series whose character did more for women's emancipation than anything else on screen in the 60s. Bond saves her when all has no meaning and she saves him when he has lost all hope. Yes, I know, Mills and Boon but here set in the crisp wedding white of the European Alps only those who have never loved could not be moved. Bond knows he must commit to Tracy forever or be damned for eternity. Lazenby does a good job when one considers the Bond/Avenger legacy he faced.

Despite being the sole movie to star Lazenby, he does a decent job with what was given to him and certainly would have gotten better as his tenure went along. Diana Rigg is definitely the most intelligent Bond Girl, on a par with fellow ""Avenger"" Honor Blackman. It would have been interesting if Rigg had more combat scenes.What would have been the best part would have been if the studio execs had not been quite as skittish over the running time. Nowadays, 140 minutes really isn't too long on a ""Titanic"" scale. Apparently the execs became so skittish over that so that 40 minutes were lost from the film. As anyone who's seen OHMSS knows, it doesn't feel that long. This year being its 30th anniversary, perhaps there could be a directors cut???The film is fantastic, covering many ranges of areas of movies. John Barry's scoring is also at its height.

386,john-597,"Oh dear, what happened here?",8,9 March 2000,"I read the reviews here, and saw that a lot of Bond fans quite liked it, so I opted to give it a second try. Unfortunately, I still have to say that ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is the weakest of the series. There are a few good scenes, such as the ski-chases and the climactic battle, and the storyline is OK, but the film is overlong and much of the first 40 minutes is pointless, save for Bond's meeting with Draco. Things only pick up (barely) with Bond's arrival at Piz Gloria. There's some saving grace in Diana Rigg and Gabriele Ferzetti, but these two can't save the day. George Lazenby was a brave choice, but he clearly lacks the suave brutality of Connery and the refreshing wit of Moore.OHMSS should have been a classic Bond film, but it came out wrong. Telly Savalas, although a fine actor, is terribly monotonous as Blofeld, the editing is sloppy most of the time, and the wedding scene is rather out of place. But John Barry's score is one of his best, and the shock ending is a nice, if anomalous, touch.

In addition, Peter Hunt faithfully follows Fleming's book (despite pressures from Broccoli & Saltzman to cut down the film's length), resulting in a taut story line, with terrific performances.

So I rented it and I can only say that folks had it right in 1969. Now, there are good elements to this film. Telly Savalas is a fine villain. Diana Rigg is wonderful in her turn as a Mrs. Bond. The action sequences are a lot of fun. Mr. Lazenby is another matter, however. He is stiff and unconvincing. Every time he is on the screen with Rigg, it is amazing how bad he looks in comparison. The plot and pacing is screwy. We meet Mr. and Mrs Bond to be and then James goes off to Switzerland by himself. He gets involved in a plot which takes far too long to be revealed and involves an annoying collection of Zombie Bimbos with Allergies. Sounds stupid and it is stupid. Once the action and the ski chase gets going, things are better, until Mr. Lazenby has another line to deliver. I can see what those who favor this film are getting at.

So to see the film for the first time ever a couple of weeks back really struck a poignant sad feeling at all that time elapsing and the two main stars so much older now but thankfully still alive. The other fascinating things about this film is the perceived chemistry between Bond and Tracey in the film and the real animosity that seems to have developed whilst making the movie between Rigg and Lazenby.Anyhow I'll say only this, if I had to chose a film for the most heartfelt love scenes , then OHMS's would be it. The tender scenes between Dianna and George coupled with John Barry and Hal Davids achingly exquisite' We have all The Time' brings a tear to my eye every time. From when he chases Tracey to her car and the beautiful Dianna Rigg turns around with tears streaming down her face which Bond (George) gently wipes away is just so beautiful as 'the theme song starts to play. Also although George is on the very rare occasion tad 'wooden' or more accurately self-conscious the scene in the barn as the blizzard rages outside where Tracey (Dianna ) seems to accept her lot that she cannot get any closer to James because of his occupation and says why are you still thinking about it and James (George) answers so gently that he is not he was '""thinking about us"" and then says he loves her, for me is the tenderest love scene in any movie that I've ever seen.Dianna and George's relationship is the thing that makes this probably the best Bond movie of them all and the pair of them acted it out brilliantly.

I'm currently on ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". One of the main things I noticed from Her Majesty's Secret Service is the fact that the new Bond doesn't seem to be as sexually assaulting as the previous bond ( Sean Connery). It did seem like the first Bond would like to force himself upon women which seemed a bit off, and was really off putting. For most of the previous Bond films this new Bond didn't seem as bad, but there was still a lot of this bond having his way with the women he wanted to have his way with. which I'm still not in total agreement with. I think the biggest problem I have with most of the Bond movies is really that they all follow a very very specific formula. the formula itself seems to always be James Bond shows it up at some place. He assumes a new identity. He then starts snooping around. He finds the villain, has contact with the villain. The villain finds out who he is. They then put him in a room or put him in some place that easily escapable. Miraculously, James Bond figures out a way to get out of said room which no one decided to guard and no one decided to put any additional reinforcements on. specifically they put him in a room for the gondola cables. If I was a super villain I wouldn't put somebody in the room which houses the gears which are kind of the only way to get up to said Superfortress. Well the movie is an overall bad. it's starting to really feel like I'm watching the same movie over and over again. which, if you like this same movie over and over again I could see how you would like this movie.

Despite his best efforts it's not entirely Lazenbys fault this movie was so painful to watch. Michael Reed contributed much with some of the worst cinematography of the era. The special effects, such as they were, look like something from a bad 40's film. Peter Hunt, the director who birthed the Bond legacy, must have been on drugs to even finish this thing (well, it was 1969.)The fight scenes may be the worst. They look like something from the three stooges, using the cheapest of all camera tricks: accelerate the film and jiggle the camera around to make up for lousy choreography.Telly Savalas made a decently vile villain.

Tough, Adventurous, with Heart",10,5 January 2006,"If Sergio Leone, maker of those gritty '60s spaghetti westerns, had ever made a 007 film, it would look like OHMMS. (That's a compliment.)The sixth installment in the James Bond film franchise is the most experimental of the lot. It's cinematography, with an abundance of close-ups and quasi-surreal quick-cut editing, makes it a uniquely visual movie. It even has a built-in music video for the song ""(We Have) All The Time In The World"" sung by the great Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong.The producers' most obvious experiment was casting. This is the first 007 film without Sean Connery. The coveted role went to George Lazenby, a rugged square-jawed Australian who does a very competent and believable job as the secret agent, and does a lot of athletic action never seen done by the older actor he replaced.Connery, disgusted by the Japanese paparazzi (taking photos of him in a men's room) while in Japan making the 1967 film ""You Only Live Twice"", walked away from the character that made him world-famous. Hoping to do Oscar-worthy roles with far less pop culture publicity, he swore to hang up his tuxedo and never do another 007 film. His loss. OHMSS is a great script.The time was ripe to find a new Bond anyway (in this reviewer's opinion) due to Connery's increasing loss of hair, and gradual middle-age spread. Connery should've stopped after ""Thunderball"" (in this reviewer's opinion). Yet he messed up by not doing OHMSS for it doesn't have the exaggerated super-hero space-race gadgetry that he's known to have despised about YOLT.OHMSS is a rough & tough thinking-man's espionage thriller with a lot of heart.But the film, and Lazenby, first in a long line of other Bond actors, arrived with mixed reviews. The movie-going public of 1969 were not so pleased that Connery was gone. Plus the film's running time (2 1/2 hours) scared many people away from the theaters. Their loss.A Christmas holiday winter theme in its third act, and having a real love story develop and unfold throughout the whole thing, were elements foreign to the established 007 style people expected. It isn't a Bahamas summer beachparty bikini/scuba type of film. Far from it.It's Autumn...It's Winter...It's Cold. The One Romance Noir, and The One Dark Drama, of the whole 007 canon.Oh, it has humor, enthralling chase sequences, and a great music score, and those familiar faces of M, Q and Miss Moneypenny, but it has a grim underbelly to its epic-sized bastion of cloak & dagger pursuits.And...a new Bond.Learn to live with it people. Bonds will change.Only in hindsight, as time has passed, has OHMSS received the appreciation it deserves.Lazenby, unfortunately no second outing as 007, did a job well done for Her Majesty's secret service, and he can take pride in doing an original Fleming story, and not a spy-composite new script like the Bond films since 1985.The OHMSS script was a faithful adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1963 book, a book Fleming wrote, incidentally, at a time when he already knew what a fan that President Kennedy was of the Bond books/films.Had Fleming, who died in 1964, lived to see OHMSS, he might've been very happy with the resulting film. No matter who played Bond.Of course, it wouldn't be a true 007 film without sexy girls. And decorated with a bevy of beauties, they are relevant to the plot:* SPOILER ALERT * Young female patients in a high-security Swiss Alps allergy clinic are being brainwashed. They're becoming naive pawns who'll secretly traffic pocket-sized WMDs into their homelands.It's a biological warfare scheme orchestrated by the sinister evil genius Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Bond, undercover and unarmed (no Q gadgets either), infiltrates the mountaintop complex by invitation. Masquerading as a geek-like geneologist, Bond is intent on capturing Blofeld after a two-year search for the elusive criminal mastermind.Telly Savalas (as Blofeld) is a dry macho villain, a sharp contrast to the effeminate squeaky-voiced Blofeld of the previous Bond film.Personally, I admit that for years (80s/90s) I never bothered to watch OHMSS when aired on TV. I channel-surfed away from it. But! After reading the Fleming book in '97, I suddenly and definitely was interested !finally! in paying attention to the film version. I am an OHMSS Convert thanks to a great book, and realizing what a great movie too.I envy those who saw OHMSS on the silver screen as opposed to a TV set.Note: I suggest reading Fleming's Thunderball, OHMSS, and YOLT in that order, to understand the original Blofeld Trilogy.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

And although it's true that Lazenby was not particularly impressive as the suave secret agent, OHMSS still ranks as one of the better Bond films. To begin with, Lazenby plays the role of 007 satisfactorily. I said he wasn't particularly impressive, and, when compared with the vastly superior Sean Connery, he's not. But he doesn't really detract from the film; he just doesn't add much. In any case, there are many more pros about this film. The plot is interesting and understandable. Telly Savalas is good as Blofeld, and Diana Rigg is superb as Tracy. In fact, she ranks as one of the best ""Bond girls"" that the series has ever seen. Plus, this is the only film in which Bond gets married (even if that marriage is ended in a rather ""shticky""--though also sentimental--ending sequence). No, it's not the greatest Bond film (that honor belongs to ""Goldfinger,"" in my opinion), but it's certainly vintage Bond.

I think that no matter who plays him, Bond is bond in the fiction world Bond is the same person and not a single person notices any change in him. I loved the film because it started the legacy of great action scenes. Such as the avalanche, Stock Car Races, and the awesome Bobsled fight between Bond and Blofeld.

397,plasppus,The best bond movie,10,19 December 2008,"This is my personal favorite. Don't go into this movie questioning Lazenby, if you do, you might go the way of many and automatically loathe it, and undoubtedly have trouble seeing the greatness in it. The story was excellent and had fantastic elements I hadn't experienced before Casino Royale. The bond girl is probably my favorite of all of them. The plot is great, it has far less cheesiness in it than many of the others, and it had some legitimately great comedy in it(I.E the seduction scenes at the allergy clinic). Lazenby does better than good, he was great if not fantastic. Many people think that if this movie had Connery it would have been the pinnacle of the series. I think it is regardless, however Connery would have made it that much better.If you're a Bond fan, this is a must see.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

407,the_spanner85,***** out of *****,10,10 May 2004,"An oddity within the Bond pantheon, and not just for the appearance of George Lazenby as 007, On Her Majesty's Secret Service actually manages to become the best Bond movie in the series. The plot has Bond tracking arch-enemy Blofeld (Savalas) down to a clinic in the Swiss Alps while falling in love (!) with a beautiful yet grief-numbed contessa (Rigg).What makes OHMSS stand out amongst the myriad films in the series is its attention to dramatic and emotional tension as much as to its brilliant action sequences. The reasons for this are twofold; the original novel by Ian Fleming is one of his best stories to which director Hunt rightly fought to keep the film true. The characters are fleshed-out into three-dimensional people about whom it is easy to care. This is particularly true with Rigg's Tracy. Easily the best of the Bond women, Tracy, at the start of the film, emotionally hollow because of a tragic past, attempts suicide but is thwarted by Bond who becomes something of a guardian angel for her and gives her a reason to live. The other supporting characters are equally brilliant. Savalas plays Blofeld menacingly with just the right hint of tongue-in-cheek and remains the best villain of the series. Series regulars Bernard Lee (M), Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny) and Desmond Llewellyn (Q) are all present and correct, with Lee and Maxwell in particular turning in their best performances in the roles. Also of note is Gabriele Ferzetti playing very memorably Tracy's devoted crime lord father and George Baker, appearing briefly as a College of Arms official who agrees to Bond posing as him, is excellent, especially dubbing Lazenby in the scenes where Bond pretends to be him.While the film focuses on characters more than action, there is no lack of action on show. If anything, action is Lazenby's forte. The action scenes are innovatively edited and are absolutely spectacular, from the fistfight on a Portuguese beach in the opening sequence to the climactic raid on Blofeld's clinic. The majority of the action sequences were on snow and ice, then new for a Bond film but has since featured in a number of successive Bonds.While it is the longest of the Bond films, clocking in at two hours and twenty minutes, it is one of the quickest paced Bond films and it reaches its magnificent conclusion before one realises. It is in these final minutes Lazenby finally steps out of Sean Connery's shadow to play perfectly one of the most pivotal Bond moments much better than Connery probably would have done.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

409,j_ohanley92,Criminally underrated Bond movie.,10,24 February 2005,"People pick on this movie because it's different. It's the only one with George Whatsit, the only one that runs nearly 2 1/2 hours, the only one where Bond gets married. Because of this, people automatically looks for this movie's flaws which, although minor, are quite visible. Lazenby does not have too much charisma. The fight scenes contain quite a few continuity errors, plus some are quite obviously sped up. And Blofeld's ransom demand is quite kooky and strange (he wants to be a Count). If there are some of you reading this without seeing having seen the movie prior, you will note that this does not seem like such a big deal. And it's not. Although that is not what they would have you believe. They somehow don't notice this movie's great score, great direction, great script, great acting, great plot, great characters, great action scenes, great...Diana Rigg kicks ass. Tracy is a fantastic character, an excellent foil for 007. Telly Savalas has obviously has a great time playing the head of SPECTRE, Blofeld. He has a seemingly nonthreatening demeanor, which completely evaporates once he personally gets after 007. Ilse Steppat is a fantastic actor, and as Irma Bunt, plays a role that is perfectly based off one of Ian Fleming's great characters. My only regret is that she was not given a lot more screen time. Draco is a pretty good ally, although a bit similar to Kerim Bey and too nice to be the head of an international mafia. As a side note, I loved his and M's casually exchanging stories at the end.Finally we arrive at George Lazenby. He is undeniably a fine actor, but there are problems. He lacks real charisma, and when he walks, he doesn't look exactly natural. But his dialogue scenes are comfortable and unforced. And he completely slam dunk nails the scenes that require running, chasing, and especially fighting. This is one Bond I would not like to aggravate, I tell you what. And for those of you who insist that this movie would have been better if Connery had been in it, consider this. This movie would not feature ""Alright folksh, letsh put on a show and have a good time"" GF Connery, it would feature ""I'm shick of all the presh and typecasting"" YOLT Connery. Personally, I'd rather have an enthusiastic young whippersnapper in the role.Those who say that this movie is boring obviously turned it off at the eighty minute mark. Those minutes are spent establishing the plot, and getting us attached to the characters. Some people hate things like that, but for those of us who do, we are in for a treat. Bond pretty much spends the last hour running for his life. Everyone's after him, and the resulting ski chase, village chase, stock car chase, avalanche chase, helicopter assault, and bobsled chase are absolutely thrilling. These scenes show how today's MTV, quick cuts style editing can actually be used to a scene's advantage. Instead of trying to be cool, OHMSS uses this style to elevate tension to almost unbearable levels and to make the chases completely raw and fast paced. Let things stay firmly planted in reality. There are minimal pyrotechnics and maximum good IL' fashioned stunt work. An interesting thing about this movie is that it has a strangely amateurish feel to it. This is the sort of movie that feels like the product of a group of extremely talented, but inexperienced people. Even John Barry's score is offbeat. It's use of synthesizers would be more fitting to a daring young composer. It fit's the movie's unique and strange tone. The only truly professional things about this movie are the quality of acting from Diana Rigg and Richard Maibaum's script.And I have to make a brief mention. This movie by far has the boldest and most shocking ending to a Bond film to date. I wouldn't dare spoil it in case you somehow don't know it, but On Her Majesty's Secret Service is worth seeing if you consider yourself a Bond fan at all simply because of it.In conclusion, a lot of people hate this movie because they expect to. I should know. I went into this movie, bad mood, expecting to hate it. And I did. Two years passed, and then I received this movie for my birthday. In this time, I had read many articles on how unfairly mistreated this movie was. My film tastes had matured, and I was willing to give this movie a chance. Lo and behold, I fell completely in love with it. Many other people I know have too. So pick it up again, and re-watch it if you've seen it before and hated it. You may discover that this is a better movie than you remembered.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
410,onwardsandupwards,A different change of pace........,8,27 January 2013,"By the end of ""You Only Live Twice"" in 1967, Sean Connery announced his departure from the biggest movie franchise at that time. After five films, the actor had grown tired of playing the suave and deadly secret agent and wanted to move onto other projects. Not surprisingly this left the Bond producers wondering who they were going to get to replace one of the popular male movie stars of the time.The answer came from an unexpected source. 29 year old Australian born male model George Lazenby snared the part. With no acting experience behind him (save for a few television commercials), Lazenby was a truly unknown quantity. It's been argued by many that his performance in this film wasn't up to par and granted next to Connery, Lazenby does come of as an amateur. That being said, it's not as bad as some have made it out to be over the years. He does come off as stiff in some places but again for a guy who wasn't a trained actor and with no experience behind him, it's more than a passable performance.To offset the leading man's lack of acting experience, the producers decided to cast an experienced actress and actor in the roles of the leading lady and villain. Enter Diana Rigg (fresh off her three year stint as the crime fighting karate kicking Emma Peel in ""The Avengers) and Telly Salavas (taking over from Donald Pleasance) in the role of Blofeld.Their casting proved ideal. Rigg was a trained stage actress and provided both depth and substance to the character of Tracy. Intelligent, charming and beautiful, she was also impulsive, reckless and brave. In other words, a perfect match for our hero. During the course of the film, you as a viewer buy into their passionate romance and can genuinely believe that Bond has fallen for this adventurous woman. Whether it's driving a powerful sports cougar during a high speed car chase, skiing through the Swiss Alps to evade the bad guys, quoting poetry to the main villain to distract his attention or engaging in armed combat with some henchmen, Tracy is a fully fledged character and not just eye candy with a double entendre name who is just there for Bond to woo, bed and rescue. Rigg is the film's heart and soul and turns in the best performance in the movie.Salavas provides a cool and calculating take as Blofeld. Ruthless and highly efficient, he has both the means and the skills to carry out his deadly threat. You never get the impression he's a push over and proves a deadly match for 007. Veteran European actors Ilse Steppart (who died just after the completion of this film and before it's theatrical release) and Gabriele Ferzetti also turn in fine supporting performances as Irma Bunt (Blofeld's nasty right hand woman) and Marc Ange Draco, Tracy's charismatic and charming crime lord father.The film makes great use of it's location filming. Fantastic ski chases and the fight scenes themselves are quite impressive. Lazenby lends a great physical edge to the character and quite literally throws himself into these sequence very well adding a lot of credibility. The theme song ""We Have All The Time In The World"" sung by Jazz legend Louie Armstrong is moving and used to wonderful effect during a montage of Bond and Tracy embarking on their romance. Given the movie's personal tone, it's romantic side is touching leading up to the tragic conclusion at the end of the film where Lazenby nails the last scene with effectiveness.In the hands of first time director Peter R Hunt, ""OHMSS"" is a solid and impressive debut. Quite often thought of a the black sheep in the series, this film has many fine moments and strips back many of the excessive elements that had clogged up the series. It also provided the character of Bond with a much needed human touch which was a nice change of pace. Well worth checking out for those who want a Bond film with the action and suspense but heart as well......",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Appeal for those who don't know...) was the best Bond ever! There were only two things that held this movie back... the ridiculous scene where ""Bond"" was putting away his old gadgets, probably a bit of mockery at Sean Connery, and the fact that Sean Connery had just left the role. No one gave this poor guy a chance. His lightning fast moves and slim physique made him much more fitting to the character of the books.Sean Connery was a GREAT Bond... I named my son after him... but physically, he was not a fit for Bond. He was too muscular and larger sided than the Bond of the books or George Lazenby. My hat's off to you, Mr. Connery, for your outstanding portrayal of the character. Nothing whatsoever against your acting.George Lazenby shows not only the speed and movement of a smaller framed martial artist, but also the romance and passion that many of us share.

416,kb38,Some people wouldn't know a good movie if they fell over one...,9,17 November 2008,"I saw this at the cinema when released, liked it then and it still continues to amaze me the amount of bad rap that this film continues to garner. Being a film that is not shown regularly on television, I haven't had the chance to reassess this film until recently when it was shown on a James Bond marathon on Moviepix. So how does it stack against up the rest of the franchise? Very well I'd say and like a good wine has aged very well. George Lazenby is by far the most interesting Bond and if he'd continued would have matured into a fantastic character. The only flaws in the film for me are the obviously sped up fight scenes and some rather choppy editing in places, as for the much publicized overdubbing of Lazenby's voice as Sir Hilary Bray it's not as bad as some are trying to make out and unless you've been told or are an insider it's not that easy to detect. Overall this film has everything, well paced, a good story, action, humour, plus an excellent love story interwoven, also an unforgettable theme , Louis Armstrong and a nice Christmas song from Nina. So just about the most complete Bond movie made, well worth another viewing to the nay sayers and if you haven't seen, you're in for a treat.

417,steven-44767,"The best Bond film and a fantastic film in its own right. If you're a lover of great films, give this one a go.",10,7 November 2021,"This is an absolutely beautiful film. For me it really stands out as something quite different from the rest of the franchise. There is a high artistic quality and loving care about this film which isn't present with most of the rest of the series. Outstandingly suspenseful action, some lovely introspective moments, and a beautiful romance awaits.The thing that I find truly remarkable throughout the entire film is the direction by Peter R Hunt. Every single shot is discerningly and lovingly composed, so beautiful to look at. A beautiful romantic energy permeates the experience of this film. Cinematographer Michael Reed deserves much credit for his role creating these beautiful shots as well.What's more, when the action scenes begin there is a wonderfully fierce powerful energy surrounding Lazenby's Bond and his enemies. The action scenes, including the car chase and skirmishes across the snow, have this fantastic nervous tension to them. We really feel as if we're part of the seriousness of Bond and Tracy's situation.Adding to creating the experience of this movie is the gorgeous soundtrack from John Barry. I can't overstate how it really contributes enormously here. The music on offer really feels outstanding from the rest of the series.Diana Rigg's Bond girl character Tracy is used wonderfully well. Unlike seemingly many Bond films where the girl is barely given anything to do apart from stand around half-naked, Tracy is an instrumental part of the story. She's there in the first act and the third act, and when she's absent during the middle of the film she is in our thoughts (perhaps as she is also in Bond's thoughts). We learn much about her and her family, and her character really has some kind of halfway decent development here. Bond isn't the only character who cares about her in this film either.Perhaps many people do not like Lazenby's portrayal of Bond. The reality is however is that Bond is a different character in this film compared with most of the others. He is more introspective and meticulous. Perhaps a more respectable and relatable gentleman than many other Bond films too - he has normal human weaknesses and imperfections, yet manages to remain composed whatever the situation.Telly Savalas as Blofeld is also greatly rewarding this time round. He's wonderfully charismatic and a great gentleman counterpart for Bond. His presence in this picture never gets old.As we cross the 2 hour mark the film grows a little tiresome for a short while, but there is still so much to enjoy in the composition of every shot, at the very least we can just sit back and enjoy the beauty.While in many Bond films the finale just seems to drag on and on and the film seems too long even with the standard 130 minute runtime, in OMHSS the finale carries some really powerful emotional weight. It's a seriously stressful scenario (not simply the cliche ""bad guys take over the world"") There's a lot immediately at stake as the characters are deeply personally vested in the outcome here.The pacing of the film in general is very well balanced. Introspective moments and suspenseful action very elegantly flow between each other.If you're a film lover you should give this movie a go. All the James Bond stuff aside it is a beautiful cinematic experience in its own right.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Definitely not as consistent with action and one liners as previous films. It lacks so much. Telly Savalas as Blofeld has to be the worst casting decision in film history. Where are the gadgets??

421,thomas_kelly_14,This never happened to the other fellow......Brilliant!!,9,20 October 2008,"I'll get it of my chest quickly, rather controversially this is my favourite Bond film! ANd yes I am a huge Bond fan. Nothing against Lazenby, but with a younger Sean Connery I believe this would have been heralded as the best bond by pretty much everyone.Acting/Characters (9/10): Overall I believe the acting i OHMSS is excellent, yes Lazenby does come over slightly cheesy on occasions but he does it with far more realism than Moore and gets it right on more than one occasion (The playboy scene with the cheeky smiles in Grubold's office is excellent!), but still provides the physical presence of Connery. If he'd stayed on I think he would have improved into a very good Bond.Diana Rigg as Tracy is the best bond girl and actress to take to the screen in the whole series IMO. Brilliant actress and portrays an excellently written character. Not just pathetic blonde eye candy but a head strong independent woman.Telly Sevalas IMO is Blofeld. He plays the character with a great presence and gives the impression of a suave intelligent man, but with the undercurrent of a nasty megalomaniac. Not over acted or ridiculous at any point like some of the other bond villains, but still sinister.Plot(8/10): The general idea is that Bond is still after Blofeld after all these years and by way of Tracy and Draco is using Blofeld's claim to the title of count as a way to get close to him by pretending to be a genealogist. Bond then stumbles upon a plot by Blofeld to bribe the world by threatening to release a virus across the world with the use of a group of beautiful and unknowing girls. Direction (10/10): It is a real shame Peter Hunt never got to direct another Bond. He was part of the editing and production team in all of the previous Bond films I believe(?) and shows the classic Bond traditions such as the use of the music (the cleaner whistling Goldfinger is a brilliant touch!), great action set pieces and chases including a classic ski chase and of course Bond's classic sarcastic quips, without making any of it seem over the top or unbelievable at any point. Overall an understated but excellent directorial debut, he even gets away with the biggest faux par in cinema - actors talking to the camera, so he must be pretty good!Cinematography(10/10): Brilliant use of breathtaking scenery in the alps and some excellent stylised visuals. I especially loved the opening sequence scene (pre-credits).Scenery (10/10): Not a normal point in my reviews but I had to say somewhere that Blofeld's mountain top lair in OHMSS is brilliant, maybe not as large or magnificent as his in you only live twice but it has all the classic Bond ingredients without going over the top.Music(10/10): Other than the Goldfinger theme, OHMSS has by far the best Bond music IMO. The title track is a brilliant orchestral piece written by the great John Barry rather the pop song usually used and that point, but then latter on the 'We have all the time in the world' by Louis Armstrong is used to great affect. I loved both!Essentially OHMSS is a great understated, yet magnificent Bond film. All the classic Bond ingredients without being at all over the top or ridiculous!Well Connery, Moore or any of the others never got as much flak as him so Lazeby was right, ""This never happened to the other fellow.""",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

And OHMSS is the only one other than one line follows the book almost to the letter. From Russia With Love is the next closest to the book out of the series, then Dr. No, Goldfinger and Thunderball starts the departure from the books.So when OHMSS came out I was excited because they were back to the books after being let down with You Only Live Twice which other than Diamonds Are Forever and of course Never Say Never Again where the only Connery Bond's that were not close to the books. But all of Moore's Bonds and all bonds that followed other than the name of each had no relationship to the book it was called by.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

424,wontgetfooled622,Best (and the ONLY) James Bond film ever,10,29 November 2002,"Once, at the library, I had a flashback of something my history teacher once told me.  ""Without Soviet Union, we wouldn't have had a lot of things."" Then, someone mentioned, accurately, that Bond films owe their existence to the hammer and the sickle.  Then he said, ""Pooh, the Bond FILMS!  Read the BOOKS.  They're good stuff.  The films are just bunch of women and gadgets."" So I went to look for Ian Fleming, and the title that caught my eye was On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is recognized as one of the best books in the series.  I started reading the book.  I was surprised at how slow pace and dark it was, and how Bond wasn't this confident, suave character who always knows what to do.  Sean Connery is not, I repeat, not, Ian Fleming's James Bond.  Of course, he is the best film version of James Bond, but he is too good a suave character to be Bond.  I can't imagine a superspy who'd say ""Yeesss"" as Connery does.I must say, more than anyone, George Lazenby is the James Bond of Ian Fleming's novels.  He is like Bond in the books, trying to be smooth but always somewhat unsure.  He has a command of the screen, that he isn't afraid to tell you he's there.  The biggest gripe I have about Pierce Brosnan is how he sometimes doesn't get a grip of things on set and his somewhat higher, softer voice (and also how he pumps endless rounds of automatic fire upon enemies who have a propensity for getting hit while he himself has to be missed by endless rounds of enemy fire).  Lazenby has a voice that I imagine Bond would certainly have.  I certainly don't think he was a bad Bond.  I think he WAS Bond.  The other four actors have played their versions of Bond, but Lazenby is the only believable, human, imperfect James Bond.  And his lines aren't that bad, come on.  The only poorly delivered line was, ""He had lots of guts.""  I think he should have delivered that with a bit more Connery, but that's a minor detail.The stunts are great and so is the scenery, and the only bad cinematics are in the ski scenes when they show closeups from the front.  They look very fake, but that must be forgiven for 1969 when it was made.  They did not have Handicams and they certainly did not have Photoshop to blend projected images as well as we can nowadays.  But they certainly do not distract the excitement from some of the best snow scenes in 007 films.  The ski chases which became trademark of James Bond started here.  It's funny how in the book, Bond is very worried about skiing, since he's rusty from not having skied for a long time.  The sled chase is excellent also.OHMSS is the only film where Bond drinks beer and gets married.  Which brings me up to the next point, that Diana Riggs as Tracy Draco (later Bond) happens to be perhaps the best Bond girl ever.  Without doubt, she is full of excitement and danger, not afraid to strap on a couple of skis amid gunfire and avalanche.  Certainly not a certain Natalya Simonova.  She is Bond's identical counterpart, experienced but having gotten nothing out of relationships, and quite a driver also.  She's the only Bond girl to really connect with the audience, to make herself more important in comparison to Bond, but that's part of the excellent novel on which the movie is based. Whatever happens to her touches the audience more than whatever happens to Bond (who, as we all know, will always somehow make it).  Her surprise appearance at the Christmas celebration brightens up everything in an instant, and the ending is probably the only genuinely sad scene in all 20 of the Bond films.The opening scene is great in terms of action, but I found it rather disappointing that for no apparent reason, baddies want to kill Bond.  The book does it a lot better, and it wouldn't have been much more difficult to do what the book did, although that would not have provided the proper material to introduce the new Bond with the immortal, ""This never happened to the other fellow.""  See, how it is told in the novel is he spies on Tracy as she tries to drown herself, and by this time Bond knows her.  He is spied on by Draco's men who take him in, and the rest of the story is told in flashback, with a car chase leading up to the casino scene and rendezvous, without all this fighting mysterious bad guys in between.  But I thought the opening sequence was quite good, even with the change-up.  It's just, with what proof does Bond try to rescue Tracy?  She could have been just going out for a swim.  It makes much more sense when he has already met Tracy. Yet some of the additions to the movie are good, such as having Tracy with Blofeld when SPECTRE headquarters is attacked.  It makes it that much more personal.This is my first review on IMDB, and OHMSS gets a well-deserved 10 out of 10.  Bond in kilts, hypnosis, world domination, and Blofeld's cat combine to make it a worthy experience.  Lazenby was not the best Bond, but perhaps the only real Bond.  OHMSS is easily the best Bond film, and dare I say, the ONLY Bond film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

426,heidis007,BEST BOND MOVIE EVER! (one ending spoiler in review),10,10 March 2003,"As an avid Bond fan, I believe that this is the best bond movie ever. It has all the elements that are present in the Ian Fleming novels. George Lazenby embodies all that James Bond is. Granted, many feel that Sean Connery is the best bond, but that is because he came first and was not measured up to anyone else. George was the first bond to come after Sean and had to deal with all of the comparisons. Diana Rigg is the best bond girl and the chemistry between the two of them on screen makes for a great movie. I have seen the film over 50 times (actually could be a lot more, I started watching bond movies with my father at the age of 2, and i'm only 18 now) and at the end of the movie when Tracy dies, I still cry my eyes out because I truely  feel the love the two characters had for each other. This is not only my favorite James Bond movie but is also my favorite movie in general.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
427,filmreelriley,"Perfect Bond film, perfect action film.",10,25 July 2012,"I do not understand why some people think that George Lazenby must ""suck"" because he only made one James Bond film. They assume he was a poor actor and was fired.First of all, George Lazenby was not fired. He took some bad advice and did ""Universal Soldier"" (which if you can find, it is worth watching)instead of ""Diamonds are Forever"". This is a shame, because being a fan of the Fleming novels, I thought George was excellent. Unlike others who point out his ""bad acting"", I am unable to find any point in the film in which George's acting is sub-par. Producer Harry Saltzman thought George was good enough to offer a seven picture contract to him. That is very impressive for someone who hadn't acted previously.The only mistakes of this film are made by the producers and the director. The main mistake is the dubbing of Lazenby's voice during the ""Sir Hilary Bray"" scenes, which is awful but excusable. The other mistake is the way the script was written to have Bond seduce the Piz Gloria girls just because he can,and not clearly to obtain information- as it played out in the novel. Mistakes aside, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is an absolutely excellent film. The screenplay is beautifully written and close to the novel. The casting is perfect all around (especially Diana Rigg and Gabriele Ferzetti). The action scenes are choreographed and executed very well, and George Lazenby looks more believable in a fight than Connery did, I think. The ski chase obviously stands out as one of the best chase scenes in the franchise. The cinematography and the Swiss location are perfect portraits of the novel and executed very well indeed. Some argue that the ending of the film should have appeared instead at the beginning of ""Diamonds"", but I agree with the decision to stay true to the novel. Tracy's death is a complete story arc that normally would set up the next film marvelously. Had the producers done a faithful adaptation of ""You Only Live Twice"" AFTER ""O.H.M.S.S."", (and preferably with Lazenby) then it would have made an excellent revenge film.All in all, I think that ""O.H.M.S.S."" is a perfect Bond film. I suggest that viewers watch the film without a bias as to what others say about the film or it's casting. If you have an open mind about it, I think you'll find ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" to be one hell of a good film.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
428,pierce_brosnan_o_o_7,George Lazenby makes the best 007 in the all time classic Bond movie.,10,11 August 2003,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the best of all the 22 Bond movies that have been made. Also one-time James Bond star George Lazenby made a real Bond. Lazenby's incredible physical prowess, absurd suaveness, amazing ultra alpha-male status, tremendous arrogance, classic matinee-idol handsome looks, and very cocky strut, combined with John Barry's wonderful music score, and Diana Rigg as a very, very good Bond girl, make this a truly different type of Bond.The ski chase sequence towards the end of the film where Bond is being chased, is without any question the greatest piece of film ever in any Bond movie, and any action movie in general. It is also one of the greatest sequences in movie history period.The last scene of the film is one of the bigger plot twists in film history, and by far and away the best acted scene in any Bond movie. This scene is certainly one of the more memorable moments in movie history. There have been very few endings in movie history that left an impression like this one on the people that were exiting the theatre.And as to Lazenby, it is beyond me how this guy still gets a bad rap. Of course he was marketed that way back in the early 70's after he quit the role and they got Connery back for one more film, then Roger Moore to take over from there. This of course is marketing 101, which they tried to use to explain this film making less money at the box office than its predecessors as being all because of Lazenby. Lazenby's time as Bond was basically squelched until the advent of home video. Until that time most people had completely forgotten about him. This movie had very rarely been seen on TV.
Of course, what is not said about the movie's box-office gross was that it actually grossed $64.6 million, with a budget of only $7 million (IMDB says $9 million, but that's wrong, it actually was $7 million). It was also the number 1 movie in the world for it's first 3 weeks of release, was number 1 in the UK and US for it's first 3 weeks of release. The movie set 3 different box office records in its first 3 days of release, including the opening day, single day, and opening weekend records. It was the 2nd highest grossing movie in the world of any film released in the year 1969 (behind only Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid), and was the 9th highest grossing movie for the year 1970. It was knocked out of the number 1 spot at the box office in its 4th week of release in 1970, by only Easy Rider. The net box office profit of $57.6 million($283 million in today's dollars) should show anyone it was far from a flop. And of course, in 2003 dollars its gross is $318 million. $318 million and supposedly Lazenby had no box office power.
This is in addition to the fact that the film had the worst marketing campaign of any Bond movie to this day, and that Lazenby was the only Bond that was not marketed. In fact they kept him a secret leading up to the film's release as much as possible. His face was even blacked out of almost all of the movie's posters if you can believe that. This of course was later admitted by United Artists as being box office death and a huge mistake by them. United Artists later admitted that the lower box office was all because of their stupid marketing and had nothing to do with Lazenby.Needless to say, $318 million($283 million in profits) in today's money, and on a $35 million budget in today's money is hardly a flop. It's a blockbuster mega-hit. So too was the notion that Lazenby was fired an incorrect myth. He actually quit the role before the movie was even released. By him quitting before the movie was released, there is no way that he could have been fired due to the movie being a box office failure. Also Lazenby was offered a 7 movie Bond deal, and was hand-picked by Bond producer Cubby Broccoli as early as 1966(3 years before Secret Service's release) for the role of Bond. He was also Cubby Broccoli's personal answer as best Bond when he was asked the question who he thought the best 007 was in a BBC interview years later.With all this being said, the question remains, so why now after so many people have seen this movie over the years, does Lazenby still have this bad rap even though he finishes 3rd out of 5 on most best Bond actor polls these days. And of course Brosnan, who finishes second on these polls, it should be noted that the current Bond actor has always finished higher in polls while they are currently Bond, then drop afterwards, with the lone exception being Connery.The answer is of course the usual, typical attitude that Lazenby only made one Bond movie and had no prior acting experience, and Connery came back after Lazenby for one film, then Roger Moore took over, so therefore Lazenby had to be a bad Bond. And actually Lazenby did make commercials for 3 years before playing Bond, and also had a small role in a 1965 spy movie. So actually him being a model with zero acting experience when cast as Bond is yet another incorrect myth.Never mind that the Bond producers and director of Her Majesty's all said he was a better Bond than Sean Connery, nor that Lazenby quit and turned down a 7 Bond movie offer and made the Bond producers very mad because as they said, Connery looked terrible at that age, and Moore was much worse than Lazenby for a Bond.I guess sometimes people just never can get past media statements and what is just culturally stated as being true, even if it is not. But regardless Lazenby is anything but a bad Bond, he is in fact a terrific Bond and makes the three who have followed him look pathetic. He is much better than Moore and Dalton, and he is far, far superior to Brosnan in every aspect.The film suffers mostly because of this attitude that Lazenby isn't really Bond. Well the truth is that for anyone who doesn't care that he only made one Bond movie, and who just says so what if he made one, he's Bond in this one, he is a fabulous Bond, and the movie then is terrific. It is certainly the best Bond movie, even better than the first three Bond movies.And finally, just to give Lazenby the credit he has long deserved for so long, he was by far, easily the best Bond actor ever.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
429,JackWade007,A Bond for Everyone,10,12 May 2005,"It's too bad the public's image of James Bond is of a superhuman British agent, invincible to almost any attack. However, creator of the famous secret agent, author Ian Fleming, did not at all mean to make Bond appear this way. Fleming often portrayed Bond to be very much human, enduring terror, torture, and even human emotion. Out of the twenty entries in the series, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is one of only a handful to portray Bond as a human being.Despite the usual ""Bond vs. Blofeld"" plot endured throughout the 1960's, the film highlights Bond's relationship with the beautiful Countess Tracy di Vicenzo (played by Diana Rigg),the daughter of a rich ally.While watching, you find yourself asking if Connery would ever fall in love with a Bond girl. Perhaps this is why George Lazenby's one-off shot at Bond is so important to the series. Relatively new to acting, Lazenby portrays very much an arrogant Bond, however, the ending to the film showcases yet again that just like your average joe, even a British secret agent breaks down in the face of human emotion.Sure, there's more to the movie than just this. Blofeld, played by Telly Savalas, is up to his usual tricks, this time attempting to rule the world via biological warfare. Here comes the shocker, he's using the most beautiful girls from around the world to carry out his plan. It almost wouldn't be a Bond movie without that aspect of the film. But once Bond saves the day with a bunch of cheesy-looking explosions to Blofeld's famous mountain-top lair, it's back home for the wedding.I'm not going to ruin the ending for any of you potential viewers of this classic, but it does a fine job of playing out for the general moviegoers that James Bond is not a robot, he's not a cold-blooded killing machine, but that he is capable of falling in love and becoming a ""one-woman man.""Some say that the next film, ""Diamonds are Forever,"" should have picked up right after the wedding, before Bond and Tracy drive off on their ill-fated joy ride. However, I disagree. I don't believe Connery would have been able to pull off a believable conclusion to the Bond/Tracy saga. It was a fitting finale for George Lazenby's Bond.Anyone that thinks that James Bond flicks are strictly about picking up girls, blowing stuff up, and obsessive drinking, needs to get their heads out of their respective rears and go rent this film. Although other flicks in the series do fit this mold, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" definitely does not. Heck, the ending might bring a tear to your eye, that is, before the James Bond Theme starts roaring to the end credits.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

I mean it's like immediately taking over after Christopher Reeves doing Superman or whoever else. Obviously, Sean Connery set the standard for Bond and its actors to come. Honestly to me it felt like a rough edit some scenes looked like something left out or it needed it back.

I adore everything from the opening credits to the ending (which always makes me cry, despite repeated watchings). Lazenby is a fantastic Bond, I wish he'd stayed on for at least one more movie. Only starring in one Bond is his (and probably his bank manager's) greatest regret. Anyway, back to the movie. Diana Rigg was a fantastic Bond girl - emotive as well as sexy (which is odd, usually James goes for women of lesser intellect). The plot was interesting, odd and unlikely as all the Bond plots are but well thought out, structured and written. As usual, the gadgets (and Q) are fabulous.

Telly Savalas plays a more physical Blofeld but no less evil. It's fantastic to watch the sparkle between Lazenby and Rigg. Lazenby really makes you believe that he wants to be with her forever which is what makes the shocking climax so heartbreakingly dramatic. The Film is also very strange in that it is so offbeat compared to previous entries in the series. The score is brilliant as is Blofeld's henchwomen, Irma Bunt played by Ilsl Steppat.

Even Telly Savalas was on bad form, but mostly it was down to Lazenby that the encounters between seemed to lack venom. In most of the Bond the films there would be a scene where Bond & the villain would sit and talk having tea for example, but it could always be felt that they were going to kill each other, this was lacking from Lazenby performance who lacked the subtle brutality needed for a bond performance, even Roger Moore in his increasingly silly bonds (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) had menace.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

So they chose 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', Ian Fleming's most engaging book to be their next film. And to say that it is faultless and beautiful is an understatement.The reason why many disregard this film is due to Lazenby's performance. After Connery established the role and brought it it's fame, a low key ex-car salesman from rural Austrailia didn't seem a particularly inspired choice, they couldn't be more wrong. George Lazenby gives an extremely credible and superb performance, through the fast paced action and into more moving, sad scenes, Lazenby is near faultless in his approach to the role and brings Bond down to earth, from the hollow volcanoes and spaceships of YOLT. Another strong performance comes from Diana Rigg. Finally a Bond girl that ISN'T one dimensional. Rigg's character Tracy is a classy, stylish and intelligent match for James Bond, and for once, Bond feels he is in love.Blofeld (Telly Savalas) is for once out of his grey pyjamas and into the action, and manages to shake of the often spoofed carnation of himself (Played By Donald Pleasence) in the previous film and is a competent, suave villain, much missed since Largo in Thunderball.Combine a strong cast with the best Fleming book written and add stunning cinematography and the brilliant score, with 'We Have All The Time In The World' from Louis Armstrong and the deep, sinister synthesiser theme from John Barry, as well as great sets, such as Blofeld's mountain-top lair, Piz Gloria, then include the magnificent action sequences as well as the way the film ends, you have the ultimate Bond film. It's a shame Lazenby left afterwards and became a one hit wonder and that Diamonds Are Forever, albeit fun, is not a patch on this film and forgets this film's events as if Lazenby's Bond shamed the series. The events of this film will not be remembered until 1981's 'For Your Eyes Only', when director John Glen (Editor on OHMSS) celebrates the lost Bond film one last time. *****",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

This film strays from the formula of high camp in favor of ingenuity on Bond's behalf.  Dianna Rigg, being both physically attractive and emotionally strong, gives one of the best performances for a Bond girl, and Telly Savalas gives a strong portrayal of Blofeld (it's nice to see Blofeld out on skis with his henchman, rather than sitting back and stroking his cat throughout the whole film).

440,nickviner2000,Retrospective classic,9,9 September 2006,"Bond films are perfect material for heated debate, but few yield more arguments amongst Bond fans and film lovers then the sixth entrance in the series, On Her Makesty's Secret Service.Remembered for a number of things (including one of the most shocking and downbeat endings possibly of all time) it is chiefly noted for being Austrailian former male model George Lazenby's outing as 007.Story aside, opinion of the film will always lie chiefly in one's opinion of Lazenby's portrayal of Bond. In my opinion, faced with the unenviable task of following on from Sean Connery, in many people's opinion the definitive Bond, Lazenby makes a thoroughly creditable job of it, concealing a thick Austrailian accent with a generally convincing British, showing a nice line in dry humour and surprising pathos at the end - most impressive however is the physicality that won him the role. Lazenby moves very well in the film, making himself very believable in the action sequences.Those action sequences as well stand as some of the most consistently outstanding in any Bond film. The location work is fabulous, particularly round the stunning Piz Gloria in the Swiss alps which serves as Ernst Stavro Blofeld's base of operations. The opening fist fights between Bond and various heavy's are excitingly shot (albeit with noticeably speeded up film) and John Barry's score is perfect. The much lauded ski chases are simply the best in any film - former Ski Champion Willy Bognor truly is a genius of his craft.As for the cast - Diana Rigg makes a wonderfully engaging Bond girl - as the only girl to truly win Bond she is very convincing - I have never understood the criticism that there is a lack of Chemistry between the two.Telly Savalas puts in a surprisingly good turn as Blofeld - a complete contrast to Donald Pleasance's wonderfully camp portrayal, Savalas is a physical presence, managing to convey wonderfully charming menace.Gabrielle Frazetti puts in a great turn as Tracy's father, crime syndicate boss Draco - bringing a great sense of warmth and humour to a character that could have been an awful stereotype.Last credit I feel has to go to Peter Hunt - one of the sadly forgotten heroes of the Bond franchise. His editing work on the early films is unparallelled - and here he shows himself to be a terrific and sadly underused director.All in all, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a terrific film, with great pace and excitement, a good cast and a great score.

I did think the line delivery was a bit stale from time to time, but the action scenes are solid, the love scenes are passionate and the plot is awesome. It almost adds to the enigma of this movie that Lazenby never made another Bond film. I read somewhere once that he, upon completing the film, sailed around the world hoping to reap in his celebrity status when he returned. Well, he did, and Connery had made Diamonds and the rest is history.Number two, Diana Riggs... so f**king hot. Dude if I had a time machine, i would go back in time to 1969, get her unbelievably stoned and f**k the s**t out of her for mad hours. Too hot.And three, the plot of Bond getting married and his new wife getting murdered in his hands....Remarkable. The first time I saw that, I almost cried. I swear to god.

443,dcerminaro,Not watchable,1,3 April 2007,"There is a reason Lazenby was Bond in only one film. The plot, the acting, the lack of Q. There are so many reasons to dislike this film. This is definitely the worst of a very good series of films. The one redeeming quality of this film would be Telly Savales. he does a decent job as Blofeld. This movie seemed to run way too long, to the point where falling asleep an hour into it is a definite possibility. The only other Bond film I can compare this to would be the Sean Connerys awful comeback as Bond in ""Never Say Never Again"". I know Sean Connery made other Bond films after this one. He had the good sense to not be placed in this dog.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Lazenby is efficient as Bond and every one else is outstanding watch it again you might be surprised.,On Her Majesty's Secret Service
445,stuhannaford,A good book doesn't make a good film. A poor reputation doesn't make a cult classic.,4,25 November 2013,"Let me start by saying that the first time I watched this film I was a young, impressionable lad. Sat with my dad, both huge fans of Bond films, I remember the old man saying, ""It's rubbish,"" just before it started. I agreed. In the years that have gone by, I have seen many a review claiming it to be a classic, and one of, if not the best Bond movie ever made. Had I been a little to swung by my fathers words? I thought I'd give it another go after receiving the collection on BluRay. Alas, I feel I might have been a little too hasty in believing that it was rubbish... it is absolute garbage.The reason why this is considered a classic? The book. Now when I say I am a Bond fan, my knowledge lies with the movies, not with the novels. From my understanding, the book upon which this film was based is arguably Fleming's finest work. I will not contest that as I have never read it. However, the feeling that this fact simply means that the corresponding film must therefore also be the best is a ridiculous argument. A good book, simply does not mean a great film. This applies directly to OHMSS.I believe this film follows the book almost to the letter, something other Bonds have not done. As such it is considered a faithful adaptation and Bond himself acts a little more Fleming Bond-like. Again a reason suggested that it is the best one of the bunch.Lazenby... there is a very good reason he is considered the worst of the Bonds, he cannot act. Now whilst Bond movies have had a tendency to allow the odd cardboard actor slip through the net, they are usually bit parts or more often than not, the girl at the centre of James' affections. 007 himself has enough about him acting wise to make him the undisputed star of the show. Each actor had his own style, George unfortunately forgot to bring any with him. Now Connery may have given up on at least attempting an English accent fairly quickly, but at least it was British. Lazenby just does not sound British in the slightest. His delivery is dull, his presence is wooden and most of all there is zero believable emotion from him in what is often quoted as the most emotional of all the Bond story lines. His lack of experience is apparent. He just doesn't hold his own on screen, you simply don't feel anything from him apart from a lazy, nonchalant bowling around the set. If nothing else, we know Bond is a connoisseur of the worlds finest things, intelligent, resourceful and a man with a ruthless streak should it be needed. George instead gives off the impression of a petulant numpty school boy who wouldn't look out of place in a rugby pub with a copy of Playboy in one hand, a pint in front of him while pinching the barmaids bum. His chemistry with every girl is cringe worthy. In the end you find yourself questioning why all these girls are throwing themselves at him... it certainly isn't his personality. An unbelievable performance from start to finish, and not in a good way. You simply cannot have a great film, without a great lead.Story... the book might be something quite special, but there are times in the film when you really do just have to question, who let that get into the final cut? There are a number of odd scenes where the screenplay seems to have just had pointers such as, 'Insert random fight scene.' A prime example being the initial scuffle on the beach where for no apparent reason a number of henchmen just set about Bond. It is also worth noting that for some reason, Bond is now almost a superhero with other worldly strength. It certainly wouldn't have surprised me to see him volley an on rushing attacker 30 yards through the air. His strength is just plain silly at times and makes the action all a little bit cartoon like. Of course, that is when there is any action at all. For a Bond film it is more than a little light on the ground.The LOVE interest... his blossoming relationship with Rigg's character (who I might add is one of the films redeeming qualities) is again just so far fetched. He randomly meets her the first time as shes flies past him by car leading to the beach scene. Again, bumps into him at a blackjack table. Then he is offered her hand in marriage by a less than legitimate businessman who he becomes best pals with. Now she might save his life once, but during the course of the courtship he happily beds a couple of women flung at him and then is overcome with devotion... again, it is just so unbelievable. He is rescued in pretty much every Bond film by a girl at some point but doesn't find himself on one knee each time. Odd. His emotion during the final scenes for the love of his life is, well, awkward.Blofeld... Savalas doesn't come out of this shining, but you would be hard pushed to suggest he is a weak link. However, the really confusing aspect is the massive continuity error regarding Bond meeting him and the two not recognising each other even though they had come face to face in You Only Live Twice. Now the argument is that that is how it happens in the book and it's timeline... that's fine, but why not change that aspect to remove the huge error? It just doesn't make any sense.I could go on and on, and have already, but this film is only for die hard Bond fans that want to watch each and every movie, regardless of quality.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

Bond films are action, thrillers and spy movies not romantic films if i wanted to watch a full round of dating id watch that kind of film. Diana Rigg is a great actress and if her part had been written without the crazy edge she would have been a great bond girl. Telly Sevalas again a great actor but cast as the wrong character in the wrong film. And then you have George Lazenby, despite this being his first real role apart from commercials and an Italian Bond spoof, almost pulls off the caring, sharing lovable hero. But this of course is not what we wanted to see. It is the scripts focus on the romance and the many flaws in said script that that ruins everyones performances.

449,harry-forrester1,Quite Good. Mixed Feelings.,7,4 February 2007,"Quite good. I definitely have mixed feelings about the movie. Some bits i liked and other bits i didn't. Firstly, Lazenby's performance definitely wasn't great but not as bad as I had heard. I actually quite enjoyed watching him, and it didn't really bother me that he was quite false and unrealistic.One aspect that I really disliked about the film was the Blofeld character. In previous Bond films, (From Russia With Love, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice) Blofeld has been a very secret character. Until You Only live Twice, we didn't even know what he looked like and all we saw of him was his hands as he stroked his white cat. In this film I felt we saw too much of him. They changed the actor, he no longer sports a menacing scar down the side of his face, his accent changes to American and instead of being the villain that sits on his chair and orders dreadful deaths, he's wrestling with Bond on a Bob Sleigh at the end. He just isn't evil enough.I must admit, I did enjoy the ending. It was very powerful for a Bond film and it was done quite well. Bond's reaction to his wife's death wasn't exactly believable, but sad all the same.The skiing scenes were very well done and I enjoyed watching them and despite the criticism of the film, I definitely enjoyed it. One point I would like to make would be I personally thought that the film should have been named 'We Have All The Time In The World' as it was said quite a lot and the theme tune is named that.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
450,jim-459,One of the best!,10,14 March 2005,"OHMSS is one of the best Bond movies and is immensely underrated.When this movie was released, it wasn't like today where we are used to different faces playing Bond. In 1969, Connery was Bond. And the public could not deal with someone else playing the character, no matter how good they were and the film suffered commercially for it. Sadly, it is a stigma that has remained with the film until today.George Lazenby was an excellent Bond (and far better cast then Moore). Even Cubby Broccoli said that if George had stuck with it he probably would have been the best Bond. He had the look, the manner and was excellent in the action scenes. He had the same sort of charisma that Connery had. I think that Diamonds Are Forever would have been a far better movie with Lazenby. But it was not to be.Now onto the movie itself. OHMSS is one of the darkest Bond movies, along with From Russia With Love, For Your Eyes Only and Licence To Kill. It is a real spy thriller, as opposed to the previous two Connery films which were a bit lighter. The plot revolves around Bond's continued hunt for SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who is up to another of his schemes. This time Blofeld is played by the excellent Telly Savalas.The main Bond girl, the most important Bond girl in the entire 20 movie series, is played by the beautiful Diana Rigg. The other girls aren't bad either. Bond probably has more women in this film then any before it.This movie also has some of the best stunts in any of the 007 movies. How many other movie makers have used explosives to cause a 2 mile wide avalanche? It is one of the most jaw dropping scenes in any Bond film. As always the Bond stunt men go above and beyond the call of duty.If you haven't seen this movie because Connery or Moore are not in it (and I know thats a lot of you) you are missing out. This is easily one of the best Bond movies, and the finale is one of the most important moments in the series. Lazenby is a great Bond and its just a shame he didn't stick around (I have no doubt that if he had only stuck around for one more 007 movie, the public would have warmed to him and he probably would have ended up doing 7 movies and would be known as one of the best Bond's alongside Connery). If you're a Bond fan and have not seen this movie, see it immediately!",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
451,kingwilliamv_2002,George Lazenby IS James Bond.,10,3 June 2002,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service, is without question the best James Bond movie ever made.  As good as Goldfinger is, it's no competition for OHMSS, when it comes down to what Bond is the ultimate Bond.OHMSS has the best sound track of any Bond ever, the best villain, which is Blofeld, played by the best Blofeld, Telly Savalas, the best Bond girl ever, Diana Rigg, the best ally ever, Draco, the best villain organization in the Bonds, SPECTRE, and of course, yes George Lazenby.The plot includes Bond getting married, and the ski chase scene is the greatest action sequence not just in any Bond movie, but in any movie ever. The OHMSS theme written by the great Bond composer John Barry plays during the  ski chase scene with perfect synchronization in line with the film. Lazenby delivers the famous one-liner, ""He had a lot of guts"", with a style none of the other 4 Bond actors could ever match.OHMSS even has a surprise ending, which is extremely unique in the Bond series.  From the opening titles sequence in which a wonderful display of beautiful women, set against the best background design ever seen in a Bond, and the introduction of OHMSS's theme, or more correctly Lazenby's theme as Bond, which is the best Bond title song as well, OHMSS is easily THE DEFINITIVE BOND CLASSIC OF ALL TIME.And George Lazenby IS James Bond.  If you have not seen OHMSS, and have heard the constant rumors about Lazenby lacking as Bond, and therefore have ignored OHMSS, then you must not listen to that and see this film.  You are denying yourself from seeing the best Bond ever.  Not just fans of Bond, but anyone will be impressed with the ambition of OHMSS and it's broad and epic scope.  And as far as George Lazenby goes, he was and always will be, without any doubt THE GREATEST James Bond ever.  Soon enough, both OHMSS, and Lazenby, as they stand the test of time, will both go down in history in their rightful place as the greatest Bond movie and actor of all time.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
452,shleepy,Best Bond Film - Great Cinema,10,17 March 2008,"Of all the Bond films OHMSS is in a league of its own. Arguably the best written, directed, edited, scored and acted.Sure George Lazenby isn't Sean Connery, but after Connery's lackluster efforts in Thunderball and You Only Live Twice that's not a bad thing. I remember once seeing OHMSS at the cinema for a Bond Festival and when Lazenby delivered his ""This never happened to the other fella"" line it brought the house down. Also, watch out for the scene near the end of the film where Bond throws Moneypenny his hat. Lazenby handles this moment beautifully and treats us to a depth we never got from Connery.And the rest of the cast are outstanding. Diana Rigg, the most independent and complex Bond girl. Telly Savalas, a genuinely threatening Blofeld. Gabriele Ferzetti, the corrupt yet heart-warming Draco. Even the Angels of Death are spot on - Angela Scoular in particular is a standout as Ruby.A beautifully structured script. The central plot and subplot intersect perfectly. Top shelf action sequences combining with a haunting tale echoing the dying dreams of the sixties. Not just the best 007 flick, but a great piece of cinema.

This movie packs in so much action that the viewer barely even notices Sean Connery's absence. Not only that, this movie also boasts the best Bond girl ever, Diana Rigg, and one of the best songs, Louis Armstrong singing ""We've got all the time in the world."" In an ironic twist, George Lazenby, an Australian, wears a kilt in this movie, perhaps in an attempt to make good old George seem more like Scotsman Connery. In the end, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the ""romantic"" Bond film, and I just can't imagine Bond's role here being played by Sean Connery, or anyone but George, for that matter.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

457,vogetisameer-162-543510,Arguably the best bond film ever made,9,17 September 2011,"OK, I own a DVD of this and i have seen this some 20 times on DVD. Frankly, i went to the store to get a DVD of Moonraker but ended up buying this one as Moonraker was not available, as per the store owner this was far better than Moonraker.I thought he is joking as moon raker has space,a super villain,JAWS,A fight in Space etc. Previously, i had seen a bit of OHMSS in star movies and could not understand a thing on what was going on and i made an assumption that this would be the worst bond movie ever made.But, on a good Friday evening , i was alone at home and was tired after a days work.I decided to watch this one for some relaxation. And, i was so impressed that i watch it even today if i get free time.Now,I will Discuss the points that impressed me.After Watching Thunderball and You only live twice people will get an idea on why Connery was so unhappy with the role of bond.James bond started with a gadget less Dr No(Bond only gets a Walter PPK),From Russia with Love(Bond only gets a Suitcase).Goldfinger and Thunderball started a dangerous trend which made the franchise a Financial Success. These films were loaded with Unbelievable Gadgets like the Breath holder,Jetpack,Radioactive detectable capsule,Industrial Laser.Till a point this was acceptable, but You only live twice converted the franchise into a circus where :- 1.)People die like insects 2.)There is a super villain who always escapes at the end 3.)Bond will get gadgets which can defy even God 4.)Bond Lives twice. 5.)A super villain willhave a Henchman with superhuman strength.It's a compulsionThis was a complete departure from The original novels which were Far more Psychological and emotional.Even the producers got the hint that the series was heading into the wrong direction.So they decided to go back to the basics and stick to the original content rather than tweaking it for commercial purpose. Thus we had1.)A more real and Human James bond 2.)Belivable villains 3.)Bond is not depicted as a Superman but a vulnerable person 4.)Extraordinary Natural Locales rather than Artificial erected Sets 5.)Neck braking chases 6.)More focus on bonds personal life and feelings 7.)Emphasis on Tension,realism rather than never ending Fights 8.)Strictly No Gadgets(There is no mission in this film,bond pursues his own agenda)OHMSS fits the bill for the above points.But unfortunately Connery left the series and a new bond was required.George Lazenby was selected to play the part after the producers saw a billboard of him.Frankly, Lazenby did a decent job as James Bond if you consider the fact that he had no prior acting experience.He had the looks and personality.He was more athletic,more physical,more aggressive and was 10000 times better than the Old uncle Roger Moore.Please don't compare George Lazenby with Connery.Poor guy got criticized because he was not like Connery.Sadly, he did only 1 film as bond. Had he done more films as 007, he would have surpassed Connery as the bestThe effect of Sean Connery as bond was such that people wanted to see Connery but were little interested in the character of James BondTelly Savalas is the most menacing Blofeld of the series and far better than Donald Pleasence of you only live twice.Diana Rigg is good as bonds love interest.I liked the context of the film because :- 1.)It was far more believable and enjoyable. 2.)The swiss alps never looked so beautiful 3.)Ski chases never looked deadly than this 4.)Bond's escape from Blofeld's clinic is terrificly filmed 5.)Editing is top notch 6.)Cinematography was Excellent 7.)Fights were extremely physical and bond hardly uses his PPK in this. 8.)More artistic elements like a little cute song ""We have all the time in the world"" and the tremendous Background score from the great john Barry 9.)We get to know more about Bond and his personal life which raises a sympathy for the character. 10.)There are no trademark Henchmen of the villain. 11.)The film was more dark and seriousTechnically, OHMSS was far more polished and flawless for the times when it was released.But the film has some loopholes as well. The Length and pace of the film suffer at times.Even though Bond and Blofeld have met each other before, Blofeld never recognizes bond on his own.But plot loopholes are very few and in fact negligible.When released, this film received mixed reviews and people and fans were not ready to accept a new actor playing bond.But the film was a Resounding financial success.Over the years, this film acquired a cult status and many critics consider this as the best film of the seriesSadly, The franchise went to the tried and tested formula of gadgets and super villains after this Coming to Moonraker and OHMSS, Moonraker is good for a 1 time watch but OHMSS still catches my attention and in fact any true bond fan will love it.Watch this, You will not be disappointed",On Her Majesty's Secret Service

What I might have seen of the edited version of OHMSS though didn't leave a lasting impression on me. Frankly I cannot really say for sure how much the movie lost by the cuts, or whether it just got better with age, or whether I didn't pay enough attention to it, but anyway:Today for the first time I have seen the full 140 min version of OHMSS and I am overwhelmed of how good this movie is. I only started to read reviews of it after I saw it, and I am satisfied that so many people like it, many are ravished by it (so I am I). It seems OHMSS has almost turned into some sort of cult movie. Don't want to repeat much what has been written numerous times, I agree with some of the most positive reviews here.I just wanted to add that I am Swiss born in 1967 and now live in the 'Bernese Oberland'. So I am very familiar with the Swiss filming locations and also some of my earliest memories must be from around the time when OHMSS was filmed, so some scenes of OHMSS could have been in a family movie - like the bears in the 'Bärengraben' in Bern (which nowadays is an enlarged naturalized bear park), or a VW beetle with snow chains and a skis on its back, etc. Therefore apart from that I now consider OHMSS to be the best JB movie of all times I have also put OHMSS onto my personal favorite movies of all times list.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
462,Gogreenconcept,Very confused by many of your reviews...,2,18 May 2013,"First off just wanted to thank all of you for writing reviews to so many movies. This is my go site making you guys my go to people in determining if it's worth my while to watch a movie or not. Much respect and most thankful. However I was SO blown away with the majority of your reviews on this movie I specifically joined to write my own. (Yes that makes me a user up until this point, lol, and I am actually sorry I've given none of the contributions you all have). My girlfriend and I are Bond fans from the few movies of his we've seen so we decided to buy them all and watch start to finish, first one to the last, and came upon this one. After seeing it and being weirded out and almost disgusted I came to this (my go-to site) to check reviews thinking you'd all agree with our take on it. How in the world did some of you say this was the ""best Bond film of them all""?! Even more confusing is how so many of you gave praise to it saying what a great Bond movie it was. The change from Sean Connery was upsetting but we we're ready knowing there was a change and would be more changes to follow. But the identity of Bond himself, how he acted, who he was, how he carried himself (mostly with women) was COMPLETELY different from all the five movies before! Not to mention, the content and context of so much of the movie was changed in an non Bond way. The movies that introduced us to Bond and created who he was! I'm sorry but as far as I'm concerned if you loved this movie and felt it was the best, or one of, Bond movies than you can't be a fan of any of the others!From the first Bond movie going you in knew and excpected a few things which made you love it: Very cool action scenes, an easy to understand plot start to finish, a lot of fun to watch, many pretty girls with whom Bond had fun with while they fell in love and he moved on, respectable special effects (even for the early ones), new exciting spy tools, and most of all an entertaining 2 hours. This movie moved away from most of that. Not by changing who Bond was but changing his identity and the flow of the movie. Plot went back and forth with delayed signs as to where it was headed. Bond, who at this point was unnatainabe is in a common setting for him being around many women, fell in love so deeply that the girl almost seemed to have control over him. And this not even half way through the movie! The player of all players who flirts naturally every time he talks was now portrayed like a boy who had relations with a girl for the first time. Love? Marriage? Three quarters of the way through the movie the whole plot turned into him chasing her captors! What happened to the man of all men un-phased by any dangerous mission or circumstance he was in who spent time with random beautiful women for companionship in-between missions?! How does the playboy go from rescuing the world to rescuing a woman he just slept with?? In conclusion so I don't spoil things in the movie for other fans, we just missed the overall fun you get with typical Bond films. Nothing confusing, no drama from relations or relationships, just a laid back action film with boisterous music and charismatic villains. He this review is helpful to some and not offensive to others. If I didn't have the respect I do for your rating other movies I wouldn't have taken the time to bring my issues to attention. I truly hope this style bond ends with the departure of this Bond actor. Maybe that's why Connery comes back for the next one and the role is properly passed on afterwards.

465,jmn7-6-555472,The Best Bond Movie ever made?,10,15 October 2015,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (OHMSS, for short) was released in 1969, and was the sixth film in the Bond series. It was also the only Bond movie to star Australian newcomer George Lazenby as 007 (at 29, the youngest actor to play the character). It's also my favourite of the James Bond movies, and one of my favourite films in general.Before I review the film, I'd like to get two misconceptions out of the way:1. The film was a financial disappointment - Actually, OHMSS grossed $80 million worldwide, making back almost 10 times it's budget. So while it certainly made less money than some of it's predecessors, it was still one of the ten highest grossing movies of 1969, and the most successful movie released in Britain that year. It's also been one of the highest-selling Bond movies on DVD and Blu-ray.2. The movie was a critical disappointment - Looking back, OHMSS did get somewhat mixed reviews. However, since the 1980s (when the Bond movies were first released on home video) the film has been critically reappraised, with many regarding it as one of the best of the series. Not only does OHMSS consistently place highly in lists ranking the Bond movies (AskMen, Rolling Stone, Rotten Tomatoes, Time Out and WatchMojo have all placed it in their Top 10), but several film directors also cite it as a personal favourite: Steven Soderbergh has penned an essay about his love for it, and Christopher Nolan has admitted it was his chief inspiration for the skiing sequences in Inception.So why is this movie still divisive? Well, for starters, there's George Lazenby. To be fair, George isn't as bad as legend would have you believe. Given his acting inexperience (he was previously a model who had done some TV commercials), he actually gives a solid performance as 007. In fact, his inexperience comes in handy: while Sean Connery's Bond always seemed indestructible, Lazenby feels more vulnerable, and a little unsure of himself, which feels more like the Bond of Ian Fleming's original books. Plus, he has two advantages: the loving and the fighting. Lazenby is actually a pretty good romantic lead as Bond, which helps to make his love story with Tracy so believable. That's primarily why I'm glad Connery didn't make this movie - you can't really imagine his Bond falling in love. And then there are the fight scenes - while Connery could beat bad guys up, Lazenby's punches carry much more of a visceral impact, and his fights are some of the most savage in the series (until Daniel Craig came along).But enough about George: the rest of the movie is great on its own. The script is intelligent, focusing more on the characters than the gadgets (of which this movie has very little), the direction and editing is truly ahead of it's time, and the cinematography is utterly gorgeous. Also, the musical score by John Barry is among his very best, and Louis Armstrong's song ""We Have All the Time in the World"" might be one of the best love themes for anything, ever.Then there's the villain. While Donald Pleasance was certainly creepy as Blofeld, he also lends himself to parody quite easily, and you can't imagine him actually doing much against Bond in an actual confrontation. Telly Savalas' Blofeld is much more of a man of action, and even gets a great fight with Bond in a bobsled run. Plus, I quite like the idea of Blofeld as a snob, obsessed with having his official title recognised. Sure, he probably should have asked for a ransom as well as a pardon for his past crimes, but God knows he's probably rich already, given that he's the former head of SPECTRE.Lastly, there's the Bond Girl: Diana Rigg as Tracy di Vicenzo is surely the best of all of Bond's leading ladies. She's beautiful, intelligent, and sophisticated, but also kicks a lot of ass: she skis brilliantly, drives brilliantly, and spikes a henchmen to death. So why isn't she more widely remembered? Because she doesn't have an iconic swimsuit scene or a silly name. Regardless, she's the best Bond Girl. And if you don't trust me, trust Bond: he married her.So yeah, I love this movie to death. It's got a compelling story, amazing action (the skiing sequences are still astonishing), excellent characters and a genuinely heartbreaking ending. Is it perfect? Probably not, but no Bond movie is flawless. All a Bond movie should be is entertaining, and in my opinion, OHMSS is a blast, from the opening gunbarrel sequence to it's shattering climax.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
466,Sexy_Girl_yea,"A Brilliant Bond Film, And A Huge Financial Success",10,15 September 2005,"This is a brilliant Bond film. Peter Hunt, who directed this film set out to make the best Bond movie ever, and he did. This film is often criticized as being the worst Bond film and a financial failure, and as having the worst Bond actor ever, George Lazenby. These sentiments are truly completely wrong. First of all, this is the best 007 movie ever made. It has the best cinematography, the best score, the best Bond girl ever, played by the super lovely Diana Rigg, the best story and plot in the history of the Bond series, and one of the best action sequences in film history, Bond's escape from Piz Gloria at night. Telly Savalas is also one of the best Bond villains ever. This is the best directed Bond film of them all. Also the views that George Lazenby was a bad Bond are very off base. Lazenby was an excellent Bond, a very capable and aptly picked replacement for Sean Connery. He was big, strong, tall, dark, and beautiful, and he was outstanding in the action scenes and fight scenes. He was actually the best Bond by quite a fair margin in the action and fight scenes. He also gave the most humanistic and natural version of Bond to date. He may not have been Connery for animal magnetism or charisma, but he was better than the 3 Bonds that followed him. And the constant notion amongst the public and constant stating by the press that this is the only Bond movie to flop are totally incorrect. It performed poorly compared to the previous 3 Connery Bond films in the US, grossing about half what they did domestically, but that was the peak of the entire franchise history financially. The main reason it performed less well in the US was the terrible press it got from the New York media, while it was being shot. Despite this, it was still however, one of the top 3 films in the US for 1969 releases.Nonetheless, this film actually had more ticket sales outside the US than either You Only Live Twice or Diamonds Are Forever, the two Connery films that surrounded it. It is number 2 in gross worldwide for all 1969 films, and only passed when Butch Cassidy was re-released in 1974, it was number 1 on initial run, the number one film in the world at its time. In today's money the film grosses well over $400 million, hardly a flop. It also is the highest earning Bond film in terms of profits against costs after only the early Connery films before it and Diamonds Are Forever and Live and Let Die after it, having grossed $87.4 million worldwide, and only costing $7 million to shoot. So I know you have probably heard all the bad things about this film, and been told not to see it. But I tell you to ignore all of that, because this is a classic, and it really is a remarkable film. And the views that it is bad because of it being a flop are simply totally wrong, it was a huge success. That it is bad because Bond gets married are wrong, because it has the best story. That it is bad because there is not enough action are wrong, it has the last 1/3 of the film as probably the series all time peak for action. That it is bad because Lazenby is terrible, well that is wrong because he was actually a very good Bond. Even today, other films are trying to match this one for score, scenery, plot, and those amazing ski scenes. Overall best Bond movie ever, and George Lazenby was a fine 007. Peter Hunt accomplished his goal.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
467,wrld,Film-making at its best!,10,12 September 2005,"I grew up watching Bond films and they have been a great influence in my life. Yet even though I am a huge Bond fan I never bothered to watch On Her Majestey's Secret Service until recently. I guess I just figured that it was a dud since I heard little about the movie and anything that I remembered hearing about it was sort of negative. After seeing it for the first time I am amazed at discovering what to me is a new classic of Bond films.I cannot imagine why this film is not hyped more for the greatness that makes it unique among Bond films. I am the type of Bond fan that looks at Sean Connery as the ultimate Bond. I will take Roger Moore as Bond but never enthusiastically and while I had good hopes for Pierce Brosnan, he never made an impact on me with his dated hairstyle and ridiculously commercial fluff Bond movies. To me Pierce Brosnan in The Thomas Crown Affair is closer to the Bond vibe than any of his Bond films.Now when I saw George Lazenby rescue the Diana Riggs character Tracy in the beginning of OHMSS I was immediately hooked. The guy has the perfect body for Bond and was tough as nails in the first fight scene that set the movie up perfectly. I thought that the line referring to, ""the other guy"" was a very cool and charming way of setting the tone of Lazenby's character.The direction was great and the script was tight. I liked Diana Riggs, Telly Savalas and especially the Italian guy who played Bonds ally. He was awesome! My only critique would be of the voice over which was sloppy at times but nothing that would get in the way of my enjoyment of the film.The final scene at the end was very emotional and a great example of the range that Lazenby brought to the Bond character. (I will never forget the look on Blofeld's face as he drove by.)All in all I would have to say that watching this movie for the first time in 2005 makes me wonder about the future of the Bond series. It seems that all the great Bond movies were made in the 60's. Who will come close to capturing the hauntingly beautiful essence of John Barry's scores? The sophisticated and stylish charm of the 60's era makes for great theatre of international intrigue. I would love to see modern day Bond fims capture the essence of the 60's films while utilizing all the new modern technology. Hopefully the producers of the next Bond film will drop all the commercial crass and get back to some serious storytelling. Until then I will be rerunning classics like OHMSS to keep the vibe alive.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
468,davidwickland,My Least Favorite In The Series,3,24 February 2006,"This is probably the worst James Bond movie. 1st off, Connery is gone and he is by far the bets James Bond, followed by Pierce Brosnan. And He is replaced with George Lazenby a relatively talented, but young and a new actor. Although it is not really his fault, he does not look like Connery or later Bonds and does not really act like him. He reduces Bond's witty lines to Schwarzenegger & Bruce Cambell one liners like ""He had a lot of guts"" (Henchman was ripped up by a snowplow). Furthure more, he falls in love which is completely unlike the Bond in the other movie. I know this is Ian Fleming's fault it still seems totally unBondlike. Also, instead of his normal, mysterious, no-respect for women sort of seduction, he uses some dumb lines and whats more, he uses them twice. I think that the acting, camera-work, and story of this movie is by far the worst in the series. FInally M has lost all respect for James Bond. In previous movies he never hesitates to do what Bond wants. Now, he flat out denies Bond's Request to try.It wasn't all bad. There were some pretty cool chase scenes on the slopes of the mountain and there were a lot of hot chicks. Plus, without this movie we wouldn't have Dr. Evil, but besides that it was terrible",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
469,elsharpy,Very good Bond film,8,20 November 2006,"OHMSS is one of the best bond films of the series. I rate it as number 3 in my list behind Goldfinger and From Russia With Love. Granted, George Lazenby is no Connery but he puts in an admirable performance as Bond and would have certainly grown into the role if he had made a few more films. His acting is a little wooden in places, but at times he gets it spot on, such as his scenes with Monnypenny and Tracy. He certainly looks the part and physically he is very good in the action sequences and fight scenes. Telly Savalas is very good as Bloefeld being both charming and menacing at the same time. The musical score is one of the finest in the series and the locations are everything you could hope them to be. The film is a tad too long but it doesn't drag at all. One of my only gripes is that some of the fight scenes are speeded up a bit which makes them slightly unrealistic, but this is a minor quibble.All in all I highly recommend OHMSS and urge people to cast their prejudices aside and view it on its merits. Like I said earlier it's a real shame that Lazenby didn't make another Bond film, this film is leagues better than Diamonds are Forever and Connery should not have returned to the role. OHMSS is also better than any of the the Roger Moore films, which although enjoyable pale in comparison to this one.History will be kind to this film and to Lazenby, who like Dalton is underrated as Bond.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
470,crnijavor,Missed gem,10,7 September 2018,"Prior to watching OHMSS, l always though Lazenby was the weakest Bond, only having one movie and being forgotten to the point of becoming pub quiz trivia.
But then, l saw IMDB trivia about him being offered 7 movies after this one... My expectations skyrocketed.
And l am pleased to say they were met. Lazenby is convincing, playful (but not to the point of just being silly), resourceful, and armed with pretty decent oneliners.
Without going into spoilerland, l will just say that story is interesting, classic Bond but (unlike some previous installments) not offending to the common sense, while also greatly expanding the main character.
Women are a few, and some of them even come off as rounded, complete characters for whom viewer may even care.Also, do not be discouraged by the pretty long duration (2h22min). It is actually pretty well paced movie which does not feel long at any point.All in all, the average rating here does not do justice to this truly great Bond. A must watch.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
471,derek-bond,the best 007,10,12 September 2018,I was nine years old when I saw this film it was school holidays and the lady in the kiosk asked how old I was I said sixteen she laughed at me and with a wink at me said go on in I was blown away with the film and ever since then ive been a bond fan for me this is the best bond film it stays true to the book and after watching it many times over the years it gets better with time its such a pity lazenby did not do anymore I was lucky to meet him in 2004 and he was a gentleman,On Her Majesty's Secret Service
472,SoberIrishmenNever,Underrated,10,30 July 2007,"This is possibly the best bond film in the series. I know that many may not agree with me, but as an avid James Bond fan who has seen each entry at least 5 times I consider this a great achievement. While many will point to a lack of Sean Connery's presence, George Lazenby does a great job with all of the witty lines and action sequences that have come to define the character. And if Connery's performance in Diamonds are Forever would have been any indication as to his performance on OHMSS then I'm glad that Lazenby was chosen as Bond.The story in this movie is probably the deepest in the entire series. I think that the love story between Traci and Bond is the only possible way that 007 could ever have been drawn into commitment. Telly Savalas as Blofeld is somewhat of a stretch, but the delivery of his dialog and his more physical portrayal of the character leave little to be desired. The role of Traci is played very well also, partially due to the fact that Diana Rigg supposed hated Lazenby's guts and despised working with him. Had Lazenby made more Bond movies, I believe he would have been revered right below Connery as the second best Bond leading man.All in all this is one of the best Bonds ever made. The 60s definitely contain the best of the Bond series to date, despite that period being 20 years before I was born. Fantastic chase scenes (including in the bobsled run), a believable love story, all of the pithy comebacks you can hope for, and the rich cinematography make OHMSS one of my all time favorites.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
473,washcapsfans-1,Another side of Bond,8,12 July 2006,"This movie has to be one of the best Bond films ever made. Not only does it contain the old staples of action and suspense but I feel it portrays a much-needed human side of James Bond. Yes, the man can actually fall in love. Telly Savalas as Blofeld brought a distinctive type of criminality to the character equaled only by the performance of Charles Gray who played him in ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The portrayal of Bond in this movie tends to paint him as a cog in an intelligence machine which is slowly taking its toll on him. Only the love of Tracy and his commitment to his country keeps him going. The theme song is also my favorite of all the films.",On Her Majesty's Secret Service
