0,Leofwine_draca,Cop thriller with a twist,6,23 December 2017,"BRIGHT is another cop thriller from the hit-or-miss director David Ayer, and yet another spin on his ever-popular END OF WATCH. This takes the concept of the patrolling cop duo and mixes it with some LORD OF THE RINGS-style fantasy in which orcs and elves live in the real world and mix with the humans of the cast. There are elements of ENEMY MINE and DISTRICT 9 in the story of Will Smith's and his orc partner Joel Edgerton's attempts to save an elf girl and her magic wand from coming into the possession of a vengeful dark elf killer. I really can't stand some of Ayer's movies - END OF WATCH being one of them - but others, like SABOTAGE and FURY, I've really enjoyed. BRIGHT falls somewhere between the two camps in terms of quality. It's predictable but watchable, familiar but engaging at the same time. An ageless Will Smith has more natural charisma than I remember, while Edgerton does well hidden in the orc suit. Other seasoned performers like Noomi Rapace and Edgar Ramirez don't disappoint. As ever, the action sequences are the highlight here, with Ayer adept at delivering blistering thrills so that the viewer's attention is held from beginning to end.",Bright
1,SnoopyStyle,exposition,5,17 February 2018,"There is magic in the world. Also, there are fairies, orcs, elves, and plenty of other magical beings. LAPD officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is leery of his Orc partner Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) who faces prejudice from all sides. They answer a call and find a disturbing scene with a magic wand. They go on the run with an elf named Tikka as everybody races to retrieve the powerful wand.I rarely ask for more exposition but this is an exception. This world is not overly complicated but some exposition would help set up the movie. It's Training Day crossed with Alien Nation, Lord of the Rings, and The Warriors with a magic wand as the McGuffin. Again, it's not complicated but it needs some background. It's a fun alternate universe Colors for about an hour but it does grow tiresome. Even Will Smith is perfect for this unimaginative construction. Edgerton is a bit disappointing but he doesn't have the backstory to give his character humanity. It's only much later when the audience is allowed into his world. It's all manufactured and limited. I can see the pitch meeting.",Bright
2,Prismark10,Not Alien Nation,3,7 January 2018,"Bright is a blunt allegory about race and class. It also again leads me to question if David Ayer knows how to direct a movie.The film is really an updated and for Netflix an expensive reimagination of Alien Nation with bits of The Lords of the Rings thrown in set in some alternative Los Angeles that still manages to be grimy and run down.Humans of all colours, orcs, elves and fairies coexist in this world. Elves seem to be the super elite and orcs are the underclass. Will Smith plays Ward who has been handed a new partner, an orc Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) the first of his kind to join the force. After an incident where Ward got shot by an orc who got away from Jacoby's clutches. Ward distrusts his partner, the other police officers in the precinct are plotting to get rid of Jakoby.Both then learn to trust and protect each other as they encounter an elf with a magical wand. Before long they are being pursued by law enforcement, criminal gangs and other more powerful creatures.The film is murky, muddied and muddled.",Bright
3,claudio_carvalho,Looks Like a Pilot of a TV Series,7,27 December 2017,"In Los Angeles, humans live with orcs and elves in a world where fantasy creatures do exist. LAPD police officer Dayl Ward (Will Smith) is the first human cop having the orc police officer Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) as partner. When Ward is shot by an orc and Jakoby does not capture the shooter, he questions whether Jakoby lets the fellow orc escape. During a patrol, Ward and Jakoby arrest a man that tells that there is a prophecy and Ward is blessed. Meanwhile, Internal Affairs press Ward to find the truth about the escape of the shooter so that they can fire Jakoby. The magic department of the FBI interrogates the man that belongs to the terrorist Shield of Light group and they learn that they are preparing the return of the Dark Lord that will destroy the world. Ward and Jakoby are summoned to attend a disturbance and they stumble upon a Shield of Light safehouse where they arrest the elf Tikka (Lucy Fry) and her magic wand. Soon they learn that Tikka is hunted down by the evil and powerful elf Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and her gang and they need to protect Tikka and the wand; otherwise the world will be destroyed. What will they do?""Bright"" is an action film that looks like a pilot of a TV series. The screenplay begins too rushed in a world of orcs and elves living with humans without explanation. But as soon as the viewer understands the big picture of this fascinating Los Angeles and the character motives, the film becomes very attractive with great potential of a sequel (or a series). My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Bright""",Bright
4,nogodnomasters,There is no wand,8,10 January 2018,"Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) and Ward (Will Smith) is not an attorney group, but are 3 Adam 9 Police officers in LA. Jakoby is an Orc and the first Orc to be a police officer. The film has LOTR races and unspoken background. There is also a magical wand in the film because Harry Potter did well at the box office. Our police officers must defy the odds and save the planet from the return of the Dark Lord. The Orcs look like Raider Nation and speak a dialect that sounds like Klingon. Elves of course are tall, beautiful, and ""rule the world and shop."" The film uses modern societal divisions to place races into roles. Will Smith plays a typical cocky Will Smith character in a role written with him in mind. I didn't know what to make of the killing of a fairy. Fans of ""Alien Nation"" and ""LOTR"" might really get into the film. Guide: F-word. Nudity.",Bright
5,kosmasp,(Not so) Bright,6,2 April 2018,"If you've seen a couple of movies, you know where certain things are going. But this is not about where it is heading (maybe a revelation or two can be surprising along the way, though I have to admit, I did not even bother thinking about certain plot details or story elements). This is about the how it you get there. So the effects are taking center stage ... unfortunately so much that not only character development is put aside, but character individuality is kind of crushed underneath the weight.Also the dialog is aimed to ""entertain"" even when it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes you feel like there was a ""joke a minute"" rule that was insisted upon. Or a ""we have to disagree"" even if my character pointed out we actually agree a minute ago. Fact is, there are so many inconsistencies it is baffling ... and yet still I gave it a 6/10. I guess the visuals got to me then. You decide if you think they make up for the lack of almost anything else ...You should also note that while there is some social commentary here (which I salute generally speaking), it's so on the nose that it is comical. Unfortunately so bad that it isn't even funny ... it's just lame. Yes we get your stabs at racism and prejudice ... don't insult our intelligence though. Thank you very much",Bright
6,paul_haakonsen,Prepare to be blown away...,8,9 June 2018,"I had no expectations to this movie, given the fact that it was a movie that aired on Netflix. And it starred Will Smith as a police man with an orc police partner, right I know sounds rather corny.But still I gave the movie a chance, and I must admit that I am more than happy that I did so. Because ""Bright"" turned out to be a really amazing movie.I was more than genuinely entertained from beginning to end. The storyline in ""Bright"" was captivating and it felt very much as if the movie was set in a pre-Shadowrun setting one that was just missing the cyberpunk aspect, or at the very least the director has been heavily influenced by the Shadowrun roleplaying game.The acting in the movie was good, and even Will Smith was able to shed his usual shackles of mediocre acting for this movie.What really blew me away, was the special effects and practical effects, because they were spectacular and realistic. And the way they made the elves appear was just phenomenal; they really made the elves seem like they had transcended humanity and reached a higher state of being.They had a very impressive cast ensemble for this movie, which really helped bring the characters to life on the screen.I hope they follow this movie up with a sequel or perhaps even a series because there is so much more to be explored here.",Bright
7,Quinoa1984,"""I think we might be in a prophecy."" ""...Look at my face. This is not a prophecy. This is a bad night face.""",2,23 December 2017,"The two lines in the above summary happen within one minute of movie. And this is one minute of this.Bright is... Bad. It's obnoxiously bad, boringly bad, and the kind of ugh-palette covering it all that even what decent cinematography it might have has the coating of a layer of gas-soaked urine. This is among the worst things Joel Edgerton or Will Smith have put their names on and it makes me question what I saw as anything entertaining in Landis's scripts for Chronicle and American Ultra (or Ayer's script for... Uh, Training Day I guess). Even if it's true Ayer changed much of Landis' original work - and he's apparently gone as far as to disassociate/dis-own the final product - the central idea needed to be fleshed out MUCH more than what we get here. This entire fantasy-cum-LAPD saga leaves one with so many unanswered questions just about the world these characters reside in (i.e. if everything has been honky-dory aside from the ""racism"" against Orcs, what happened during slavery for example if everything was the same, or was it?) nevermind the plot. Oh the plot, don't get me started.Bright's title is surely not without a sense of grave, un-winking irony: from nearly the start (from it's ""Fairy Lives Matter!"" line practically, and by the way we never see any fairies again so that was useless) is a putrid, grimy, exposition led zeppelin of a horror-thriller-action-fantasy boondoggle. This is the kind of D.O.A. stuff where two-thirds of the way in they even manage to use the wand MacGuffin to screw up having any actual stakes as far as life and death go, and this is still with more to do with Noomi Rapace (who I feel bad for the most, sort of, she still signed on). But more than anything Bright is thoroughly unpleasant and is joyless and bloodless despite and because its efforts to be ""cool"" and ""tough"" and the typical strutting male horse manure action sludge that David Ayer just does because he can. Ayer's own Suicide Squad is 89 Batman in comparison.",Bright
8,CinemaSerf,Bladerunner in Morrrdorrrr,5,28 May 2020,"This is dreadful. There really is no other word to describe this base-level derivative of anything Tolkien. In Los Angeles, humankind, elves and orcs all co-exist; hell there is even an orc on the LAPD. Fortunately, though, bigotry and racism (or, perhaps, speciesism?) is alive and well and sees Will Smith (""Daryl"" - no dots) paired up with ""Jakoby"" (Joel Edgerton) who after a predictably sticky start, gradually start to trust each other on their quest for a mysterious shooter, a magic wand (yep!) and the evil ""Shield of Light"" group of terrorists bent on returning the ""Dark Lord"" (No, not THE ""Dark Lord"") to earth to unleash all manner of hell on us all! It's riddled with rogue elves and orcs; effing and jeffing; car chases, shoot 'em ups and all the usual action adventure malarkey, but it is completely devoid of any depth, soul - or, indeed, anything that could lead to you give a monkeys about any of the cast; indeed if Earth had become epitomised by these two as the best of the bunch, then maybe we ought to have the good old ""Dark Lord"" on speed dial. I usually love this genre of mythical stuff, and the effects are well up to standard, but Smith is just terrible and at all but two hours long, it is an extremely long watch!",Bright
9,zardoz-13,"""Bright"" Is Radiant",8,26 December 2017,"Clearly, Netflix wants to go toe-to-toe with Hollywood, and they are challenging it with their own provocative, slam-bang, $90-million, pulp-fantasy-thriller ""Bright,"" toplining Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as a rare pair of LAPD beat cops. Although Smith plays a human, Edgerton is cast as an Orc! Essentially, ""Suicide Squad"" director David Ayer has taken his superb police procedural ""End of Watch"" (2012) and retooled it as something like director Graham Baker's ""Alien Nation"" (1988) with the fantastic beings from Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. Clocking in close two hours, ""Bright"" conjures up non-stop action, nail-gnawing suspense, unbearable tension, complete with surprises and revelations galore. Smith is as charismatic as ever, but he isn't mimicking his ""Bad Boys"" character Mike Lowery, a role that he plans to reprise in two forthcoming sequels: ""Bad Boys Forever"" and ""Bad Boys 4."" As veteran patrolman Daryl Ward, he is mired up to his neck in devastating debt, and his chief aim in life is to survive long enough to get his pension. Meantime, Ward finds himself in a predicament like nothing any policeman has confronted. The world of ""Bright"" is as gritty, violent, and racially charged as 21st century America, but this imaginative epic takes place in an alternate universe where far-fetched creatures, such as Orcs, Fairies, Elves, and others have been co-existing with humans since the dawn of time. Were it not for these extraordinary characters, ""Bright"" would amount to little more than another foray in urban crime. Sadly, this inventive hokum suffers from two shortcomings. First, predictable plotting undermines the outcome because Ayer and ""Victor Frankenstein"" scenarist Max Landis paint themselves into a corner. Second, the filmmakers provide only the most basic backstory about this bizarre new world. Meantime, the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" actress Noomi Rapace keeps things exciting as a demonic elf who tries to ice our heroes, while Edgar Ramirez is equally as tenacious as another kind of Elf with a badge. 
Patrolman Daryl Ward (Will Smith) isn't ecstatic about having an Orc as his partner. In the alternate universe of ""Bright,"" Orcs are savage, toothsome creatures who resemble a a synthesis of olive-skinned albinos and ghoulish vampire of the 1922 silent horror classic ""Nosferatu."" Basically, Orcs are blue-collar, bottom-feeders who stick together inseparably and rank beneath the most woebegone ethnic groups ravaged by poverty and racism. Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton of ""Smokin' Aces"") is a typical Orc, and his fellow Orcs display nothing but contempt for him. Since they have no use for him, Nick has no use for them. Indeed, Nick has always dreamed of wearing a badge. Imagine his surprise when his dream comes true, and the LAPD hires him on the grounds of diversity. Meantime, Daryl is desperately trying to hold onto his job. Unfortunately, riding with Nick is no bargain as Daryl discovers when out of nowhere a shotgun-wielding Orc blasts him with a shotgun. Fortunately, Daryl survives, but he isn't happy that he must resume riding with Nick. Ward's irate fellow police officers heap endless criticism on him for tolerating Nick. They argue that he should charge Nick for incompetency, so the LAPD will fire the rookie. Daryl's fellow officers fear that if Nick proves himself as a valuable contribution to the force, more Orcs will follow.
Word has spread like wildfire around Los Angeles about a virulent league of Elves known as the Inferni. Moreover, these Elves have been toiling to resurrect a renowned 'Dark Lord' warrior to subjugate mankind. Legend has it the Inferni can with a magical wand deemed ""a nuclear weapon that grants wishes."" The Inferni are ranked as 'bright' because they can wield this wand. Furthermore, accounts claim there may even be some humans who can brandish it. Meanwhile, anybody else who dares to touch it is doomed to incinerate themselves before they can realize their dreams. Daryl and Nick stumble onto a wand one evening in a hood when they respond to a shooting and find themselves in the middle of a supernatural showdown. They help a renegade young Elf, Tikka (Lucy Fry of ""Mr. Church""), who has slain another Inferni with that deadly incandescent wand. Dumbfounded by these circumstances, Daryl summons his watch commander, Sergeant Ching (Margaret Cho of ""One Missed Call""), and his fellow patrolmen, to make sense out of this uncanny situation. No sooner have they arrived than the police see the wand as an answer to all their troubles. Furthermore, they conspire to kill Daryl and Nick, so nobody will know how they acquired the wand. Daryl turns the tables on them, then Nick and he realize they are now being stalked by a more formidable Inferni, Leilah (Noomi Rapace), who wants the wand and is prepared to kill anybody who gets in her way. Indeed, Leilah is ten times more powerful than Tikka, and Leilah's posse is pretty much indestructible, too. If Daryl and Nick don't have their hands full enough, they must contend with a crippled gangsta, Poison (Enrique Murciano of ""Collateral Beauty""), who needs the wand, so he can walk again. Poison rules an army of trigger-happy, machine-gun toting thugs. Adding to the complications is another Elf, Kandomere (Edgar Ramirez of ""Point Break""), a government agent who supervises a Federal Magic Task Force that wants the mysterious wand, too.
Director David Ayer rarely lets our embattled buddy cops catch their collective breath as they run a gauntlet consisting of the ruthless Inferni, Poison's homicidal hellions, and corrupt LAPD officers. Before everything works out for them, Daryl and Nick must dodge barrages of bullets and discover that the wand can resurrect the dead. Ayer intersperses the careening car chases, harrowing shootouts, and high-octane explosions with plenty of exposition, so we learn little by little the amazing powers of the wand and the various characteristics of the heroes and villains. ""Bright"" delivers more than enough wattage to keep audiences enthralled before its obligatory feelgood ending",Bright
10,Calicodreamin,Surprisingly good,7,14 September 2019,"I went into this with an open mind, I didn't know what it was about. But I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is good, the plot is straightforward, and the action is well done. The cinematography and make-up are really well done. I quite enjoyed the pairing of Smith and Edgerton. Really well done.",Bright
11,view_and_review,Underdeveloped,6,30 December 2017,"In a present day world of orcs, fairies, elves and humans a new form of bigotry exists in which orcs are the object of all kinds of discrimination while elves enjoy exclusivity--as in they have all the exclusive stuff. I wouldn't call it racism towards the orcs because that would imply that orcs are a race when in fact they are an entirely different species (I doubt a human and and orc can procreated together (ugh!)). In any case, Officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is the unfortunate recipient of an orc partner, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), on a force in which no other orcs exist nor are they welcome. The two of them have to work together to overcome the bitterness between each other as well as the vitriol that comes from others on the force. They also have to figure out how to protect the world from a dangerous magic wand.My problem with the movie is the incredible lack of back story. There is some exposition throughout the movie but it is woefully lacking. This isn't the future, this is the present and there are orcs and elves everywhere. Why? And even their mission is a bit nebulous. They have to save a magic wand from getting into the wrong hands. There are so many questions I have from just that alone.The action was OK and visually the movie was nice as well, it was just underdeveloped as a story and Daryl Ward and Nick Jakoby were underdeveloped as characters.",Bright
12,Wizard-8,Overall it's mediocre,5,30 June 2018,"Although the premise of ""Bright"" is not entirely original (think of the 1980s movie ""Alien Nation"", for one thing), I was still willing to give it a chance, because of the great potential the story had. However, in the end the movie, while not the bomb as some people have labeled it to be, isn't terribly successful. It's never boring, and it does bring up some intriguing ideas every now and then. Unfortunately, most of the intriguing ideas that it brings up are not developed to their full potential. There are a lot of things about this hybrid ""normal"" and magical worlds that remain quite vague and not fully explained, which leads to many moments that are frustrating and/or confusing. The movie's script is not the only thing mystifying about the movie. The direction, primarily with frequent underlit lighting and hard to follow action sequences, also adds some confusion. Personally, I think the movie would have worked better had it used this premise to primarily be a satire on modern day race and culture relations - that would have added a lot more detail to this world. This is not really a BAD movie, but it could have been a lot more than it ultimately is. Maybe the upcoming sequel might improve things, but considering the dire state of most sequels, it probably won't.",Bright
13,trashgang,action all the way,8,4 April 2018,"I found this a refreshing flick. i mean, the bad guys being Orcs and the Elves getting involved and still it's all happening on earth between humans. No part was boring and it's action from minute one until the end.And it shows it all, the blood, the gore the nudity it's all there. And having Will Smith in it you have sometimes a bit of funny situations or talking. But it surely isn't a comedy. It's out there on Netflix so watch it, you won't be dissappointed.

14,deloudelouvain,Not bad but not great,6,11 February 2018,"I just have mixed feeling about Bright. It definitely could have been much better. But it's not a bad movie, good enough to watch once. The fantasy factor is the good thing about this movie. Orks and Elves mixed with humans, different classes like in real life, it all makes this movie look like not too far fetched. But with those ideas the options to make it a great movie were there but somehow it just didn't become what I expected. The cast is all right, even though Will Smith is just not a great actor at times. He has his good moments but in Bright I just thought he was average, no big fuzz about it. That said, Bright deserves credits for the costume designers and the make-up artists, they all did a good job. The story is okay, you won't get bored. But it could and should have been much better.",Bright
15,siderite,Not a normal body cop movie? It's exactly that.,7,22 December 2017,"OK, it's got orcs and magic and elves and even mentions of dwarfs, but it's a simple cop movie. It features obvious foreshadowing, typical cardboard villains that are terrifying and effective only when not engaging our heroes who, by in some way or another, are regular folks, like me, and you, and Harry Potter. Only brave. Yet it was also a fun movie. The effects were OK, the world building was subtle enough to leave a lot of room for exploring and the acting was mostly good. And the plot feels so familiar as is similar to so many other movies like, say, Alien Nation. Wait... It's exactly like Alien Nation. And, alas, just like that movie is a cult film for just a few and some have never heard of it, so will it happen with Bright. At least that one spawned a TV series, which is the best possible outcome for this film. Too bad, since with a little bit of creative effort, it could have been both appealing to the masses and having something intelligent and inspiring in the background. As it is, the social issues it barely touches are drowned in the racial and tribal stereotypes that abound in the film. As it was no more than I expected, but wasn't disappointed, I rate it average. And for two hours... it was too long.",Bright
16,Hellmant,Very similar to the 1998 sci-fi flick 'ALIEN NATION' (like a modern redo)!,9,25 December 2017,"'BRIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A fantasy-action crime-drama buddy film, set in an alternate world where humans coexist with mythical creatures. It revolves around a human police officer that's partnered with a rookie Orc cop, for the first time, and they have to stop a powerful magical artifact from falling into the wrong hands. The movie stars Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace, Lucy Fry, Edgar Ramirez and Ike Barinholtz. It was written by Max Landis (who also wrote 2012's 'CHRONICLE' and 2015's 'AMERICAN ULTRA') and it was directed by David Ayer (who also teamed with Smith and Barinholtz on 2016's 'SUICIDE SQUAD'). It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through their streaming site. I mostly loved it!In an alternate present reality, humans have existed with mythical creatures since the beginning of time. A lot of bigotry, and discrimination, naturally also exists, between humans, orcs, elves, fairies and other creatures. LA police officer Daryl Ward (Smith) is partnered with the first orc police officer, Nick Jakoby (Edgerton), against his objections. The two have to deal with hate and constant criticism from everyone around them, while the public watches. They also have to deal with an ancient artifact recently being discovered, that many powerful beings will kill to get their hands on. The film is very similar to the 1998 sci-fi flick 'ALIEN NATION', which is about a human cop being partnered with the first alien police officer. It has almost the exact same 'cop buddy film' formula, with the same social commentary on racism and bigotry. This movie isn't quite as good as that classic action film, but it is a great modern redo. I was really entertained by it, and I love it's constant (timely) social commentary, on prejudice and discrimination. I look forward to the planned sequel as well.",Bright
17,cherold,Never as good as its brilliant title sequence but generally fun,7,28 July 2018,"Bright has an amazing title sequence, using graffiti and posters to sketch out a contemporary Los Angeles where fairies and elves are real and Orcs are an oppressed race dealing with humans who fear and hate them. It's a densely packed sequence that promises something really cool.The early part of the movie does a nice job of world building. Will Smith is a human cop forced to partner with the first Orc cop, who is hated by the entire department. Unlike our world where race is a constructed artifice, here race is very specific, and humans are all one. So Will is a mildly racist human who never experienced the anti-black racism of the real world.We also get to see Will murder a fairy, which is basically a flying rat in humanoid form.In this world magic exists, and certain individuals known as ""brights"" are able to wield magic wands, which will destroy anyone else who touches them. Will and Orc come across a scene of magical slaughter and find a young elf woman who has a wand. The lure of magic is strong, and the movie becomes a hectic run from magic-desiring cops and thugs, as well as the wand's original fairy owner, whose gang is an unstoppable force of murderous gymnasts. To put it more simply, Bright is a mismatched/buddy cop movie (with a twist) involving a night of mayhem. It's predictable, shallow, and has some fun action sequences and light, somewhat amusing banter.The critics hated this movie, but I'd say it's pretty standard as buddy-cop movies go. Lethal Weapon and 48 hours, big hits the critics like better than Bright, seem equally dopey. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than either of those ""classics.""But I can't help but wish the movie had followed the path set by its title sequence, with more attention paid to the racism of a society that has actual races.Also, why are all the thugs black? I mean, it's a world where presumably humans see themselves as one race, so why would poor neighborhoods have so few white people in them? It suggests that the premise wasn't really carefully thought out. Anyway, Bright is fine. It's not the end of the world if you miss it, but it's got some fun stuff in it.",Bright

19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Promising, but ultimately undelivering sci-fi action film",4,21 January 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDaryl Ward (Will Smith) is an LA cop, who's been partnered with Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), an 'orc' cop. In a city where humans co-exist with these creatures, Daryl's partnering is an uneasy one, with which he's riddled with suspicion, after he was shot in the back several months ago, and Nick appeared to let the suspect go. Most of the department dislikes Nick, and relish the chance to get rid of him, and this seems to present itself one night when a young woman named Leilah (Noomi Rapace), a 'bright' specimen of the orc race, appears, in possession of a magic wand with phenomenal power, that various parties want to get hold of.Will Smith re-appears in this latest sci-fi film, exploring similar themes of human co-existence with other life forms he previously did in films such as I, Robot and Men in Black. Approaching fifty now, it doesn't show so much in his appearance or physique, but his voice is noticeably gruffer and gravellier, although he's no less an effective presence than he was before. While MIB was light-hearted and I, R slightly darker, this feels as played straight as it can get, and is all the more redundant because of it.One of director David Ayer's previous features was the raw, true-to-life cop drama End of Watch, and it's hard to shake off the comparison of that with this film. In fact, the whole sci-fi/fantasy element seems misplaced, like it belongs in a different film altogether. It feels determined to be the same film as EOW, in pretty much every scene at the beginning. Possibly Ayer was trying to push the co-existence narrative, believable in these diversity obsessed times, as it's hard to think of any other reason.Sadly, the story on its own isn't strong or structured enough to be really great on it's own, a jumbled mish mash of potentially great ideas that don't work together as one. There is some humour in the script, and it comes, of course, from Smith and his trademark wisecracks and delivery. If only they could have been part of a more organized, smooth film that knew where it was going. **",Bright
20,bowmanblue,An idea better than the film,7,25 December 2017,"Sometimes a film comes along with a premise that sounds so good that you couldn't see failing. However, when it comes to being executed on screen, it doesn't live up to what it could have been. 'Bright' has been getting a lot of hate from the critics, some even calling it 'the worst film of 2017.' Personally, I didn't think it was that bad - just could have been better.Apparently, in 'Bright's' world, elves, orcs, fairies and other supernatural beings have existed alongside us humans throughout the ages. Now, we're in modern day L.A. and we see the results. Now, off the bat, if these types of creatures had lived among us all through our history, our cities would be radically different. They're not. It's basically L.A. with a few different races roaming around and occasionally have their own 'districts.' And that's an example of how a film like this probably should have been done differently. You had an interesting idea and wasted it.But, like I say, it's not as bad as some are making it out to be. It's effectively a 'buddy cop' film where Will Smith (human) is paired with the first ever orc cop (Joel Edgerton). So, we have our typical 'mismatched cop' duo who bicker constantly all the way through it. Soon they come across an elven maiden with a wand which the bad elves are also after.So, again what could have been a vaguely interesting set-up turns into a series of action set-pieces where one group of bad guys attacks our trio after the next until the obvious end battle. First the humans attack. Then the orcs. Then the elves. Then it's over. Again, nothing wrong with that, it's just with an idea like this it should have been able to have been stretched into more original territory.However, it has Will Smith at the helm and, just because he's on Netflix, don't think he's any the less charming. He holds it together and the action is fast-paced and fun. There's quite a lot of swearing, so it's not a family movie, but, if you're looking for something action-packed (only!) to watch, stick this on your 'watch list' and, as long as you're not expecting too much, it'll keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Oh, yes, it's a couple of hours long. It probably could have been an hour and a half and been all the better for it.",Bright
21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,11 January 2018,"BrightIf magic were real than sawing someone in half would not end in a jail sentence.Fortunately, the alternate earth in this action-fantasy has seen a recent increase in enchantment.In a world where Tolkien-type creatures live in harmony alongside humanity, LAPD officer Ward (Will Smith) and his Orkish partner Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) are tasked with maintaining that delicate balance. But an elf (Lucy Fry) with a magic wand being sought by a dark elf (Noomi Rapace) - intent on reviving the Dark Lord - threatens that harmony.Now, the odd couple must protect the girl and the wish-granting wand whilst battling their own demons.A paint-by-numbers buddy-picture, Netflix's first foray into blockbuster territory is a tepid one. While the concept is serviceable, the racial comparisons are bordering on offensive. Moreover, the action, dialogue and character designs are all questionable.Worse, the Orc's rap album sold more than Will Smith's last one. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Bright

It heavily copied movies like ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch"" - because of course it was the same writter David Ayer. And those two movies were much superior, but still i liked ""Bright"" because of its high concept and gritty crime thriller settings, mixed with fairy tale world. Sounds bizzare? It is, but i would take this kind of high concept movie that takes risks any day.Overall, what ""Bright"" didn't had is a better world building. They kind of tells and show things to viewer and you really have to catch it quickly. The sequel to this movie i think would be a great idea, expanding this intriguing world of ""Bright"". And i would love to see it.",Bright
23,tabuno,"This movie is an alterative universe fantasy, action crime drama where powerful magic and magical creatures exist with humans set in Los Angeles. But the movie's underlying t",8,27 January 2019,"This movie is an alterative universe fantasy, action crime drama where powerful magic and magical creatures exist with humans set in Los Angeles. But the movie's underlying themes also could just as well parallel the actual American universe trending in ten or twenty years from now. Each culture having its own ingrained enclave - bitter, nasty, and cynical sarcasm dripping with racism and hatred of each other. In regards the movie, there is a looming threat to the existence of the status quo of stratified world humans and magical creatures. Wil Smith's character will play a large role in addressing this impending threat to this alternative world. Bright's script has taken some elements from Luc Besson's sci fi cult classic The Fifth Element (1997) and Francis Lawrences's occult Constantine (2005) as well as Ben Kingsley's persona in Sexy Beast (2008), and a nastier version of the action thriller Aleksander Bach's Hitman: Agent 47 (2015).The movie contents Orcs that are(considered dumb and repugnant with molting grayish skin. There's great prejudice against them by humans. They seem more easy-going, level headed, and sensible. The new minority. Apparently 2000 years ago they chose evil and their present-day descendants live their association with the tragic past. They are much more physically strong , heavily built, muscular and have a great sense of smell. Elves live as the rich elite living in clean luxury with pointed years. They also have positions as federal agents. There are also renegade elves who want to bring back a ""dark lord"" whom are affected mostly by magic instead of humankind's rational science. Then there are humans mostly middle class living in segregated African American and Latino neighborhoods. Ruled more by their emotions, humans hate orcs and want nothing to do with them.It's possible that the poor reviews of this movie may in part be a reflection of how hard it is to look at ourselves in the mirror and see how much we as Americans haven't really evolved and matured that much as a civilization. It may be that in our contemporary American racial prejudice and economic disparity still exist in great glaring and stark proportions while there is only a shimmer of superficial tolerance that hides the crude beliefs and raw feelings underneath. The movie also presents human greed based on legitimate desperation and wanton desire.The tone of the movie is fragile, its balance provided by the occasional wry banter between Wil Smith and his Orc partner while there is a much more dark and sinister ambiance with the willful corruption and cloying greediness derived from a society of neglect and class segregation and entitlement. There are seemingly few morally upright characters in the movie except for the primary lead characters. In this new environment for apparently darker films, Bright seems to follow in the steps of Daniel Craig's more cold and physical James Bond in Casino Royale (2006) and Christian Bale's psychologically dark Batman in The Dark Knight (2008), the percolation of more gritty and raw filmmaking descended to original TV movies and the Japanese cyper-punk Tokyo Tribe (2015). For most of the movie, the drama and grittiness seem to be persistently balanced with the movie, yet later in the movie the physical violence and then fantasy atmospherics seem to turn more sadistic and evil almost to the point that Bright becomes more of a fetish movie than a serious look at violence, racial hatred and redemption, almost.At times, this movie is hard to watch because it is so graphically despairing and repulsive in the way it has various races pitted against each other. It's almost the complete opposite of what America superficially presents itself as enlightened and tolerant. The movie presents an America of what we are supposedly not, but yet perhaps it actually taps into our unconscious truth about ourselves that we don't want to admit. The movie also requires the audience to face some very difficult moral questions and asks us to face some very black and white life and death issues of which we may not like some of the possible human answers that the movie depicts. Overall, this movie would not be an easy movie to see for a good number of people and yet, it is an important movie to experience for the message it contains. But the emotions and ideas it presents rise above such reactive emotional ugly repulsion.Wil Smith is allowed to present a tad too much of his own characteristic wry humor as opposed to being a new, unrecognized, un-Wil Smith character that is somewhat distracting at the beginning. Nevertheless, as the main storyline and action takes hold, his idiosyncratic character begins to be less prominent in its diverting impact. Wil is displayed as somewhat sensitive person concerned about his pension, retirement versus being killed on the job leaving wife and daughter without a husband, father. There's even an action scene in which there is a very brief but really funny ""holy"" reference and it not about spiritual holiness. The ability of our leading characters to come up against the strongest of the opposition is well somewhat questionable, but as this is a movie, this moment is about on par with a majority of such outcomes however fantastic. Overall, this movie is contemporary, on-point, and relevant to the current political headwinds in this country. Bright reflects the present state of entertainment and it conforms well to the more stark realities of biting commentary while offering up a sense of gritty optimism.",Bright
24,Platypuschow,"Bright: Great ideas, poorly executed",6,8 December 2018,"So Bright was met with highly mixed reviews and I can entirely see why.Bright tells a story in a world full of multiple races, man stands alongside orcs, elves and if you pay attention you can see others. Focusing on two police officers and a plot involving a magic wand and the chaos it brings.The cast are great, though Joel Edgerton is unrecognisable in his orc makeup and until afterwards I didn't know that was Noomi Rapace either!The effects are great both practical and cgi, the soundtrack is solid and the movie ticks most boxes. The box it most adamantly ticks is the one for originality, it's a fantastic concept and I question whether it would have made more sense to do this as a television series instead.Sadly it's alarmingly flawed, the story they chose was really quite generic, it felt very rushed in places and absolutely nothing about this world and its history was explained which I find to be a bad call.Bright had unlimited potential but only came out as a slightly above average quality movie. My hope is that it becomes a franchise, whether a sequel or a series this is one of those concepts that should be grabbed with both hands because it reeks of money.Very nice try but should have been better.The Good:Great social commentaryImpressive visualsA lot of potentialThe Bad:Story was a tad clichedThings I Learnt From This Movie:If you play stupid games you win stupid prizesTriangle formation on public roads makes perfect sense",Bright
25,The-Sarkologist,Buddy Cops in a Fantasy World,9,5 November 2018,"Not surpisingingly this is one of those films where the opinions of the critics pretty much are at the opposite poles of the opinions of those who have watched it. This is probably why I prefer to take audience opinions into account over those of the critics (despite the fact that critics do end up having a lot more sway than those of the audience). Honestly, when it comes to audiences, the number of reviews, and the collected ratings, tend to give one a much better idea of whether the movie is going to be a good one or not.
However, I can sort of understand the problems with this movie, and that is background. This is the sort of film where it can be very difficult to drop the viewer into a story without actually explaining what is going on. Basically, we are in an alternate world where Earth is populated by orcs, elves, dragons, and some really annoying faries. The problem I had was that there seemed to be little explanation as to why the world was like this, except for some references to the orcs being on the wrong side of the battle, and this darklord that was banished, but some groups are wanting him to return. Oh, and there is magic, but it is incredibly rare, and very, very dangerous.
So, this is where the action comes in because it turns out that it is one of those films where we have an orc who has become a police officer, but the thing is that orcs are second class citizens (actually third class because the elves tend to at the top of the food chain). So, he has become a cop, but everybody wants him to fail, so this is where Will Smith comes in. He drew the short straw and has to work with him as his partner.
At first it seems as if it is going to be one of those films, but pretty quickly turns when they stumble across a house where there happens to be some magic going on, and when they call in backup they discover a wand. The thing with wands is that everybody wants its because they are so powerful. The problem is that only people known as brights are able to use wands, so what they are going to do with it once they have it is beyond me.
Then there is this whole thing about Elf Town. While the film seems to focus more on orcs, and in particular orcs that are not orcs in that they find themselves on the outer when it comes to both their sides and the humans, the whole idea of the Elf communities where only elves are allowed, doesn't seem to play as much of a part. Except this also happens, particularly with the rise of gated communities. In a way there are sections of the country where if you aren't connected then you can't enter, and if you do enter then you are basically treated with suspicion, no matter what your race happens to be.
Yet, despite all of the flaws, and the lack of any real background can be a really big problem in films like this, it was still a pretty awesome film that just seemed to keep on going, and kept me drawn to it right the way through. In a way it was non-stop action in a style that you very rarely see namely because we have a fantasy world merged with a gritty modern cop film that I thought actually came out really well.",Bright
26,cruise01,Bright is action packed with the star power from Will Smith and Joel Edgerton. A buddy cop with a twist of fantasy makes it a fun watch.,7,7 January 2018,"In an alternate reality were orcs, fairies, elves, dark lords and humans all coexist in modern Los Angeles. That is what Bright is, a fantasy action crime film somewhat of a buddy cop movie with Daryl (Will Smith) and his orc partner Jakoby (Joel Edgerton). Bright is better than I expected for being an exclusive Netflix movie. It could have been a lot worse but the movie is what it is. It delivers on some fantasy concept of orcs, elves, magic wands, and making it all take place in modern times. It also delivers on some shoot them up action with some cool decent visual effects. The plot was okay, which opens up were inferni elf (Lucy Fry) steals the magic wand away from her sisters led by Noomi Rapace that plans on dominating the world. The plot follows Daryl after an incident when he was shot by a gangster orc while on duty with his partner orc Jakoby. Which created a backlash with the rest of the LAPD in having orcs in there task force. But they have to accept an orc for the diversity conflict. When Jakoby and Daryl respond to a call were inferni elf Tikka (Lucy Fry) escapes from her evil sisters leilah (Noomi Rapace) and her two guards. They will have to protect the magic wand against her, some corrupted police, and the gangsters that are wanting to use the magic for there own agenda. What I liked about Bright is it is a fun concept with an alternate reality with fantasy. It seems like a buddy cop movie with two cops patrolling LA, dealing with gangsters, and so on. But adding a bit of fantasy like orcs hating the humans for their mistreatment. Besides there was history between the two for a thousands of years. Plus there are fairies that are such pest bothering peoples properties, then there is the high class part of the city were elves are mainly populated driving sporty cars, high fashion attire. There are magic wands that can dominate the world, but if in the wrong hands of humans they will incinerate to nothing. And there is also dragons flying in the sky, if you keep your eyes focused when the camera pans to the LA city. It is a fun interesting concept that they are mixing with. If you are an action junkie, this film is also for you. There is a lot of shoot them up action. When Daryl, Jakoby, and Tikka are on the run from the bad guys being chased and stuck in a shoot out in most sequences. The chase never stops until it ends. There is a lot of gun shoot out sequences, some fighting and chases. It does not lack in action. The visual effects are decent. The make up on orcs are also okay as well. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton did great with there characters. There are also some cheesy one liners and dialogue. Some of it is played for laughs. Or to be tacky with its humor. It does play well as a buddy cop fantasy movie. Noomi Rapace is stunning as the villain, who her and her people are fast and skilled warrior fighters. Lucy Fry is also good as the quiet elf with little to do. Then, there is Edgar Ramirez as kandomere, a federal agent that is an elf. He is almost unrecognizable with the make up work but also good as well.What I did not like about the film. I felt like the plot tried a little too much on the controversial issue with diversity and racism. Mixing it with the fantasy story just felt uneven at places. Like one orc mentions that they tried to have a party with all races. But the humans started to bring their weapons which caused a drift with the two kinds. Sure, the film does play with the diversity, and racism. Which does feel like the uninteresting part of the movie when it is like a social commentary. Overall, Bright is a pretty fair fantasy action film. The concept was pretty neat were its like David Ayer's End of Watch mixed with an fantasy idea. The action and gun shoot outs are exciting. Will Smith and the cast were great and fun. The plot may be uneven with its fantasy dark lord story of magic wands but dragged down with its social diversity issue. I rate the film 3 and half stars out of 5. I do recommend checking this film out on Netflix. Definitely one of the better original movies on there and exciting enough to keep you entertained.",Bright
27,Floated2,Tries too hard at being unique and different,3,4 August 2018,"Bright is a straight to Netflix film starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad, End of Watch). Being a fan of both Smith and the directed and having seing a lot of positove revoews from fans (mostly critics were panning), one was intiguied in watching the film. Having waited several months down after forgetting about this Bright, finally have decided in watching. After so, this film is completely dissapointing in what fans are saying. Seeing many audience reviews staying ""critics are wrong"", was more intrerested in watching the film.As a film, it starts off decent but eventually drags on and becomes something less than interested and tries hard at being something different as it falls short. As watching, it does have alot of similarities to End of Watch, as well as Suicide Squad, noting the same director. There are elements there but as a whole, Bright doesn't seem to fit. Much of the world where they live isn't too explained, as in how are there Orcs, Elves and other creatures among them, and what exactly year is it.Bright has a unique concept in potential and the trailers did make it look intriguing but overall the story feels quite generic and a mash up of something not great. As a whole the film is quite boring and it shouldn't given the cast and concept. Also a lot of F-bombs within the film, as it feels forced and pushed.Simply put, there is a reason as to why Bright went straight to Netflix as opposed to theaters worldwide.

28,eddie_baggins,Not the film it could've been,4,17 January 2018,"Netflix's biggest and most ambitious feature film yet, unlikely to be surpassed until Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is released in the near future, Bright is a high profile affair that has received its fair share of critical drubbings since its release in late December and while some of the harsh and unforgiving criticisms of the film are a little over the top, David Ayer's big budget follow-up to the increasingly lambasted Suicide Squad is very far from the film it could've been.Set in an alternate reality where the world in which we live is shared with Orcs, Elves and various other mythical creatures, that years ago were defeated by humans and now live in peace with us, Bright has a loaded backstory and foundation that is instead largely ignored by Ayer so that he can instead focus on what he knows best; the gritty and grimy cop thriller that he honed as a screenwriter with Training Day and director of films like Street Kings and his best film, End of Watch.You get a sense that screenwriter Max Landis's original vision for Bright was focused much more on the magical and mythical side of the story, that likely would've included more insight into this odd new world but while it's great Ayer is looking to overcome the disappointment of Suicide Squad with something once more suited to his particular brand of film-making, it makes Bright feel like a small portion of a much bigger pie we never get to see, let alone taste.Instead of offering us a look at the world of Bright, we get quickly placed alongside Will Smith's street cop Daryl Ward and his partner in the form of Joel Edgerton's orc police officer Nick Jakoby as the mismatched duo find themselves protecting Lucy Fry's magical orientated Tikka who has found herself in a spot of bother with Noomi Rapace's big bad Leilah, who wants her wand back and to do the ""Dark Lord's"" bidding (yep they couldn't think of a better name than The Dark Lord).Smith and Edgerton share an easy to enjoy on screen chemistry, even if neither role stretches the capable actors, bar Edgerton's seemingly cumbersome makeup and prosthetic's but with our focus on these two determined cops you cant help but escape the feeling that the film of Bright is only sharing with us a few brief snippets of what we could've been getting and while Ayer can do action, as Bright's story sinks further and further into generic action thriller tropes, the magic that we've been promised disappears into a dull and tiresome plot that feels more like a stepping stone into something more; something more we may get with the recently announced sequel.Final Say -Bright starts off in an intriguing enough fashion, giving us a glimpse of a unique world unlike any we've seen before but as Ayer's film sinks further and further into a seen a thousand times before cop thriller, Bright ends up showing only brief glimmers of the film it could've been had it focused on the strength's that make it stand out from the crowd.2 Foosball tables out of 5",Bright

30,Vartiainen,"Not a great movie, but I still want a sequel",5,11 January 2018,"*sigh* I want to like this movie. I mean, one has to wonder what kind of sorcery was required to get a movie made based on the Shadowrun roleplaying campaign setting? Well, they don't openly acknowledge it, but that's what it is. Orcs, elves and other fantasy critters living in a gritty urban setting? That's Shadowrun. Plus the film has Will Smith in it!And yet, the film doesn't quite hold up. A big part of that is the slight change from a futuristic cyberpunk into a more modern downtown Los Angeles. It just doesn't work that great. The big appeal of Shadowrun was its style. You had heavy metal chrome cyberpunk and you had high fantasy magic. The dichotomy of that mix was what made it entertaining. And while there was a lot of social commentary involved, it was mostly about mega corporations and the dangers of technology.Whereas this movie wants to talk about racism and prejudice. Okay, it's an important topic, but it has been on the table a lot recently and this movie isn't really saying anything original about it. Orcs are black people, elves are the rich folk, and that's about it. Draw your own inevitable cliché conclusions as you like.That being said, the film definitely looks great. I also really enjoyed the two leads. Smith's role felt a tad tired, but even his halfhearted effort is enough for a pretty good outing. But it's Joel Edgerton as Jakoby, the first ever Orc police officer, that steals the show. Beautiful, restrained role full of heart.So yeah, it's not what I would have preferred it to be, but even as it is, I'm pleased to have seen it.",Bright
31,subxerogravity,Best flick Netflix has produced so far.,7,23 December 2017,"Will Smith does an original movie for Netflix. I'm not sure if that means Will fell off or Netflix is that big. I'm going for the latter.David Ayer who directed Smith in the ill conceived Suicide Squad gets an attempt at redemption in the film Bright. It looks like a sequel to Alien Nation, but instead of Aliens moving to LA, Bright takes place in a world where Orcs and Elves are not myth or fantasy and they coincide with the rest of the human race, in a uniquely style fantasy film. The mythical creatures literally become the new black, as the story is about the first of the orcs, who are considered as low as animals by humans, Jakoby, becoming a cop and nobody on the force wanting him there. Will Smith plays Ward who is force to be Jakoby's partner on the streets. He feels the same hatred but has some reasoning as Jakoby is a rookie who almost got him killed, and now he has to rely on this orc as they run for there lives on the streets of LA in this strange buddy cop feature. Bright delivers an interesting realm. It's not like Lord of the Rings, the world of fantasy comes into the reality of the streets of LA. A world with mystical creatures is a world with Magic and a world where everybody from all the races are willing to do very bad things in order to get magic. In this case the magic comes in the form of a wound that only a select few called Brights can wield without it blowing them up.Love David Ayer's style of using songs as composed music for certain sequences, especially in this movie. He can be overkill at times but it does work In Blight far better. Taking Suicide Squad out of the picture, if you are a fan of End of Watch and Sabotage, Than you'll like Bright as that's the Ayer style being fitted for this film.Will Smith brings his amazing personality to the Netflix original, but possibly more impressive is Joel Edgerton who has to bring all his personality and project it with all that make up on. It's a good action thriller and a good police drama (With a fantasy element), you'll like it far better if you are a fan of gritty crime stories set in LA.One of Netflix's best.",Bright

33,generationofswine,An Honest Review,9,7 May 2018,"Well, you do get the feel that it will work as a series. But you also get the feel that like all the good shows Sci-Fi puts out, Netflix will only let it run long enough for you to get involved before they cancel it...so it is probably better it's just a singular film.The bad would be that, at least the introduction of Will Smith in the film mirrors ID4 so much its a little unsettling...it gives the feel that ""I've seen this before"" and that feel kind of lingers throughout the movie as it seemingly resembles other films you've thought you've seen before...but can't exactly place, at least not all the time.The good news is, the opening credits do the same thing and that works to brilliantly set up the films universe. It gives it a very 90s gangland LA feel from the get-go with a play on race relations without mentioning actual races that is only really beaten by Marvel's use of Mutants.It all makes for a very familiar movie. You do feel like you've seen it before and that works both as a strength and a weakness.

35,alindsay-al,An above average fantasy mixed with modern day,6,1 January 2018,"This film has had alot of promotion from Netflix and it is there biggest venture to date, this film is definitely enjoyable at times but it could have been so much better. The premise of the film sees a human and orc cop attempt to protect a young girl from dark forces. Will Smith plays the lead human cop and he does a really good job in the film, he is very charming and charismatic in the film to make him a likeable enough character especially as the film progresses. Joel edgerton plays his cop partner and I found him fun to watch and a likeable protagonist for this film that I thought blended well with Smith. I also liked there chemistry together and it got better as the film progressed. Unfortunately I didn't really like any of the other characters in this film, noomi rapace plays the villain and she is just a bland over the top cliché villain with no real motivation that felt really weak in the film. Edgar ramirez plays a special agent and I feel like his character could have been removed from the film and the film would have been no different that is how forgettable his performance is and his character. The story has an interesting concept of seeing fantasy races in modern day and I liked how the two protagonists relationship developed through the film, also the film moves pretty quickly and keeps you on your toes. But this film tries to fit too much into it and it lacks any interesting direction as it never gives a clear direction for the films story. The script has some interesting humour and drama in it that helped develop the main characters. Though I feel like this film had an overuse of swearing in it especially at the beginning of the film and it felt unnatural and like it was a script not real conversation. The style of the film is really interesting as it sees fantasy elements mixed with a modern day crime film and I like how the lore is represented. But they try to show us everything and it doesn't flow very well in the film, and makes it probably a bit longer then it needed to be.

Smith plays a police officer in a real world with fairies, elves and orcs. Orcs and humans are species still at odds from something that happened thousands of years ago. Smith is partnered with an orc officer much to the dismay of many other human cops. Meanwhile we learn the elves and humans have special people called Brights who can wield the power of magic wands to summon a dark lord to return. Only the elves Shield of Light is able to stop it. A wand is stolen by an elf and other elves, cops and thugs battle to gain control of that wand. Who will end up wielding the powerful wand? At a high level, this is a weird fantasy gang war over a loose magic wand. It is very dark in tone yet creates an interesting world with unique species. There are also a blunt and simplistic species/race acceptance plot points. A neat, modern Sci-Fi action alternative.",Bright

Fantastic film",8,8 August 2018,"Another excellent WILL SMITH movie & role!!!""Bright"" is an underrated gem.I think this is actually one of Smith's best roles & films, ""Bright"" will be a future Cult Classic i think!!!What i absolutely love about this fantastic film is it's thick smoggy, gloomy, rain drenched & neon lit look & dark atmosphere & it's night time streets of Los Angeles that seem so dangerous & this alternate fantasy comic book type universe version of L. A feels like a boiling pot ready to explode with all it's violence & different species & races that all seem so angry!!! It's a very scary los Angeles.I've always loved my childhood hero ""Will Smith"" & I've followed his amazing career since his Fresh Prince days & the guy is an ICON & one of the best actors out there today!!!He's been abit of a role model for me since my teens & nearly every movie he makes is great with the exception of a few like the terrible ""Focus"" but usually he's great & the film is too.I'm a huge fan of David Ayers Suicide Squad which he cast Smith as the Awesome Deadshot, Another excellent performance & way underrated film.Smith was definitely fantastic as Deadshot in the BRILLIANT underrated SUICIDE SQUAD & moved on to ""Bright"" with the same great director david ayer who he works perfectly with & here & smith is excellent as tough rugged older cop Daryl Ward who has to team up with an orc on the police force & it's one of my favourite characters that Smith has ever played.""Bright"" has alot happening with our hero duo cops on the beat with all sorts of craziness that happens including finding a magic wand, being hunted by violent street gangs of both humans & orcs & fighting off super killer elves & crooked cops!!! A dark fantasy cop THRILLER full of gritty corruption & violent streets of thugs, this cop film moves along at a great pace & is full of action & some fun banter.""Bright"" is part old school buddy Cop genre from the 80's with a fantasy twist to it, it's a unique Cop Thriller & very dark & gritty & violent so yeah it's excellent!!!This fantasy world created here is so unique & interesting i want to see much more & we will with a sequel in the works & I'm excited, although it's fantasy it's still a mirror image of our own dark world just made more fantastical, the gritty & violent rough neighbourhoods of LA are here & so is the gangs of thugs & all the graffiti covered walls!!!""Bright"" often feels old school like an 80's or 90's film & that's a good thing,
I got vibes of Cop Thriller's like Training Day & Colours & Alien Nation & Lethal Weapon & 48 hrs & even dark murky urban sci-fi films such as BladeRunner & Robocop & The Terminator, there's a dark & dangerous 80's look to the night time scenes of the urban streets & often a John Carpenter feel with it's vibes & dark look just like Escape from New York & echoes of Assault on precinct 13 are also here, i love all those movies mentioned so ioved Bright.Need to explore the world of Bright with a hopefully full on franchise of films!!!Will Smith really does give another excellent performance here & is one of his toughest roles by that i mean he's a very no-nonsense tough Cop & is sarcastic & intense, he's abit of a mix of his Mike Lowry character from Bad Boys with a bit of his serious Deadshot from Suicide squad.Bright is also visually stunning with it's striking cinematography & use of bright lights & neon colours surrounded in darkness, a great sharp looking film.Another excellent performance is from Joel Edgerton as the troubled orc cop Nick Jakoby, he's an extremely brave, tough & loyal orc who wants to do good & do the right thing even with everyone against him even his own kind, he's the great moral centre & heart of this magical fantasy Thriller.A big thing i loved about this fantasy Cop Thriller is it felt like i was watching an 80's or early 90's Film, whether intended or not to feel old school & retro? It definitely did to me & i loved it for that almost Nostalgia feel like a ""Lethal Weapon"" film or ""Alien Nation"" on that old Cop film feel with abit of ""Training Day"" feel & grit & again ""Bright"" is excellent & one of the most underrated films of recent years in my opinion.This is well directed by David Ayer & full of danger & violence ANOTHER underrated but great movie!!!WILL SMITH is Fantastic again & has created another great character.This is an underrated movie that will become a much loved cult film as the years pass.I love fantasy films & i love Cop films & ""Bright"" is both.I really want this Netflix original movie on dvd, I've already watched it about 5 times already i need to own a physical copy.",Bright
41,s3276169,Bad Boys with Orcs.....,6,10 January 2018,"Bright might best be described as the 1995 Will Smith film Bad Boys with Orcs, fairies, elves and other dungeons and dragons style creatures in a US urban setting. In real terms this film has much the same bones as any ""cop/buddy"" drama. There's a settling in period where the chief protagonists come to like and respect each other in spite of their differences. There are lots of wise cracks and action shoot em ups on the way as out hero's overcome seemingly insurmountable odds and defeat the predictable bad guys. The difference with Bright is the injection of an other wordly aspect. An alternative universe where human cops work alongside Orcs and take on evil Elves and other assorted nasties. On a superficial level this film works quite well. The fact however that this rather novel concept was not taken further outside the predicable formulaic ""action cop film"" comfort zone is the reason I do not give Bright a higher rating. Bright works as basic entertainment but the fact is the fantastical creatures are really just fancy skins worn over tired characterisations we have seen 100 times before.Bright is a nice idea Hollywood and a step in the right direction. My advice next time take a few more risks and you might have something truly original to offer jaded cinema goers like myself. 6/10 from me.",Bright
42,valleyjohn,Stunning looking movie,7,23 December 2017,"If there was ever any doubt that Netflix was a big player in the movie industry it's been confirmed with this big budget film and I for one am pleased they are because if the future of film watching is the latest blockbusters being streamed to your home instead of horrible cinema experience then bring it on! 
Set in an alternate present-day where humans, orcs, elves and fairies have been coexisting since the beginning of time, this follows two cops from very different backgrounds. Ward, a human and Jakoby, an orc , embark on a routine night patrol that will alter the future of their world as they know it.
The first thing you notice about this film is how great it looks. The make up and special affects really are stunning. The second is how old Will Smith is looking. 
The film itself is pretty good. I'm not a big lover of fantasy movies but because this is set in a modern day, gritty world it feels more relative.
I did prefer the first half where we follow the cops and they experience the prejudices amongst the public and their own colleagues more than the second half which is where the fantasy action goes into overdrive. Bright feels like a a cross between the 1988 film Alien Nation and the Underworld series of movies. 
If I had to criticise it , I would say it has too many clichés that get a little corny after a while but overall I enjoyed it.",Bright

44,a_chinn,Derivative but enjoyable buddy cop fantasy film,6,10 January 2021,"Think ""Alien Nation"" meets ""Lord of the Rings"" set in the world of ""Training Day"". From director David Ayer (""Street Kings"" ""Fury"" ""End of Watch"") comes yet another gritty LAPD crime film, except this time the jaded veteran police officer (Will Smith) finds that his new partner is a Tolkien style of Orc, the first of his kind to join the LAPD. Taking place in a modern day Los Angeles that also happens to include magical creatures filling the gritty crime filled streets, the story tackles racism and intolerance within a pretty standard action film plot, involving the two having to protect a witness and a stolen object, which in this oddball fantasy world is an elf girl and a magic wand. Much like ""Alien Nation"" and much like every other buddy cop film, the two unlikely partners learn to appreciate one other by the end and use their collective skills solve their mystery. That's the main detraction for the film, that it's so utterly familiar, but the fairy-world colliding Ayer's very gritty ""Training Day"" version of LA is pretty irresistible. This kind of world building is pretty fun, even if the film doesn't go into it too deep. Overall, ""Bright"" is a highly unoriginal and derivative story, but the solid cast and the genre mash-up elements make it never boring and an entertaining if forgettable experience.",Bright

54,Troy_Campbell,"B-grade fun, but could have been so much more.",5,30 December 2017,"Netflix have been producing and distributing original movies for a few years now, slowly but surely cutting into the typical cinema-then-DVD/Video system that has been around for decades. But until now it has largely been award-bait dramas-Mudbound, Beasts of No Nation-or Adam Sandler flicks. Having been picked up for a whopping $90m (their most expensive film to date) and starring Will Smith, one of our generation's most beloved (and costly) action heroes, Netflix has officially dipped their toe in blockbuster waters. The potential significance of this release on the cinematic landscape aside, how does this fantasy buddy-cop outing actually fare? Well, much like director David Ayer's career, this tale of orcs and elves and humans grinding it out on the streets of L.A. is hit and miss. Ayer injects his usual gritty urban bluster, à la End of Watch and Street Kings, which is definitely not everyone's cup of tea; however, the futuristic setting provides enough of a tweak to make it more interesting than normal. Scripted by the inconsistent Max Landis-highs: Chronicle, American Ultra; lows: Victor Frankenstein, Mr. Right-there's enough social commentary here to fill a feature-length 60 Minutes episode, whilst the climax is positively lame and the dialogue is simultaneously cool and tired. Regardless of your tolerance levels for the on-the-nose style of both Ayer and Landis, there's no denying that Will Smith and Joel Edgerton make for a fantastic pairing. Smith brings his trademark coolest-guy-in-the-room attitude to badass human cop Daryl Ward, while Edgerton steals the bulk of laughs as Ward's by-the-book orc partner Nick Jakoby; their chemistry shining through despite the messy plot and occasionally murky set pieces. Energetic, violent and all over the shop, Bright is B-grade fun thanks to its A-list stars, but it could've been so much more.",Bright

56,pyrocitor,Dim,4,13 March 2018,"'Lord of the Rings meets Lethal Weapon' reads as a film pitch cooked up in a basement by a 14-year old, doped up on hours of Diet Coke and Call of Duty - a 'high concept' only in the most literal sense of the world. Still, it's unexpected, goofy, and replete with playful potential that it just may have been crazy enough to work. The key to it working, naturally, being acknowledgement of how crazy it is. Unfortunately, that memo was one messenger eagle that director David Ayer and writer Max Landis didn't quite receive in time. And lo: the prophecy of the mischievous, tongue-in-cheek genre revisionism that might have been became consumed by a shroud of darkness - in ever sense of the word. And from that darkness - asininely self-important, drearily predictable, and executed with the lumbering, pitiful tactlessness of a hobbit let loose in a brewery - nothing could emerge. Least of all, anything Bright. If a director's paramount priority is confidence in their project, Ayer certainly earned his paycheque, as it's impossible to imagine a more daftly earnest take on his given material, even from the director of the painfully idiotic Suicide Squad. Tackling his film's dissonant fantasy and gritty, urban crime tropes with a ludicrously self-important swagger, Ayer's film is so deliriously serious that, paradoxically, it's impossible to take even remotely seriously. For all the expansive potential of its conceit, Bright is a dour, plodding, paint-by-numbers cop thriller, replete with more MacGuffins, conveniences, cloying foreshadowing, and exposition than you can shake a glock at, all enacted with joyless stupefaction... and fairies. Ah - but didn't you know? The fantasy creatures are A-LLE-GOR-I-CAL, a word Landis has clearly searched on Urban Dictionary while flossing with the pages of his Superman back issues. Behold: in the midst of the genre crossover nobody was craving comes a hackneyed commentary on contemporary racial tensions nobody was waiting for, as Landis wears his film's racial subtexts on his sleeve with customary insufferable smugness, and all the insight of a sixth grade civil rights essay. Characters don't speak dialogue so much as burp racial slurs at each other, in a staggeringly misguided thematic dead horse beaten long before the cameras rolled, from the offensively thuggish orcs to a stroll through the walking Gucci commercial of 'Elf Town' that can't help but amusingly recall Who Framed Roger Rabbit's 'Toon Town.' But hey - Landis is a man who got paid millions of dollars for penning the line ""fairy lives don't matter,"" so this is the world we live in, apparently. Amazingly, the clash of stale cop clichés and stale fantasy clichés only serves to amplify rather than negate one another, with the only mirth coming from Ayer's relentless street posturing lending the film airs of surreally heightened nonsense. If you thought watching actors spitting out the words ""magic wand"" with grim scowls on their faces wasn't silly enough, try watching Will Smith murder(?!) the rest of his police squad(!!) over a dispute for the so-called ""magical WMD..."" then falls prey to the outlandishly lazy ""oops, I dropped the wand - y'know that thing that the entire conflict hinges on"" conceit not once, but TWICE! All of a sudden, the ""Starlight"" Elf/Dwarf romantic triangle from Peter Jackson's The Hobbit isn't looking so stupid by comparison, is it?* For a film called Bright (paradoxes are more plentiful than dialogue here), Ayer vomits up a murky soup of grisly hues ranging from 'cement' to 'muddy, bloody cement,"" while lurching from back alleys to cult Elven safe houses to strip clubs. Even the uninspired grey orc prosthetics blend into the visual muck, while the film's sub-par visual effects and perfunctory, sleepy shootouts and fight scenes do little to pep up the drab proceedings. The occasional flickers of visual inventiveness (in one shot, a distant dragon flaps by, framed by a cityscape sunset) are mere flirtations of the world and movie we'd love to burst out and explore if we could shake off the infuriatingly daft, small-minded story blinders we're shackled to. (Side note: spending an entire movie announcing the triumphant return of 'The Dark Lord,' only to leave genre diehards suffering through this mess with fantasy blueballs, is particularly unconscionable salt rubbed into a wound of disappointment) Even Will Smith's inherent charm is quashed under a veneer of sour, unrelenting unpleasantness, while the prosthetics-laden Joel Edgerton, bizarrely elects to play his put-upon orc officer as a dopey, sweet simpleton, making him arguably even more dislikable. The two hit upon embers of chemistry, and it's easy to imagine enjoying their banter under different circumstances, but their flamboyantly dissonant, but equally sloppy, performances range from drab to obnoxious here instead. Supporting them, Lucy Fry contributes nothing more than frustrating noise as an irritating riff on Milla Jovovich from The Fifth Element, while Noomi Rapace, though promisingly conjuring kernels of sleek menace, is far too under-utilized a foe to generate much scenery-chewing threat. Still, muzzling the excellent Margaret Cho with a wholly unironic performance as a grim, kinda racist police chief, is perhaps the film's missed opportunity for fun. When even the career comedians don't get to provide comedic relief, you know something is rotten in the state of potential. That rare bastardization of pop culture that would see both Tolkien and Shane Black fans cueing up to tape David Ayer to a chair, and force him to watch endless replays of Jared Leto's Joker, Clockwork Orange style, as penance, Netflix's $90 gambit may not have been as costly a bellyflop as it would've been as a cinematic release. But a proposed SEQUEL, with Ayer still attached?! The future is (you asked for it) not so Bright. In the words of its cavalierly disgraced lore: Bright shall... not... pass! -4/10 *Just kidding. It's still so stupid I probably sacrificed at least 15 brain cells just remembering it.",Bright

61,sharky_55,"Dude, you can't go through Elftown.",5,30 December 2017,"David Ayer's Netflix blockbuster Bright tries to be a few different things at once and ends up being a watered down mess. The basic premise riffs off material that Ayer is quite comfortable with by now; he wrote Training Day and directed End of Watch, with the latter possessing plenty of heart and injecting something fresh from the old trick of handheld footage. But add Max Landis' blend of the LAPD street scene and stock standard fantasy creatures and you have a film that bites off a little more than it can chew. The opening montage steals from dozens of familiar movies, cycling through street snapshots over rap music and leaning on decades of Hollywood iconography that firmly declare the urban ghetto as an irredeemable pit. Only this time there's cute add ons that signal the supernatural twist on the world: racist graffiti spewing hatred for the lower class orcs (and not so subtle references to black power - Be Yorcself, really?), Tolkien-inspired apartheid that designate Elf-only zones. If there was a time for the generic intro with animated figurines over narrated voiceover this was it; most of the lore and history of the world of Bright is spluttered out in between two hours of murky, inconsequential action sequences. The characters barely have time to spit out (or in the Inferni's case, hiss) throwaway dialogue before they rush to the next bar/car park. You can easily point out when and where the filmmakers decided their audience might need a bit of a catch up; in one scene, FBI magic division agent Hildebrandt Ulysses Montehugh (yes, that is his actual name) all but asks his partner for a sparknotes summary of the major players and their motivations. It's like the infamous line from Jon Turturro in Transformers 2 that sounds exactly like a script note mistaken for dialogue, ""Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it."" This is storytelling of the laziest, lowest calibre (and no, a three second shot of a CGI dragon flying across the moon does not count as world-building). By the time we're two thirds in and Jakoby finally namedrops the fabled hero that banished the Dark Lord two thousand years ago, we're long past trying to piece together all the plot threads and whispers of ancient prophecies. Even Jakoby himself, whose early dialogue doubles as an extension of his goofy, often oblivious personality (""Something unusual happened here.""), can't manage to sell it. That's Joel Edgerton in an unrecognisable performance, and it's one of the times where that adjective truly means it. Apart from his gruff delivery, the makeup well and truly replaces his golden locks with a stumpy nose and ears. But what use is it when every other orc in the movie looks exactly the same? Ayer might think he is making a strong case against racism and discrimination, but while his opening may flash social satire, the rest of his talking points are merely redressed from our own world, brief pointers that are more snark than insight (""Fairy lives don't matter today!""). The orcs all carry pieces, wear oversized basketball jerseys and make up the majority of pro football offensive lines. Will Smith, as the morally conflicted lead, is supposed to be the arbiter, but while he makes the emotional core work (his wife and daughter are given all of two scenes, but Smith's always shined in these everyman roles), prior to the climax he's still spouting racist slurs (and a reference to Shrek?) and looking to confirm those tagged slogans from the opening. And the film all but ignores the fact that Ward is a minority to himself - this is a neatly packaged alternate present where the entire human race has been squished into the middle. You'd think the elves might be able to pick things up when they enter the fray. They've always been the sleekest and coolest creatures in any fantasy setting, graceful and deadly at the same time. Rapace and Ramirez head the two opposing forces, but they look stiff and embarrassed behind a mountain of makeup, plastic fangs and cartoonish contact lenses. This is a 90 million dollar school play. Their expressions as they deliver these corny lines say as much as anything. They carry so much pent up self-seriousness because the only other alternative that could work is the mocking tone of a youtube sketch. There's a moment where Lielah is asked who she is (because the past hour hasn't done enough to fill us in), and her answer almost seems to be poking fun at how paper thin her characterisation is. But this isn't that smart. Or self aware.",Bright
62,one9eighty,Under the radar hollywood style film,5,28 February 2018,"In a world where fantasy and reality live side by side this film follows two cops embroiled in their own race politics issue, while trying to save the world from an evil that could be unleashed, and dealing with corruption along the way. As I was watching this I kept thinking that the film felt like another film, and this happened a lot. At times it felt like a cop movie I've seen before, or at other times it felt like a chase film I'd seen. That feeling of de-ja-film happened a lot through this. It was an enjoyable film, not one for the youngsters due to the language and action but not the worst film I've seen this year. Based on the adverts and promo's I'd seen, this was not what I expected, unfortunately I expected something more fantasy based rather than something as gritty and dark and that expectation wasn't met. That gritty, darkness was the main achievement this film got right though - the reality portrayed with different races co-existing, and the sub-species or social groups that live within those circles, that felt right. Unfortunately that was the main originality that film achieved because a lot of everything else felt like I'd seen it before (going back to the de-ja-film feeling).Not as bad as the bad reviews, not as good as the good reviews.

65,carbuff,"It'll likely keep your attention with the action, but totally derivative and cliched.",3,6 May 2019,"I really wanted to favorably review ""Bright"", because there are so few really good sci-fi/fantasy films made; however, as this mess drags along endlessly, and just becomes more and more annoyingly derivative and cliched. Take one of those super-fancy, ultra-expensive, thousand-horsepower blenders, then grab any old generic Will Smith action movie you happen to have lying around, stuff Tolkien's life work in there too, spice it up with a few miscellaneous fantasy elements you might have in the cupboards, and a good bit of ""the hood"". Once it's all in, hit high-speed, and take a slow walk around the block. Turn the blender off, and pour out the bland gruel, the consumption of which is supposed to sanctimoniously lift us to a higher moral plane. Here's where I should be complaining about wanting two hours of life back, but, the reality is that I was going to watch this movie just to see if the even approached success. So it's ""my bad"". It was a really hope against hope, but if I hadn't sacrificed those two hours, I would always have been curious. This experience further justifies my belief that if you've seen one Will Smith film, you've pretty much seen them all, and I've seen much more than one of them. Let's just say that the direction this film was going was obvious in the very beginning, and only got more obvious as it went along. If this is what you're after, you now know right where to get it.

67,mitsubishizero,I wanted to like this movie.,4,18 November 2018,"Some of the characters, effects and the action are cool but the story and how the world works isn't really put together. Apparently, the orcs are one of the minorities while elves run the world. Did everybody just kumbiyah to hate on these creatures? There's one scene where a friend of one of the main characters Daryl Ward (Will Smith) named Rodriguez (Jay Hernandez) mentions still getting chewed out for The Alamo. That was centuries ago and it almost makes you wonder if Mexicans still get chewed out about that. As previously mentioned before, Will Smith plays an LAPD officer Daryl Ward. He's assigned a new partner named Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) much to the former's dismay. The reason? His partner's an orc and there was an incident where Ward was shot during a chase and Nick failed to apprehend the ork that apparently robbed a store. As a consequence the whole police force distrust him.Things don't get any better when they arrest a mysterious man who speaks the orcish language claiming that the ""Dark Lord"" will return and if that's not strange enough, it gets confusing when an extremist group called the 'Shield of Light' led by a creepy, fanatical elf named Leilah (Noomi Rapace) come into the picture. They want the wand in order to free their master. They already have two and need the third one. As they continue to investigate, they come across a surviving witness named Tikka (Lucy Fry) who has the wand and was a former member of the the group before defecting. One thing I find annoying is how in most the movie, she acts like she doesn't understand English until towards the end. I can understand why but could you imagine how much better things would've been if she told them what she knew earlier?! I find it frustrating how she tells them that she ""trust them"" despite all they've done for her throughout the film.The deeper they go, the shadier things become. There's a scene where after Ward calls the police force for backup, they try to convince him to kill his partner and steal the wand. Thankfully he plays along and kills them all in self-defense. This unfortunately attracts the attention of the a gang who's leader named Poison, wants the wand for himself believing it'll help him regain his ability to walk. At this point they're pretty much fighting for their lives. I could go on about this but I think that's enough.The big problem is simply the commentary. It's uneven and while the setting's interesting, sometimes how it works isn't well defined. I like the idea of fantasy mixed in with the modern world. I just don't think it was well developed. Rather, it was clumsily introduced.While it has some funny moments and the action scenes are cool, most of the characters are unlikable, stupid and hard to root for though in the case of Ward he does show some development during the course of the movie. Some. If you want to see just the action and the fantasy elements, that's fine. But if you're looking for a good story to match, you definitely won't find it here. Look elsewhere.",Bright
68,markthomassintek,Expected more than what was delivered,7,25 December 2017,"REVIEW - BRIGHT A Netflix original film. The anticipation and expectation sometimes is better than reality. Bright is such a film. The acting is excellent, the story is interesting and of course the stunts and special effects are great but unfortunately the film lacks one thing.The film doesn't deserve the bad reviews it has been getting because it is a good watch but not a great watch which is the essential thing that this film lacks, you expect more from the whole experience. This I personally feel is why this film has been getting such bad reviews because with the film having such a lot going for it your left thinking was that it. Rating 7 out of 10",Bright
69,kjproulx,"A Slick, Uneven Action/Thriller",6,3 January 2018,"In an era of big-budget studio films, it's nice to see a smaller budget taking on an incredibly interesting concept. Even if the end result is mostly uneven, the fact that Netflix was willing to take a risk with something that definitely wouldn't be for everyone is commendable enough. Personally, Bright isn't a movie that many people will be talking about, but with a few tweaks, could've been the talk of the town. It kind of disappoints me when an interesting concept digs itself a grave by not having a good enough script to carry the likable premise. Here's why I believe Bright deserves your time, but not immediately.Will Smith leads this film, and as always, his charisma definitely helps the feel of the overall film. He and Joel Edgerton play an unlikely duo of police officers patrolling a town in a fantasy world. Humans, Orcs, Fairies, Elves, and numerous other creatures roam the streets in pursuance of a wand. Only those known as brights can wield it and its powers slowly surface throughout the course of the movie. The story itself is as old as time itself, but the world surrounding it is what makes it worthwhile.If for nothing else, Bright is a unique film visually, providing characters that feel well-realized and scenery that feels real. From sweeping shots of the city with dragons flying through the skies to racist dialogue that really makes a statement about our society, there are quite a few aspects to enjoy about this feature film. When it comes to scenery and world-building, a movie can only be so enjoyable though. The premise and repetitive nature of this movie are truly what took it down a notch for me.Movies that repeat the same beats throughout its duration bug me. Bright involves many sequences of gunfights and Daryl (Smith) realizing that his Orc partner, Nick (Edgerton), isn't such a bad guy and not all Orcs are bad. This aspect annoyed me because that's revisited too much throughout the film and you can see each moment coming from a mile away. That being said, their chemistry and development throughout the film are what makes this a joy to experience. I would love to see more of their banter in the future.The climax of this film is very exciting and the action leading up to is even more so at times, but the movie doesn't take enough risks in terms of story. As I mentioned, you'll see the ending coming from a mile away, but you'll grow to love these characters and wish for a sequel to come in the coming years. I would love to see this film become a franchise because there are so many ways of expanding this particular world. I see potential like crazy within Bright.In the end, Bright didn't blow me away, but I was impressed with the world that's set up here, which is mainly due to the unique script, done by Max Landis. The story itself needs work, but I enjoyed seeing his ideas on-screen. The direction is solid and the soundtrack really makes you feel like you're living in this world with these creatures. This is a very believable premise, due to the lower budget of the overall picture.I can't really recommend this movie to average moviegoers because there are some pretty bizarre aspects, but for those who find weird and unique storytelling interesting, then Bright will be the movie for you. It's incredibly predictable, but the world itself is worth watching. Even though Avatar is a better film, I would compare it to that. Great world-building, but exploring a predictable premise.",Bright
70,kuarinofu,Enjoyed it,8,4 February 2018,"This was a well done story-driven action movie. I enjoyed it even though it was quite predictable by the end. At first I thought that it would be some sort of heavy political commentary but it's not. It doesn't focus too much on being mind-provoking and that does good for this movie.
It had some flaws though: movie took a long time to understand what it's trying to be, it had some Ayer'ish cliches, some weird writing, continuity, undeveloped characters etc. 
Yet it was well acted most of the time, the chemistry between Ward and the Orc was believable, action was good and it wasn't too long. The humor was not as cringy as it comes nowadays and worked OK most of the time.
It could've been a little better if they would've spent more time on expanding the world (since it feels a little shallow) and clarifying the bad elves motivation a little more, since it just left me confused over what they want exactly. Guess they were afraid to overload the movie with exposition. 
Give it a try, it's a good movie.",Bright
71,anselmdaniel,High budget entertainment,6,27 June 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Bright is a Netflix original movie starring Will Smith and is directed by David Ayer.David Ayer previously directed Suicide Squad. Bright is set in a world where fantasy races such as elves, faeries, and orcs exist in the present day. These races are brought into the modern world as if they existed today. Magic exists in this world, but it has been de-emphasized from modern society. Magic exists in the form of wands.The entire story follows a pair of cops as they discover a wand. Due to the ability of a wand to grant wishes, it becomes an item sought after by many organizations. Bright is primarily a buddy cop movie with a fantasy setting. Many of the tropes and cliches from a buddy cop movie can be found here. However, it is not executed as well as it can be. The setting ultimately proved to be more exciting than the actual plot. I wanted to know how the world came to be. How orcs organized themselves when they were under the dark lord. Why the antagonistic elves believe that they should bring back the ark lord. Sadly, these answers are not given, and the movie focuses on its A plot instead. The movie felt like it did not want to use its setting even though it was its strength.The acting is well done, but the directing and editing are not up to par. The movie had good scenes, but as a whole the directing is bland. The movie had issues with editing that plagued David Ayer's last movie, Suicide Squad. The writing for the main arc is bland, but the setting is fun.Bright is difficult to recommend. It is not a good movie. It has too many faults that stop it from becoming a great movie. It is however, fun and different. Netflix funding an original movie should be commended, even if the overall package is not up to snuff. Bright is recommended.Grade: D",Bright

75,Alexander_Blanchett,"Too ambitious for its own good, but still fine",6,30 December 2017,"It had potential as Will Smith usually shines in the role of an authority, especially when he is allowed to bring humor and irony in. Also David Ayer proved with ""End of Watch"" that he is the right director for a cop film. The idea to mix that genre with fantasy was ambitious but could have worked well if handled correctly. 
Too bad the film was full of flaws. First of all the awful screenplay. Not only the dialogue were outrageous but also the structure was all over the place. I think the film could have worked with the fantasy setting but without the overload of fantasy elements, kind of like ""District 9"" maybe. Too bad they tried to go a different route with it and tried to build up an own legacy which was too ambitious. 
Will Smith was not really good. I don't know what it was but he really had not the energy nor charisma he usually has, especially in films like that. I really muss 90s Big Willy. 
Joel Edgerton on the other hand was really great and gave an emotional performance and was even able to add a lot of depth to his awful dialogues. 
Noomi Rapace was awfully wasted, I mean besides her last couple of minutes screen time she hardly had any dialogue. Too bad to waste such an actress, who may have been physically been perfect for there role, with one word dialogues like ""Traitor"" ... oh well.

77,CANpatbuck3664,Bright is Ambitious Project That Casts 3/4 of the Urban Fantasy Blockbuster Spell Correctly,7,25 December 2017,"Urban fantasy is one of those genres that hasn't been effectively translated to movies yet. It works really well in books but meshing a real-life environment with stuff like orcs, elves and fairies is difficult. What I appreciated the most about Bright is that there was a concerted and successful effort to integrate these ideas into contemporary Los Angeles. You have to be open to picturing this world (a leap of faith I don't think a lot of the critics were ready to make) but if you can suspend disbelief, I think you'll appreciate how interesting Bright can be. One of Ayer's best qualities as a filmmaker is that he knows how to drop you into gritty and tough environments and build that atmosphere. I think that this would have been a tough task for anyone to sell these concepts, but Ayer was an inspired choice to take these creatures and this lore and make it palatable to the movie-going public. Max Landis (the primary screenwriter) deserves credit too and there wasn't a moment where I wasn't looking forward to what they were going to incorporate into the next scene.The budget on this was big for Netflix and I think the place where it shows is the excellent makeup work and the special effects. They looked fantastic, there wasn't a point where I didn't buy any of it and it really helped sell the world this movie was building. So many people wanted to dismiss this movie and if the action, makeup or creative work with the visuals hadn't been up to par, it would have given them an easy excuse. Luckily, the movie doesn't falter in these areas.I think the acting in the movie is solid the whole way around. I think Joel Edgerton is the strongest of the group. Jakoby is meek and naive as a character but through Edgerton, he is by far the most sympathetic. I wanted to see him grow and make it through the night. He helped at least make the character memorable and I would like to see him in the sequel. Will Smith did a fine job, he's funny in certain scenes and he builds things up with Edgerton over time. He's an awkward fit in this genre but he's decent overall. Some of the supporting characters were fine but I don't think they were given much to do. Noomi Rapace, Edgar Ramirez and Lucy Fry are all serviceable but don't have a lot to do. Rapace and Fry at least get a couple of decent action moments. Jay Hernandez and Dawn Oliveri are in the movie very little. If I was surprised by someone, Ike Barinholtz was pretty good in his supporting part as Pollard. He's pretty menacing and I liked him a lot better in this than his Suicide Squad role.The movie wants you to invest in the friendship/partnership of Ward and Jakoby. I don't think they're the strongest characters but by the end I did think they became believable as friends. The events of the night escalate as organically as they could and because of what they had to face, eventually I bought into it.As much as I appreciated the obvious ambition of Ayer, Landis and the crew, this movie is far from perfect. The movie is interesting in the beginning, but it takes a while to truly shift into gear. The biggest flaw for me was that the dialogue in this movie sorely needed a punch-up job. The dialogue almost falls completely flat and Smith and Edgerton's chemistry suffers for it. One of the things that made End of Watch special was how funny Gyllenhaal and Pena were when they were just hanging out in the patrol car. This movie sorely needed that kind of banter to help move some things along. There are lines that are so bad that I had to keep myself from slapping my own head. This problem falls on Landis and Ayer (who wrote his own draft of this script) and the comedy is hit or miss. The other slip up is that the movie is less than subtle in addressing the social commentary its going for. I think the movie has a lot of good things to say but especially in the beginning, they're beating you over the head with it. We needed a little more velvet glove instead of a hammer.This movie had a lot of risk vs reward. There's nothing that closely resembles this in the current movie landscape (ya I heard about Shadowrun and Alien Nation) and this was brave of any studio to take on. This is a mixed bag for sure but don't be so dismissive of this. The internet and the critics were ready to dog pile on Ayer after Suicide Squad. The guy is not a hack and he's made some really good movies (End of Watch is awesome, and Fury is at minimum as good war movie). His recent output (including SSquad) has been admittedly more varied. Although they didn't hit it out of the park, this premise and this world have potential and they could build something great off of this. There's a reason that the audience ratings on this are high and hopefully they clear up some of the issues in the sequel. I'd give this a 7-7.5/10",Bright
78,phenomynouss,the critics weren't wrong,3,27 December 2017,"When the film is done delivering some of the absolute worst allegories for police racism in the form of Orcs basically being Black people (and Jews, in the form of ""You did something bad 2000 years ago and we hate you forever for it), and Elves basically being White people (and Jews, in the form of ""Elves control the world""), this movie commits its most egregious sin: it's boring.
the movie starts with some modern-era graffiti involving Orcs and Elves and implying some epic backstory in which the Orcs sided with some ""Dark Lord"" 2000 years ago and were defeated, and have subsequently been treated like garbage ever since. This is referenced several times, but with absolutely nothing actually done with it, including no indication that the Orcs are even religious or show any sort of devotion or fealty to any sort of Lord, dark or otherwise.
As well, along with some cringeworthy racial-ish lines like ""Fairy lives don't matter"", we're pummeled with a sort of blatant anti-Orc racism that would be more suited for a 1950s police department setting than a modern day one, with no clear indication that there has been some manner of racial equality between different human races due to the presence of Orcs and Elves.
Meanwhile, rather than give us something interesting like Orc and Elf culture of some sort (either some mix of Tolkien/Warcraft or something completely different) being modernized and put alongside Human, we just get Orcs basically made into a caricature of ""black people in the ghetto"", as they wear bandanas and necklaces and hang around in ""clans"" (basically gangs) and live in poverty in LA and have a hatred and distrust of the police.The Elves on the other hand live in a stretch of the city that is so luxurious that it has perpetual security blocking off all entry and exit at all times.Once we get passed the hamfisted racial allegories, we get to the core story, in which an Elf who is a member of some secret ""Way Better Than The Illuminati"" secret society (they literally have a line mentioning that this group destroyed the Illuminati) escapes with a magic wand, which is capable of granting wishes to anyone who uses it, but only people who are ""Brights"" can use the magic wand.
Despite this, a Hispanic gang and the LAPD lose their minds and start sending death squads after Will Smith's character and the Orc Nick Jakoby trying to get the wand. This leads them through some wacky adventures in LA getting shot at and betrayed constantly and beat up before we discover at the end that Will Smith's character is a Bright and can use the wand, because at least one of them had to be a Bright.
It ends with everyone being happy and accepting the Orc cop because he and Will Smith foiled a caper that could've literally lead to the end of the world to some degree. And I'm sure if they had failed, everyone would've gone back to saying ""Orcs can't be cops"" and being racist to the Orc cop because they only like him when he's useful.
On its own, this movie is not good enough to be awful. It skirts the line between bad and average, and is serviceable as an average ""the world vs two snarky buddy cops"" with all the clichés and tropes associated with it. That it attempted and failed miserably at being an allegory for modern day racism is likely what crushed it so badly among critics. With or without that, it was an overall boring experience.",Bright

81,PyroSikTh,"Unremarkable, but Good Fun",7,23 December 2017,"I've been looking forward to this movie for quite some time. Your typical fantasy tropes of Orcs and Elves and Magic Wands thrust into a gritty street crime thriller? It sounds bonkers...and amazing. At absolute worst Bright was guaranteed to be good fun. And it is. It really is. It's exactly what you'd expect, with Will Smith being Will Smith, cooped up in a car with an Orc amidst the completely unsubtle racial tensions of LA. They stumble upon a murder scene with a scared Elf huddling with a magic wand at the centre of it, and have to avoid the local gangsters, the Orc community, a cult of renegade Elves, and the Magic Task Force arm of the FBI across the streets of LA. No matter the cost, no-one can get their hands on the wand.And this is where the tantalising world-building comes in. Bright is chock-full of tiny little details and backstory that ooze through every scene and ultimately just causes you to want to know more. The title comes from the designation of magic users; those who are born with the ability to wield wands without blowing themselves up. Brights are usually Elves, but every now and then you get human Brights as well. Since the rise and fall of a Dark Lord two thousand years previously, magic has been outlawed and sought out by the authorities. This means most Brights don't even know what they are, and the only way to find out is to grab hold of a wand, which has a high chance of blowing you (and everyone around you) up. For some the risk is worth it, as the power a wand grants is limitless.Then there's the aforementioned racial tensions. There's a mention of nine races in this world, but humans, Elves, and Orcs get all the attention in Bright. The Orcs are the black community, sticking together like family, but succumbing to drugs and violence, and often treated unfairly by the police and other races. Meanwhile the Elves are the upper class rich race who have their own Dubai-esque district full of supercars, gold, and towering glass skyscrapers. The humans are stuck somewhere in the middle. However there's a whole bunch of teases and hints as to the other races. There's an amusing opening sequence between Will Smith and a fairy, who are treated like pests, there's a quick shot of a centaur dressed in police riot gear, and there's even a dragon flying in the LA skyline. I'm looking for the already-ordered sequel just to see more of these races being translated into the modern world. Dwarves? Skeleton hordes? Rat-men? Gnomes? Treefolk? They could go anywhere with it!Bright is full of clichés and tropes though, of course. There isn't really anything new here, on the crime thriller side or the fantasy side. What makes Bright feel fresh is purely in the combination of the two genres. There's still a Dark Lord, the Elves are still stuck-up, high-maintenance people, there's a prophecy with chosen ones. And then of course the whole racial tensions thing is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. Orcs and Mexicans are still organised by gangs, there's corrupt cops, the buddy cop angle is full of one-liners and banter. As such, if you're familiar with either genre, there are few surprises. In fact it can get downright predictable at times.Acting is so-so, with no-one particularly standing out. Will Smith is Will Smith and there's little more to say about that. He's at his best delivering one-liners and being a charming leading man, but as always he struggles with the more dramatic moments. Joel Edgerton does a lot behind his new face of make-up, but it never quite tantalises, and often he just looks a little awkward and uncomfortable. Noomi Rapace is pretty much just a pretty-face antagonist who has about two lines in English. Edgar Ramirez, Lucy Fry, Happy Anderson, Ike Barinholtz, Brad William Henke, and Jay Hernandez all do well in their supporting roles though.Visually Bright somehow manages to balance the gritty, street-level aesthetic of downtown LA with the more loftier spectacles like the glowing, dripping wand, and mystical forms of death and destruction. While I can't say it offers anything wall-mount worthy, the aesthetics that Bright establishes goes a long way to building the world the story fits in. The majority of the movie is practical effects too, which goes a long way to keep the balance between realistic and fantastical, but it does result in the Orcs looking just a little underwhelming. They look more like humans with severe skin conditions than full-blooded Orcs (which are traditionally corrupted Elves, but who knows if that's the route Bright takes or not).Bright is no masterpiece, that's for sure. It's proven quite polarising between critics and audiences because of this. It's well-made, but doesn't make any strides on a technical level. The writing is serviceable, with a shaky third act, but it's offset by teasing world-building. Judged purely from an objective standpoint, Bright is an average flick, neither great or horrendous. I find myself wanting to know more though, and I'll gladly sink myself back into that world for as many sequels as Netflix wants to give us. It's thoroughly enjoyable with some fantastic moments (Will Smith gunning down four antagonists in slow motion to Bastille's World Gone Mad is certainly a high point), chuckle-inducing humour, and a plot that holds more potential than it admittedly capitalises on. I give Bright an enjoyable but unremarkable 7/10.",Bright

84,JakeBrinkman,A great story with an excellent concept,9,10 February 2019,"I am blown away that my opinion of this film is so drastically different from the ratings and critic reviews. Some movies are understandable as dumb action blockbusters or silly comedies, but Bright is not one of those films. This is a movie that truly deserves to be enjoyed by all.The concept of a Tolkien-esque world in modern times is completely unique, at least compared with any other high budget films. This movie tackles race issues in a buddy cop film with possible government conspiracies and something supernatural, none of which are entirely new concepts, and many of them have even been mixed together in films before. However, the addition of the other medieval fantasy races creates an entirely new layer behind everything to give a breath of fresh air into each of these old ""genres"".The primary complaint that I have seen against the film is that the world is not built well or not explained well, and this is completely false. Perhaps these reviewers have grown accustomed to fantasy films that take very long introducitons to explain how the world works and why certain things are done. Bright recognizes that people don't actually take several minutes to explain everything that everyone in their world would already know, and it elects not to slow down the story with a voice-over narration. Instead, it very cleverly introduces concepts through conversation that sounds very casual and fitting, and these scattered clues reveal plenty for the viewer to gain a full grasp of the aspects of the world that are important to the story. They also hint at many other concepts that aren't relevant to the story but still provide a glimpse into the vast world that this movie has expertly crafted.Beyond that, this is a movie with great humor, action, and drama, and I highly recommend it to anyone. My only complaint is that the primary villain's motives aren't very well explained. However, there are enough secondary villains and race issue conflicts that it doesn't stand out too much. And perhaps they are saving that explanation for the sequel, which I am very excited to watch.",Bright
85,MovieCriticOnline,What did I just watch?,1,29 December 2017,"David Ayer basically copied and pasted from his old scripts, like Training Day, End of Watch and his other cop movies (BTW, is all he does is cop movies set in LA?), and then changed some of the characters to, let's see, elves, orcs, yeah that's the ticket. Grab creatures from Lord of The Rings and set them in a LA gang/cop murder mystery and hopefully no one will notice everything was done before in his other films, as I mentioned above.But apparently a lot of people have grown low tolerance level for below mediocre films these days, because Hollywood keeps making them, one after the other.My wish: Stop making crap.",Bright

David Ayer Is One of My Favorite Directors of all time Harsh Times, Street Kings, End of Watch, Sabotage, Fury, Suicide Squad one of my favorite movies of time. This was pretty good it's like End of Watch Meets Lord of Rings to Suicide Squad like Deadshot teams with Killer Croc and Witch but expect it's not a witch it's more of Elf's And Orc's This was such a perfect Storyline Perfect FULL ON the action mixed with fantasy and gore that's how Suicide Squad should have been sadly Gore R RATED. that would be great but shame it didn't happen In Suicide Squad. This Has More Action full on i thought Will Smith Character is such badasswith a lot of bad attitude rather then him playing prisoner Assassin. but this is badass, and cast from another's are from suicide squad Prison Guard Actor 
(Ike Barinholtz) was in this and you have Jay Hernandez Not as his Diablo, and of crouse will smith. but this is a lot more of Lord of Rings style with Orc's and Elf's It's NOTHING AND NOTING LIKE Suicide Squad. different Fantasy style of movie. now story follows In an alternate present World with humans and fantasy creatures-Orcs, Fairies, Elves, Centaurs, Dwarves have co-existed since the beginning of time, human LAPD officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) and Orc rookie officer Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) are partners in movie they were good characters specially i loved fact how this is like end of watch style of movie with LA and Gangs Cartels and all that, that what turned me on with this movie. Nick Jakoby was really good character in this movie and they both went to random safe house with all gangsters live in house they have found some mystery magic wand now guys this has noting to do with Harry Potter he would have stick the wand Expelliarmus up his butt and this has noting to do with Lord of rings. and they have found woman who is a Elf Tikka (Lucy Fry) and reason they are on run is because Ward and Jakoby are product girl and Wand or else that was thought to be destroyed, and Encounter a Darkness that will ultimately alter the future and their world as they know it. Villain was Leilah (Noomi Rapace) who is after Ward and Jakoby and Tikka is Because they toke Wand and Leilah and rest of her Elf's are after Them for Wand so it's Wand and Jakoby running all night and it's thrilling and intense movie and action was soo good and a lot fun and strip club action scene was soo good and elf's coming in shooting another gangsters was such good scene a lot of blood and gore in this movie. Jay Hernandez doesn't do much in this movie sadly i like Jay Hernandez as actor is really not in movie as much, could giving more of him to do, and movie is pretty full on mixed action and fantasy in movie and it's like pretty much full on non stop film it goes on believe me you won't be disappointed like critics screw Critics they thought this was going to be like Suicide Squad 2 ??? ha ha well it's not i like different thing with Human and Orc's buddy cop movie witch is great. i don't want spoil everything else and action god this was such a great movie. Critics got this movie wrong to flop this movie badly well guess WHAT AVOID IT they got this pretty much wrong what's their to hate about this movie noting WATCH IT AND ENJOY IT please if this was in theaters everyone would go download it and see it on Netflix well this movie is Netflix release sadly i wanted to see this movie in theater. this is highly recommended movie go and fu*kin see it don't see any of spoiled trailers don't go and listen to critics if you ever do ! your missing out of a great movie believe me you can't always listen to them all time who knows you going to like movie it's not long long movie of all time. 1h 57 running time go and see it on Netflix i wished this movie would come out at theaters. please go and watch you will thank me later.",Bright

Then, I watched some reviews on YouTube, rewatched the movie and realized that they were right.

88,stevenrotherforth,This movie may not shine but the future of home entertainment looks bright,6,11 January 2018,"BrightSadly the concept is much greater than the execution in David Ayers second collaboration with Will Smith.
A world where fantasy creatures dwell along with humans and everyone struggles to get along.Bright is by no means a bad movie and a definite improvement over Director and Stars last outing, the suicidal Suicide Squad.
Bright fails to become anything more than just an interesting idea. I can see why this movie was green lit. It is definitely original and for that it must be commended.
Smith and Edgerton have an erratic chemistry that never really works until the very end of the movie.
Yes that really is Joel Edgerton under all the make up and he does a decent job at conveying a performance through all the paint and prosthetics.
The problem lays in the fact that the movie just isn't memorable.
There's nothing here to write home about.
Nothing jumps off the screen and into the memory.
A film that will be forgotten in the time takes to turn off the TV.
Perhaps that is the films saving grace. This is a big budget movie made straight for TV.
A Netflix original. No need to travel to your nearest multiplex in order to see the Fresh prince beat the dust out of a fairy.
This is a positive. If Netflix do continue to try and make quality big budget projects with A list stars and renowned directors than this can only be a good thing.
Bright the movie may have turned out to be a little dim but the future of home entertainment is certainly looking bright.",Bright

90,Magow-Intermean,Bright Review,9,7 April 2019,"In an alternate Los Angeles where fantasy creatures are a fact of life, Detective Ward (Will Smith) and his orc partner Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) respond to a call, only to discover a terrified elf (Lucy Fry) with a magical artefact that practically everyone is willing to kill for.
If you can imagine a world in which Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings is classed as a historical documentary, then you're not far off the setting of David Ayer's Bright. Two thousand years after 'The Dark Lord' was defeated, a menagerie of fantasy creatures co-exist in modern America. Elves swan around Rodeo Drive shopping for Gucci loafers, fairies sift through rubbish like sparkly, winged raccoons, while orcs have been relegated to a brutish underclass, still living down the millennia-old faux pas of siding with the Big Bad. It's a superb conceit that draws on Tolkien lore, throws in a dash of '90s RPG property Shadowrun and acts as a mirror for the racial divisions of modern-day America.At least that's the idea. The execution, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the premise. From bigoted cops to slimy IA suits and supercilious feds, the characters are drawn with strokes broader than a cave troll's buttocks. Even Smith, one of the most effortlessly charming actors alive, is reduced to a growling, surly flatfoot, barely concealing his resentment at a partner foisted upon him by the department's diversity initiative.
There are sparks of solid action, but Max Landis' script contains too much stilted dialogue to properly ignite.
The racial subtext itself would have more potency if the fantasy factions weren't so stereotypical themselves. Snooty elves are portrayed as the social elite, while orcs are thrash-metal-loving street thugs who sneer at any who remain 'unblooded' - a barely explored ritual that seems to sub for an orcish bar mitzvah. The broader fantasy setting is squandered, too, with a centaur traffic warden and the silhouette of a lone dragon flapping across the Angeleno skyline that only hints at a deeper mythology. Parallels to modern prejudices are still felt, but it's hard not to feel this was all achieved more artfully by Alien Nation back in 1988.The story is similarly undeveloped. Magic users ('brights') are regulated by federal law and magic wands treated as eldritch WMDs. So when Jakoby and Ward stumble upon one such glowing MacGuffin, we're pulled into a street-level pursuit movie, scrambling from venue to venue while dodging fire from a potion of Latin gangsters, an orcish death cult and Rapace's band of ninja elves. There are sparks of solid action amidst the confusion, but Max Landis' script contains too much stilted dialogue to properly ignite.Coming after Suicide Squad, this isn't the David Ayer return to form we'd hoped for. Neither is it the big win Netflix wanted, having dropped $90 million on the project and won a bidding war with Sony and Warner to prove that blockbusters are no longer the domain of cinemas. Netflix may indeed prove that streaming is the future, but that future isn't Bright.Worth watching for the sight of Will Smith beating a fairy to death with a broom, but it takes a far more sophisticated grasp of the fantasy concept to really get away with Mordor.",Bright
91,paulcreeden,Tolkien on Acid?,1,24 December 2017,"Where to begin? The first thing that turned me off were the recycled orc masks. They are just so bad. Halloween in Ohio. Then we move on to Will Smith's house in a gang neighborhood where he and his pretty blonde nurse wife live in harmony with a gang who live on their front lawn. Smith proceeds to smash a tiny humanoid fairy (really?) to death with a broom to the applause of his gangster neighbors. Typical cop drama at its heart with cliche and added political correctness, disguised as grit. Elves represent White Privilege. Orcs represent something hard to figure out. Smith's daughter is the annoying voice of New Left propaganda. This was unwatchable. I found this production extremely disappointing as a veteran Netflix subscriber. Is this the future? Maybe time to look into another streaming service.",Bright
92,ginocox-206-336968,Would be stronger if not diluted by political commentary,7,23 December 2017,"""Bright"" has a lot of very strong elements, but often feels as if periodically the projector gets stuck and displays an image of melting celluloid while some guy walks out on stage with a microphone to announce that the filmmakers would like to interrupt the show to read the screenwriter's homework assignment in high school civics. The film touches on or refers to current social concerns such as immigration, gun control, xenophobia, police corruption, secret government agencies, street gangs, cults, homelessness and police brutality. There are several references to a clan, although not the Klan. A policeman twice escapes dire situations by using less-than-lethal weapons rather than deadly force. An ethnic group dominates professional football, but primarily as linemen. The cast is ethnically diverse, with females in several important roles. A gang leader is confined to a wheelchair as a result of street violence. The automatic weapons are all in the hands of criminals, who fire them indiscriminately in closed areas without any damage from ricochets. Of its 117-minute running time, perhaps 25 - 30 minutes are devoted to political allusions and commentaries which often serve more to distract than to propel the plot, leaving several important plot elements and characters woefully underdeveloped and loose threads untied. In this respect, it is similar to several other recent films that seem distracted by the political agenda of their filmmakers, such as ""Miss Sloane"" and ""Unlocked,"" although not nearly as pretentiously as ""The Life of David Gale"" or ""The Star Chamber."" Other than the frequent interruptions for largely irrelevant PSAs for various liberal causes and a few scenes that seem borrowed from earlier films like ""Alien Nation,"" the film is entertaining with good performances and production values, although much of it occurs in subdued lighting, possibly to facilitate digital effects. A few scenes suffer from distracting camera movement. With so much of the screen time devoted to political content, many of the characters seem two-dimensional. Several characters are shown to have unexpected special powers that aren't explained. A lot of time is devoted to the death of a fairy and fairies are often referred to in dialogue, but aren't integral to the plot. A character's financial troubles are mentioned several times, but not really explored and don't seem to affect the plot. The film could have been much stronger, if the filmmakers had concentrated on the story.",Bright
93,tesswysko,"AMAZING movie, MUST SEE with a few holes...",9,5 March 2019,"I've been putting this Netflix original off for a LONG TIME, because how could it POSSIBLY be a good movie when CLEARLY a huge chunk of their budget must have been in paying Will Smith! Boy was I wrong! Not only was this filmed, paced, and the sets like a big budget, the rest of the cast was big too!Im a HUGE fantasy fan, and VERY critical of fantasy movies that just make up BS excuses for why things are the way they are, and that's ANOTHER reason I avoided this movie, I figured it would be a gritty police procedural with little actual world development... again, WRONG! Not only did they provide really good development for why the world was the way it was, they gave it to you in natural chunks, as thee story developed, not in some awkward, cheap, montage or set of words or pages at the beginning like SO MANY other movies do! KUDOS!The ONLY thing I have to say sideways is that they brought into custody a man making a ruckus in the streets, and found out he was part of some secret group sworn to protect... someone, I've forgotten already, because they only mentioned the group one more time for a split second and it was gone. They acted like utt was important, then dropped it, they should have developed it or left it out.All in all, I LOVED this movie!!! I wish I could go out and buy it! It's like a new ""Legend"" though I doubt Netflix will ever give over the rights. But this is a MUST SEE!!!",Bright
94,CountJonnie,Glad to learn that critics can be wrong.,7,10 February 2019,"Will Smith teams up with an Orc. What else do you need to know? We decided to ignore the critics, but waited a long time and expectations were low. What a surprise to see that this movie is not 2-dimensional horror/action.The refreshing part of the movie is that it doesn't waste time on being an origin story. You enter a completely new world that borrows from Lord of the Rings, Constantine and every cop movie ever. That's what you have to deal with. From that moment on, it's a byddy/cop movie, and Will Smith, Joel Kinnaman and the script flawlessly draw you into their dynamics, after which you can't help but (a) sympathise with them, but also (b) find their relationship credible.That makes this movie more than a random superhero or fantasy film. It's character work, and some bold choises by the writer and director, that raise this movie to being better than standard. I can't help but being curious to know more about this world, and the world behind it.",Bright
95,WalkdenEntertainment,Not so Bright...,5,10 January 2019,"Welcome to the world where mystical creatures live and work together side by side. In this world there are many mystical creatures among us such as Orcs, Elves and Faires. In this story, a human police officer, Daryl (Will Smith), is forced to partner up with Nick, an Orc (played Joel Edgerton). Nick is the 1st Orc to wear the badge of the law. As Daryl and Nick spend one evening together on the job, they soon discover a new weapon and a person of interest that everyone is prepared to kill for. Can they work together and survive the long night?Couple of things I loved about this film from the get go. Firstly, I found it rather exciting to see Netflix exclusively release this film straight to our flat screens. Secondly, the film actually has some big names for lead actors and is also supported by a well known director (David Ayer who recently delivered Suicide Squad). The concept and plot alone also shows huge promise and excitement for what the future could be for home entertainment.Bright does having many positive points but also some disappointments for me personally. As a film, I was truly impressed by the film's idea (story concept) and its characters. Actor Joel Edgerton as an Orc is truly unrecognizable. While his character is a little weak, his work in the makeup department and acting is awesome. There were only a couple of lines of dialogue that actually reminded me that I was watching Joel Edgerton under a mask. Will Smith, as expected, is the same old Will Smith. In fact, it's not the 1st time Will Smith has worn a police uniform, quoting panic dialogue when under pressure. While the plot and our two lead characters show so much promises, it's also one the film's biggest weakness.The relationships between our two leads characters is a rocky one. It's a partner relationship that has very little trust and contains constant debates and arguments. The film script between the two also over uses foul language to the point where it became just too much to hear. As mentioned, the film's story and concept is a great idea, but on screen it's a mess. The film doesn't really explain or provide any depth to the world that the audience would be keen to know more about. How did the world become this way? How did the world react to an Orc becoming a police officer, why are Faires so bad and why must they must be killed on the spot? Instead, we watch our characters go from A to B, B to C as they run and hide or run and fight. Films like Training Day and End Of Watch also comes to mind, as this film provides a very similar pace and structure, just different characters (Orcas, Fairies etc). For movie fans who love a fantasy story without wanting to know more, they will simply enjoy the ride that Bright is. For me, this film comes across as a little too slow with the plot that keep feeling like it's made up as the film goes along. Certain elements to the film occur with very little information or reason behind it and you can simply accept it or dislike it. Our Villains here are also somewhat laughable and they really enjoy doing backflips for no reason other than...well I guess because they can.Bright is a film that had so much potential, but for me personally it never quite delivered a film that could have been amazing. With such a great concept in story and characters, instead the film goes down the path of being similar to other films we have seen before such as Training Day or End Of Watch. The relationship between our leads is painful to watch, considering the film goes for almost 2 hours...the development between our heroes never really grows into anything different or better off from where the film first started. It's exciting to see Netflix delivering new content with actors and directors that we would normally expect to see in our local cinema. Hopefully this is beginning of more to come with some improvements ahead.4.7/10

96,pranayjalvi,Not so 'Bright' one by Ayer..,5,23 December 2017,"A $90 million-plus fantasy and action adventure film from Suicide Squad director David Ayer, it seems to have a little something for everyone: gritty action beats, a fantastical, magical world full of orcs and elves, and the still-undeniable star power of Will Smith, but disappoints on a number of factors. Bright is a series of disconnected action vignettes that work as standalone sequences, but don't hang together in any kind of meaningful way.

98,digdog-785-717538,"yes indeed, the critics are wrong.",7,31 December 2017,"All the critics are wrong, except me, i'm the only critic who is right.Trust me.Now that i sold you on that one, here is why Bright is both good and bad, and why you can watch it anyway.At its core, Bright is the story of Nick, an Orc police officer. As an Orc, he comes from a society with deeply ingrained Orcish values, who contrast with his desire to be a police office .. and also with his desire to be an Orc. His existential struggle is the most complex part and core of the script. 
However, there is also a framing device, a story about a magic ritual, magic wand users, and evil Elves, who want to (acquire a wand/bring back a dark lord/macguffin), that unfortunately takes too much front space compared to Nick's story. 
There's also some gangsters involved who shoot up a lot of sets.Will Smith does pretty well (considering his horrid previous attempts at ""serious"" film) in the first part, his interactions with Nick; not Oscar worthy, but better than Legend, or Happyness. 
Joel Edgerton is solid as Orcish officer Nick Jakoby, and pretty much carries the film. 
And then everything goes to the dumps.At the climax, the what was a serious film about race relations, veers off in the direction of a cheap action film, with explosions, gunfights, one-liners, the character of Leeloo lifted right out of Fifth Element. I do not blame Smith for this, but rather those who wrote his part.Bright is a surprisingly good film, that at times seems scared of success. I would recommend Bright, it's got much to offer, if you are willing to ignore some more offending parts. My vote: 7.5/10",Bright

100,carlos37andre,Definitely not bad as they are saying,6,24 December 2017,"Based on the only trailer that I saw (that just between us here, was not good) and the metacritic score here in IMDb I went to the movie expecting a bomb, and this definitely isn't what I found.The movie isn't perfect, far from that, some things bother me a little bit, like the most of fight scene, that are truly confusing in some points, the direction surely fails here, or one or to things about the plot that at the end still are ""cloudy"" on my mind. Like: Aren't the feds bad guys too? But, besides that, the movie is good, I absolutely love what David Ayer did here, with the mix of fantasy, with orcs, fairies, and even DRAGONS (there is a scene where you can see one flying on the horizon, and I loved) with the ordinary things that we have in our society nowadays, like prejudice, police violence, power abuse and a lot of other things, the movie capture those themes in such a clever way, through Joel Edgerton character, you really fell that weight on this themes, when they are addressed on screen, this is probably the best thing of the movie. If the movie was focused just on that it would have been great, but, when it tries to build something bigger (a Dark Lord, powerful, that will destroy the entire world) it fails, you never feel that this treat is real, you never buy that there is a Dark Lord, or that something like that will fit on this world, the explanations on that part are rush, and quite confuse, the feds thing isn't good solved, and, at the end, if you look the movie from this point of view, it's kind of if the whole plot was left open.Both main actors (Will Smith and Joel Edgerton) are great as usual in their roles, they have chemistry, and the dynamics between them works. The rest of the cast, I dont know, if in one side all the themes that the movie try to approach works, all the ""non-human characters"" (that aren't Orc's) seems really out of place, very silly and lazy, I don't know if this is the director falt, or if is falt of the weird actors job, but something is definitely odd there.Well, in short, the world that Ayer created here has some big pottencial, so I would love to see a sequel for that, I like the main characters, and, besides the flows, the movie still pretty good, definitely isn't bad as some people are saying.6,5/10",Bright
101,kevinxirau,"More like ""Flicker"" if you ask me.",4,12 April 2018,"There's been this recent trend of Netflix exclusive movies lately. I haven't seen that many of them to be honest, but from the plot synopsis of each of them there seems to be a few interesting ideas. One such case was ""Bright"" starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton. They play human-orc cop duo Daryl and Nick in a modern world where mankind lives alongside mystical beings, one where some are treated much more poorly than others in blatant displays of racism. When they stumble upon a frightened teen elf and a magic wand, a dangerous artifact few can wield, they are chased by crooked cops, gangsters, and worst of all, the wand's owner, a ruthless elf extremist named Leilah (Noomi Rapace). The best aspect of this movie is the world and even some of the lore. There are some funny things like a centaur in place of a cop riding a horse and a government agency that deals with anything magical. The acting is also done well with the main actors of course pulling the most weight, the effects executed nicely (especially the make-up), and the overall plot is decent. That all being said, ""Bright"" is far from Oscar-worthy. In fact, I wouldn't call it memorable. The film is needlessly long and tedious with many scenes that can easily be cut out. There are certain plot points that either don't go anywhere or have little payoff along with a few moments/lines that are true head-scratchers. It's also never clear what truly motivates the villain into wanting to do generic evil scheme number 42. Another aspect that can come down to personal preference is that it's very mean-spirited; I mean, racism is not a bad thing to tackle in the story and sometimes it's done fine, but most of the film feels like it's trying too hard to be ""dark and edgy"". Frankly, there are other films that pull this off better. Overall, while ""Bright"" is kind of cool in concept, it's also unremarkable and not a film I would return to anytime soon.

I found the premise of the various races awake in a sort of run-down, semi apocalyptic and obviously corrupt US rather interesting, but the story was let down by a cop yarn as hackneyed as many other, flat characterisations and cliched cop tropes that somehow managed to overshadow the fact that there is an actual orc in the police force and the Elves run the government ... Too bad, considering this had a chance at being a sleeper, like District 9 or even Alive.As it turns out an excellent backdrop was otherwise all but wasted on an all too pedestrian and clear cut good cops against the world tale... Where powerful whites are replaced with powerful Elves, US ghetto blacks with US Ghetto Orcs and Drugs with Magic. Oh, and leeloo from Fifth Element is replaced by a repentant, wayward dark-Elf.Such a shame to let such a good premise go to waste.

The premise of humanoid creatures and humans living side by side together after an apocalypse, coup or uprising is incredibly fascinating to me. However this film lacks any charm, intelligence, originality or proper satiric message that a sci-fi film about society could and should offer. The plot involves Will Smith's character being paired up with an Orc cop, played by Joel Egerton who rescues a young elf from the clutches of murderous Elves. A magic wand, in which only people who are ""bright"" can use, is the source of all of the problems in which all races, good and bad, would kill to have in their possession. 
During the first couple of minutes, it is amusing and funny, but then it's all downhill from there. 
Everybody in this movie talks like street-kid bullies. You'd think high-ranking officers would be a little more professional in their manner of speaking and handling things, but they're not. The majority of them are power-hungry and corrupt. It's not believable.The film decides to use guns instead of wits to win the game.

109,Mivas_Greece,An unsuccessful mix of genres. Recommended only for one watch without expecting anything special.,6,14 February 2021,"Crime/fantasy movie. A special mix of genres, where humans, orcs, elves, fairies, dwarves and magic wands coexist in modern times. Will Smith is a police officer and his partner is a police officer orc. Although it starts like a trash movie, it gradually begins to gain interest, to have action with gangs, gunfights etc, and as the film progresses it also involves magic, battle with elves etc. There is a clear reference to a mythology similar to that of the lord of the rings, where the lord of darkness (Sauron) was defeated by the union of the 9 armies. Now, the Inferni, the successors of the Illuminati, are trying with the help of magic wands to restore the lord of darkness with spells. Unfortunately it is not a serious film, nor does it have enough action as a police/crime movie, nor enough elements of magic etc as a fantasy film. An unsuccessful mix of genres and poor selection for Will Smith. Recommended only for one watch without expecting anything special.",Bright
110,PCT1970,"Not Ayer's Brightest, But An Intriguing Concept",7,23 May 2019,"This is an edited review this viewer originally posted from over three months ago. This viewer's first review was concise labeling this film a muddled mess of a concept. I didn't even bother to follow my standard format. It wasn't fair because this viewer really didn't give the film a chance as it was somewhat out of the norm for Ayer, but sometimes humans make mistakes. On occasion this viewer will revisit a film, which I did earlier this evening. Sometimes the review, which is essentially an opinion, won't change and sometimes it will. The latter applies here. Ayer has directed a great fantasy film. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, special effects, score and acting. All of the artists involved deliver the goods. In particular Smith, Worthington and Rapace are superlative in their portrayals. Without getting into the politics, racism and other underlying themes, which are made clear and would be an insult to the intelligence to review, the plot is set in a futuristic Los Angeles and revolves around two police officers named Ward and Jakoby. Ward is a human being and Jakoby is an orc. The differences and tension between the two is immediately made clear. After a shooting incident that attracts the attention of Internal Affairs the partner's brotherhood is tested. After an arrest following the shooting, Ward and Jakoby have been enlightened with a prophecy which they brush off due to their seemingly delusional captor.The partners are betrayed by their own colleagues due to their involvement in another incident where they stumble upon a Bright named Tikka and a magic wand. This Bright and the wand are the possible key to the future of the world as the Bright and wand can prevent the rising of the Dark Lord. Throughout their journey to save the world the duo face advesaries from every direction seeking to obtain the magic wand. This includes gangs, a magic task force, elves, their own kind and more. More importantly both men truely learn about each other's struggles and a strong bond is formed. The banter that goes on between Ward and Jakoby, both serious and comedic, is spot on. The plot is duplicit, crisp, unique, clever, action packed, imaginative, intelligent, and has a poetic ending. This viewer did learn to not be so quick to judge. Bright is a very good fantasy film with a one of a kind play on the buddy cop genre.",Bright
111,kenyae-cagle,This was a great movie I guess,8,23 December 2017,This movie had me agreeing and disagreeing a lot. This movie made references about black lives matter with saying fairy lives don't matter which I did not like. This movie also made references with racism with slavery that should not have been said. I loved the plot switch with Will Smith protecting Jakoby from racism on a minority team if you will. I did not appreciate a lot of the references Will Smith was trying to make in this movie. I did like the acting in the movie it was phenomenal! This as a fantasy movie was pretty decent! I love the comedy in the midst of the tension in the movie. I love how Ward in the movie turned out to be a Bright who saved everybody. Even though I had my issues with a few things I think the movie was pretty good and I enjoyed the ending!,Bright
112,achyutaghosh,Will Smith makes it interesting,7,30 December 2017,"When Netflix decided to pump in $90 million in a movie that will not see a theatrical release, many raised eyebrows. When they picked David Ayer to direct it, it raised even more eyebrows, considering Ayer's previous release- Suicide Squad. And when details about the unique plot (cop thriller with fantastical elements) and critic reviews started coming out, things went further south.But then Bright is an interesting movie for sure, and it does many things right. For starters, it has Will Smith, one of the most charismatic stars alive. Hell, he even made a hit movie that featured only himself. Even though it is a movie that features orcs, elves, centaurs, fairies and humans living together in modern times, Bright has more in common with Ayer's best movie till date- End of Watch, than Suicide Squad. Like End of Watch, it tackles racism, buddy cops and crime in an unique way that is racy and funny. More importantly, the movie also unveils the burgeoning ambitions of Netflix- the background is such that it can spawn innumerable sequels for Netflix to create its own universe, like Marvel and DC.So it is an alternate earth where different races are trying to live together peacefully, after a turbulent past. The society is extremely racist- with the elves at the top of the food chain, followed by humans and orcs. Much like Harry Potter, there is the prophecy of the resurrection of a dark lord, which I think will be dealt in the sequels. For the time being, human cop Daryl Ward (Smith) and Orc cop Jacoby (Joel Edgerton) must save the world by not letting a magical wand fall into the wrong hands. In the process they need to settle personal differences, and see off corrupt cops, orc gangs, evil elves, and a nasty little fairy.Bright is a strange name considering the movie is mostly dark. Even though the movie is a tense action drama, the script is funny like End of Watch was, Will Smith is at his shotgun firing best, the action sequences are solid, and keen eyed viewers will catch the dragon circling overhead. I love dragons.Bright is 2 hours long but I felt it could have been a bit longer, to give some more backstory about the bizarre world it sets up. In fact I am looking forward to the sequels, as the interactions between each of the races offer so much room to flex creative muscles. It is a popcorn action flick in the end though, and the best thing about Bright is that it is playing at the screen in your hand.

114,phoenixinvictus,Did the writers steal some kid's school homework?,1,28 December 2017,This would have been a decent movie had it been a cartoon. Everything about this movie from the dialogues up to the special effects screams mediocrity. When I watched this film I kept thinking that it was somebody with the mentality of a child had written it and the studio didn't even bother to read the script before shooting it.The impression that I got was that somebody really really really really LOVED Shrek and decided to make it in real life version of it and we ended up with this disaster.I get the allegory of racism and discrimination.

You don't need your subtlety glasses and if you ever thought allegory was too subtle for you, this will absolutely prove you wrong.The fantasy aspect is a little strange. An interesting premise but given the scenario, how come we end up with a world exactly like ours? So dedicated fantasy fans are off to a poor start. Much, much suspension of disbelief required.As for cliches - they must have scoured the internet to see how many they could squeeze into one movie!Having said all that, if you can accept all those cliches and shortcomings and just go with the flow, it won't be the worst movie you ever see.

117,torrascotia,Average at best.,5,25 December 2017,"I found this a strange experience. The movie poster alone was an odd one, it looks like a buddy cop movie but at the same time there is a non human or orc as a policeman. The director David Ayer has made a number of police focused dramas in the past with varying success. While the more recent suicide squad effort saw him engage with the fantasy/super hero genre, so its no great surprise he has directed which is on paper a mash up of a cop movie with fantasy elements.
The first strange thing about this movie is that there is little in the way of backstory about where this is set or even when. The little information that is discussed is something about a 2000 year old war against evil. So does this mean that this is somehow the future, a parallel earth or even a different planet? 
What is also strange is that we have what is basically a fantasy movie which seems to remind me of an episode of Buffy due to the elves, fairies and orcs but which has some fairly adult themed violence and brutality. The genre doesn't seem to fit with the severity of the violence of the movie. 
Also is the critique of supposed racism against the orcs via the humans. Its one thing to see racism as a bad thing between members of the human race but to try and illustrate this using different species is a different matter. If you want to use this as an analogy then its clumsy. It basically reinforces the false belief that there are massive biological differences between human races, where we know that they are more similar than alike. To use an albeit made up species which have real differences to make this point is flawed. The reliance of dressing the orcs is street clothing is also a bad move as it seems like in many cases they are like a black stereotype. We get it. The orcs are the ""new blacks"" and the police are the police no matter what colour they are. The underlying race issue just isn't handled very well and may well reinforce exactly what its trying to break down. 
The problem with this movie is that its trying too hard to be a buddy cop action movie, fantasy movie as well as provide some kind of social commentary. Does anyone really think that is a good mix? Buddy cop movies are generally comedic, fantasy is the opposite of reality so why try and hammer home a social message at the same time? I think some people will be disappointed with this movie as in the end its just not that much fun which is something you would expect from a Will Smith movie which will draw obvious comparisons with RIPD and MIB. 
All in all it just takes itself far too seriously for what sounded like a fun concept but got bogged down in clumsy race relation politics, attempts at being a serious cop movie and levels of violence that weren't justified.",Bright
118,hjalsayegh,I hate it but I give it credit,5,29 December 2017,"On paper this sounds like a fun light hearted movie. In a world where fantasy creatures like orcs and elves live side by side with humans, there is this buddy cop movie going on between the jaded human and the rookie orc still wearing his rose tinted glasses. The Mcguffin that makes things go downhill is a magic wand... No literally just, a magic wand. Not the wand of the elder Lich Maverick. Not the vessel holding the power of the superme dark elf Liehsognt.... no just a magic wand. This had the makings of a very silly movie. Instead, they decided to play it with a straight face in a gritty world full of racial tensions, and lets throw in police corruption and brutality into the mix. At this point just say the Orcs are -insert whatever minority you want in here- and give him brown skin... oh wait they did give him brown skin in this. Least you missed the not subtle at all message.I give the movie points for trying something different. We need more originality. However it was tough to sit through this one. The humans look meh, the orcs look like they're from WoW and then you have that one Elf FBA agent that looks like he came straight out final fantasy. He belonged in another movie altogether. Also it's almost impossible to take the movie seriously (and believe me, it was going VERY serious) when you hear grown men say repeatedly in a megaphone.""Hand over the magic wand!""",Bright

It is chock full of Will Smith blockbuster candy.
And yet...
It does not feel like it was made by people who love 'movies'. It feels like a 'product' made by people who love blockbuster money.
My own impulse/reaction, especially during the early set-up 'checklist', was one of seeing a product that had been designed and tested meticulously in every little detail to to maximize every little money making 'flavor' decision within the parameters/algorithms of a Will Smith blockbuster.
Something that can't be fixed: old Will Smith acting like young Will Smith is not young Will Smith.

A pissed off Will Smith can not portray this poor attempt at social criticism as funny or exciting.
And our super ugly orcs, which all remind me of the Gumbas from the Super Mario movie, leave a lot to be desired in character design.I've heard that the movie should have a tough R rating at first, and after careful consideration I'm sure that would not have helped but at least made it more exciting
I've read somewhere else Tikka (Lucy Fry) was planned as a kid in the script, that would have been more emotional and would have given more heart to the story and motivations of our protagonists, but did not make the movie much better.
Because he just is not thoughtful, one has considered too little what you want to say, what you want to tell, what you want to portray and what a movie man wants to end.
When Lord Of The Rings meets Grand Theft Auto.It is strictly speaking the film ""Training day"" that in addition to the Mexicans there are also orcs, otherwise there is no difference in the world building or in the implementation and that is sad.
the film had given so much potential away and I don't understand why you already have the premise that a door opened into a fantasy world a few centuries ago and it doesn't make any difference in the end because the world is exactly one-to-one like ours The world has only developed that there are more immigrants who don't look human.
It's completely stupid and I don't understand how the world works. Cars are the same, the technology is the same, the music is the same, even the films and the racism are the same, is Shrek a documentary in this world?
and why does every cop have to copy drama training day?
""Zootopia"" was more innovative and well thought out.
Everything in this film is so meaningless and interchangeable that it is not even representative of its time and it is a shame that with a few simple steps the film could at least have been made more excitingThe film takes place in an alternative present, where humans and mythical creatures coexist, and describes a LAPD policeman and his orc partner (nocturnal) who encounter police racism and corruption while using a magic wand (which only works on humans) and protect the elf girl (6 years old) who leads him.

123,Wililjam,Could've been executed better...,7,25 December 2017,"SPOILERS MIGHT BE AHEAD
There is a lot of things going on and you don't really fall off track with how fast the movie is going. With that said, the movie does have flaws. Elves, orcs, fairies and more fairy-tale creatures exist in the alternate reality this movie is set in. In my opinion, it kind of works. We are so used to seeing orcs and elves in medieval settings, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' etc. But seeing the creatures in a different setting feels weird, but it actually works.The main focus in this movie is race, which is extremely clear from the beginning of the movie. While it is kind of cool, it's kind of not. Being an orc is not such a great thing in this world, since they chose to be on the bad side of history, some 2000 years ago. So being an orc is not a great thing, and being an orc in the police force is definitely not a great thing. We are reminded, time and time again, that orcs are the race that is subject to the most abuse. We see police officers beating up an orc who does nothing that would justify the behavior of those cops which a lot of people, mostly minorities in the real world, can relate to.The thing I had a problem with is the dilemma where Daryl Ward, played by Will Smith, had to decide whether to kill loose ends, which means kill his orc coworker, Nick Jakoby played by Joel Edgerton, or be killed with Jakoby. To me, it felt as though Ward only wanted to save his own skin when he finally decided to kill his rogue coworkers. There are a lot of good things about this movie, and a lot of bad things too. A good thing was the elves' fighting scenes, they were smooth, fast and easy to follow. A bad thing was that there were only one fighting scene with those elves. Could this movie have represented all the races, elves specifically, more? Sure, but the main story was with the orcs and their relationship to the world surrounding them. If they do a sequel, which I'm not convinced that they will, then I would want to see more of the elves. They were a lot like billionaires, you hear a lot of things about them, but you never quite see them.I enjoyed the movie, while not the best movie I've ever seen I do not regret seeing it! 7/10",Bright
124,punisherversion1,Bright- A fantasy quest/buddy cop/one bad night kind of movie,6,31 December 2017,"Bright: Directed by David Ayer and written by Max Landis.This is the big budget blockbuster from Netflix coming from the mind of the guy who wrote Chronicle and American Ultra and directed by the guy who did *ugh* Suicide Squad. Alright, not off to a great start but I think we'll be okay. This has an interesting plot, kind of a fantasy version of Alien Nation with buddy cop humor, chosen one fantasy plot points, racial allegories and crazy intense violence. This has a lot of background information built into the story that makes the world lived in. This movie does operate on a simple bad night cop movie. It puts these cops into a situation that they're not prepared for and they have to rely on each other despite not trusting each other. Will Smith starts out playing a more worn down character but too much remnants of the Will Smith persona creeps in and it takes things a little off track somewhat. Joel Edgerton is really good despite being buried underneath a ton of makeup. You can feel his pain and what it is like to be hated from all angles. The villains are pretty much just there. They're bad ass and difficult to defeat naturally but they lack much in the way of character. Honestly only Will Smith and Joel Edgerton's orc have characters. That's okay. This is meant to give you some context of the world they're in and the obstacles they face and toss you in face first into insanity and chaos. It does that well. It is predictable though. You can figure out what is going to happen and when down to the very second. This does hinder things somewhat. This is without a doubt a of the moment movie. It is one of those films that when you think about it too much, it starts to fall apart at the seams. It has a ton of side material that is barely touched upon but that is part of good world building.

126,tmpsvita,A very entertaining movie,7,29 December 2017,"The collaboration between David Ayer and Netflix has given rise to this ""Bright"", an action with fantasy elements that marks a big step forward of the aforementioned streaming platform as far as production is concerned, given the stimulating budget of 90 million dollars.
After ""Suicide Squad"" it seems, however, that critics has condemned Ayer and ""punishes"" him again with extremely low ratings (score of 29 out of 100 on Metacritic) and reviews far from exciting (31% on Rotten Tomatoes).
But, as I had left more than biased and had already been conditioned by the general thought of the critics, I must admit that the film is not as bad as it is unfairly defined, rather I will tell you more, with my unexpected but pleasant surprise, I had fun a lot in looking at it.
Of problems there are plenty of them, especially in the screenplay that presents several holes and that in general is rather weak with forced breakers and trivial morals; but, as I read in a review by a mere spectator, this is not a movie to be seen with the eye of the critic but with that of a person who wants to enjoy two hours made almost entirely of entertainment.
It seems almost to see a bizarre, interesting and in some ways also original mixture of Ayer's previous works such as ""End of Watch"", ""Traning Day"" (which he wrote) and the aforementioned ""Suicide Squad"".
Bright resembles them in the care of the images, in fact cinematography is excellent, in the importance of the soundtrack, mostly composed of original songs, which played a fundamental role in the marketing campaign (as was the case for the DC movie), but also in the action scenes that are really remarkable and certainly a lot fun and that have a strong visual impact.
Some scenes really amazed me, especially for certain camera movements and shots that Ayer handles perfectly.
In the cast, as you already know, we find Will Smith as the protagonist, for the second time under the direction of David Ayer, and, like he do pretty much always, he satisfied me, but it is still a role that did not require particular acting skills unlike that one of Joel Edgerton, a complex role given some singular features both for the behavior and for the appearance of the ogre, however Edgerton does it very well. The two protagonists are also linked by excellent chemistry.
While Noomi Rapace really hit me, really perfect in interpreting the villan, an actress who is always more amazing in increasingly important roles.
In short, it is certainly not a masterpiece, it is also devoid of a depth that seeks continually and unnecessarily to reach, but I would very willingly but I warn you have to watch and appreciate it for what it is: a simple entertainment film without pretensions or special subtext .

So poorly edited it was jarring. One positive would be it sets the bar for bad films to be measured against.

135,urthpainter,Badass movie,8,25 December 2017,"Yes, Bright borrows from a lot of earlier source material. Namely? Earlier David Ayer's films, Cast a Deadly Spell & Alien Nation. Yes, your likely going so see some plot points coming, especially if you've watched a few movies in your life.And you know what? Who cares? This movie is strait up bad ass, just like so much of David Ayer's work. If you like his movies (Training day, Street Kings, End of Watch), your going to like this movie. If you like odd mixes of genre, like buddy cop, fantasy prophesy, action movies? Yes!!!Bright has an incredible look: dirt, grime, blood, seedy environments, stylized lighting, weather, and *urban fashion. This movie is rarely at rest, and the constant motion is always spiced with background minutia and surprising set design detail. The sound is also in your face with a constant mix of music, gunfire and caustic dialog. Very obnoxious film making combined with artistic flair - very entertaining.For the record, Bright is about two modern day SoCal cops - one human, one orc. Obviously this requires a completely different reality, one that combines fantasy with the world we know. The two main characters are reluctant allies for a variety of reasons that are revealed as the movie unfolds. Both are swept into a wash of dirty cops, gang violence, a sprawling FBI investigation and a overpowered group of elves bent on very evil deeds. But? Their evil is dependent on an object that is at the center of the entire story, something Will Smith and Joel Edgerton's characters obtain and choose to protect. Bright is an action adventure with a lot of disparate moving parts.This is a very well thought out movie. Its sets up an interesting set of rules based upon fantasy races (fairies, orcs, elves, and humans) combined with a contemporary urban flair. The world building is spectacular, and this isn't the only details.Just using the transition of day to night for content, plus weather? It's super smart, useful and adds to the already interesting content. I feel like the performances improved as the movie unfolds, which makes me wonder if a lot of these scenes were filmed in the order we see them (likely not - this style isn't often used for obvious practical reasons). Probably, as a viewer, I just slipped into how this movie is presented, but I do wonder.I'd like to see more! The world is built, might as well make use of it!fun, entertaining 8/10

136,RJBrez,F-ck movie critics- Think for yourself,8,22 December 2017,"BRIGHT was an overall solid movie made by Netflix, starring Will Smith. Here are some positives IMO:
+Strong cast
+Soundtrack
+Original plot
+CinematogrophyI was infuriated by some critic reviews that I saw online for this movie. My hate for critics coninues to grow as does the obvious fact that critics have an agenda. This movie was by no means perfect. The plot was a bit convoluted and most of the characters lacked depth. Some of the diologue was cringeworthy and the comedic relief felt forced. But to see the overall score at 28 blew my mind. This movie had an excellent cast that made the most out of this story. What it had the most of though, that Hollywood as a whole is lacking as we approach 2018, is originality. Nobody has it anymore. Hell, how many TV shows have been brought back from the dead? They are even contemplating bringing back the office!! So when I see a story, albeit a far fetched one, that involves humans and elves and orcs, dragons, etc, I am just excited to see something different. This movie doesn't let you down, give it a shot. Most of all, f-ck the critics. Keep in mind those same idiots actually think Star Wars: The Last Jedi is epic.Update 2021:I recently gave this a rewatch and I increased my score to a 8/10. Yes it has weaknesses, but the good far outweighs the bad. The problem with our world, is it slants to the negative. Find the good and enjoy it people. We have enough bad.One thing I really enjoyed the second time around: the soundtrack. Wow.I love this damn movie and I hope the sequel happens soon.",Bright
137,WooderIce64,It's Terrible.,2,27 November 2018,"This movie got a lot of attention for being the most popular Netflix original movie. Another thing it's gotten attention for is the disconnect between critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 29% from the critics, and an 85% from the audiences. I don't know why. It's terrible. The main issue is that it doesn't know what kind of movie it's trying to be. A social commentary? A fantasy epic? A buddy cop action movie? It bounces between all these things and isn't particularly successful at any of them. At the beginning, it's a social commentary about the relationship between minorities (who in this case are orcs) and the police. There's nothing subtle about it at all. They may as well call it ""Race Relations in the U.S 101."" Will Smith is partnered with the first orc cop despite not wanting to, and they go on a mission together. Honestly, it feels more like an R-rated version of Zootopia than anything else. It also has the fantasy side, which fails spectacularly. There's a wand that only Brights can wield, and there are a bunch of elves that are after it. There's no explanation given as to why there are orcs, fairies, elves, and other Tolkien wannabes in Los Angeles, and the storyline with Tikka and the wand is extremely predictable. The plight of the evil elves was as generic as a fantasy story can be. The performance given by Will Smith was possibly his worst. It should come as no surprise that this was made by the same guy who made Suicide Squad. And this might be worse. It's not without its positives, though. While the world its set in doesn't give any backstory, it does look good, and it does capture the feel of what it's supposed to represent. That, and magic is always cool. However, that does not change the fact that this movie is a tonal mess without a cohesive message or story.",Bright
138,Ben-Hibburd,Bright Review.,6,22 December 2017,"After last year's critical flop Suicide Squad, director David Ayer and Will Smith once again team up for what's essentially a modernised retelling of 1988s Alien Nation. Written by Max Landis the film tells the story of an alternate earth where Orcs, Fairies, Elves all co-exist with man, set in a modern day L.A. Will Smith stars as a beat cop Daryl Ward who's forced to work with a rookie Orc cop Nick Jakoby played by Joel Edgerton, the first of his race to be accepted into the police force. Together they stumble into a plot of deceit, murder and betrayal as a mystical wand that can grant wishes and stop a dark lord is fought over by gangsters, fellow officers and Eleves.On the surface level the film is a fairly entertaining buddy cop film. Will Smith is essentially playing a sweary version of himself, and whilst it's not his most challenging role he still retains his unmistakable level of charm and charisma. Joel Edgerton also does a good job in his role as the inexperienced rookie learning on the job. Again it's nothing out of his wheelhouse but he helps carry the film alongside Will Smith convincingly.The action and mystical elements are well done in this film. David Ayer also does a great job of building a world where elements such as Orcs and Elves living in L.A could've felt ridiculous. However they were nicely integrated into the story. David Ayer's dilapidated urban grimy visual motifs also help to sell the world the characters live in.Where my main issue comes into play is in the films subtext and dialogue. I get that this wants to send a deep message of racism, inclusion, poverty etc, but at times it was so on the nose and forced it felt rather clumsy. Where-as a film like Alien Nation shows you injustice and bigotry visually, this film has the characters stop and tell each other every few minutes which at times had me rolling my eyes with cringe.Other then that issue, and a slightly overlong runtime Bright is a solid buddy cop film with an added twist of fantasy, that manages to tick all the boxes it needed too. Whilst it might not be the most original or intelligent film, the backlash against it from the critics has been rather harsh. Bright is a film worth watching especially if you have Netflix.",Bright
139,drael64,Refreshingly fun,8,1 January 2018,"Unlike mainstream action franchises like furious, this film actually feels suspenseful, and makes you laugh. With shades of die hard, Beverly hills cop and other 80s and 90s movies - this movie is an action film with neither the forceful moralising of modern films, nor the overdone nihilistic edginess. It's a pure ride that stands out amongst its dull and empty peers. 
The universe itself is imaginative, and the acting compelling. 
If you want something fun, and you are willing to just ""go with the flow"", I fully recommend this fresh Netflix gem.",Bright
140,vandelour,It's not that bad...,5,19 March 2018,Its just not that good. Wish I could leave the review at that but TPTB won't let that happen. So here's some fluff. Will Smith is slightly better than usual. Joel Edgerton under all that makeup is totally unrecognizable but he still manages to project a character. The social commentary is in your face.

142,stebird,Bright and cheerful,8,10 January 2018,"A Netflix original with a rather unique premise, going into it I thought ""Bright"" was going to be a load of rubbish, seen it all before how is this going to be any different? But it was different, enough to enhance my attention, to begin with it exploded onto my screen and I was hooked almost instantly. Humans coexisting with orcs and elves and a host of fantastical specious, Netflix have been a bit clever here, as there's a strong moral story behind ""Bright"", that in the real world (no we don't live in a fantasy world with orcs and elves) yet we do live in a melting pot of differing cultures, we are all humans after all, so why can't we all just get along?For all the action and wonderful visuals, ""Bright"" is the exploitation of the human race, that despite being one of the same and living harmoniously together, we instead find prejudice with each other and separate ourselves from each other and our differences..., the story of ""Bright"" takes this real life problem and elevates it in a fictional and exaggerated way.Generally I haven't been overly impressed with the films Netflix have been churning out, but ""Bright"" seems to have broken that mold, the film is visually stunning and morally impeccable, it is one of Will Smith's finest films in years and the guy appears to have rediscovered his rhythm; his co-star Joel Edgerton is an exceptional talent who's star is well and truly rising, his character Nick Jakoby the orc possesses human like emotion and is highly relatable for a different specious (we're not all that dissimilar are we?) Overall a definite winner and a film I would be very happy to watch again, well done Netflix, you've actually produced a decent film for once.",Bright
143,pazu7,Loved everything but the slow descent into mediocrity.,7,22 January 2018,"(spoilers) First half is very, very good. Clever premise. Unique setting. Subtle wit. A gritty crime drama set in a fantasy realm: Los Angeles, 2000 years after the fall of the Dark Lord. But after a great opening, it starts to fall victim to the usual tropes and over-the-top chase scenes. And then there's the super-elf bad guys who take out an entire swat team and a street gang, but can't seem to handle Smith and Edgerton. There's also a little too mcuh expositional speechifyin and they suspended a lot of scenes unnecessarily, pushing the crescendo to the ""ok, I get it!"" point. In the end we find out Smith himself is a rare creature; a human Bright.... but that revelation, which was foreshadowed in the beginning, really goes nowhere. But all that considered, it's still unique fun and definitely worth a spin. Smith and Edgerton shine in their unusual buddy-cop roles. Loved everything but the slow descent into mediocrity. Opens at an 8 then about half way through it slips to a 6, so I gave it a 7.",Bright
144,MovieSonic,An inspired blend of genres,9,24 December 2017,"You will enjoy this film if you like the fantasy and buddy cop genres. If you don't like those genres... I'm not even finishing that sentence. Who is reviewing films these days and why are they bald-faced lying? Are the stakes really that high now that Hollywood is dying and Netflix is taking over? I can't wait for the epic docuscandal heading our way ten or twenty years down the line when Netflix is running everything and the scandal of Hollywood using fake reviews and lies to try to take them down comes out in film form. ""Bright"" is a standard buddy cop film with a new twist: Middle Earth meets L.A. The effects are superb, the storyline makes sense and the meta dialogue is kept to a minimum i.e. there's just enough so that the easily-confused can follow the storyline and whenever it happens, it's always done with the right amount of humour. ""Tikka"" (really?) was a bit / a lot annoying as she's written as the typical damsel in distress (until she can be bothered getting involved it seems) but no film is perfect and I won't waste time writing about plot holes or improvements they could have made. The film is what it is and so we only need to know if we will enjoy it and we will. We will because we care about what happens to Ward and Jakoby, the world they live in is plausible (suspending disbelief about how it came to exist of course) because it's exactly the world we live in now minus magic and dragons. The fantasy genre isn't exploited to make up for a weak script, it just adds to the existing story allowing those of us who enjoy more than one type of film to watch both elements superbly combined to create a great film which deserves better, and more genuine, reviews for all involved from cast to crew to fans and for future non-typical projects which depend upon the reactions to films like this to get off the ground - which ultimately circles back to benefiting those currently cutting off their noses...",Bright
145,Jack_C_,So much wasted potential- don't believe the Studio's hacked reviews,4,27 December 2017,"In Bright, you have a modern world where humans and fantasy creatures have lived together for thousands of years, with a dark wizard that is waiting in the wings to return and take over the world. How could you go wrong with that premise?
Apparently, sexual deviant Max Landis figured out a way.Beyond ripping off every buddy cop and the LOTR films in this sorry excuse for a script, he managed to drag out pointless scenes that could have been better used to develop this amazing world. All but the two main characters are reduced to shallow caricatures and the sad, tired plot devices used to create tension were predictable and blindingly obvious.Applause for Will Smith and Joel Edgerton's performances. They and the wand are the only saving grace for the movie.",Bright

Critics hated it, but ""regular"" people seemed to really like it. I was hoping I'd be part of the latter. That didn't happen, but at least I can say that at least I wasn't part of the former.This film had an interesting premise, but it didn't do enough with it. In the end, it was just an average buddy (or not so buddy) cop movie, with magic thrown in. It was interesting to see magic used in a modern day setting, and the ""race"" thing was done in a unique way, but it didn't make for a very engaging story.I don't want my 2 hours back, but I feel this could have been better. Ayer did a much better job with End of Watch.",Bright
147,cheighlee,"Ok action, fantasy, cop movie, nothing more",5,22 December 2017,"Well flick me, but I just have to write few words about this movie, because I'm seeing it being shredded apart by ""critics"" for a lot of wrong reasons. Same critics that lauded The Last Jedi as the best movie ever, for whatever reasons.It's a bit of a high-concept, cocaine pitch of a plot and screenplay by Max Landis, directed by David Ayer. As far as Landis go, sometimes he hits, sometimes he misses, great pitches, but usually it never gets further than that. As for Ayer, I hated Suicide Squad, however he seems like an okay dude so I don't hold any grudges here.Bright stars Will Smith as gritty cop Ward and Joel Edgerton as Nick, an Orc newbie who find themselves in a race for a certain mcguffin. They run, they gun, they have witty banter that sometimes works, while sometimes falls flat on it's nose. There are elves, a bit of magic, a lot of gangs and dirty cops, couple of explosions. Also, there are some social elements regarding Orc racism, because they once, in the old times, choose the side of the Dark Lord. But they're trying to do good, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and if we go by Nick's words - they kinda know they've chosen wrong and they're never gonna live that down. Nothing too deep, but movie balances all that commentary, action, etc. somewhat passable.Directing is fine, but it could be better. Same for photography. Too many shaky cam moments and just random visual nosie. But nothing too horrible. Music and sound desgin is fine as well. Acting... eeeh, it varies but all in all it's serviceable. Tempo is probably the most obvious problem, which is probably tied closely with a script that isn't that much refined so hence ""the tempo problems"" as well.This movie needed a couple months more in post production, so everything gets ironed out nicely. But in any case - it's ok, original, far from the worse movie this year (on that, more in a bit). You can watch it if you want something different but not too different.I would like to touch briefly flood of negative reviews for this. Now some are more ""I didn't like the movie because acting is bad, it looked dumb"" and stuff like that. However, a lot of the reviews tried to tackle some ""racism"" that they themselves dialed into this movie, and then draw a parallel in the real world with it. And gosh darnit - they didn't like it and the movie must be racist and everyone who liked it. While there is racism in the movie against Orcs mostly, it's fully in the service of the movie and really doesn't try to comment on anything in real life beyond the world setup of the movie itself.So for someone to read that into the movie itself and try to spin it off into something that isn't in real life - he/she has had to do it because one of two reasons. You're either completely nuts and out of touch with reality or you're just a really scummy person who's hijacking a movie for their own reasons and ideologies. TL;DR - it's a passable, ok movie, with some bad parts and some ok parts. Nothing special, but a bit fresh so it gives those bad parts a fair fight.",Bright

149,Maladjusted_1,Ironically titled!,3,22 December 2017,"'Bright' should have taken some pointers from its title and lightened up a little. How seriously are we expected to take a film which features orc gangsters, elves using iPhones and a fight between Will Smith and a fairy? *Very* seriously, it seems. Smith is given a few lines that are reminiscent of Alonzo from 'Training Day', but apart from these brief pauses from gloom the film is entirely devoid of humour.
The world-building is far too superficial. There are even references to 'Shrek' in this film. Sometimes allusions to pop culture and the real world work in fantasy (e.g. in Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower' books and Terry Pratchett's 'Discworld' series), but it's a total misfire here. The world of 'Bright' seems to be a carbon copy of our own world, and we're just expected to accept the fact that it happens to feature elves, orcs, magic and the like.
The specifics of the film aren't as bad as its premise: the performances are fairly decent (Edgerton does what he can but is heavily restricted by his character), the soundtrack is forgettable but passable, and the visuals are occasionally impressive. 
I can't recommend 'Bright' to anyone in sincerity - the world-building is comparable to something a 13-year-old would produce for a creative-writing project. I was drawn to this film after asking myself the question of how director David Ayer and writer Max Landis make a premise like this work... the answer: they don't.",Bright

153,arnieiam,This film will be taught in classes but for all the wrong reasons,3,3 February 2018,"First off I'm not paid off by a major Hollywood studio. On a macroscopic level, the concept of this film is quite interesting. A police procedural in a reality much similar to our own save for the fact that there are also fantastical creatures. The concept is one thing the execution is another. And so lets give it to the director of Suicide Squad. You would think David Ayer would've learned how to pace and structure a film after the Hindenburg that was his last film. But no. This film has no clue on how to use planting and payoff and so you're never engaged. And it becomes infuriating at times. There is basically nothing pushing the plot. It just seems that stuff just happens to the characters. There are only one or two moments where a character makes a decision, be it minor or major. Hence the characters go through no arcs. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cringe worthy dialogue: ""Fairy lives don't matter(?)"".Strike two goes against the world building. Now again, when dealing with a high concept film like this where you are setting up the universe and its rules, you have to be meticulous. The world building is so sloppy that, again, the audience is no longer engaged. There are references to the Alamo and Shrek. How is that possible in that reality? Explain! And what does it mean when an Orc gets blooded? And with the film's Macguffin, a magic wand, they set up the rules, but yet then the characters aren't aware of the film's internal logic. And so it renders much of the second act quite moot.Ugh. But the worst offense is the film's use of allegorical racism. Even a good film like Zootopia really missed the big picture, so imagine how poorly handled it was here. Racism is, for lack of a better word, complicated. It operates first on the concept of race, an arbitrary social construct. Human beings exhibit very superficial physical differences, but overall we are still one species. I can't tell you how many pointless conversations I've had with my simpleton friends when it came to defining a person's ethnicity, how their rules tended to fall apart after a few sentences. So it is not a one to one comparison when defining the relationship between a black dude and a white dude to a rabbit and fox or specifically an orc and a human. The marginalized group in this film are the orcs, because 2000 years ago there was a war with a Dark Lord or w.e. and they sided with him blah blah blah and that's it. There aren't any other institutional, societal or historical factors. And the characters that present their resentment towards the other are not subtle about it at all. Racism operates on many levels, and its not just based on emotion.I wonder why Will Smith, one of my favourite actors, has been choosing such awful projects. Why is it that in every film now he is scowling when back in the days of Bad Boys and Independence day he was an overall happy and charming charming character. But while his last couple of films were forgettable, I can't really say the same for this. This film will be studied in classes, I guarantee it, but for all the wrong reasons. So while Will Smith chose another bad film, he at least chose a film that is pretty infamous, so I am interested to see what kind of career trajectory this will take him. Touche.",Bright

And as it goes, this one is about the boys finding themselves being in possession of a critical piece of an attempt to summon a grand evil, and the attempts of pretty much everyone from gangbangers, dirty cops and elvens street ninjas to retrieve what's akin to a nuke-in-a-pocket.Considering the budget , you get some pretty good bang for buck for clearly shot car chases and crashes (no super quick cuts like 'Baby Driver'), expensive looking set design for the orc temple, shootout in clubs, and some awesome explosions. And you get Will Smith and Joel Edgerton playing rookie cop and veteran, with shades of Bad Boys. Whats there not to like? Noomi even dress like Pris from Blade Runner.

Then I read the synopsis and realized it was not. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad one. I was still intrigued to watch it because I like Will Smith. However, this movie was quite a letdown.Smith is LA cop, Ward, in the future where orcs, elves and fairies are a common sight. His partner, Jakob, is an orc (played by Joel Edgerton). Magic is a real thing and a wand has turned up that can provide anyone with their wildest wishes, but not just anyone can wield it. There is a prophecy, lots of exposition on how Ward and Jakob have betrayed their own kind, etc. If this sounds like a bad description of a Harry Potter movie, I felt the same way writing it. Ward and Jakob come across one of the wands and the Bright who wields it. Brights are elves who can handle the wands without exploding. At least I think that is what they are. The movie never really makes an effort to explain any of these fantasy characters and how they came to be. They are just there and are already assimilated. There is also a twist at the end you can see coming from a mile away and its never explained how it could happen.The rest of the movie is just Ward, Jakob, and Tikka (the Bright) running across LA's inner streets trying to get to safety and stay ahead of various gangs who want the wand. Okay, now it sounds like the Warriors. The first 45 minutes of the movie are pretty impressive as you start getting settled into this fantasy LA world. But then it just turns into a chase, crash, shoot 'em up movie. At that point I mentally tuned out.There was some great potential here for an analogy of immigration and assimilation, but it was missed. There also could have been some great fantasy elements explored, but those were cast aside for the violent action scenes and fights with actors on wires. Sad. Maybe James Caan will decided to do a sequel to Alien Nation after all.",Bright

Noomi was a cool villain even though there is more than one. The gentrification was a nice touch since there is magic and sorcery involved it makes sense that there would be different classes of people/species and that it would be very prevalent. The action was relentless and bloody and Smith was a little more level headed and not as over the top as he is in Bad Boys or MIB.

168,aquascape,An alternate universe filled with potential,7,1 April 2018,"Probably Netflix's most ambitious feature film, ""Bright"" attracted much media attention after the company's extended marketing effort. With established director David Ayer at the helm, screenwriter Max Landis to oversee the script and fueled by a $90 million budget, ""Bright"" was looking to be Netflix's flagship movie of 2017 and surely enough it became one of the steaming service's most viewed content ever.""Bright"" stars Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as a human-orc police unit in the Los Angeles of an alternate universe where orcs, elves, centaurs, dwarves lived amongst humans. As with our modern society, the film tackles racism and social issues, trying to send the message across by using fictional and supernatural creatures. 
In our story, Edgerton's orcish police officer becomes the first ever of his race to join the ranks of the police department. This fact is not seen with good eyes by the rest of LAPD's human force and certainly not by Smith's character, Daryl Ward. The unit is sent to investigate a crime scene where they find an Inferni elf who is in possession of the magic wand, a wand that is pursued by rogue elves. Thus the newly formed police unit is in search of the truth leading to a prophecy with Ward as an important piece of it.The film's dialogue I found to be rudimentary and bland with nothing of true quality or wit being said. The script's premise isn't the most interesting story ever written and it felt like it went sideways a bit during the last half of the film. However, the film's lore is quite interesting and I wish they expanded more on the its backstory and given us more information on the riots, revolution and how Los Angeles came to be a community of different fantasy creatures living together.""Bright"" is Will Smith's return to serious science-fiction after the failed attempt that was ""After Earth"" and while his performance is definitely better than the Smith-family controlled environment of M. Night Shyamalan's movie, it is also a more suitable fit for his on-screen persona, the portrayal of a police officer during tense social times.""Bright"" had the potential of being a solid science-fiction film, but its screenplay and rushed paced took its value a step back, however it leaves new possibilities for the sequel. 
I recommend watching ""Bright"" to action, sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts and if you already have a Netflix account, definitely check it out as it is one of their finest efforts at a feature film.",Bright
169,lumieretrain,Bright by David Ayer,8,13 February 2019,"After the success of Suicide Squad, David Ayer decided to work on a next project as a contemporary crime movie, with fantasy elements which is unusual to mix these elements in a story. But it would be interesting to see, what kind of result would come out. In 2017 the director David Ayer with the cast Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace and Lucy Fry, worked really hard to release then the movie Bright. The movie's plot: a human police officer (Will Smith) teams up with a discriminated orc police officer (Joel Edgerton), to find a magic wand which is a powerful weapon able to destroy everything. Bright is an action crime movie with a non stop thrilling rhythm, to see how the main characters would collaborate with each other to face the mission. As they initially would have difficulties to stay together, until they would find a way to respect each other. Bright follows different themes and one of the most important is discrimination on the orcs, as they would be brutally beaten in the course of the story like they would be not as important as elves or other fantasy creatures. Will Smith did an excellent performance as a strict police officer who would do anything, to find a solution for the mission which he would face with his colleague. Joel Edgerton did an excellent job as an orc who would initially not be seen with good eyes, until he would become a much respected police officer. The script by Max Landis is written with a rhythm which would not stop to be intriguing, with unexpected surprises and the humor works as well without using forced gags. The score by David Sardy gives the rhythm and the emotions needed for the movie, there are also songs written by different singers like Camila Cabello, Steve Aoki, Bebe Rexha, Bastille, etc., which some of them are catchy and others are emotional needed for some scenes. Bright is an intriguing movie which has action and drama moments, to be workable for the story from the beginning to the end.",Bright

Also, the jokes would make sense coming from a young, loose cannon Will Smith from Men in Black, but just clunky coming from the grizzled older Smith that is clearly depicted as old and weary. Will is good as old and weary. It is solid as a street crime drama, but fails as a fantasy film as a whole.

It was a Cuisinart confection which took a little from the aforementioned ""AlienNation,"" tossed in a wee splash of ""16 Blocks,"" simmered it with a nod to ""48 hours"" and then tossed in a healthy chunk of Tolkien.The resulting mess was not very palatable, mostly because you watched it thinking ""this should have been so much better."" But instead we got David Ayers' trademark homies in the hood, a lot of badly staged gunfights, not very believable character motivation and some dramatically convenient stupidity.On the plus side, Joel Egerton did a great job as the rather naive Orc/rookie cop, and there were some fine action sequences with some angry elves.

But the plot later goes to a more simple continuation that, while it's still good, it's not as great as it could have been. Basically is the story of how the two main characters try to work and cooperate with each other to find a mystical weapon that could destroy the world where they are living. The two main characters are played by Will Smith, as the human cop who was alright, and Joel Edgerton as the half-orc Jackoby, who I think was the most interesting character of the movie, as well as the most developed. The evil girl called Leilah was played by Noomi Rapace who was okay, but nothing too special.The visuals were really great for this kind of movie and also I have to mention the make-up team for their great work. Also, there were some great songs during the movie and a really good score by David Sardy.It's a fun an entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained for about two hours.

176,iNickR,Ignore the Low Metascore for this One,8,4 January 2018,"Thankfully I don't review movies for a living. I'm a fan, a big fan of movies of all kinds. So are critics film lovers too, or is a just a job for them? Personally I don't understand why this movie got such a low meta-critic rating. I don't pretend to understand IMDb's algorithm, but Bright doesn't deserve the 29 it got (at the time of this writing). With the amount of movies critics see in a week, a year, you'd expect them to be a little more interested in something unique like Bright.I too watch a lot of movies, and many films struggle to keep my attention. If I'm not completely hooked within the first 10 minutes, it's not a good sign. ADHD is not a fun companion to sit and watch a movie with so I am absolutely thrilled when a film comes along that allows me to plant my rear-end in a seat and not take my eyes of the screen. Bright does that for me, and this is on Netflix...where I have the power to pause and even stop a movie at anytime to get up and leave or focus on something else. So this is quite an honor someone with ADHD an bestow upon a movie!I'm not biased about fantasy-driven films; in fact I'm not even a loyal fan of the Lord of the Rings movies. However, the way Bright manages to weave fantasy - fairies, magic, orcs, elves, etc. - with human existence in the near-now and make it something that is neither tacky nor cheap is to be admired.The back-and-forth conversation and jabs between Will Smith's and Joel Edgerton's character were atypical of your average buddy-cop movie, but there was something a little different about this one. It was almost enjoyable to watch and not at all dull and boring.I don't really like the whole race stereotyping thing going on, but I do understand the point - almost a political statement - that they are trying to make. Indeed, I can almost appreciate it because it looks so ridiculous on the surface, it makes one think about our country's current race, religion and creed issues and how that looks. You get a much better look at the whole picture when you step outside the frame.My overall rating reflects my overall opinion, and this is a really good film.

177,rebeccalucy,Decent Netflix watch...,4,6 January 2018,"Definitely not as bad as many reviews were saying but could be executed a lot better. The script needed a few more re-writes before it was the best it could possibly be. Some of the cinematography is unique, trying to get some different shots. Furthermore, the urban and street settings are very original. They can be so interesting to look out, however it can go a little over the top. For example, there is a bit too much graffiti covering the walls. I feel sometimes the film is trying to hard to be many different genres. Like one minute it will be a police thriller, then it will change to be a fantasy film. The elements did not blend as well as it wanted. Joel Edgerton was the best actor in the film, I think he put a lot more effort into it than others. His makeup was also fantastic, I'm impressed they used makeup than using CGI instead. It could have been boring to look at otherwise. In conclusion, a decent film that needed some more tweaking.",Bright

This could have been really interesting if Netflix and David Ayer hadn't thought...""Hey, you know what would be great...

It isn't the kind of movie we see a lot of in cinemas but through the power of Netflix it seems we are getting more original films with great talent behind them.It's set in an alternate modern day where orks, elves, fairys and humans coincide with each other. A human cop played by Will Smith must work with the first ork cop to work on the force. However, they are caught up in a conspiracy involving a magical wand.While I've praised the movie, it does have its shortcomings. I believe the movie could have been 10-15 minutes shorter. There are also some cultural references that seemed inappropriate considering this is set in an alternate universe. I quite enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it. Hopefully we get more Netflix original movies like this in the future.",Bright
180,imdb2-5,"Painfully bad dialog, lazy writing, only for fantasy junkies",3,28 December 2017,"If you can check in your brain at the door, have liberal political views and are a HUGE fantasy junkie that will eat up anything that resembles Lord of the Rings - you might be able to sit through this movie without laughing out loud.The movie opens with a jarring scene. Our hero, an insanely foul mouthed Will Smith, murders a buzzing fairy that presents an annoyance. His thuggish neighbors seem indifferent to the fact that something that looked like an ugly little winged man was beaten to death by Smith without warning. And then our hero says ""Fairy lives don't matter."" Oh boy... just beat me with that stick.The story devolves into a contradictory moral play, full of cliches where everyone is corrupt, especially the police, except for Will and his Orc partner. The details of this world aren't really made clear. All we know is that there are things called ""Brights"" which are beings that are capable of performing magic and there are ""wands"" which are only usable by Brights - but everyone is after them because of their incredible power. Product placement and awkward dialog fills this movie. Will Smith's cursing is so ridiculously out of control that he makes Andrew Dice Clay sound like a docile church going youngster. There are out of the blue comments about things like ""the prophecy"" which all seem like vehicles to get the movie to go somewhere.I don't always agree with the critics but this one was a horrible stinker. I've seen much worse but there are moments of laughably bad, especially the fight scenes. Never once do you believe that our heroes are really capable of beating a group of characters far faster, more powerful and dangerous. But no matter how much abuse they suffer or clearly bested, there will be a moment where the enemy will stop fight or do something completely idiotic so that our heroes can get the upper hand. It's painful.Many defenders of this film talk about the emotional and serious moments, redeeming qualities, etc. There are few. The actor playing the orc does a good job. Unfortunately his dialog ends up leaving him with a terribly inconsistent character. He's incredibly brave yet dumber than a pile of rocks. Parts (especially the end) are painful in an attempt to inject comic relief and this movie does this, like the pitiful endless morality plays on ""all of us races should be more tolerant of each other"" is delivered with the subtle nature of a jackhammer. If this was created for theaters it would have gone straight to video on demand anyway and watchable on a day when you're searching for diversion. You've been warned.",Bright

Major spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't seen. About 3/4 through the film a crime boss orc captures them all, beats them and literally kills one all so they will give him the magic wand. The elf girl is upset and saves the orc with the magic wand. The crime boss's response? Is it, oh, there's the wand, I knew you had it! I was right! Gimme gimme. Bang bang everyone's dead again. Nope. It's to fall on his knees in reverence of the magic wand, and to let them all leave because they are magic users and must be gods.... I didn't want the wand. Especially since it's like, magic and all. erm, WTF? Seriously. Did any adult read this script?? Turned it off at this point. Horrendous film making.

182,fletcherc21,"Clunky Dialogue, Plot, and Mythos",3,27 December 2017,"Bright had an interesting concept, a world where magical creatures like elves and orcs live side by side with humans. Human police officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is partnered with the first ever Orc police officer Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), despite his and everyone else's protests. I had hoped they would use this pairing for some social commentary (like Enemy Mine, or even Alien Nation), but instead they just head off on a semi-buddy cop action movie backfilled with a lot of magical mumbo-jumbo. In this society the elves are the highest class, the orcs are the middle class, and humans exist somewhere in the middle. Human society still looks just like it looks in real world LA, just with magical creatures slapped on the ends. These different races have lived side by side for thousands of years, but Earth essentially looks the same as it does in real life, with the same countries and cities. It would seem that there would be Elven countries and Orcish countries and Human countries, but they just all live together and hate each other. Also, in this world there was still the Alamo and Shrek movies apparently. There are also other magical creatures like Centaurs and Dragons that appear in the background and just make the whole this more confusing. Why is it such a big deal to have an Orc cop, but nobody thinks twice about the Centaur cop? Because there is so much mythos that they need to fill the audience in on, there is a lot of clunky dialogue where characters tell each other things that already know. The federal agent who hunts down wands probably wouldn't need to be told what happens if a human touches a wand. The also created a world where humans and orcs would probably be extinct if not enslaved by the elves, considering the handful we see are indestructible super soldier badasses. The writing is so poor that they managed to make Will Smith boring. Instead of him spewing one liners like he does in the Men in Black franchise, he is serious until he suddenly says a joke that falls flat. It is disappointing to see a director in David Ayer, who showed so much promise with End of Watch, consistently make such terrible movies like this, Suicide Squad and Sabotage. It is like his only take away from the success of End of Watch was that he needed to use more intercity gangs in his stories.",Bright

185,jackcwelch23,A great concept given painfully average treatment.,6,23 December 2017,"Not nearly as ambitious as it could have been. We have Orcs and Elves and magic wands but most of the narrative takes place in poorly lit alleyways, convenience stores and strip joints. Yes David Ayer was attempting to mash two very different worlds together but only clings onto the ladder instead of climbing up it. Little is explored in detail and it just plods along from one boring set piece to another. It would have been cool for the orcs to have more in the ways of weaponry or spells but instead they just wear gangster clothes and cut their hands. Disappointingly, Will Smith is on auto pilot, saying his trademark one liners with about a third as much energy as he used to and looking tired and annoyed despite being around pretty fantastical things. Joel Edgerton does the best acting job here, probably having a gruelling time having that orc stuff applied to his face every day. His character is noble, straightforward and quite likeable, but still one dimensional overall. We get a decent scene of them both opening up to each other somewhat but it's still formulaic and generic. Anyone who really enjoys fantasy films will be bored with all the shootouts and car chases. Anyone who likes gritty action movies will be bored with the talk of dark lords and prophecies. No audience for this movie will be fully satisfied. It's just not as big and grand as a Netflix blockbuster should be, they have the money in the pot to make something great and they settle for ok. At least the editing wasn't as horrendous as suicide Squad. We can see what's going on, though a lot of it is very dark, literally so. It just feels very small scale for a big budget adventure.

Even if Will Smith wasn't in the movie, I would be hard pressed not to compare this movie favorably to Men in Black. Will Smith however despite being the star just struggles to stay up with a really high quality movie. He plays the typical Will Smith character of MIB and Independence day, however he is just another guy having a bad day. The brilliant effects, excellent visuals, and memorizing what if the movie is based on steal the show. So too does Nadia Grey's portrayal of the villoness. Her expressions and evil grace made her a believable evil incarnate. An excellent script drove the movie. The same kind of off improbable humor of MIB keeps you laughing all through the movie. The biggest thing holding this movie back was an attempt to make a social commentary. The commentary just gets lost and bolos the movie down in a few spots. The attempt to create a bond tween the cops never really worked and was as cliche as pointless.

It just seemed so natural to start, without explanation, right into Orcs and fairies, prejudice and more other colorful beings. I was totally fine that all the beings weren't explained or how they happened to be here. All kinds of room for sequels and prequels, though not sure Netflix will foot huge budgets like this without equally huge followings. The only stretch, in my mind, was Will Smith's character being able to fight a super-being and lasting more than a handful of seconds, but the fight choreography, in general was excellent. While there is an additional film contracted, I think this could work as a series, with a lesser-known (less expensive) cast and lower-budget special effects.",Bright

The urban fantasy setting may have seemed interesting from the trailer (believe me, I was excited when I saw the first promotional info for this movie), but nothing creative is done the idea, with the gimmick usually set around marginalizing the different races into a variety of stereotypes (the orcs being given an awkard split between gangsters and The Godfather-style mobsters, the Elves are shallow Beverly-Hills types). The dialogue is laughable, the ""twists"" and various character developments are lazy, and the main villain/side characters are boring.

210,travishouze,"""Bright"" Doesn't Shine the Way It Thinks",4,23 December 2017,"Diversity is a theme that has become very prominent over the last few years in film, not only in actors, but also in the central themes of the movie. If done right, it can serve a great way to handle to approaching people unlike ourselves and aware of our differences. And Netflix's big budget movie Bright has that ambition, but loses focus of that ambition pretty quickly. In the movie Will Smith is a cop in present day LA with Orcs, Elves, and Fairy's. His distrust for Orcs even lies with his second in command (Joel Edgerton) gets him shot off duty and tension begins between the two of them. Meanwhile, they bust a case where Elf wand is being sought after by a mysterious woman and threatens to bring back the Dark Lord.The idea of mixing humans and Orc's and Humans wasn't a bad idea in concept. To get a feeling of two totally different species and the way they live on paper. The makeup on the Orc's are pretty good as well, as Joel is pretty much unrecognizable on screen and the close ups allow to see the great detail on the characters.The films biggest issue is that it takes on entirely more than it can chew. As a fantasy film that explores adventure esque elements, and trying to bring social commentary of racism and discrimination, it doesn't do well juggling all of those elements. The film tries so hard in the first act to make Will Smith unlikable making statements about how he doesn't trust Orc's and speaks derogatory statements about them to their face. Also, the fantasy plot aspect is so hard to follow at times, as they are trying to make this world feel so big and expensive, as it's hard trying to digest all in a 2 hour movie.Bright is not the worst film this year, but wastes alot of potential. The jokes don't land and come in strange times, the plot is messy and the character development is inexistent. Maybe some people might be able to find some enjoyment, but for me, Bright doesn't shine anywhere near as much as it thinks it does.",Bright

However there is little depth beyond the initial concept of fairy tale creatures living alongside us in modern LA. Without a real plot driving the action the film falls victim to continuous clunky exposition with huge plot leaps from scene to scene. The lead characters were utterly wasted with virtually no time spent exploring their background and motivations - which is insane, why on earth wouldn't you reveal why an orc joined the police? Surely that's the point of the movie. Without explanation Ward is little more than an unpleasant, arrogant cop who is very hard to warm to. And this is despite being played by the charisma magnet Will Smith! What could have been a new District 9 satire collapses into a confused light weight Underworld. Very disappointing.",Bright
218,tenyearreunion,Well above average and wasted on a small screen.,8,27 December 2017,"I am quite frankly amazed by the low score on IMDB. I can only assume that some of the critic backlash is due to the whole anti-streaming only saga. Get with it people, it is here to stay and grow stronger. It has given us excellent TV serials and now it seems, blockbuster movies.As a fantasy, sci-fi, action movie lover, this film ticked an awful lot of boxes.The production, directing, script was far beyond my expectations for a made for streaming film, of which I have seen many. I have seen far, far worse at the cinema with more hype and a greater budget.First and foremost. Though largely fantasy based, the plot makes sense, I couldn't spot any holes or leaps of faith that were required and it told a good story around two well (but simply) written characters well whilst packing in a LOT of action and wit.The movie goes headfirst into a 'district 9' type world, you completely go with it. At no point did I go 'this is a bit silly' even where there are some pretty fantastic weird stuff happening! I was reminded of End of Watch, Training Day and many other quality Cop Thrillers, but based around a huge fantastical element!Will Smith is, well Will Smith, and why not? The support cast was good and the comedy never went over the top or tarnished the story. The script absolutely suits the buddy cop relationship between Smith and Edgerton. Good one liners, swearing when swearing was necessary and not used in every sentences needlessly.The action sequences were so well executed I couldn't help but think these were wasted on a steaming only service meant for the small screen. I am fortunate enough to own a decent size projector screen but on a TV the effects are a little wasted. For a budget of $90 million, the director squeezed an awful lot of decent pyro effects out of it!The film is well paced, 2 hours flew by as the action was pretty non stop with little time for a breather.I would more than welcome a sequel. I think there are places this world and characters could go and I would be happy to given them a couple more hours of my time.I am losing faith fast in Critic reviews, witnessing the Last Jedi fiasco and now the Bright criticism, from now on I will only read the 'most helpful' reviews written for the audience film are meant to play to.Anyway, don't take my word for it.

224,NormanCroucher,Great premise squandered by pedestrian execution,5,23 December 2017,"Director David Ayer smashes together the vérité-style grit of his cop drama 'End of Watch' with the effects laden decadence of his more recent directorial effort 'Suicide Squad'. The premise of 'Bright' makes for a really cool pitch - imagine a cop movie set in a world where magic, orcs and elves exist alongside humans in everyday life. This should have been a lot of fun to watch but Ayer and screenwriter Max Landis get too bogged down in trying to turn an inspired but silly story into a heavy-handed allegory for racism and prejudice.Will Smith blows back onto the screen with a performance that helps to remind us that he was once the biggest movie star in the world and, while his box office wattage has most definitely diminished in the intervening years, he proves that he can still hold a picture together with his charismatic screen presence. Perhaps his most impressive feat in 'Bright' is taking Landis' ham-fisted attempts at gritty street dialogue and managing to sell it with an energy and conviction that it probably didn't deserve. He has sturdy back-up in the form of a completely unrecognizable Joel Edgerton as his orc cop partner, who continues to choose interesting and diverse roles to test out his thesping chops. These guys manage to build a semi-convincing bromance in spite of the screenplay's familiar take on the mismatched cop dynamic that sees Smith hate his partner from the outset only to grow to care for him over the course of the film's play (bonding through all the shootouts and chases with stock buddy-com banter). These two actors do their best and acquit themselves well, although the rest of the cast seem to veer between stilted or embarrassed, never knowing which genre tone they should be playing up to more.And the tonality of the piece is what creates much of 'Bright's' disconnect. Its sociopolitical ambitions are loftier than its actual subject matter and these two conflicting tones - popcorn fantasy cop thriller versus self-serious contemporary racial allegory - don't quite mesh. One assumes that the orcs are supposed to be representative of the black community, with some scenes depicting them being beaten by cops or cussed out and marginalized because of how they look, and while this concept worked really well in 1988's similarly rendered 'Alien Nation', it often rings hollow here because Ayer and Landis mix their metaphors far too often and their overall message is muddy as a result. Perhaps they meant the orcs to merely represent the ""other"", in which case they probably should have avoided using every ghetto racial stereotype in the book when it came to their background players.There is something shockingly cheap and stagey about the production too. Considering the $90 million budget and the scope of the story it feels very small. That epic, sprawling world you might be hoping for never truly pops off the screen and that is a real shame because the potential here was pretty high. That is not to say that the film is without any pleasures. Once the MacGuffin of the magic wand kick starts the action, we are treated to some finely staged set-pieces that blend bullets and magic to relatively entertaining effect and a steady momentum begins to build as our heroes face down all kinds of foes, both supernatural and human. It's like Harry Potter replaced Ethan Hawke's character in 'Training Day' and it is hard to deny the charm of that.'Bright' succeeds on occasion when trying to blend its two disparate genres and you can sometimes glimpse what might have been had Landis simply sold the idea and let a more capable screenwriter pen the actual script - David Ayer would have been a top choice! Maybe then Ayer could have passed over the directing reigns to someone with a bigger appetite for fantasy and a more audacious vision (Guillermo del Toro or Peter Jackson come to mind). But that is what could have been. We have to focus on what is, and 'Bright' is merely a pedestrian film and a colossal wasted opportunity.",Bright
225,freddyj8882002,What a Mess.,3,23 December 2017,"I can't figure out where the $90 Million dollars went. I guess it was just to pay the Actors and Actresses. The rest of the movie was absolute junk. The story line is really messed up. Something happened 2,000 years ago with Orc's, Human's and Elves. I don't recall them telling us exactly what happened to create the world they are currently living in. It seems as though they could have started the story line with that and moved forward.. I love Nomie Rapace and can't figure out why she keeps getting put in the worst movies. I read that this was done by the same gentleman that did ""Suicide Squad"" and everyone knows what a mess that was.",Bright
226,filmsbyq,Bright - Not Really (Spoilers),4,24 December 2017,"BRIGHT is the latest offering from David Ayer, the writer, director and producer, whose most recent works include Suicide Squad, Sabotage and End Of Watch. He is perhaps best known for two of his earlier works, The Fast And The Furious and the critically acclaimed Training Day. On Bright, Ayer is on director duty, the screenplay having been written by Max Landis, whose most notable writing credit is the 2012 superpowers thriller, Chronicle.
Bright tells the story of a world where humans, orcs and elves live an uneasy coexistence, with elves being societies elite, orcs the bottom of the pile and the humans somewhere in-between. Quite why Landis decided to use orcs and elves, as opposed to creating new beings or characters, is not a question I can answer. I can only think that by using the normally opposed races Landis was hoping it would speed the story along. It doesn't. If anything, it pulls you out of the story, especially the elves, who are LOTR (Lord Of The Rings) extras in Matrix get up. The budget does not quite stretch to creating the orcs with the same intensity they had in LOTR.
Will Smith, turning in an I, Robot performance, plays Daryl Ward, a street cop forced to work with the affable orc Nick Jakoby, played by Joel Edgerton, only recognisable by his gait under the orc make-up. Ward distrust Jakoby after he is shot by an orc whilst waiting for his partner to buy lunch. He suspects that Jakoby let the assailant escape due to him being an Orc. On returning to duty, his human colleagues, all of whom are small-minded and wear their prejudice with pride, try to encourage him to turn against his orc partner. Giving them short shrift, Ward and Jacob hit the streets.
They encounter Montehugh, a hirsute, dirty, half-naked man, wielding a sword and after persuading him to put the sword down, arrest him. Whilst in the back of the car, the seemingly crazy man suddenly - with an exposition scene that lands like Thor's hammer - starts talking in orcish. He also throws up in the back of the car, which later leads to a scene in which Internal Affairs come to have a covert meeting with Ward to persuade him that turning on his partner would be in his best interest.
Meanwhile, Montehugh, the orcish speaking, sword-wielding vagabond, is visited by an elf and a human from the magic division - really - who wants to know about his babblings. As this is going on, Ward and Jakoby are attending a call where they come upon charred bodies and an elf crucifixion. They also meet Tikka (Lucy Fry) a terrified elf who is protecting a much sort after, wand. When back-up for Ward and Jakoby turn up, their four colleagues, in another exposition scene, try to persuade Ward to kill Jakoby so as they might keep the wand that can grant them any wish they desire - once again, really.
Exposition is next given in one sentence when Ward warns Jakoby not to reach for his gun because he would stand no chance against him in a gunfight. He then proceeds to kill the other four policemen who, of course, had planned to kill them both anyway; he is amazing in gunfights. The wand is now common knowledge in the city and everybody wants it. It's a wishing wand you know. Humans cannot touch the wand without exploding - or maybe that's anyone, that is never quite explained. Humans definitely explode though. Unless they are a....Bright. Really.
Remember babbling exposition man, Montehugh, in the back of the police car? He signposts that Ward is a Bright - that is not a spoiler, a small child would have seen it. The rest of the film is basically a chase film, where everyone pursues the wand - not the ring. Sorry.
Bright suffers from two major faults - there are more, but only two major ones - it is too shorts for the many varied themes it tries to cover. Bright would undoubtedly have been served better as a short series, four to six episodes maybe. Secondly, it is rushed, which sort of feeds into the first point, but if the slight book that was The Hobbit can be stretched into a trilogy of - admittedly - overlong films, how can a similar story be condensed into less than two hours? It can't.
Bright tries to cover themes of race, prejudice, class, greed and avarice. Unfortunately, it fails on all fronts due to some heavy-handed writing and a runtime that is short by present standards. Bright turns out to be pretty dim.",Bright
227,ashishagupta,Bright is Brilliant Allegory,8,23 December 2017,"On the surface, Bright is a interesting mash up between the genres of Buddy Cop and Fantasy genres. Beneath that exterior, it is a allegory, of the type like 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell. Just like 'Animal Farm' wasn't about animals but Soviet communism, the movie Bright isn't about fantasy creatures in LA, it is about 21th century life in a multi racial and ethnic world. A cosmopolitan city like LA is a believable melting pot and serves as backdrop.Unlike political satires the become too preachy and point fingers, Bright typically keeps the identity of fantasy races a little confusing. Some viewers may find this annoying and I suspect the critics have in view of their reviews. However, I think it is a better choice to keep an element of mystery about it. This gives viewers of different ethnicities a chance to view the narrative in someone else's shoes. Getting people to see the world from someone else's perspective is the whole point of allegories.The rich white america is depicted by Elves. Admittedly it is very difficult to disguise their wanton greed for money and power! Black hearts and white faces, as per freaking usual. It isn't entirely clear who the Orc's represent, could be African American, could be Japanese, could be East European, but most likely a blend of these ethnic minorities. Most Americans are depicted as regular Americans are always depicted in movies, paranoid and entitled.Since the movie does little to white wash the bleak reality of racism deeply embedded in American psyche, there are those who will either hate the movie or choose to ignore it. However, the movie is a lot of fun, if you give it a try. The social commentary is really funny. Without giving away any plot point, there is a scene where a white man, who self identifies as a veteran, is swinging a sword, presumably the Excalibur, since he is shouting of victory in wars long ago by ancestors that gave the minorities (Orc's) the freedoms and privileges they enjoy today. Hey, its a fantasy movie, so...In the end, the movie at its heart is a buddy adventure movie. An odd couple, polar opposites who hate each other's guts, are compelled by circumstances to work together. They go through hell together and discover their own true identity through the actions of the other. In the end they realize that even though their time together did not have the power to change the truth of the world, the world does not have the power to change the truth of their time together. That is the cornerstone of any story of true love and friendship.",Bright
228,reallaplaine,It was entertaining but it could have been so much better,7,23 December 2017,"Bright, the movie, has a great cast, with Will Smith, Edgerton and Rapace. There is some fun dialogue and a lot of good action. The concept was cool and of course, as with any Will Smith movie, his witty humor and candid approach, is refreshing. I would have given it a higher rating except it fell short on one very critical point. The movie is staged in contemporary Los Angeles, with current model cars and all, and yet, there are Orcs and Elves which now populate the city. The script writers fail to explain how it is that the Elves are now the rich and wealthy and somehow, the most powerful of its citizens, while the Orcs, who are everywhere, are considered second-rate citizens and regarded with contempt. Where did the Orcs come from? Where did the Elves come from. How did this whole society come about? It's a HUGE hole that leaves one trying to reconcile the anomaly from the very outset of the film. It never gets explained, as if its unimportant to include in the narrative that now involves alien species, so one finds it very difficult to connect with the plot and the characters. This is no slight on the actors who did a good job, but the screen writers cut corners and jumped the whole plot-line and did absolutely no build up to give the story the credibility it deserved. It's unfortunate, because otherwise, it was a good film.",Bright
229,patrick-413,Better than you've been told,7,13 January 2018,"This was an enjoyable take on the Buddy Cop genre, with some good set action situations, interesting characters, and a plot that, while not breaking any new ground, kept moving and always made sense. The dialog was great throughout, witty but believable (in its context). And special praise is warranted for the two lead actors: they gave better performances than they really had to here, and it pays off for the viewer.The production values were actually pretty good - what are people complaining about there? The effects were not overly showy, the costumes and makeup fit in to the overall world and it was all very good looking. Not too murky, not too overly lit. My main criticism was that it REALLY screamed ""pilot"" to me, and with that sort of structure the plot can never really soar. They had to set up ongoing characters (so of course the leads couldn't die) and SPOILER: not only does the Big Bad get away, we never actually get to see him. Just one of his lieutenants. And one main character is discovered to have great power that he never suspected but other than one scene at the climax, that's all we get. It even ends with a big medal ceremony like Star Wars (the first one) so there's a definitely ""More adventures await our heroes"" vibe.. So this was all a major constraint on having a truly engaging plot. Was it great?

This idea was fascinating, to see it resonate with the modern world. There'd be thousands of questions of what it'd be like, this did not do good. First off, if you want to make a world, a buddy cop drama is not the best way to do it. And of course they couldn't pull it off. They focused way too much on the boring crime thing nobody cares about, that they ignore questions like, ""HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD A DRAGON BE LIKE IN THIS WORLD?"" It was very limited and very slow paced. Will Smith's quirkiness didn't even save this movie. And the clumsy cop, which is a cliche, wasn't likeable one bit. The fictional society made no sense and as repeated, the crime this movie focused on was boring. Nothing fresh and new. Also felt like another Suicide Squad with the color palette and everything. There isn't really anything good about this. Definitely don't recommend this.",Bright
232,brandtair,Critics seem to mis the good parts and don't look further than who made it,6,26 December 2017,Oke i loved the cinematography and the idea of norse mythology applied to modern day world. He should do more films but then only the cinematography. Making it a cop movie wasn't a smart move and gives the viewer a mixed and confusing background. It does not fit. The special effects were amazing. The norsemythology is done quite bad though. Wich is a shame. Where marvel does study norse mythology quite well this writer did not. The briggest problem for this movie is that you have to guess the history of the world this movie takes place in. There seems to be a whole society that we just won't understand during the movie. Maybe it is a possible follow up movie where the history of the alternative reality is explained.,Bright
233,TyJustice,"Not a perfect story, but not as atrocious as the critics would lead you to believe.",6,4 February 2018,"As many other audience reviews have gone onto mention, the critics reviewing this movie wasted no time calling it things like ""the worst movie of 2017"" and after seeing Bright I don't think I could disagree more. A couple valid grievances would certainly be the dialogue, plot devices as well as the use of some characters we are introduced to throughout the movie but if you go into this film looking forward to a fun, diverse universe with fantasy worldbuilding that remains rooted in our own society I'll bet that you won't be disappointed. Will Smith plays an LAPD police officer who was assigned an Orc partner - the first Orc in the LAPD, which brings a lot of prejudice and judgement from the other officers in the department as Orcs in this universe are generally seen as gangster, low income savages, although Jakoby, played by Joel Edgerton, comes off as a unique case to that stereotype as he has shown a passion for law enforcement since he was young. An unfortunate encounter that takes place before the film begins however taints the departments perception of Jakoby even further, even more so in his partner Ward's case, who is Will Smith's character.If you were intrigued by the setting and the characters of the story but also had problems with the writing, you'll be pleased by the fact Max Landis, the screenwriter, will not be returning for the sequel that Netflix announced. In conclusion, don't let the critics deter you from this movie as there is certainly enjoyment to be had in this movie.",Bright

I felt entertained, it didn't get me depressed, it wasn't overly sexual or violent - what else do you want in a world were everything has to be pseudointellectual, political correct and full of nakedness and violence? I especially enjoyed how racism was a big topic, but they handled it differently. They didn't feel the need to preach about how everyone should get along. Will Smith plays a character who isn't the typical ""good guy"", the ""hero"" - that was refreshing. The world was very intresting. The producton overall looked more like the pilot of a TV series then a movie, but it wasn't bad. Overall a good start for a new franchise. I hope they will continue this.

There has been comparisons to the racism in america towards black people, i'm not american so I don't know how accurate that is (and I'm not stupid enough to believe everything the mass media tries to feed me) but it does push the racism message a bit but other then that it's a well done cop thriller... with elves and orcs.There has been a number of negative reviews for this movie, i'm guessing it's because people didn't get the comedy they were expecting and I know there are a lot of people who have trouble watching movies with non-human characters so that could also have played a part.",Bright

Some of the action was bearable. Some of the plot points are recycled from his earlier scripts.

That's the figure I've seen going around, so if that figure is wrong forgive me. This movie has been made before. Its called Alien Nation. It was a movie, then a TV show, then a series of made for TV movies. The non-human partner just changed from pure science fiction to fantasy. 
 Bright wasn't horrible and I'll watch the sequel when it comes out, but it was also not great. I like Will Smith usually. He might play the same character every time, but the movies are usually fun at the very least. The visuals seemed akin to something of a lower budgeted movie. This thing clocked it at well over what Deadpool cost and Deadpool at least showed that a great flick doesn't have to cost 200 million. I think Netflix missed the mark on this and it would have benefited from the longer narrative of a long-form serialized show in contrast to a movie.",Bright

It will probably appeal to those that like nothing more than foul mouthed violence and lots of car crashing a speeding.

Magic is bad and everyone needs the one Wand to stop the Dark Lord, but why?Where did the 2000 years of Orcs came from and why, did i miss something as i almost fell to sleep while watching this?Surely they have spend lots of time for SFX and the many many Orc and Elf mask during the movie and you have to give credit for that, but other parts just don't work to make a great movie.I hope Will Smith can't do more wrong, this ain't a good direction to go.",Bright

It doesn't take a biochemist to figure out that inequality and discrimination ionized the central charge in this movie wherein humans coexist with orcs and elves. It had it's moments with friendship building juxtaposed with distrust between human and orc, but it's a mess throughout its duration with holes that flex seal couldn't even plug up. It doesn't live up to any of the hype others have projected about a Netflix offering in the face of cinematic releases. The ending was left unfulfilled about how a ""Bright"" cometh from the main character when dispatching the baddy. It was a cheesy haphazard attempt to reveal a prophecy, which didn't make for an earth-shattering moment. Further, the very last scene could have been omitted just to spare us from painful dialogue limping to a movie close.",Bright
243,sleeping_tiger,Bright and entertaining,10,22 December 2017,"First off, the at the writing of my review, the current rating for this film is 6.7 on IMDB. I was disappointed at face value because I had high hopes for the film. But I went ahead, watched it, and I am grateful I did. The IMDB score does no justice to this film.From the opening scene, it grabbed me and did not let go until the credits rolled. It was action packed, humorous, thrilling, and kept my interest hooked throughout the film. At the heart of it, is a buddy cop film with action and mystery. Beyond that is flavor. Set in a modern dystopian Los Angeles with liberal amounts of fantasy added in. There's orks, elves, pixies, a centaur cop, magic, a reference to dwarfs, and even a dragon flying over L.A. under the moonlight in a quick panoramic scene.The story was tightly woven. It focused primarily on the two cops (Will Smith and Joel Edgerton), trying to survive, while protecting an elf girl and a magic wand, against dirty cops, two gangs, and an evil elf cult looking to raise an ancient evil. The story plays out in the mundane with a little magic peppered throughout for the cool factor. That's it. I like that they kept it simple.I honestly enjoyed the film and I am glad I ignored the ominous rating on IMDB. I recommend it to anyone that just wants to watch an entertaining film without too much backstory to muddy the primary story. Also, if you are a Shadowrun fan, you will really enjoy this movie. It may not have runners taking on some megacorp, but it's a great blend of modern dystopia and fantasy.",Bright

This is a well made film,8,4 January 2018,"Ok, so it's not what I would call a really deep film, but it is certainly better than most of the critical reviews would lead you to believe. It is mostly well-written and there are some interesting themes involved. I was definitely a skeptic and had no intention of watching it after seeing the trailer, but I was persuaded to give it a shot by a friend who recommended it. I had to admit that it was a good deal better than my expectations. Will Smith is not someone I typically regard very highly but I think he is perhaps at his finest here. Edgerton is the real star of the film, as far as I'm concerned, but the two have great chemistry. The visual effects are mostly very good and often genuinely inspired (the magic wand effect is pretty neat). There is some fairly obvious racial allegory going on here, but I think the themes about staying true to your convictions, learning to accept yourself, knowing when not to give in to the expectations of others, etc. are what elevate this from a typical buddy cop film with a fantasy twist.",Bright

My only issue with the movie was too much unnecessary foul language. The story line however was interesting and fresh. Putting elves, orcs, and humans all in the same modern day events was pretty cool. The action sequences were cool too.

Stupid plot and story telling.",Bright
251,ddangtruong23,Comical Writing,6,24 December 2017,"To be fair, Bright actually has a great idea to mix racism and classism with fantasy characters. Such a premise would have made for a really interesting movie, if only it were handled in a subtler way. Instead, it feels like the writers think their audience are morons who need everything dumbed down.That assessment is especially apparent when you take a look at how they write villainy characters.There are two sets of villains in this movie: the humans and the elves. The bad humans are racist, greedy, stupid, and like to loudly announce any evil thoughts they have. On the other end of the spectrum, the evil elves have about 3 lines of dialogues in total. Rest of the time they just go around being evil and wreaking havoc. I really don't understand why they would cast such a good actress like Noomi Rapace for such a useless role. Just cast Cara Delevingne or some other eye candies and be done with it.In other words, so many villains but so few substances.Worse, there are many plot lines that just become abandoned by the third act. It's obviously another case of movie makers trying to set up for sequels before even finishing the first movie. It reeks of extreme arrogance that they can serve an unfinished product and still think we would beg for more. Then there's the fantasy world building. This aspect is actually not so bad, since the movie manages to build up a quite elaborate and imaginative world that hints at a dark history with interesting connections. And like previous David Ayer movies, the action scenes here are rather well-done and enjoyable. Ayer chose a visual style that's neither too 'fantasy' nor too dark. It's not daring, but it works. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton also did a good job with their characters. They have good chemistry and their delivery makes the banters funnier. With that said, Will Smith is still playing his same old character and it gets boring after a while.In conclusion, Bright is an entertaining action movie, but it has its big share of problems and couldn't live up to the great promises.",Bright
252,tomdude0,Do not believe the critics. Watch this movie.,7,27 December 2017,"Sometimes critics get too full of themselves around Oscar season and want to seem like they are sophisticated, cultured filmgoers with refined taste who accept only the highest standard of movies. This leads them to write scathing reviews of films that are not necessarily ""high art"" in order to seem credible. Bright is a victim of this phenomenon. Is it a perfect movie? Absolutely not. Does it deserve a 30% on RT or whatever it is? Absolutely not.The world of Bright is something I have never seen in movies before; an alternate present where fantasy creatures live alongside humans. The visuals in Bright are amazing. The detail that went into the set pieces, into each shot of this urban fantasy LA, really made me believe in this universe. From the very opening shot, not once did I doubt that the world of Bright was real. This movie deserves Oscar nominations in all the makeup and visual categories. Bright will make you believe.I was hooked from the title sequence. The filmmakers have created an amazing universe that I want to see more of. My biggest gripe is that Bright could have easily been 20 minutes longer, and all the better for it. Too many seemingly key characters just don't have enough screen time. I wanted to see more exposition regarding the world's history and the villains. I can't help but think that maybe Bright would've worked better as a TV series.Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable. Yes, there are loose ends. Yes, there are thinly written characters. Bright has its fair share of flaws. But it has far more redeeming qualities. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton work great together. Edgerton is especially fantastic. And I just cannot emphasize enough how visually stunning this movie is. Bright doesn't make the mistake of trying to be any more than what it is, an urban fantasy buddy cop thrill ride set in the underbelly of LA. I, for one, am excited for the sequel because this universe is amazingly unique.Do not believe the critics. They've forgotten how to have fun watching a fun movie. Is Bright the next great cop movie? No. Is it the next great fantasy movie? No. Is it as bad as the critics say? Absolutely not. Should you watch it? Absolutely.",Bright

The story itself is a normal street-police chase with some fantasy elements.It would be an avr. movie (7/10) if not for the fantasy style.
It really does good to the movie, brings a bits of refreshment, excitement and kind of shakes the old genre up.If you do not like the american style cop chasing, ghetto/slum, dirty cops etc.. than I don't recommend it, because it might bore you or not interest you.
In my country.. we do not have this. It doesn't even exist. The american slums.
If something like this makes you feel bad, than I also don't recommend it.Overall the art was good, the music very nice. The picture of things.. good. The design elements, also very good. The story is a bit sloppy, unoriginal of course and maybe old. The acting is great though.",Bright

Maybe the jokes never get old or it could even be just that they are especially comforting for you.. Or maybe because they are giving you something you can't quite crack the first time.. deliberately.. From Walter Hill to David Lynch, Terry Gilliam to Paul Thomas Anderson, they are thoroughly worth the investment to try again. Bright by David Ayer is definitely one of those movies which you have to see again in order to fully appreciate the value of it.Will Smith wears this role like a suit, he might be getting a bit old to be credible in some of the action scenes 'though. I don't have even one bad thing to say about Joel Edgerton, he is simply amazing as Nick ""The Orc"" Jakoby. You totally forget, it is a heavy make up and under it, there is Edgerton. He creates such a believable persona on the screen, it is really something..Also I have to admit that ('though I am a total metal-head) I really liked the song ""Crown"" by Camila Cabello & Grey, particularly produced for this film. It is on YouTube.I even saw some critics say it is ""the worst film that they've ever seen""..pfff.. Maybe Holywood doesn't like Netflix, I don't know.. But I thoroughly enjoyed Bright very much.

Think Lethal Weapon and Harry Potter mashed.If you have Netflix, watch it. If you don't, it's certainly worth a free trial to check it out - plus, it's in time for Christmas and we all know how booooring terrestrial tv is over the festive period :)Looking at the negatives, I'd have to say that the baddies aren't overly well developed. There is a lot of talk about how powerful and dangerous they are and how they want to bring back the dark lord but in they end they're just a bit handy in a scrap but ultimately shallow. Also, it felt very light weight - it sped along without ever dwelling on what had just happened but then I guess that is because the whole thing is set over the course of a few hours.Give it a watch, you'll probably enjoy it if you like either buddy cop movies or fantasy stuff.",Bright

Yeah, they could have done more with it, maybe it deserved an 8, but overall it was a great watching experience, everything looked so real, the orcs were cool and badass. At first I thought, oh great, another metaphor for white people are evil and everyone else is awesome but it didn't go there at all. Will Smith's character is kind of an ahole which made the movie less enjoyable for me, I didn't like him at all from beginning to end and I wasn't crazy for the little elf girl either, but everyone else I thought did a great job. The orcs all bad and mean, the elves all fancy and elegant, all in a modern setting together in real life America, that is just cool. 
It's not without its flaws and the script could have been better at times but overall it was a very cool movie to watch. It could work as a series, something like Game of Thrones, with 12 long episodes per season that feel like movies, it definitely has potential.I personally give it a big thumbs up and I rarely like movies that come out these days, I hated the new Star Wars and pretty much all the Transformers except first couple of ones, and I loved the new Blade Runner, so, if you like a somewhat slower pace then the mess movies like Transformers are these days, watch this, it's quite an experience.",Bright
261,keith-umsted,"They did not reinvent the wheel, they only made a really cool one.",8,1 January 2018,"Before writing this review I encountered a post where the poster described the show as ""They did not reinvent the wheel, they only made a really cool wheel."" I think that perfectly describes this movie.The movie has strong influences from movies like Alien Nation, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, and Lord of the Rings. The story is very common place in that the protagonist (Daryl Ward/Will Smith and Nick Jakoby/Joel Edgerton) find themselves unintentionally in life threatening situations due to stumbling upon a world threatening plot. The story takes place in an alternate dark universe where the creatures of legend (Orcs, Elves, Centaurs, Fairies) exist and have lived together for thousands of years. Now, in the 20th century, they face social issues that our world faces now. No, the story does not explain a great deal of the history of the races, other than the defeat of an evil warlord some 2000 years ago. The story does touches on social issues we face today. Unlike some newly released series and movies, Bright does not attempt to convince you that one side of the issue is right and that opinion should be accepted. Nor does it try to show you how right the idea is. Instead, Bright successfully shows you the issue and the impact it has to those around it, and leaves it up to you to decide if it is wrong or right. It does not attempt to preach, or make light of the issue, but it does strive to ensure the viewer sees both sides of the issue clearly. Will Smith (Daryl Ward) delivers the same performance he did in Independence Day, Men in Black, Wild West, Bad Boys, I,Robot, Suicide Squad, and well I could continue, but I think you get the idea. It is Will Smith being Will Smith. Now, there were some scenes where Smith provided a strong dramatic performance, but then seemed to slip back into his tired old worn out Will Smith performance. Smith is a strong actor, but he seems afraid to stay outside his box too long, and retreats back to it for safety. It would have been nice to see him stay out of the Will Smith character, and focus on being Daryl Ward.Joel Edgerton (Nick Jakoby) delivered a strong and constant performance over and over. In several scenes he upstaged Will Smith. Though Joel had makeup, he continuously delivered performance after performance that conveyed to you what Jakoby was thinking, feeling, and how he was reacting. His use of facial expressions, body language, and voice acting gave his character life. In many ways you found yourself connecting with Jakoby more than Ward. I found myself delighted in watching Edgerton deliver his lines and performance. The other actors played their parts well, but to be honest there isn't much to talk about. They are there, and that is it. They walk on, say their lines, perform their action to move the story along, and little more. They did well. Conclusion:
It is a fun watch. I felt the concept and the writing was brilliant. I also enjoyed seeing how mythical creatures are portrayed in a 20th century environment. This is a good watch. I wouldn't say this is a popcorn movie. In order to enjoy this movie I think the viewer must pay attention to the environment surrounding the action. Take the time to look at the Elf, the art on the walls, and how the Orcs interact with world around them. The magic of the movie isn't in Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, but in the world around them.",Bright

268,nadeeshantennage,The film 'Bright' could have been 'brighter',5,22 April 2018,"Bright is a strange film.
At times it would make you delighted, in a very few number of scenes would keep you authentically invested in the film whereas in other scenes you might wonder 'what the hell is going on?'
Even with the football sized plotholes the film manages to entertain mainly because of Will Smith's performance.
Ward played by Will smith at times becomes extremely vulnerable and most importantly he becomes vaguely funny in certain scenes.
You will be able to observe that the strains of comedy which are added to this fantasy film throughout its plot are by Ward.
The biggest problem with the plot is it has no real flow and at times no consistency at all.
Eventhough, the film manages to roll a good momentum throughout it with good action sequences it doesn't really help the viewer to look over the thin and inconsistent plot with scenes which feel almost repetetive.
At the end of all the mayhem depicted the only thing that would strike you as even slightly memorable will be Will's performance.
Watch this problematic film for Will Smith without necessarily expecting the plot about Orcs v Orc - Bad Elves V Good Elf- Greedy manipulative humans V morally good human to be entertaining.
Because honestly it wouldn't be.
I wanna go with 4 stars for the film and an additional 1 star to commend Will Smith who carried this weak plot disaster on his shoulders.",Bright
269,cazmor,Better than expected,6,16 January 2018,"At the time of this writing Bright has a 6.5/10 on IMDB, and I think that is about spot on.I went into watching this film with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised, now this certainly isn't a masterpiece, but for a rainy afternoon it hits many of the right ques.Been a fan of Will Smith's for many years, from Fresh Prince, through Independence day, Bad Boys and Men in Black (well... at least the first two), and after a couple of dud rounds, this suited his style much more, not his greatest but fun to watch.Joel Edgerton as Jackoby was brilliant, his on screen rapport with Smith played out well and he has good comedic timing.This action flick really mashed together a lot of genres, for the most part it worked well. Some of the hostility towards the Orc's was a little over done in the first half, but cooled by the later. The actions scenes were well choreographed and paced nicely, with the CGI adding in without been over the top, and ticked all the action boxes.One IMDB user summed it up well ""good, but could have been better"". So as long as you don't take it too seriously this film is worth a go.",Bright
270,pinobarbaritano-44840,Would have been better as a show,7,4 March 2021,I love the world building and the setting of this movie... the only thing that comes to my mind thats similar is Onward which was released 3 years later by Disney. To explore this world with a series would've been much more exciting... sadly the run time isn't enough for this and the weak story doesn't help with that... GREAT concept but wrong execution :/,Bright
271,hennyxu,TV movie with untapped potential,4,29 December 2017,"Henny's Movie Review: Bright (no spoilers)In five words: TV movie with untapped potential.Bright is a Netflix movie with an original take on the well-known ""buddy cop"" genre. Set in present Los Angeles, similar to our own, the movie tells a story of a world where fantasy creatures like orgs and elves live among us. Like most buddy cop movies our protagonists get into trouble and they have to solve it before the end credits roll. The movie has an intriguing setup with much potential to become a franchise; however with a meager story and 90s television quality filming it was mostly noise. I think everyone who is BRIGHT enough should watch something else on Netflix.The story follows a human cop (played by Will Smith) and his org partner (played by Joel Edgerton) doing their job when they are called to investigate a building. There they discover an ancient weapon and learn that they have to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. As aforementioned the story is quite meager and the only saving grace is the interaction between the two protagonists. The cinematography sets a grim depiction of LA with org street gangs ruling the streets, and it is mostly shot at night. The music is almost non-existent, which can also be said for the antagonist, setup and payoff. The three act structure of the movie consists of an unimpressive quite boring beginning, almost no middle (mostly noise), and an anticlimactic ending.The movie fails on almost all levels. The story needs more depth, especially since we are talking about a mystical world with magic. I understand that the movie isn't focused on telling an epic story, but tries to tell a more grounded story. A story about a couple of cops doing their daily jobs in a mythical world. I get that, but why do all the characters react like this is a big event. All I'm trying to say is that the story doesn't fit how everyone is reacting. In addition the movie attempts to depict a world with different social classes where the Elves represent the rich, humans the middle class, and the orgs the lower class. Even though this is an interesting setup this aspect of the movie is dropped almost immediately after it was introduced (like most things in this movie). There are side stories that go nowhere and instead of setting up a scene, in order for it to be paid off later, the movie tend to run through it all without any setup. The movie uses close-ups for most scenes and everything is framed in the middle (like 90s television shows). This limits the world that they are trying to build and sometimes detracts us from what is truly important. Furthermore, the most important thing for a movie that is character focused is to show character growth, well there is very little of it.Does that mean that the movie has nothing positive? Well no, I can without a doubt say that the org cop has some funny lines and moment and in my opinion should have been the main character. Also there are some action scenes where they slow everything down, which is also quite good. And lastly the make-up, CGI, and practical effects were very good.Really people there are a lot of better things out there that can truly brighten your day. I give this movie a 4.",Bright
272,novica83,OMG,10,1 January 2018,"WTF with the reviews? This movie is awesome!
Story is original, environment also, I have never see fantasy movie or game in this timeline!
Cast is supreme. Actors did there job. Budget was obviously high... But there is a few questions to ask...
1) Why this is not a blockbuster?
2) Will there be a sequel?
3) The world they created is great, but will there be more stories to it?
4) And again, why this isn't a blockbuster??

Ok, they could have refined and polished story a bit more, now it seemed they took the material of 3 movies and put it in the blender. What we got was mish-mash and chaotic, uneven but... pretty awesome! Had quite a few flashbacks of Alien Nation (which was good for its day), but Bright took it to a whole new level.

277,ivorybow,A ceaseless stream of F bombs,5,23 December 2017,"They had to know kids will be flocking to see this film, regardless of the R rating, and as it is so easily accessible on TV. But the very first lines of dialog were peppered with F bombs and other foul language, even from the wife, and never slowed down. I and my teen granddaughter eagerly anticipated this movie for weeks. It was a major disappointment that the dialog was so crude. The foul language and utterly superfluous, gratuitous naked prostitutes and sex talk made absolutely no contribution to the story and I can only assume was all put there to avoid the dreaded PG-13 rating. I promise the R is easily earned with the violence. The vicious killing of the fairy at the start was also strange, and turned us both off, rendering us less enamored of Daryl's character. However, we did enjoy the story and the non human characters, especially the Orc Jakoby, played by the excellent Joel Edgerton. We both tried in vain to recognize him from Warrior, but he is thoroughly orc. Too bad it is such a cesspool of language. Else I would have given a much higher rating.",Bright

279,JokerReviews,This is a very enjoyable movie,8,22 December 2017,"If you've seen the trailer for this on Netflix and though it looked like it might be a good movie then you will get exactly what you were expecting. This film doesn't make itself out to be anything its not. To that end it has a few good jokes, decent action and a very interesting world which is really the gem of this movie.The critics reviewing this movie should be fired. I saw several major publications giving this a zero out of 100!?!? In what way is that professional at all? Please ignore these people as it is a pretty good cop movie with a fantasy twist. I don't know who took a dump in their cornflakes, but they're simply wrong.This is the first review I've ever taken the time to write because I'm extremely picky with my movies and I almost didn't watch it because of the bad reviews, but I'm really glad I listened to my instinct on this one.

281,luzarius-04701,Do you like Of Orcs and Men and Skyrim?,9,27 December 2017,"The mixed reception for this movie is a testament to how new and fresh the idea was. I enjoyed the execution. There was one scene that blew my mind with the visuals and completely captured my imagination. I adored this movie and would like to see more films like this. I find movies set in a modern way of life as we know it to be extremely boring, but mixing in the fantasy element the way Bright did ensured I did not get bored. Magical, sword & sorcery elements are always refreshing and unpredictable. There are many different takes on Orcs and this kind of reminded me of two RPG's: Of Orcs and Men and of course Skyrim. This movie is much more suited to fans of RPG's and people heavy into fantastical settings. I would say half of mainstream will not like this movie because they're trapped in a normie mindset.",Bright

284,lunalovitt,I was hoping for more...,3,23 December 2017,"I had such high hopes for this movie, but at the end of the day my hopes were too high. I loved the idea of it all, but when I actually sat down to watch it I found myself wanting to stop less than half way through because it was just... boring. I feel like a lot of the culture and world could have been built up and better explained. It doesn't have to be spoon fed to the audience, but really... It would have been nice to have some lore other than some spray tags in the opening credits. I think the hints of the world created by the writers was incredibly fascinating, but all of it was wasted.The concept was really neat and I was excited for it, but it was poorly executed. A lot of the scene changes and jump in plot was messy and didn't make sense other than to force a continuation of the story. There was some political commentary stuff. Not a ton, but the big points are kind of shoved in your face when they pop up. The jokes could have been delivered a lot better as well. I was hoping for some comedy, given the trailer, but in the end it just wasn't... A lot of characters were wasted. Some of them would have been really cool to just learn more about, but instead more screen time was split between less interesting characters that really only show up for two scenes and then die later.Now that's not to say there weren't good points. The visuals were nice. As nice as visuals of people getting their guts blown out with a shotgun can be, I mean. And some of the music was good as well. There were some editing choices that seemed... odd to me, but I'll let them slide in this instance. All in all? LotR meets Zootopia meets any buddy cop film ever made with neat visuals. For all its budget, I wish more time had been spent on reviewing the material from the point of view of an audience member so that some mistakes could have been avoided.",Bright
285,jwp-54567,Identity politics at its worst,4,25 March 2018,"With this movie it's as if all those involved sat around a table and decided to conjure up a plot that incorporated as many aspects of identity politics as possible, which were then transposed onto a fantasy world filled with different beings in order to drive home social hierarchy and inequality - the prime villians of course being the rich, powerful white elves. It's so derivative and is just another example of quality being compromised in pursuit of pushing political agendas upon the viewers. Go and watch 'End of Watch' instead.",Bright
286,dystopian-galaxy,Better than expected and set in a really cool universe,7,8 January 2019,"I was surprised to see such negative reviews here, I went into the movie only knowing the summary that Netflix gave me and I really enjoyed it! The Fifth Element is one of my favourite films, now I'm not saying that this movie is like that at all but I do think it has some similar vibes, (particularly with Tikka), along with Guardians of the Galaxy and maybe Training Day.The concept of the universe/world that has been created in this movie is very cool, watching the preview on Netflix I didn't think much of it, looked a little mismatched, but when I was actually watching the movie I really liked it. It worked so well and I thought the fantastical elements were very cohesive. The character and creature designs looked amazing too.There are some minor negative things I could pick out but I think that's already been done, ultimately they didn't take away from the movie as a whole for me. It's interesting and entertaining, I'd watch it again and I am intrigued to know what they'll do with the sequel.",Bright
287,leonthesleepy,"gnore the critics, this is some of the most fun I've had in a blockbuster all year.",6,23 December 2017,"Imagine End Of Watch meets the comic series of Fables, and you have Bright. Its a fun, roller coaster ride of a cop thriller thats wrapped up in a wildly inventive and interesting world where fairy tales exist. It also blends in some social commentary about racism, particular in the police department. So yeah, this is a genre blender, but its done well because of a streamlined plot and magnetic performances. Joel Edgerton kills it as Nick Jakoby, the only Orc in the police academy. We've seen comedy in blockbusters go horribly wrong this year (looking at you Marvel + Last Jedi), but here its used sparingly enough that it never overstays its welcome. Heck, theres some one liners here that REALLY go for it, and personally i loved it. Will Smith and Edgerton have great chemistry throughout as the unlikely duo, and the film is a brisk, entertaining ride throughout.Its also surprisingly emotional for a film about chasing a magic wand. For the most part, it hones in on the cop partner relationship of trust, and smartly centers itself around surviving. This isnt a film out to make a political statement, but rather a boots on the ground view of discrimination. Now lets talk the bad reviews. Because my god i saw this film before reading the reviews, and i'm shocked by the negative reaction.Now, i HATED Suicide Squad because it was an incoherent mess that had no focus, no interesting action sequences and a boring villain. Bright has none of those issues. Taken on its own, it offers up a new world, filled with a pair of charismatic performances and some great action sequences. Sure, this ISNT a subtle film, but that doesn't make it bad. Far from it. Bright is first and foremost, an entertaining thriller. Its violent, crude, but also inventive and funny. Its a well made B film with an unusually fun setting and dynamic characters. Go in with those expectations, and i honestly think you'll have a great time.",Bright
288,bornskeptic,Pretty awesome set up and world,5,29 January 2020,"Ayer and Landis created a very cool world for these characters to inhabit. Fairies. Orcs, I even saw a dragon at one point. Pretty decent makeup and visual effects. Honestly, this would make for a great Netflix tv show. It all kind of follows the themes and patterns of Alien Nation.
Unfortunately the execution of the whole thing was a mess. It's impossible to cover how many things went wrong. The action scenes made no coherent sense, the characters motivations and interactions changed constantly, the humor was forced, the overall tone in constant flux. And there were just too many groups and storylines: Bad cops, Hispanic gang, Orc gang, Fairy gang, Magic Task Force (lol)... i mean, what the F###?!

it assigns the real world races and groups a code name and different look .
like orcs, elves and a cops life in all this madness going on. apart form the concept of that the take on fantasy in real life kind of way is very different than that of any other movie falls to fantasy category .
i really liked this movie . the 2 main actors do their job damn well . The use of Visual Effects should get the credit it deserves its flawless.comedic pieces was well placed otherwise it would suck a lot . enjoyed the action as well those were great the slow motion scenes were good .
trust me the movie isn't all good i had my doubts while watching why this has to be so long . i think critics were bad on this one , they have this impression of this is going to be bad before they watch the movie probably that's why they rated it a low level as i see people love it .as i think this gives a hidden message to viewer about our current society.

First of all, no back story on how things became as they are.
Nothing to explain, just says we jumped ahead 2000 years or something like that
and suddenly every angel, fairy, orc and gandalf(oops, wrong movie) was in the role. Naturally elves was magically the leader of everything and naturally the orc was the grunts on the ground. So what in heavens name does the producers want? For us to jump in every hoops they offer and just say ""oh well thats the way it would have been"". and then plots and twists and ofc you know the guys is the hero/antihero/hero can't decide what.This is such a mixup and this movie , if anything, serves best as an pilot for a tv series than anything else, it leaves so many questions unanswered and it basically begs for a sequel or something.No thank you, I think Will Smith's outages into space and aliens and outwords etc has gone to far when it comes to fairies and magical creatures.someone needs to stop eating their magically delicious snacks cause this... was not worth the money to be honest.",Bright

Car chases, fight scenes, gun fights; everything guys look for in exciting movies I'm pretty sure.Really the only complaint I have is that the heroine is just a bit silly sometimes. Although she does create a real contrast to the antagonist -- a real meanie.Love love love Will Smith.
Joel Edgerton is a real surprise these days. You sort of forget he's in there.",Bright
295,ulrichburke,"Nasty, spiteful, disturbing little movie (SPOILERS ALERT!)",4,26 December 2017,"Basically, this film's a Far Right fanboy's dream, it's about as racist and nasty as a movie can get. First off, you watch a poor fairy being splatted. OK it's attacking a light like a moth, but why's that a reason to kill it (heck, why's that a reason to kill a moth?) There's no other reason for the fairy being there than to show how 'badass' Will Smith is by killing the poor thing. The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off at that point.Then my online g/f made me watch it with her. Boy! Everyone hated the orcs - why? Because they were Orcs, of course, and that's what you do with Orcs, you shove them in a ghetto and hate on them (they were thinly disguised coloured people anyway, so that made it OK to hate on coloured people just because they're not white.) Then the human (Will, but I'm gonna call him The Human!) was DEFINITELY the slave owner, the orc was DEFINITELY the slave, don't let Will being coloured confuse you, he was as much a white slaver as you can get. And the Orc was as much of a subservient caricature of a coloured guy as you can get. Great writing. Not. So this movie was about 2 cops who were forced together by circumstances but really hated eachother's guts, spent the movie trying to find excuses to betray eachother so each could get the other off his back. If the orc betrayed the human he'd prove himself to his own kind. If the human killed the orc he'd be a hero to the other cops. The only reason the human didn't kill the orc was because the orc understood a bit about magic and when the wand turned up, the human needed the orc alive, even though he hated him. Then you get the huge plot hole of the Wand Itself. Three cops want it to give themselves power. A 'hood guy in a wheelchair wants it to magic himself able to walk again BUT.... only a Bright can handle it without blowing themselves up. That's hammered home to you. And none of the people who wanted it had any idea if they were Brights or not, prob. not, Brights are pretty rare creatures. So why not chuck'em the wand, let them blow themselves up by touching it, pick the wand back up out of the ashes (you can obviously touch it because you're not blown up!) and carry onto the next scene? When the escaped Bright turned up, the human tried to kill the Orc for not turning her in, but needed her alive because she could use the Wand. The Human and the Orc spent the entire time arguing with eachother, mostly she was just a chattel, being tossed unceremoniously and totally chauvenistically into various vehicles. Yet when the plotwriters painted themselves into corners, she became Superwoman! Why was she letting those two push her around so much? Even at the end, The Human was telling the Orc he hated him and wsn't his friend. When the Orc was accepted by his own kind, the human was glad he hadn't killed him because now he could use the Orc as a Quisling to find out what other Orcs were up to. Altogether, a thoroughly nasty, racist, overly violent waste of time. BUT.... if it had had a ton less violence and a ton more magic in, like the series Once Upon A Time, so it felt more mystical , and if the creatures of magic had been given more personality and more of a part t o play in the film (rather than just being there to be racist about) it would have been a much better movie. Enjoy the world it creates, but think of how much more they could have done with the idea if they'd had the courge to use more magic and less hatred and guns. As it stands, this movie's a hymn to the virtues of racism. It COULD have been a really good fantasy. What a waste. Chris Burke.",Bright

It's a journey of two cops on a quest at the LA land in the middle of the gangsters, Orcs clan, Elf Assassins, & Magic FBI. This movie almost cyberpunk-ish too like ""Shadowrun series"" for RPG fans with the overcrowded settings in downtown LA while almost a sci-fi city in ""Elftown"" with rich & powerful elfs controlling the city. The movie definitely has great setting & memorable characters. Will Smith & Joel Edgerton are having a great chemistry in this. 
Story: 8/10. Probably the best Max Landis work on movies so far.
Setting: 8/10. Great, finally something unique in Hollywood (although not exactly new with Shadowrun series).
Characters: 7/10. MCs are great but some supporting casts aren't fleshed out enough. 
Sounds: 6/10/ average, passable. 
Action: 7/10. There are some good fight scenes but there are also some confusing choreographs.
Cinematography: 7/10. Honestly, David Ayer wouldn't be my first choice to direct this.

Just re-watched this movie and realized all that I had missed that evening so long ago. Am a fan of the genre, maybe not an uber fan, but I watch most of the schlock and enjoy it for what it is. This is on the level of LOTR with adult characters, grounded in the real world. This isn't a black and white G v E. It's nuanced. Where the details are scarce, it just enhances the story. I look forward to Landis and Ayers doing another. There is a lot of room for these characters and the world they inhabit to grow. Watch it TWICE, there is a lot that can be missed. Third time is the charm.",Bright
300,mikesnppr,Much better than I expected,7,20 September 2018,"I went in with low expectations thinking this will be just an average flick from a genre i enjoy, but i was wrong. 
I loved the combination of the LOTR themes and a modern day society and technology, it was very original and fun to watch.
The characters were presented very well too, both main protags and bad guys were entertaining and you ended up rooting for the good guys without any issues.
The pacing was decent as well, the first third of the movie was a bit slow, but then it gained pace and it was a smooth ride with no real deaf spots.
It would be nice, if they uncovered a bit more from the lore related to the plot, but luckily since the sequel was already ordered we will get answers to those questions there hopefully.I quite enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to the second part.I wonder for whom are the professional critics who are bashing movies like this with low scores even rate them anymore?",Bright
301,nbfcblog,Alien Nation set in Modern Middle Earth,6,25 January 2018,"Using fantasy stories to provide commentary on contemporary society is hardly a new concept, especially in regards to racism. Just look no further than Dr. Seuss' short story The Sneetches or the whole Mud-bloods vs. Pure-blood theme of the Harry Potter series.However, if there is a comparison to be made with David Ayer's latest creation that gives an End of Watch urban cop thriller spin to a Middle Earth-esque mythos; it would be Disney's Zootopia.Both movies use odd else-where settings (Zootopia with anthropomorphic animals, Bright with orcs and elves) in order to examine racism and the wealth disparities that exist within our own.I certainly give Bright plenty of credit for it's intriguing ""Middle Earth in the modern day"" concept and the large amount of money that was obviously put behind it (it's the most expensive Netflix movie yet). From a visual effects and cinematograph perspective; it's certainly the best-looking of the Netflix features that have been released thus far.With all it's impressively thrilling action sequences that have all the blood and grit of those nostalgic R-rated 90's action flicks and wild shenanigans courtesy of the MacGuffin magic wand; nothing here feels cheap or like a glorified TV movie as with some past Netflix features.But the film's core strength is it's two main leads.I've always loved Will Smith ever since he first stepped out of that rare cab on the popular tv show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Smith has a natural ""adorkable"" charisma that lighten up a room and posses solid acting chops to boot. Even if he may not always be in the best movies (Wild Wild West, Concussion), Smith always manages to elevate things somewhat and Bright is no exception.Smith, much like with his previous role of Deadshot from Suicide Squad, utters plenty of hilarious one-liners while also being a more morally grey character than his previous roles. Despite being despicably racist and mean towards his Orc partner, Smith brings a certain vulnerability and humanism to the role that gives the down-on-his-luck Daryl Ward compelling layers.Smith also shares great Bad Boys-like chemistry with co-star Joel Edgerton, who despite having to act with pounds of prosthetic Orc make-up, manages to still turn in a very solid performance. While I wish Nick Jakoby's backstory was more thoroughly explored, Edgerton still manages to be compelling by playing up to the character's innocence.Much like with Ayer's and Smith's previous heavy flawed but enjoyable Suicide Squad, if you can accept Bright on the level of being a B-level low fantasy action flick with solid action and funny dialogue; then it's passably fun on that level.However, upon watching this I can't help but feel that the concept presented would have been better served if it was a six part Netflix miniseries rather than a movie. The script is written by Max Landis; a screenwriter full of clever ideas but can't coalesce them into a great screenplay to save his life (Ex. American Ultra, Mr. Right, Victor Frankenstein).In all honesty, the further away we get from Chronicle, the more that movie is starting to look like a fluke.Where the aforementioned Zootopia was able to deliver a surprisingly fair and balanced portrayal of societal racism and prejudice from all angles while still telling a compelling coherent story, Bright is not able to do the same. The first twenty minutes of this movie in particular lays the racism subtext on way too thick with particularly heavy-handed lines such as ""Fairy Lives Don't Matter"".Sheesh, and I thought Spike Lee lacks subtlety.Landis is also pedestrian when it comes to developing the backstory and fantasy LA setting, with the fantasy elements seemingly placed at pure random at times. For the most part Bright's LA looks like normal LA with Orcs and Elves in it, but other times with little explanation there would be Guillermo del Toro-style magical trees, gothic seedy churches surrounded by normal square buildings, and a Dragon flying in the background (I bet a certain Dothrakian queen is worried sick right now).Frankly, the whole subplot revolving around a certain prophecy and the danger of a Dark Lord returning felt forced into the plot to give the conflict un-needed worldly stakes. Bright works best as a low-fantasy with focus on character interplay rather than as a Lord of the Rings-type epic high fantasy.There is also a subplot involving an Orc gang and Nick that is very sloppily injected into the third act that honestly felt like padding and it's made worse by the fact that it leads to a moment that is frustratingly ripped straight from Training Day!!I really liked the concept, the action, and the two main leads but it's execution and attempts at world-building left much to be desired. There is a sequel currently in the works and despite my reservations, I am still personally interested enough to see what lies in store for Daryl and Nick next.",Bright
302,paulyew-45125,Critics were right...,3,17 May 2018,"I won't even go into the story line and pick out everything that was completely ludicrous about this movie. The biggest problem with this film is that it is nothing more than a bunch of movie cliches blended together and dressed up as a ""new"" movie. There is nothing original about this movie and just about everything is predictable. Why? Because we've seen it before. The upside is that since this is a Netflix production, anyone who has an active Netflix account can watch this for free. The downside is that the time you will end up wasting on this film isn't so free...",Bright

304,Boreas74,Terry Pratchett meets Alien Nation?,2,22 December 2017,"There is an interesting idea at the heart of this film, but it's let down by the execution and the humour, which just falls flat It comes across as Will Smith doing a Will Smith impersonation.The central conceit of a modern day world in which several intelligent species exist alongside each other is never really developed and we're not given a clear idea of what the world of 'Bright' is really like, are there Orcish and Elvish nations for example.The Guards series of novels by Terry Pratchett is a much better and more developed take on the idea of a multi species police force and I'd recommend reading them instead. They also manage to be both much funnier and much more emotional impactful. The other film/TV show this echos is 'Alien Nation' from the late 1980s.",Bright
305,bementar,Cop Drama gets 'Medieval',9,26 December 2017,"Perhaps some 'critics' have an arbitrary dislike against Netflix. Others toward Fantasy or Sci-Fi - so much so they ignorantly use the two terms interchangeably. Honestly, the poor reviews of Bright made it all the more surprising to get to experience how good it actually was.People hold grudges, we get that. Bright gets that. That might also be one of the reasons why it made some critics so uncomfortable. It put those grudges right up in the viewers face to the point that it can't be ignored.Here's the kicker though, and what sets Bright apart from many would-be moral tales. While the ethical problems of the story's world are in your face the solutions to those ethical dilemmas aren't spelled out... Much like the world we live in.Many claim the representation of orcs as a caste archtype was offensive - but I would place my money on it being the representation elven class that really got underneath some people's skin.What holds this movie back? Closure. But that might not be a bad thing... I want to see more of this world. And I think Netflix is going to deliver.",Bright
306,BklynBryanCM,Trust the audience instead of critics!!! BRIGHT spot for Netflix,8,29 December 2017,"BRIGHT was a hybrid/ cross genre film blending sci-fi/ fantasy with crime/ drama & action. Don't trust critics! Approx 90% of the audience enjoyed BRIGHT. Will Smith delivered his trademark one liners and great action scenes. Highly recommend that you check out BRIGHT. Loved the haunting performance of Noomi Rapace! She was brilliant as the evil villain elf!! Joel Edgerton did an extraordinary job as the first Orc police officer. Some say that BRIGHT was an obvious allegory for the current state of politics/ race relations. After all Smith said ""Fairy lives don't matter today"". Which upset some people as well as Orcs being used as a metaphor for Minorities. However, the overall theme & moral of the story of BRIGHT was a positive message of different races working together toward a common goal. An orc, elf, and a human join forces to prevent an apocalypse (The return of The Dark Lord). BRIGHT had 3 million viewers in its first three days of streaming and received a limited theatrical release. I was fortunate enough to view BRIGHT at a movie theater. It definitely belonged up on the big screen. Netflix has green-lit a sequel to BRIGHT. Odds are that we will see Ward (w/ his new found BRIGHT powers) and his back-from-the-dead partner Jakoby battle The Dark Lord!!! Tikka needs to strengthen & improve on her magic abilities to help Ward & Jakoby. A sequel has great potential for expanding upon the story and characters. BRIGHT has something for everybody. It is the film version of a ""renaissance man""/ ""jack of all trades"" seamlessly fusing sci-fi/ fantasy with crime/ drama & action.",Bright

Fairies, elves, orcs, and who knows what else. Story got a little muddled at times but was entertaining most of the time. I feel a sequel coming on but really, does everyone have to use that dirty mouth? Can we ever go back? Kids would love this movie, but I wouldn't let mine see it.",Bright
311,Neil_Durrant,"A reasonable romp, elevated from the rest by a neat fusion of genres.",7,18 January 2018,"Bright is set in a parallel Los Angeles, where mythical creatures live alongside humans, combining the ""downtrodden cop/partner"", and fantasy adventure playbooks. You can infer to your heart's content from the roles of the different races and their parallels in our own society, and the humour is unsophisticated, but serviceable.There's nothing new here at all really, but the film is well made and shot, and there are enough good ideas to keep you in your seat.",Bright

I'm shocked at the unevenness of the reviews here. Usually you can read the reviews, and then the user reviews, and get a sense about whether you want to watch it. seeing the unevenness of scores here, makes me begin to think 'FAKE NEWS'Some calling it brilliant, others feeling like I do.. Time was, I would automatically watch a Will Smith movie, because I felt they were consistently good. Lately I just don't understand how he is picking the movies to star in..",Bright

315,francis007,Fun and ok but kind of generic with interesting world building,7,24 December 2017,"First like everyone else I must address the critics. Their hatred of this movie is not really understandable. It seems it is politically motivated because the movie deals with racial issues in a fantasy setting (which is the most banal thing in fantasy settings) and they feel the message was not progressive/PC enough. 
That's bs.
Now the movie itself - the plot is so unoriginal that it sounds like a joke: the heroes must protect a macguffin while being chased by all sort of parties who want this macguffin. You saw it 100 times before.
But it's well done and fun. Nothing incredible but serious competent work.
And there is some interesting world building here, the LOTR 2000 years later idea, which would have been much better if this was the pilote of a TV series and not a movie. There is a sequel so we will see.
Anyway if you have it on Netflix, watch it, it's good.",Bright
316,revboose-781-838014,"A few gaps, but enjoyable",7,3 January 2018,"Bright reminds me of the concept of Star Wars: A New Hope. George Lucas put out the part of the story that he figured audiences would be able to grasp most quickly, to see if they would want more; when they did, he *gave* them more, and look where we are now! Such is this movie, I think. Bright drops us into a world where the Nine Races (Human, Elf, Orc, and I'm guessing, Fairy, Dragon, Troll, and whatever the others are) live in a tense attitude of peace, but where everyone has their place in the world. Orcs are muscle; humans are emotion and order; Elves are wealth and glamour, etc. Magic is real, but can only be used and controlled by a select few who are given the title of ""Bright."" Brights are born, but not necessarily easily identified as such. There are various tests, though, some of which may cost you your life if you're wrong. If you've seen Alien Nation, you'll think ""Oh, I know this movie!"" Yes and no. It's a ""buddy cop / alien cop / fish-out-of-water cop"" movie on several levels, but takes some neat twists with the formula. Bright II was green-lit before the release of this one, and I truly hope they make it, and make it GOOD! I enjoyed this story, but now I'm craving exposition and background and an understanding of this world that is a lot of the best elements of Shadowrun brought to life.",Bright
317,neil-procter,Middle Earth in the 21st Century?,3,27 March 2018,"Imagine a world in which adults have the imagination and intellect of fourteen year-olds and an internet movie company makes a film about Middle Earth maybe 1000 years after Lord of The Rings. The premise they take for their movie is that orcs and elves interact with humans, harmless dragons cruise the skies, there is magic, but everything else in the world is just like it is in every other underworld cop drama; ignorance and racism abound, there is much violence and mayhem. The baddies are desperate to bring back the Dark Lord - I laughed at this extra Lord of the Rings connection, and again when I considered it could just as easily be Voldemort. Did I say there is magic - glowing magic wands that a non- magic person can't touch without instant death. As I said, it's a plot for fourteen year-olds but it is supposed to be an adult movie. Ultimately, as with all violent films, we then just have to wait for the one with the biggest to win. As usual, it turns out that goodies have the biggest, but they take the whole movie to prove it. Alas, I couldn't be bothered to wait that long.",Bright

319,atishnramdonee,Not that bright,3,22 September 2019,"I really like how they merged fantasy and reality throughout, even if the climax feels like a huge F-up.But the arterial lifeline of this movie is a deja-vu adventure: good people find a weapon which can be used to destroy humanity, and they save the world - so lots of cliches in it.The writer probably masqueraded the lack of originality through this interweaving of genres; I mean, we do not expect to see a fairy tale cum prophetic story happening in the middle of a cop and gang fight, in the inner city! However, there is a poignant subtext: one which has a lot to do with Class and Race.However, this movie lacked in comedic punch, and there were moments which were engineered to sound funny, but which were embarrassingly not funny. In contrast, the dialogues for the cop parts felt genuine.I believe that they could have worked on the pace of this movie, as what started as a little bit slow, suddenly accelerated, to finish with anti-climactic halt.I think Will Smith, who acted a little bit too much, as he did in his previous movies, did not do that bad. While Orcs are supposedly dumber in this movie, I preferred the character of his co-partner, and his acting better. However, a 'Serenity' cum 'Fifth Element' female lead, whose character felt like it was written while drunk was extremely disappointing.Barely entertaining, not that funny: meh.",Bright
320,jmacd-3,"A great mix of action and fantasy - fun and exciting, a nicele made flick!",8,16 June 2021,"I didn't watch this for a few years based on some of the negative response/press this film was getting. Having watched it tonight, I find that reaction was based on something I don't understand.Very high production values throughout, and excellent performances across the board - this is a fun transplant of a standard action movie plot into a fantasy setting, with Orcs, Elves and Fairies. Once you get your footing about 15 minutes into the film, you can appreciate the allegory of racism toward Orcs and other beings. There's not of plot here, but there is a nice buddy story laid onto this scenario. It's a lot of fun, and the actors really bring life to the material.Maybe it's not a classic, it is very effective in the telling of the story it intends to tell. To do more in this world would require a TV series, diving deeper into the world that the filmmakers have created. As it is, it's a fun film wth two excellent leads, leaving us wanting more.",Bright

322,hansjs,"Tries to be too many things, Isn't good at any of them",5,2 January 2018,"The concept seemed like a cool idea. I wanted to like the movie. Unfortunately, it's really just a clunky attempt combining social commentary with about 10 different other movies. With that, had the dialogue not been so God awful, I would have been able to enjoy this as a decent attempt genre combining action flick. It's not. The dialogue is terrible. The plot is super paint by numbers. The occasional nudity, which certainly doesn't offend me, serves zero purpose to the story line. 
So why even give 5 stars? The main Orc character, Nick was pretty good. The overall idea (fantasy characters like Orcs, Elves, and magic overlayed on today's society), while not particularly well pulled, is still a good idea. 
This has the feel of a TV pilot that could be made into a series still, even with all it's shortcomings.I would Keep the main Orc character and make him the main character in a TV series and move on from Will Smith, who is wasted as the stereotypical jaded cop.",Bright
323,kchintogtoh,It wasn't the best but I loved it.,7,25 December 2017,The movie's synopsis was good. I loved the idea of bringing magic and other races to modern age.

324,KlangSmithToo,Would Rather Have Watched Battlefield Earth II,1,28 July 2018,"So, I now have a theory. We were told that Suicide Squad was not a good movie due to studio interference. They forced reshoots and interjected humor and just monkeyed with the entire thing, making it a dumb, muddy mess. They interfered with David Ayer's vision. After sitting through the entirety of Bright, it is now my opinion that all of the studio interference probably made Suicide Squad a better movie and turned it from unwatchable to moderately entertaining. Bright, unfortunately, had no studio interference.
How do you take such an original idea and have absolutely nothing original to say with it? Bright is every buddy cop cliche mashed up with every fantasy cliche delivered via a two dimensional plot and corny dialogue. Nothing about this movie was good. The story plays out like a third grade D&D campaign. The characters were cardboard cut-outs from Tolkien meets Lethal Weapon. The acting was wooden (aside for a few brief moments by Edgerton who did his best with what he was given). The pacing was bad. The shots were bad. The stunts were bad. The FX were beyond bad. Seriously, 90 million dollars for rubber orc masks and tattoos that were obviously drawn on with a Sharpie. Noomie Rapace looked great. Everyone else looked like cosplay on the last day of comicon when everyone is tired and hungover and just can't be bothered. Ayers made nothing but bad choices and delivered a terrible movie. I am tempted to insert the words ""visionless hack"" into this review somewhere but thought that might be bit too harsh. Hopefully, Netflix ignores the obvious shill reviews praising this stinker, takes note of all of the harsh criticism that this flick so richly deserves and interferes a little more in the sequel so the next installment will be at least moderately entertaining.",Bright

I saw the trailer and thought ""Ok, modern day Los Angeles cop movie, sprinkled in with fantasy elements, something about orcs and a magic wand...seems dope"". After watching this movie what can I conclude we got? A modern day Los Angeles cop movie, sprinkled in with fantasy elements, something about orcs and a magic wand.I don't know what critics thought they were getting into. Acting was great, lots of action scenes throughout, some were alright and some were shot really well, Will Smith classic jokes thrown in, and you got yourself a great time. My only complaint was I wish we had a deeper understanding of some of the characters (they try to quickly say what their motive is but it would be better if some were more fleshed out), and the movie constantly references some past historical events of this world that I wish we got to also have a deeper understanding of their history (Netflix signed on for a sequel so I'm hoping it'll dig deeper into the world).Solid 9/10. If they added an extra 20 minutes or so to delve deeper into the history and villains I would give it a 10, but hopefully the sequel does the job.",Bright

It just seems that everything nowdays has to have Orcs,Elves or magic.All the subtitles. All i want to do is watch a film not spend half the time reading.Pick a language and stick with it. Subtitles are ok from time to time but not every 5 minuets.Will Smith acts the same as he did in Bad Boys and just about every film he's been in, which is dull to say the leasts.Maybe i would watch it if was a series but as a film not for me.",Bright
327,crystalline-46579,Better than critics say but leaves a lot of ??,7,31 December 2017,"I really enjoyed this movie. On the buddy cop end it was pretty good but the fantasy end was actually fairly light id say. Most of the fantasy elements were only briefly explained or implied. Humans, elves and orcs are the main inhabitants of this alternate world but we do see a centuar standing guard outside the police station then later a dragon flying across the sky in the distance. Fairies are implied to be pests but we only ever see one in the begining then again as the credits roll. Kind of like will smiths beloved family oddly enough. My biggest complaint about this movie is there wasnt time to explore more aspects of the world and its obviously rich history. That and the villians were one dimensional. It was hard to grasp their motivation for wanting to rise some nameless dark lord from the dead. Seems to me that if the inherently evil elven bright had her all powerful wand she wouldnt need to raise an ancient big bad from the grave. In any case rapace and her buddies give us some good fight scenes and she looks badass.

It also had the sarcastic crude humor of Will Smith that only made the movie even better in the end! The only thing I could complain about is I wish the magic was a little more entwined with it but I kinda get why and the ending was a bit weaker than expected but, overall definitely a 9/10 for sure without a doubt and I hope to see a Bright 2 to expand on this story and bring the cop and magic thing more into view!",Bright

The story is complete garbage, the characters are one-dimensional (some are zero-dimensional), there are enough dei ex machina to give Adam Jensen another full-lengh game, and every element of the movie is generic and lifeless. Magic wands? A prophecy about bringing back a dark lord? Really? That's the best idea you could come up with, given an entire blank slate of fantasy lore to pull from?The two federal agents that follow the characters through the story ONLY exist to provide exposition to the audience between action scenes.I wonder how many genuinely talented writers are out there, struggling to get their scripts read as this overly-expository, connect the dots, pre-teen bullshit gets churned out by the dozen every year.I don't know.This movie was either half-assed, made out of sheer incompetence, or both.

This is the first movie I have seen since LOTR to give me that legendary ""Edge Of My Seat"" experience. Which is a feeling that has always alluded me since I only really feel it in Games. It is a modern masterpiece especially if you happen to be a RPG gamer like me. Will Smith was awesome and hilarious as always.And Joel Edgerton's performance was so good that he NEEDS TO BE in the next Warcraft movie.And Tikka! Whilst barely speaking gave this movie more depth and emotion than every other side character in the history of Cinema!Aside from that the bad guys are evil and menacing as they should be. (Looking at you Black Panthers Killmonger)
Last but not least it features world building at its pinnacle. After all what is the point of a movie if not to take you to another world?GO WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW! STOP EVERYTHING YOUR DOING AND GO! NOW!",Bright
335,nburroughs-34087,Brightless,4,15 June 2018,Bright has a strong cast that tries to work with the weak script but even with great actors it is not enough to make the movie good.

The action sequences work but there is not enough to keep interest.,Bright
336,GreenApplesss,"Movie is great, Ignore the critics and watch it yourselves.",9,23 December 2017,"I watched the trailer months ago, I was pumped by it because it seems so good. Then I just watched it minutes ago, and oh my. It was so good, I am embarrassed by the ratings yesterday, I was about to watch it and I saw it was 6.0 and I was like what? really? Why is it so low? It didn't stopped me from watching it because I have a feeling that it won't disappoint me, and I was right. It didn't. I thought this was a series, it would be actually cool if it was a series, because those orcs & elves + the pool ( you'll know it what I mean after watching the movie ) will have a proper introduction even it will have a slow progress until popping some action from the rest of the episodes. That could've been ending for the whole plot. ( This is just my opinion )To be honest with you, This might sound maniac. I watched it because of Tikka ( Lucy Fry ) because she fits so well being Elf. ( LOL ) But, Will Smith is here too so I really have a good feeling that it will be good and it won't flop.The real review;The movie is great, It had some plotholes, I bet thats what critics are focused by those plotholes and don't like fantasy & it was directed from the director of Suicide Squad so I think that might be the reason too [(because the SS was a flop )]( AFAIK ). Acting is good, they played their roles really well, I just find some lines that are unnecessary cussing, I don't really watch fantasy ( If I only found it interesting and had some actors that went on good movies ). I'm not surprised that some people don't like it, we all have our different taste & opinions on watching movies. If you are unsure because it has a low rating & bad critic review, Just watch it. Don't listen to those guys because this movie really went well from I expected it to be. Hopefully, There's part 2 of this! I won't be able to wait. This is my one of the favorite movies of this year.You will be confused by the plot, because it didn't introduced how the orcs and elves come to life, but I expected it because it was ""fantasy"". There are some characters that is poorly introduced too and background. But that's just the only bad thing that I see, Other than that, You should watch it! I really recommend it.",Bright
337,theedeer-13767,"Thought it would at least be funny in parts but, it was not well put together and made everything unbearable.",1,21 October 2020,"Will Smith is put in this to make some jokes and act cool like in many of his other movies; borrowed overused and simplistic in that aspect. The entirety of the movie is loosely put together to form a 'kind of' plot which is pieced together and never really reaches the goal; I strongly believe it was made & written in an amateur way and had to throw in a couple strip club scenes for no other reason other than to have a few naked women. .Such a dull overused plot that coulkd have come out of any half rated fantasy flic. It was so slow in some parts to get to obvious conclusions and fight scenes were a bit eye rolling at points, like "" why would they slowly ignore the people who would kill them giving them enough time to inch by inch ( literally) come back to finish someone off. If you are desperate for a movie and not bothered by obvious ridiculous actions and a weak plot and never really coming together smoothly or with any great writing or anything you may like this. So many things left me saying, why?..... Just 'why? Other than Will Smith, no one really had much of a part at all do do any real acting, other than one, and it was a part of innocent ignorance misunderstood and stupid combined with courage. The end made me also wonder, why are the others at the end supporting them with no idea or proof ???? Almost like lets make everyone seem to know everything they did and make everyone like them and forgive them with absolutely no knowledge of what really happened.... Great Job guys.... what did you say happened again?? The gangs though they did great.... why?? The others were just happy with a cover up and let them get away with murder...( because they had no idea what really happened.... sigh sigh sigh... I could pick it a part for longer than the movie lasted. Let's make a movie and .... and... well, let's just make a movie.",Bright

I had no expectations but i was kinda sceptic because of Ayer, SS was a mess. Anyway, i loved it. It felt like LOTD meets the warriors meets black rain, imo a killer combo. Will smit was good and i really liked Joel edgerton, hell i thought the entire cast was great. I loved how every race in the movie had their own distinctive style.

344,naijshua-627-972216,Just Wow! So many places it can go?,10,30 May 2019,Whomever wrote the the main rewiew for this film on this page summed up this movie pretty well in his or her title. There's a lot of unexplained things that could go in a lot more detail and further films. But the characters of Jacoby and Ward work well together if they were more developed it would be pretty cool. I'm not sure what part 2 is going to go but I'm just glad I'm getting it because this movie deserves it and it's something that's totally different. I see a lot of films.It's a shame it got a bad wrap it because I do see where their issues but the hope of what it could grow into and how it all started is a prophecy.,Bright

As the title said, it's an action/fantasy flick that will do well with any (male) who's not old enough to vote.
the plot is incredibly simplistic and easy to grasp. there's bad guys who want do invoke some ancient evil, and our heroes trying to stop them. 
You've probably watched dozens of similar movies and this one is no different. the characters are archetypes (and Will Smith plays the exact same role he always play), humor is daft , the action scenes are effective.
The money poured into this film's production is what mostly helps this movie score a 7 rather than a 5 or a 6 for my taste.

347,mynban,How is this so underrated by critics?,10,20 May 2018,"I just can't understand how could anyone have not liked the movie, assuming they watched the trailer and had an idea about what it was they were about to watch.To start with the world setting is amazing, they paid so much attention to detail in crafting the world and everything we needed to know about this world was introduced without needing any narration at all. The graffities, the way people interact at street, the street signs, districts and the reaction people show in different parts of town; it all delivered the intricate mechanics of that magical/fantasy 21st century world.Characters were very well fleshed out. They never felt one dimensional at any point, and they developed in a very consistent and relatable way through the story. Visuals were also very good with action scenes feeling satisfactory in the sense of old school movies like lethal weapon or die hard series.I would have given it a 9, but after seeing the unfair scoring from so many people I bumped it up to 10, because this movie definitely deserves it.",Bright
348,grantham-15125,Way better than a 6!,9,27 December 2019,"This is a really great, fun buddy cop movie - with a twist. One cop is human (Will Smith) and the other an Orc who is being trialled in the police force against huge prejudice by the other cops. Add in some elves, some magic and plenty of action and wisecracks and we have a winning formula! It just gets better and better towards the climax with some unexpected twists - which I won't spoil. A solid film currently on Netflix and well worth an evening with some popcorn!",Bright
349,cmerrittphantom,Awesome imaginative fun.,8,7 January 2018,"Anyone who poos on this movie is a snob. Simple as that. This is a fun slightly above average modern fantasy flick with great acting, great writing, and fantastic world-building and thematic commentary.If someone criticizes the racism commentary for being simple, why don't you go write a blog about how The Lord of the Rings trilogy is trash cinema, because it did the same exact thing, literally. There's a comment made that people take as hand waving certain strains of racism away, but it's just a realistic depiction of someone who isn't victimized all that much but has experience with it trying to level with someone who lives it daily... I've seen that exact thing happen on multiple occasions in real life.Anyway, the plot is standard fare modern cop partners bonding mix up with standard fantasy stop the dark lord, and it works so well. There's a lot to think about in this movie, whether it's the dynamics of racism, or the historical relevance of real life pop culture depictions of fantasy characters in this alternate reality of sorts... that might not make sense but if you see the movie you'll be tempted to think it's a plot hole by your inner cynicism... it's not, it's imagination fuel. Have fun.Let loose and have fun with this movie. Characters are easy to connect with if you don't have your head in places it shouldn't be over the racism element. The two lead guys have great chemistry despite one of them being in full prosthetic make up. It's great.Action is pretty solid. Not your shakey cam. Some people might not like that a lot of it happens in the dark, at night, but I followed the flow just fine. It was fun, and had some unique action set pieces. The bad guys are threatening enough it's got some good tension.Fun, energetic pacing, a little sticky in some places, but not even noticeable if you're fully invested in what's going on and firing on all cylinders with the toys the setting and lore gives you to think about.A lot of the humor isn't my personal brand, but it works well because it doubles as good character drama and development. My brother was laughing at it while I was empathizing with Will Smith or orc guy depending on the situation. I swear it's not racist that I don't know the orc guy's actor's name. He's in orc make up and he's not Will Smith.",Bright

Here we go again. Warf times a hundred. I alwaus thought Orks got a raw deal when it came to Lord Of the Rings, but this is just junk. I would rathe rhave violent orcs then overly humane ones, and Will Smith needs to realize he isn't the Prince of Bellair at some point. That humor of his isn't ageing well.",Bright
351,thejacobmello,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,7,8 February 2018,"Director David Ayer has earned a place in my mind as the director who knows how to turn once in a lifetime ideas and boatloads of money into brilliant trailers attached to truly shit movies. So, when I saw the initial trailer for Bright, and googled the price tag, as intrigued as I may have been, I refused to get my hopes up. I can't say this movie has given the man a new lease in my good graces, but it was a start!It's a bit derivative. It doesn't take a cinephile to notice there's a healthy portion of Training Day and Lethal Weapon hidden in there, with a nice dash of The Warriors, mixed with a vaguely familiar peppering of this and that. And honestly, if it would have been a straight buddy cop movie, it wouldn't be worth the watch. But two things saved it here: The fact that partner number two was a fuckin' Orc, and the fact that partner number one was Will fuckin' Smith.Had the leading character been played by Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp or anyone else, this movie would have been a Razzie contender for sure, but there's something about the pure charismatic conviction and charm that Will Smith brings to the table that makes movie's like this feel authentic. (for a Cameron Crowe film to work, you need a Tom Cruise. For an M. Night. Shyamalan film to work, you need a Bruce Willis. For a buddy cop or action movie with aliens or zombies or mythical creatures to work, you need Big Willie. *obviously there's exceptions, but following this simple key could easily save Hollywood billions*)This won't go down in history as a great movie; and it shouldn't - there were a handful of gaping plot holes, a couple cure-all options they chose to sweep under the rug for the sake of cinematic struggle and, as previously mentioned, the derivative nature of it all. Fine. I can live with that. Honestly, my goal is merely to keep it from going down as an awful movie; which it most certainly wasn't. They were thoughtful in their set ups and pay offs, the acting and chemistry were top-notch, and they had me invested in the ride and outcome from credits to credits.The ""ghetto fairytale"" world was a fun place to explore and though they didn't specifically leave it open for a part two, with the right execution, there's room for a sequel that would go down in history as a truly great movie.Prescriptions

Don't trust reviews from people, who loved Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman. Bright was not good. It 's better than Suicide Squad, which is a 2/10, but that isn't saying much. It's a ham-fisted allegory with incompetent world building. The non-sense nature of the world that is built leave many questions, that would not be answerable, because the answers would make no sense. The story in general is also lacking. The action scenes are fine. The acting is fine in the sense that the actors are doing what the director has told them to do. It's not the worst movie.

HOWEVER will smith is great in this, I like him in most action /scify and now fantasy flicks and he doesn't disappoint in this. The story is ok, seems more like something they should have done in a show so they could build out the lore a bit more, I hope there is a part 2 to flesh it all out.

I don't know what exactly they were expecting, but it seems they just didn't understand this movie.I'm pretty picky when it comes to stories and acting, very picky in fact, but this was top of the line on both counts. I enjoy very much being thrown into an unusual storyline, unapologetically and without excessive ""set up""... and being demanded to accept an odd new world, as it is, on face value. That's exactly what this movie does, and does it well. The story is fascinating, compelling, and weaves a great tale. Joel Edgerton is awesome as Jakoby, and the rest of the cast are naturals, eminently believable. The action is well-suited and not over the top.

It was entertaining, had great action, super banter between the stars, an interesting premise and the acting was stellar. The setting was awesome.

Instead, it pulled me in, trying to make sense of it. Somewhere along the way, I realized that this is a well written, intriguing movie. Perhaps a bit much with the action, but a wonderful combination. Will Smith is doing his typical Will Smith role. And better than usual. Edgerton is perhaps even better, a very pleasant surprise. 
 Granted it borrows/steals from a number of other movies, but charts its own course too.

The movie script was very well thought of, has all the nice components necessary for an action movie with a bit of a twist. It succeeded in introducing the racial issue - a real life problem - as an artifact that is relevant to the plot. The universe of magic and reality they present is very carefully thought of and executed. The direction was great, and made the flow of the movie feel real and engaging. 
The acting was awesome, as would be expected with this cast. I wish however that the director had pulled a bit more of Will Smith's character towards something less heroic, but that's just me.

Hilarious and Awesome!,9,25 December 2017,"I knew nothing about this movie, just stumbled across it while looking for something to watch on Netflix... and I was blown away! I really enjoyed this movie. It's a really high quality sic fi action film - could easily be something you'd see in the theaters, with high quality special effects and action sequences and actors (which is why I was pretty surprised when I saw this movie with Will Smith in it, that I had heard nothing about, had never been in theaters - a netflix original...Imagine Lethal Weapon - set in modern day New York, cops and gangs, etc., except the world has all kinds of fantasy races in it - Orcs and Elves, magic, etc. Imagine Elves (think Legolas) except they are dressed in black Matrix style clothes, carry machines guns and handguns and kicking ass like in a John Wu film... HILARIOUS AND AWESOME! Pure popcorn movie, but I would recommend watching this if you enjoy sic fi fantasy and pure action movies. The chemistry of Will Smith and the orc partner was great too, hilarious dialogue!After I watched this movie, I was really surprised how badly the critics rated it. How is it that those critics got this so wrong? It honestly make me question whether a lot of those reviews are politically influenced by the studios - it feel like there is some kind of politics in Hollywood trying to shoot this movie down because it is a Netflix movie (not going to be released in theaters)? Are the movie studios and media afraid that Netflix could completely disrupt the model for movie distribution - the same way that it completely changed the way TV is consumed? For sure, if this movie had rave reviews, it would change the movie going landscape - an entire industry... But ""Worst Movie of the Year""?? No way this movie was that bad... Honestly, it's better than most of the movies that are out in the Theater right now... Okay, so is this movie a 9? It's definitely over 8 in my book. II watch a lot of movies, I recently watched the Shape of Water, Star Wars: the Last Jedi, Thor Ragnarok, and Justice League in the Theaters, and I honestly feel that Bright is more enjoyable that Star Wars, Justice League, and Shape of Water... Maybe runner up to Thor Ragnarok in terms of pure fun... Of course, those just happen to be the movies I watched recently - Shape of Water is of course a completely different kind of movie, but honestly, movies are supposed to be fun, an escape, and that's why I scored Bright a 9.",Bright

It's simply will smith back at his best ( been a long time) in a movie that reminds me a bit of District 9. 
it was a great hour and a half and had a way better story than most of the blockbuster this year. I couldn't believe it when i saw it had the same metascore as Transformers: The Last Knight or that Justice League had a better score than this original story. Its like Hollywood is ganging up on Netflix to make it fail.

The action and effects are top-notch, no complaints about the actors, and the one liners are surprisingly good... but it's not enough.Not one single character have depth, there's no character development whatsoever and there's at least ten characters I would love to know more about.Since I know ""nothing"" of the characters I don't understand their motives and sometimes very strange behavior, I'm not even sure which ones that are the bad guys. The ingredients could make a great tv show or mini series (perhaps 5 one hour episodes) but instead falls flat.

389,simon_sanos,"After months of putting off watching, I'm glad I finally made the time",8,21 October 2018,"Surprisingly clever, this film riffs on so many cop movies and fantasy tropes, but brings something entirely new.The racial metaphor is a bit obvious (and I'm frankly rather bored of the whole black repression thing. But then I'm English and we dealt with that centuries ago, more or less; if I was a black American I'd undoubtedly feel differently). But the fact that the main protagonist is black and it's the orcs who get the rush deal is a cute departure and helps us think about these issues a little more objectively; that's a powerful application of sci-fi.More impressive is the alternative history, with elves, orcs and even fairies coexisting in well thought out modern world. This is subtly done and leaves so much more to explore.The film itself is solid. Plenty of action, decent enough dialogue, solid acting and some nifty fight scenes and even a spot of magic.There are missed opportunities, Ms Rapace has yet to impress me and the young elven character is largely under developed.Overall, a solid 8/10 for a great concept with room to explore in a series.",Bright
390,sssachin26,Exciting & delightful yet concept could have been refined with a 2-part series.,7,24 December 2017,"Bright amazingly captures the issue of racism & its background. The attention to details & body language seem really thought through. The effects & simplicity is praiseworthy. 
But the story could have been refined a more. The main combination was the racism point along with the fantasy POV. Because of the mix-up, which was good indeed, the focus wasn't distributed quite effectively on both the points. So it may feel like neither of the topics were well focused. It seemed like a rushed execution. A two-part story could have been better. 
They explained a few strong points of their past but it would have been more effective & cool if they would have showed some kind of flashback to better understand a few terms.But still it feels satisfactory. The effort to make this kind of movie is great nonetheless. A 8/10 from me. Would have been 9 if they would have at least presented a clear distinction of all the different races in the storyline. And a flashback of the actual reason for the dispute would have been a 10. 
I most definitely recommend this one for the fantasy enthusiasts, just don't take all the flaws personally & enjoy the creation!",Bright

The cinematography is so poor that at times one can't identify the characters - it is like a failed attempt at Film Noir lighting without the charm.The plot is quite difficult to follow if you care about the development of the characters reactions to the story line... of which there is a very short arc for such a long film.It was pure torture for the entire time I sat through it.",Bright

I found Bright to be pretty damn enjoyable. It's a kind of run all night movie where the characters go against everyone and rightfully so with how the movie sets up the stage and the world it is set in.
I find this movie deserves a 8/10 but will give a 10/10 because of the weird hate revolving around it.
What was bad?
The acting was great. The story was great. The characters great. Also being able to make a world with different rules and make the characters so relateable was amazing.
The stage the music the mostly everything was great about this film.
So how was it so bad?
There is a very strange hate for this film and we should all take notice that Netflix is doing something to piss Hollywood off. 
Maybe making original stories and not another Jason Bourne/Transformers/Pos movie is what makes critics angry these days.
29 from Metacritic? There is more to the story here.Bottom line if you want a fun action filled movie with great setting, atmosphere and characters then give this a watch.",Bright

But please don't come here and give it a 10 / 10 review afterwards telling me ""the critics were wrong"". These are people that have studied and watched film all their life and know a heck of a lot more than any IMDB user does. As for the film I have to agree with the critics, this should be called 'ArBRIGHTrary' as every scene in this film happens for no reason other than to rip off scenes from other films and badly. Acting was pretty good from both leads considering they had an awful script. Female characters are underused and merely serve as plot devices to take our leads on their (really dull and ultimately pointless) journey. Many women will probably boycott this altogether due to its total disregard for the current climate. Additionally, the script was a complete mess. Characters we've not seen before will turn up, state their arbitrary part in the story, cause a few problems for the leads then disappear having had no bearing on the actual story (I refer to the gangsters, Tika, the orc gang leader, even the dirty cops to a degree). The original lore for this world is mentioned in passing rather than fully fleshed out and the actual REASON and MOTIVE for most of the story events / fantasy world's dynamics is 'Just because...' I could go on for hours but overall this film fails because I simply didn't buy it. Everything fell flat; the comedy, story, atmosphere, cinematography, characterisation etc. By the end of the film (which thinks it's a lot more meaningful and spectacular then it actually is) I just felt deflated and angry. What a complete shambles of a film, a total mess and 2 hours I'll never get back. If you do enjoy this when you watch it then please be realistic with your review. You know for a fact that this is NOT a 10/10 film. I've given this 3 because some of the violence and comedy worked for me but overall there was nothing else to like.This movie is dumb... super dumb... it rips off Fifth Element for God's sake.",Bright
405,RBForrest,Critics give bad reviews due to PC society,9,22 December 2017,"This movie was fantastic. I was more than surprised after reading the harsh reviews littering the web. I believe this was because of the issues it deals with. Early in the movie Will Smith says ""Why are you mad at a group that oppressed you over 2,000 years ago?"" and from there you can see the underlying issues this movie represents. Besides that fact, this movie felt like a 'Training Day' or 'End of Watch' but still managed to blend it nicely with the fantasy on hand. The acting was top notch and the thrills (despite the realistic grittiness) were a mile a minute. This was no snooze fest! The only issue I found was that there was TOO much foul language. I'm all for cussing, especially from Will Smith, but a lot of it felt forced since it comes in the form of every other word. Other than that this movie was frickin' awesome and has to be seen to be believed.

The charters and plot are really different and has potential for a great sequel because the world was amazing and the charcters by the end really developed well. Now the problem with critics these daus is that they don't want to seem like they pander to the common denominator but the common denominator is the common people so they aren't helping the populace decide whats good it's putting them down for God knows what reason. This is a classic example as such and as a result many people aren't going to try an original (property) film that was acted in reality despite being such a unique well developed world that I really hope gets developed further.

Acting 5 - Actors did good with what they had to work with but screenplay was bad
Length 1 - The movie was too long and too drawn out. Too much action.

Interest 3 - It held my interest through the first part but I lost interest on going to battle after battle
Cinematography 10 - The movie was shot very well
Music 3 - The music seemed to fit but was distracting at some points I felt the story was a great idea. I wish it was just executed better. It may have done better as a TV show to slowly flesh out the ideas that were presented. Will Smith did a good job but the screenplay he had to work with was subpar. I didn't laugh nearly as much as they wanted me to. Way over use of the f word. It just doesn't mean anything when you use it for every adjective and adverb. Some of the supporting actors were trying to be big, bad, and tough but they did not present it well.

He irritated me in just the right way. He was believable, and even relatable. The same for his partner, who was a younger, sweeter and more earnest character.They had good chemistry, and the main woman sold frightened, victimized do gooder.I was so impressed with how the universe was introduced and unfolded without mass info dumping and a mess of tiresome dialogue.

This movie has too many plot holes that could have made a big difference , I feel that they crammed a what could have been a great series into a one hour gun excessive gun shooting.",Bright

It tries to be serious, but I can't, it is just WAY to stupid of a concept. Imagine watching Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and any conspiracy cop movie while drunk and you get this movie.The writing is just really bad, but what are we to suspect or the writer of some really bad movies. The only actor who is able to deliver his lines is Will Smith, but I sit there an I feel embarrassed to think he did this movie.The director gives off this generic grim look to the film, almost like a Hell Boy movie, but not nearly as good. Some shots look really bad to the point you think they shot it on an $40 camera.The CGI and special effects aren't the worse, but give seem like they were done by someone who learned a few tricks. Make up is okay, but it really goes down hill when they do black vains on Tikka's face and body.Overall don't recommend the movie unless you want to get really REALLY drunk.",Bright

Great acting, great effects, great story line and a lot of action.

This isn't Lord of the Rings.Bright is a solid movie with Will Smith adding his usual charm and flair to the production. I don't understand why the critics are so negative about it but they are what they are. Don't go in expecting some Peter Jackson production but it's a good time hopefully leading off a new franchise.In terms of world-building, mostly good but I don't know how LA exists in its mostly current form or how Shrek got made with Shrek and Fiona still (there's a Shrek joke made, no spoiler there I believe). Those kinds of errors are somewhat grating since the basic premise is what might modern times look like if we had these races living in close proximity for millennia.I think it was definitely worth watching.

444,tpasa-1,Disappointing movie with so much potential,5,3 February 2018,"The concept of this movie had promise, but the overall delivery, the acting, and overall writing was just sub par.I guess they were trying to say something about racism, but the ridiculous over the top hatred of the orc cop by everyone was almost comical. I realized halfway through the movie that everyone in this movie was a jerk besides the orc cop.Will Smith looked tired and uninterested throughout the film and never really is very likeable. They never really explain the whole world as the viewer is not sure if they are watching another world, the future, or something else as a LA-like city has orcs and elves and humans all living together. Blacks and hispanics are given gangster stereotypes and all the cops are just racist jerks and even become attempted murders as one point because of there racism. I can't tell if this is some kind of social message wrapped up in fantasy, but if it was, it was done poorly and the over exaggeration of the racism against the orc made everyone unlikeble.The only thing that saves this movie are the elf bad guys who are like super ninjas killers until they meet up with cop buddy duo, then they predictably becomes less lethal.",Bright
445,aoneill2486,Good but not great,6,24 December 2017,"I watched this last night and my initial impression was that it was good. There were a few things I felt the film lacked more so in the final half. The first half was rammed full of story and character building and it really set the scene for a new world filled with mythical creatures. Was this movie just a tease of things to come? Maybe. Was there more to be played with on screen? AbsolutelyThe attention to detail in the sets was phenomenal, the graffiti in the gas station bathroom really drew your attention, sadly it took away from the on screen bond between Ward and Jakoby. Sadly it seemed that this was another outing for deadshot and his backup crew (jakoby and tikka). The focus was always on Smiths character and if I'm being brutally honest. His portrayal wasn't all that good. Jakoby was given cheesy one liners that didn't really seem to flow with the script or have a genuine interaction with his on screen co stars. Could it have been the voice he was putting on, or because he wasn't used to that amount of special fx make up? Some of the other main Orc characters managed to convey all kinds of emotion. So why couldn't Edgerton. The introduction of the Elves (Leila and her henchelves) what a trio they were and delivered some of the best action scenes in the film. It's a shame we didn't get to know a little more about them, why she was doing what she was doing and how was it going to pan out going forward.I really wanted to see an action scene with Kandomere, you can't just waltz a dude with blue hair and a badass suit on screen and not at least tease us with some mad elf combat skills. I mean, come on, use all the characters and tease their potential.Don't get me wrong, the movie is worth a watch and it is an amazing concept for a film. I just wish David Ayers had pushed it that extra notch and delivered something truly amazing. He should have learnt to do so from his time with Suicide Squad, yes less can sometimes be more but when you've got £90,000,000 budget, I wouldn't have picked such high paid actors (Smith) to take on such a project.Overall, I'd say this would have been better without Will Smith and could have done with casting some unknown up and coming actors to take these Netflix projects to great heights. You only have to look at stranger things to realise what unknown actors and actresses are capable of.
Definitely give it a go though and make of it what you will",Bright
446,dario-dipasquale,it is actually good...,8,27 December 2017,"I read many negative reviews on this movie so as i usually do i decided to watch it, judge by myself and I think it is actually good. Maybe not the best movie of all time but it gives 2 hours of great fantasy-action. I liked very much the Elves-Men-Orcs reality idea. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton are really into the role and it's fun to watch them.
My advice is to watch and judge it for yourself...I think you could be pleasantly surprised by Bright.",Bright
447,Cake15,WHAT,2,6 January 2018,"This movie lacked ANY backstory at all. Why was the orc cop a cop? Why isn't there more ""professional"" orcs? Why are the rest of the orcs ""ghetto""? Why are the elves the richest of them all? What role do fairies play in this and why is it okay to kill them? 
Will Smith's career seems questionable at best in this. While he is an okay actor the films he gets in aren't the best. I just really disliked this. I though it was going to be much better. I will see part 2 in hopes that these things are addressed. I really would love to see a TV show done instead of a movie so we could have more character development.",Bright

454,saxophonelounge,$90m Down The Toilet,2,22 December 2017,"After watching the previews we planned a real movie night for this - got the snacks, set up the cinema and got stuck in. Will Smith, morning coffee, talking with wife in kitchen - nearly exactly cut from Independence Day though the wife was terribly cast and the relationship was completely unconvincing, alas she was forgotten after 20 secs out of shot. This was followed by a whole stream of not very likable characters of which I had no invested interest in, even when the main was was shot dead at one point I didn't feel a thing but anxious waiting for the whole thing to end.The plot was a staccato of poorly thought out scenes that could have led to interesting stories but unfolded in a predictable tale with half baked ""look theres racism in the world"" under-tone that failed to highlight any particular societal problem or enlighten/educate us on any particular moral issue.There was a female elf called Tikka that was dragged around by the main characters for half the scenes for no particular reason on their behalf, this character hardly ever spoke and spent most the time crying and in featal position. When they met this character she was holding the wand and blasted a car to bits with it, though it took them an hour of literally carrying her around to actual use that power in their rambling mission. They then claimed they didn't know she could use the wand! wouldn't you think to ask?Well predictably Will Smith could use the wand and the prophecy that no one really cared about or knew the provenance of was fulfilled. I give it 2 stars because the wand was well designed and at least a little thought out. Shame about the rest.",Bright

I enjoyed the relationship between Will Smith character (Ward) and the Orc, Nick. They had the perfect partnership filled with comedy, and friendship. The story line is pretty simple to follow.... ish, if you have some idea of elves, orcs, magic etc however if you don't know much about these beings than it might be a little harder to follow, but it is a shame the past of what happened before wasn't explored further. This would of made it much easier to follow. There is lots of references to what had happened ""2000 years ago"" something about the dark lord, and magic and wands, and those who are deemed as ""brights"" - essentially those who can wield a magical wand but context wasn't really given through the movie, just snippets.I really would give this movie ago, and ignore the critics!",Bright

Though to paraphrase Buffy's Oz when he learned of the existence of vampires, that explains a lot. First, the basic premise was obviously stolen from Alien Nation (this hit me like a two by four when I read the first sentence describing Bright), a decent and interesting but far from great movie that is Citizen Kane next to this. Characterization is terrible (Will Smith's attitude towards his Orc partner seems to change 180 degrees from scene to scene throughout the film), worldbuilding is awful and confusing, and, worst of all, the dialogue is horrible. The Three Stooges had wittier banter than is on display here. Judging from this and the possible even worse Suicide Squad, David Ayer is seriously talent challenged.",Bright

Known as a Bright (hence, the title). Anyone else touching a magic wand would be killed instantly. Well, guess who turns out to be a Bright? Hint: It's not the Cholo in the wheelchair.The movie has its good points; a cool car chase, a cute Elf fighting against her own people's evil plan and a few decent laughs, but, overall, it falls short of a what could be called a ""good movie"".The acting is dry and without depth. The characters aren't charismatic. You won't be emotionally invested in any of them. The fight scenes are short clips pieced together which screams of poor editing and plot holes that you could drive a semi truck through without slowing down. It contains elements we've all seen before: conflict between partners, an evil master plan by a group who feels superior, main characters fighting against all odds when their peers have turned their back on them, but it doesn't really make any of them work for the audience.I didn't really find it worth watching except to say that I had seen it.Below average - 4/10.",Bright

And some kind of sickness making predator animals attack the other animals races appear. Bunny police and her fox partner work on that case.. If you watch both movies you will see the similiriaty between them. Just like in Zootopia Bright starts with introducing the sections of the multicultural city.

Because of their low rating of Bright, I must assume that Hollywood pays them for their ratings and I want nothing to do with that.Here's my review (I'll try and keep it spoiler free)! There are multiple solid performance's by A listers and B listers performing at a A lister level. There are some weak performances from one or two support actors however this only mildly distracts from the overall immersion. This movie drops you into a world that will leave you wanting to know more about it with a complex story set in modern times steeped in a fantasy setting, blending fantasy and reality in a way that I've not seen before.

If I was watching solo rather than with my husband I admit I would have turned it over however we were watching together so I persevered.As the story line developed the language improved throughout the whole second half of the movie there was less swear words than in the first scene. It came across as lazy scriptwriting and depreciated the character of the protagonist.I completely agree with the review by Nasser74 that the racism towards Orcs was overkill a few rouge cops would have been more realistic.

It was a good take on the Buddy Copy formula, and mixed with the fantasy elements resulted in what I thought was a great production. Will and Joel did a great job, and the effects and story were really good.A lot about the world it was set in was not explained in detail, but that was a good thing, especially as I'd love to see this result in a TV Series which could delve much deeper.I read one critic review (and I paraphrase here) where he stated that being a subscription model Netflix movies are not dependent on critical review or box office results in order to measure their success. He then rated this movie quite badly. I'm glad that critical reviews have nothing to do with success on Netflix, because I really liked this movie.

Loved the ending.Don't get why anyone wouldn't love this movie. A bunch of messed up stereotypes, yeah, but it's tough to create aliens and have people not see themselves in behind the green faces. There was honor behind those faces.Yes, its a take off on earlier ""alien as cop partner"" movies but the added touch of numerous different aliens is cool.Yes, it hits all the necessary movie cliches and that's just fine.It's too bloody for the kids but if they are old enough for slasher movies this is way better.The aliens aren't outer space but from earthly fairy tales. Sort of a Lord of the rings meets Harry Potter's Voldemort vs Bad Boys.Seemed very Alien Nation at first but once the magic happens it gets much more interesting. And Will Smith does cop buddy movie better than anyone. Yes, the head count is really high. Turns out wand weilding elves were mad dangerous.Had to watch it twice cause I missed the whole street guy prophecy bit the first time.Watch this movie, it's fun and real escape entertainment.Don't let some assumptions about stereotypes prevent you from seeing a way back from the bad.",Bright
487,nikosokilleras,"Exceptionally original and interesting premise, OK film...",7,24 October 2019,"General Information: I am a big fan of Will Smith, I simply love him and I consider a lot of his films great. D.Ayer has taken some missteps, but overall he is capable enough, as he has shown more notably with ""Fury"". Of course with myself being a huge fan of all the genres this movie belongs, I was very excited about it, it helps though that the premise is really intriguing and iniquePlot briefly summarized: A human cop and an Orc one having some issues with each other, in a world that can best be described as ""Today's Middle Earth"", get caught in an ancient war between good and evil and as a result they become hunted by, primary, corrupted ElvesNow despite the potential of the premise, the movie itself is incredibly average. There are some excellent character driven scenes between the two leads, but everyone else except Ward and Nick fail to generate any impression, intimidation or empathy and since the movie, especially in the first half, is all about the plot building, this is a problem. The character development of the leads though is the highlight of the movie, both of them act and evolve extremely realistically (I never expected to say that about an Orc cop in a contemporary earth). The action scenes are decent. The movie is a combination of two parts, the cop drama one (which works almost great actually) and the fantasy one (which brings the film down, because it's meant to be taken seriously, but ends up almost the opposite). The acting is excellent by the leads (Edgerton manages to steal the show even from Smith), everyone else though is wasted with the characters they are called to portray. That goes most of all for N.Rapace, she is a great actress, but she has to play one of the most one-dimensional and underdeveloped villains of the recent years. The movie of course suffers because of this. The climax is satisfying enough and a little stupid at the same time. The movie seems cheaply made sometimes, despite having a relatively big budgetAll in all, the movie is very entertaining, but it falls very short compared to what it had the potential to beRating: 6.3-6.4/10 (yeah for once imdb has the perfect, in my opinion, rating for something).I hope the sequel (which I actually look forward to) does better",Bright

I suppose if you're not a fan of Will Smith, fantasy or David Ayer, this will not be your cup of tea, but I absolutely enjoyed it. Enough so that I wanted more from the universe this portrayed. Even if the main characters in this aren't the focus (though I'd love to see them return), the lore here seems strong enough for another movie or two if not a series. Just my opinion, but I really don't get the hate, I had a blast. I never felt the movie was overly hokey or trying too hard, either, but found a comfortable place where I got a kinda Warriors vibe, like everyone is after them in the city, but with magic.

Look no movie is perfect because no ONE is perfect, but this movie is a whole shite load of different, interesting, intriguing & for once ORIGINAL. Everybody wants something different, but they always bitch about how its not perfect. Well DUH!!! This movie is much better than 99% of the movies in theaters. This is one I would pay to see in a theater. 
Will Smith & Joel Edgerton work excellently together. Their relationship or lack of one is a main premise and like all good buddy movies something they have to over come. But that's not all, there is this world of Orcs, Fairies, Elves, Dark Lords, Humans & as always good cops, bad cops, corruption, evil villains, feds & MOB's both human & Orc.
This world is beautiful, clean, affluent and on the flip side dirty, dank & our current reality is tucked in it too.. 
Sure there are endless questions not answered in this movie. *This happens in most books too, where its the 3rd or 4th book down the road before answers start showing up* . 
This movie is meaty, putting a lot of questions out about what this reality is about, answering a few & giving more insights as to what awaits in the future.

 When it comes down to it, you either watch a movie... or you don't. IMHO this is definitely worth a watch. It certainly borrowed heavily from things I've seen in the past (Alien Nation + Training Day w/ a splash of World of Warcraft)... yet it managed to feel ""original"".

Bright does manage to conger up some tense moments, but it does lack character development you get in arguably better films. This means you don't feel invested in the characters whenever something happens. Bright also seems to attempt some comedic moments and lines which, probably for a similar reason, don't pay off. That said, it is enjoyable to watch as long as expectations are managed.

I think a lot was left untouched that is open for a sequel which I so hope they do. I can't wait to see the prophecy unfold and see more of Ward and Jacoby's developing friendship and banter.

502,tm-juli,Interesting ideas wasted in an uninteresting movie,4,22 December 2017,"I have strong feelings when it comes to 'Suicide Squad', which I absolutely hate, due to its embarassing tone changes between the first twenty minutes and the rest of the flick. I would have liked to see David Ayer's original cut. But after 'Bright' I'm pretty sure, 'Suicide Squad' wouldn't be better in its proper form.'Bright' is filmed in a grim an dark way, which is cool in the sense, that it's a fantasy world, but with realism. And for David Ayer that means, that Orcs don't represent Orcs, but other real life stereotypes, which is laughable as soon, as you see all these Orcs with hoodies and s*it. But adding to the ghetto-lifestyle, they're still having magical rituals. Do one of both (pls the magic thing) or let it be.The Elves were pretty f*cking cool. They represented the rich people and elvtown reminded me of the capitol in 'The Hunger Games'-Saga. The strongest aspects of 'Bright' is the super interesting worldbuilding (at one time you can see a dragon in the background, but it's still the gritty modern city - awesome) and the fantastic costumes and make-up work.The world building is present in just the perfect portion. Sadly the main pretentious story about racism and police violence (while being the most gun-porn you can be) just falls flat. With another story to introduce the viewer to this wolrd and other characters, it would have worked much better. Will Smith's character is somewhat likeable, but I think just because it's Will Smith looking very Will Smith all the time. Joel Edgerton's orc is pretty awesome, but he also makes dumb decissions. And you are stuck with these two characters, who change their opinion on each other after every scene, but it's a buddy cop movie of some sorts, so they gotta become friends along the way, right? I think, and that is pure speculation, David Ayer just really loves cops shooting more than necessary and so the interesting story of an orc cop in a modern city with fantastic creatures gets minimized to gun porn with racism and a slight mystical background story.Joel Edgerton's Orc looks very stunned and not happy about his first murder, but after that he just shoots people left and right, so what is the point of even setting up that 'I don't like to kill'-vibe, when nothing comes with it. At the end there is even an embarassing scene were all the other orcs finally accept him as a cop and it's bad and cringey. So it's supposed ""arc"" is bulls*it, but we obviously like him, beacause people treat him bad and he's ultimately has a good heart.For people who think, that an orc-cop movie can only be a comedy: you will be vastly diasappointed and embarassed for the attempts at humour put to screen in 'Bright'. Only after the big end fight there are some good lines and even a little bit of chemistry between the main duo.So in the end I think the world of 'Bright' has potential, but only if in the hands of another director, who has more heart for the fantasy part of this movie and less for the non-entertaining violence. And maybe with other protagonists, but with the predictable revelation at the end, they will stick with Will Smith an his Orc-friend (?).",Bright

For a film to be a zero it would have to be really bad, im talking ""freddy got fingered"" or ""the room"". With that out of the way, on to the merits of this film. The film suffers from some plotholes and editing problems like not showing when an item is picked up before getting into the car (not really a spoiler), this is a 5 second scene that seems to have been excluded. The terminology can be confusing but it is more or less explained in an organic fashion, as necessary. There is a giant world they are creating that would take too long to establish, this does cause minor problems, however. Technical aspects are acceptable. The acting is good. Lighting is good. Sound is good. Image quality is good.

Will Smith has played these type of roles before and Joel Edgerton is one of my favourite actors always quiet and understated but able to convey ample emotion.
I believe, as others, this is more than likely the future paradigm for middle of the road budget movies with big names and somewhat risque plots.

I think it works well enough to warrant exploring further this universe that has been created. When you consider some of the ""epics"" that Hollywood foists on us as being ""the next best thing"" this is bold enough to warrant more attention than most of them receive.

511,alanmarquesleal,Positively surprised,8,22 December 2017,"I'm still a little traumatized by Ayer's Suicide Squad. So, seeing the trailer, I've expected the worse form this movie. The villains would be awful, while our protagonists would be doing some random stuff, in a disconnected story. Given the soundtrack has already be released, I expected it would be exactly like Suicide Squad. I'd love this soundtrack and listened to it without stop for months and this soundtrack would dissociate form the movie very quickly. So, those were my expectations going to watch this some hours ago.
No I must say I was wrong and I 'ma positively surprised by my mistake. First, I'm gonna say the worldbuilding in this 1:57 hrs movie is tight and still satisfying. I tend to believe a good worldbuilding is that one the leaves you curious about its characters, places and stories. I couldn't be more curious. I want to know more about the Dark Lord, the 2000 war between some races, how the orcs became the bad guys, how a prophecy seem to be going in a kind of déja vu, where does the power of brights and inferni come from, and much more. A short movie left me that curious means it's doing something incredibly right. 
The second thing that entertains me was fight choreography. Seriously, those inferni/elves fights got me at edge of my seat (bed in this case). They were great and I hope Netflix produces a TV show only about those inferni. I want that so damn much right now. 
Besides, the whole different races living segregated, with different stereotypes associated to them, and the impact of this i their real life was well-portrayed. I think the movie doesn't deepen this critic too much, which will be a reason for praise for some/critics from others. I for one am fine with the depth showed with this movie. 
So, I might rewatch the movie again to see if there's something I didn't like. At some points, I was expecting some things to happen/not happen and the director carried the opposite of my expectation anyway, which surprised me in two occasions I was ready to criticize the choice (again I hate Suicide Squad and I still surprised how much I liked Bright). I'm giving 8/10 because there were some scenes that didn't feel equally paced as the rest of the movie and the difference wasn't used to improve something in the movie In the end, this is it.
So, if you hated (and still do) Suicide Squad, give this movie a shot. It won't disappoint you!",Bright
512,RichyRichFerguson,The Brightest Movie That Couldn't Be Any Dimmer,3,12 January 2018,"While I applaud Netflix for their efforts in trying to slip themselves into the Hollywood mainstream (Thank You Meryowitz Stories), I do personally believe they haven't quite patented the formula quite like they have with their Tv and Mini series.Bright is a film Directed by David Ayer and is written by Youtube alumni Max Landis. The film itself has the prestigiousness to boast the title of the most expensive produced film to garner the Netflix logo alongside the title, but that doesn't seem to help this picture. The movie tries its best to build a world instantly by adding elements from classic fantasy and modern day drama, without actually conceiving an idea as to why thats a thing. As an audience member, you can accept the fact of the relationship of all these worlds being squished together, if not for making references to other pop culture fairly tale mash-ups, like Shrek. Now the world and environment is the least of the audiences worries. The deeper issue is the writing. As I personally happen to be a fan of Max Landis' constant appearances and cameos on my favourite Youtube channels and having been a lesser known writer in Hollywood these last few years; I wish I could cut him the slack. The writing in this film is not terrible, but not adequate. It is creative, but unnecessarily vulgar and the characters along with their respective arches mean little to nothing what so ever. What really intrigued me the most is why people have to hate the the different classes and races? I have seen the same social commentary built into the film District 9, but where that film took it with a different viewpoint, this decided to sugar coat it and expect the audience to enjoy the sweet outside, without questioning what it really was about. This movie really seems serviceable until you actually try to connect the dots. One of my personal flaws with it, and this is an unusual one is the Sound Mixing and editing. Not even so much the editing, but the Mixing here was not great. I had the pleasure of watching on my laptop, with headphones plugged in and I know for a fact my headphones were ok, because I heard Will Smith utter Shrek remarks time and time again. What I did hear were not punchy and loud explosive action noises that we are used to, but a subdued soundtrack that made dialogue take over from the scene. Instead of hearing the loud crash of a car running into a building or a menacing blow to our lead characters in battle, we hear a quiet and again, utterly subdued pop of what the noise should be along with a heightened voice clip of an almost unnecessary reaction. Is this a nit pick? Probably, yeah. But this is no avant garde editing, this is merely poor sound mixing and editing. There are so many flaws to point out and clearly the direction from Ayer proves to be insufficient in its treatment, as it was in Suicide Squad, and oddly enough I would not be surprised if in some way this film became the second in an Ayer - Smith joint venture of bad films with ok Will Smith performances. I think the only feature that at least I could feel better about was Smith in this film being ok as I stated, but that Edgerton took this one and really built a half decent character. His performance, along with journey from start to finish was worth noting as plus for this film. Besides that, the movies plot seems all too predictable for something that tried to be so different than anything else. I wish I could say more positive things, but alas I cannot and that is why I give it a solid 3/10.",Bright

It is not only a great entertainment as cop drama but also a finely tuned social analysis. Will Smith emphasizes in multiple trailers that this movie is like Training Day meshed with Lord of the Rings. So true! Bringing elf/orc racial hierarchy creates such an interesting dynamic, since the reality of racism is definitely not a fantasy. But the chemistry between Joel Edgerton's committed orc cop character and Will Smith's smart play to navigate his survival as already racially marginalized, human cop is so amazing that I was sucked into the narrative smoothly. I'm going to watch again to find out whether I missed any cues!! Highly recommended.",Bright
522,alexlenceon,"Critics don't really get it, do they?",8,4 January 2018,"This movie is actually pretty good. What makes this movie very interesting is the fact that nothing is directly explained to you. When the movie starts, there is no narrator telling you about the world or the characters (which is the laziest way to write a movie), instead, you learn everything throughout the movie. If this movie was a video game, it would be actually praised by the critics. Why ? Because game critics are not 50 year old men with a grudge against everything new. This movie is not a 10/10, or a 9/10, or even an 8/10, as there are flaws in the writing. If this movie had it's own series, it would allow for much move expansive and better written world, but let's stick with what we got. Protagonists: Of course more character development, and learning more about their families would be nice, but in spite of that, their personalities and backgrounds were well established and developed. In fact, it was the perfect amount of development for such a short movie. More development would make the movie seem like an episode of some drama series, while the opposite would result into a most of the world and motivations remaining a mystery.World: This world is probably the most interesting setup in a movie in a while. Not because of the fantasy element, but probably because of this amount of questions it makes you ask. We are shown but one small story, revolving around two police officers. After watching the movie, you are left craving to know more about this world, its history and the characters. This is incredibly rare for a movie, as most most movies develop their worlds to their full potentials by the end, leaving you with no questions to be asked and no interest in learning more.Antagonists: This is probably the worst part of the movie. The main antagonists were incredibly under developed, motivations were mostly left out, and they felt more like disposable background characters rather than proper antagonists. In other words, they were super boring. However, this could be also viewed as a good thing. As I mentioned before, this movie is just a small story from an incredibly vast world. It would be rather unfitting for the antagonists to be overly complicated, as it would take away this feeling of something way bigger going on behind the scenes. In fact, the antagonists were merely puppets in a way bigger plan.Music: Great music, nothing more to add.Cinematography: Great! Some shots were astonishing, while most of the movie was simply very pretty to watch.Realism: If you disregard the fact that the movie takes place in a fantasy world, it is actually pretty realistic and down to earth, except for 4-5 moments which probably were essentially simple ""(deus)-ex-machinas"".Overall: Great movie, absolutely must watch, one of the best action/cop movies of 2017, just don't expect a masterpiece.",Bright

I admit the end could maybe have been a tad better, and the critics babbling on about how the movie leaves the audience with so many questions unanswered. Hey, use your imagination to answer some of those questions, if not stop watching movies. Also, I see GREAT potential in this becoming something like Star wars, where a few movies including 1 or two prequels to explain a few things, but yet again, I am still waiting on ""i am legend' and ""irobot' prequels/sequels, so, with Will smith you must enjoy the movie as is.I for one enjoyed it, it hurts me to see that some people out there who watched it, clearly DIDN'T get the movie, and they tell others that it sucked.No it didn't suck at all, it uses a lot of what YOU know of as person and presents you as is.

I get that they are police officers, but just be police officers in a movie, not like police officers in real life, trying to kill every living thing they see, and shouting for no reason. Too many explosions and killings, to be honest 8 times out of 10, I had no idea who was killing what and why. The idea with magic, again good idea, but with no clear explanation to why they were trying to bring the Dark Lord or what exactly makes someone a bright, apart from the wand thing. I was expecting a little backstory on that, since the title, but we got only a 2 second scene, literally. All the scenes in the movie are a mishmash, it looks like they had too many ideas and not enough movies to put them into, so they just decided to put everything in a bowl and hope for the best.",Bright

It throws you right into the fray, in a somewhat odd way. I found the world that was created, to be interesting enough to look into. While confusing at first, towards the end of the movie an exposition clears things up. I think I would have rather been drip fed the information that is revealed in a couple scenes, rather than being kept in the dark most of the time. The action sequences are over the top. The characters and the story make it a worthwhile watch. Overall I enjoyed the romp therough Bright's world, it's an original idea for an action/sci-fi/fantasy that has very little dull moments.

I could follow along with the plot albeit there was a lot to absorb about the wand and who was after it. I wasn't quite sure about if the Fed guys were good or not...I wasn't on the trust bandwagon with that duo. Will Smith always does fantastic work in movies w/ aliens and monsters (he said some years ago in an interview those were his top criteria for a movie and I agree) although his character was a bit stubborn, he played it well. The Jackoby character was well played, and equally as stubborn no matter how many times SEVERAL tried to break him. Nice surprises: Margaret Cho and Noomi Repace! Both actors were excellent. My reasons for not giving a full 10: there is much more to be developed in this story - two hours is just not enough time to digest what is going on; it wasn't ""smooth."" The action scenes were intense (10) and acting was stellar (10) and the story as well (10). I think my rating falls in how the plot was carried out and the segue of scenes getting from point A to point B to point C ... et. al. BRIGHT is definitely worth watching. I agree with another reviewers post that maybe this could be a series. THAT would work and give the viewer enough time with the story.",Bright

The fact that critics rate the biggest piece of garbage ever made ""Star Wars, The Force Awakens"" 90 something% and this movie 19%, like is why you should never heed the word of pretentious miserable idiots who are so delusional in their bias that they really have no clue what the heck they're talking about. Rotten Tomatoes is a website for brainless twits who need other brainless twits to tell them whats good or not. This movie was F'ing awesome! Will Smith still got it! it was incredibly entertaining, a great mix of comedy, action and adventure, intertwined in a fantasy world. Its well written, well produced, and well acted by everyone involved.

The world was so interesting and I wanted to learn more about how things functions. Aspects could definitely be improved, but if you have netflix, you need to watch this.

The elves clear out cops like it was nothing but fight hard and lose to injured ward and jakoby3. the wand if so powerful and has a range (force field scene), why doesn't it thor like go back to leilah?? or she has a sense where it is at then why homing beacon it down to the wand, why the whole cell phone tracking? also if it is the one and only wand, why doesn't she do the dirty work of taking out tikka. yes i know plot device. but still. felt contrived.4. the ending. suppressing from the world at large about the existence of wand was a good touch. but the dismissive death of rodriguez was a poor kick the dog moment with no reprieve , almost a foot note.",Bright

551,jonwh128,Loved It!,10,3 January 2018,"Just keep an open mind. You'll totally enjoy it. It keeps getting bad reviews by people who are missing the point. Much of it is undeveloped but that's what's great about it. You have to use your imagination as you watch it. Also, there's a sequel in the works that will continue to fill in the gaps. You're thrown into a world where cliches seem strangely fresh and interesting. Anyone with a deep appreciation of The Lord Of The Rings and several other brilliant sci-fi movies will really enjoy it. I'm easily bored by typical buddy cop movies with car chases and over done pyrotechnics etc. This has much of that but it's shown from a completely different perspective that makes those elements entertaining again. People are also critical about the racial commentary. There's a particular scene with 4 corrupt cops who are enticed by an all powerful magic wand. It's to the extent that they are willing to commit a racially motivated murder - killing a good Orc (Will Smith's cop partner). Everyone knows there are no good Orcs in Middle Earth or this Modern Earth. Yet, this one Orc has the purest of hearts and is filled with honesty and integrity even though he's despised by humans and even his fellow Orcs. There's a level of character development and we care about him. Even Will Smith doesn't like him through most of the movie. The magic wand could easily be the ring of power in Lord of the Rings. The good Orc is despised by Orcs in part just due to being a cop and also because he's never gone through their blood ritual which is basically Worf in Star Trek. The movie draws from many great sci-fi movies and TV shows from the past. It's a mish mash and to an extent the racial stuff can feel out of place, but for me it just made it more interesting.It's not perfect but I still give it a 10 due to the level of originality and imagination.",Bright

555,sideorderofflies1,Great idea and visuals but everything else is rotten.,1,22 December 2017,"A lot of people on here seem to think flashy visuals = good film. However while yes the visuals are great and the concept is great, the rest of the film is awful. The dialogue is clunky and stilted. Character development outside of the two leads is non existent. The way the plot unfolds is clichéd and boring. The pacing is awful and makes the film feel way longer than it is. The performances across the board are flat and one dimensional. Will Smith comes across as a parody of his performance in bad boys, Joel Edgerton sounds like he is chewing food all the time and is so wooden (perhaps the huge amounts of prosthetic make up he has to wear hampered his performance). If you want a film about cross race police forces and race issues, go and watch the original alien nation film which is a million times better than this trash.",Bright

But beyond a doubt it is entertaining, sometimes exciting, and very cool in it's imaginative style. It reminds me of the film Alien Nation and its television sequels, but it goes far beyond just being a similar knockoff. I cant understand how so many film critics got this film wrong with their reviews...they really missed the mark with their negative reaction. According to several sources a sequel is in production now, and I honestly cant wait to see it.",Bright
557,bhattaswagato,did not understand even a single storyline of this movie,5,5 January 2018,"I did not understand even a single storyline of this movie. It made no sense. There was no meaning to any sequence of the movie. What just happened made little sense to anything. What the movie lacked was a good story plot? Other than that, it could have been a good story. Also, the sound quality was poor. The movie needed better quality of camera actions. Will smith was ok as he always is. I give it 5 because I have no idea what just happened. So it is right in the middle",Bright
558,adrianald,Quite good actually.,8,23 December 2017,"Not quite the production quality of a Hollywood blockbuster film that you might see at the cinema, but that doesn't matter. For what it is Bright is very enjoyable. Will Smith is (surprise, surprise) excellent again and instantly captures your interest. However, while the 'orcs' makeup and design is amazing Joel Edgerton's ""Jakoby"" feels a little flat Perhaps because he is working alongside someone as charismatic as Smith. None the less his portrayal was enthralling enough to really get into each scene with the pair. The movie does well at the beginning to set the scene of this fantasy or magical version of the world. Its very amusing to see the slight differences in this fictional world compared to reality. There is definitely some analogies about different races and separate working classes, also amusing.
Once the action begins its very gripping and hard to look away. Noomi Rapace was a good choice for an elf in this film, her character had a real presence that did well to make me simultaneously hate her and be curious to learn more. However, her motivations were never really explored to a satisfying extent. The stunts, effects and CGI were all very high quality on par with modern superhero movies, for example. 
Unfortunately the story begins to get a little stale throughout the guts of the film where majority of the action occurs. Here it seems to just go from one stand off with a gang to another and another in rapid succession each time only escaping by some fluke. With some obvious twists and some surprises I was not too distracted by this fact. Despite this the climax of the film is intense and I certainly was invested by this point. 
The film ended with me satisfied to an extent. The Main plot of this film is concluded however I was left with many questions about the greater universe. I certainly hope they continue making this universe. All in all definitely worth considering when and if you are on Netflix. 8/10",Bright

569,rcoulter-31439,"Ouch my head...needed more work, felt rushed.",4,27 December 2017,"I was hoping so hard that because Will Smith was the star, this movie would be awesome. It almost was, but I can start with the good news and go from there. This movie is set in an alternate reality where certain mythological races live among humans. Each race has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. The plot centers around individuals called ""Brights."" Brights are the only ones who can manipulate an elven form of technology called a ""wand."" If you know how to use one, and if you are a ""bright"". these wands can be used as weapons, tools, or healing devices. These wands are so rare, they're almost mythical -- some people don't believe they even exist -- finding one is like seeing Santa Claus or Bigfoot. When a wand is found by the police, it is up to Smith's character and his partner to keep it safe from the good guys and bad guys until they can find someone they can trust. Therein lies the problem, they can't trust anyone -- even the proper authorities might kill them for just having seen it. Their only clue for what to do next is a terrified young female elf, who is the sole survivor of the raid where the wand was discovered.Sounds great, right? Well it is, except for the poor dialogue (sometimes you don't have slightest idea what is being said or why), the poor filming (sometimes scenes bounce around so much you can't keep track of what's where), and the poor editing (hard to describe this part, just that a lot of scenes don't make sense). A way to sum-it-up would be -- think of the Fifth Element if someone tossed it in a blender and re-released it. It's basically the Fifth Element but with much less refinement. Overall, I gave it a 4/10, and I called this movie ""Will Smith's punishment for After Earth.""However...I think I know why some people liked this movie...if you can follow it, your own subconscious should be able to clean up the ""mess"", and it won't seem as bad once you get to the end. :)",Bright

First problem is that the movie want to cover as much content as possible, resulting it bad at every topic.
Second problem is that at many points of the movie the atomesphere is just off! When it needs to be fast paced, they give you some sentiment monologue. When it needs to be serious, they throw in a couple wise lines try to make you laugh. And then the rythm just got dragged out of shape.

Will Smith is great as the cynical cop who gets paired with a wide eyed rookie. It just so happens that the rookie is an orc and that there is deeply held prejudice against the orcs by just about everyone. I can't say enough about the acting. Joel Edgerton really pulls off the beaten down orc who has to prove himself, not just to others but also to himself. Tikka seems so vulnerable but she has a secret. Noomi Rapace inspires dread like few movie villains manage to do these days. The action sequences are all really well done. The plot is engaging and it isn't full of holes.

Nothing in this movie made any sense. After a very slow start, it started moving so fast that you could not keep up with it. Maybe this was the plan, so as to cover up it's humongous weaknesses. 
Nothing seems to be related. Random incidents keep happening just to get it where it should be.There is no connection between main events. New characters keep popping up all the time with no purpose at all, and even those who should have played a bigger role in this kind of movie (cop movie), just make a guest appearance.

The executive at Netflix who greenlit this must've been on a week long cocaine bender when he did so. Everything about this bland boring movie is generic and lacklustre beyond imagination, it's so bad finishing it is like hitting rock bottom - you'll rethink your life afterwards, that's the sole positive of this movie. It's such a low energy, slow paced movie that looks like budget despite it's extravagant budget. Avoid at all costs, don't say I didn't warn you.",Bright

The acting and casting was good and the range of characters (some a little stereotyped) was broad. The story wasn't particularly tough to follow but was engaging. The cinematography and some of the characters reminded me a little of Fifth Element.Lots of action, a bit of buddy cop drama, sprinkled with some magic, orcs, elves and fairies but it was a fresh take; a totally different feel to the usual racial stereotypes of the non-humans (well, mostly anyway).Good fun for a couple of hours - entertaining, with a good but easy to follow story line, some good acting, some great lines and good FX. What's not to like?",Bright

580,thedivide,Critics are wrong again,8,27 December 2017,"This movie was very enjoyable. It was fast paced and when it was over I was left hoping for a sequel. The synergy between Ward and his partner Jakoaby was very good and the fact that there was magic and elves in LA should have felt foolish, but it didn't, they pulled it off.It was like the plot of an RA Salvatore novel set in modern times with a bit more humor. Good job I say and don't trust the critics. These days it seems as if they are paid off to like and dislike what they are ordered too.",Bright
581,joelwaalkens,Promising,5,25 June 2019,It isn't all that bad considering it went straight to TV. Hard to believe they wasted A list talent and totally missed the big screen. If I would have seen this movie in a theater I would probably have given it 8 stars. It isn't perfect but very solid acting and a decent story certainly make it compelling. Will and Joel play off each other really well and the story is pretty much non-stop action. With more and more streaming services killing movies. I am afraid to expect a very bleak future for the entertainment industry. Not often you see a fantasy story of this nature taking place in a present or future setting.,Bright

DULL.NOT THIS ONE.It's not that I don't like Will Smith, but his characters in MIB, Independence Day, etc are so shallow. So one-dimensional. Hollywood demanded he be a walking-talking Punch Line.But he's aged very well. And his talent, if anything, has increased with experience.Both he and his Partner Orc develop quite nicely thru the film; become characters we begin to know and love.Of course there are 10,000 bullets fired from guns that never run out of ammo (except when it really counts).

586,paul-51829,Underlying Racism,5,26 February 2018,"The storyline about the object that ultimately drives the movie is not bad. The thing about this is the use of orcs and elves. Ever heard the joke about the leader who claims that he is not racist and to get around issues of black and white he denotes everyone as being green. He is loading them onto a bus and says: ""okay, I want all the light green people to the front of the bus and all the dark green people in the back""In this movie, the orcs are all thugs. All of them. Strangely enough, they live in poorer areas and dress like gangsters. They look and act like your typical movie portrayal of Latinos and African-Americans. Then you have the elves. They are all slender, dress smart, drive fast Japanese cars, highly proficient in martial arts. Very underground vibe. Hmmmm, they couldn't actually be substitutes for the Triads or Yakuzo, could they? So, yeah. The orcs are dark green and the elves are more like yellowish green I guess. But hey, at least they are not stereotyping black or latinos or asians. So there is that.But maybe I am reading too much into it. Just something that struck me.",Bright

It's hard to make a review and I don't think you could trust anyone else but the mass voice of the public. Of course there's Oscar-like appreciation (or Rotten Tomatoes-like) and an actual real appreciation for a movie.Bright is a very good movie. It's fun, it's somewhat familiar but yet different. If we choose to search for the standard lines and plots, we're just boxing ourselves in a mindset of a dull type. And when we don't see that standard that we're craving for, we're judgmental. What a weird way to watch a movie...It's a movie worth watching and enjoying, it has it's drama but it doesn't focus on that and Jakoby is also a fun character and a decent guy... Well, Ork...

The one we all love, without the fake added drama that is unnecessary with Will. Bright is a very surprising, and odd, and crazy movie that in initially seeing might give you the feeling that you missed something, and that it is ridiculous. You wouldn't be alone, but this movie has it all, and none of the fluff. The story is very coherent when you understand the landscape of the world it is being told in. The odds are, the first time you watch you will get some of it, but not all, and it's still great, and very funny, after the first time though, you will see the whole picture, and the depth of the story will shine through. If you don't like this movie you don't like fantasy/scifi of any kind, even when it's presented to you at the highest level, otherwise you will love this movie.",Bright

From the best ""Lethal Weapon"" (short time detective hooks up with suicidal partner) to the worst ""Theodore Rex"" (cop is paired up with dinosaur). This movie is much better, I am giving it an 8 but I tend to think ""Lethal Weapon"" is a 9. There is plenty of action and drama, the scenario is a what if stories like ""The Hobbit"" was real, what would the present world be like today? In the alternate fantasy universe, Orcs are the odd race out, they made a deal with the dark powers 2000 years ago and no one is letting them live it down. Will Smith plays a racist cop who is teamed up with an Orc. The movie lacks a bit of introduction to these aspects and most people who don't enjoy figuring this out for themselves won't enjoy the movie.My wife and I watched it together, we both enjoyed it.

Well, my expectations were not surpassed, since from the begining I was really annoyed at the fact that there was no intelligent dialogue, all I could see was yelling, swearing and really bad jokes mixed with so much sh.it hip hop trash music. It's a movie that clearly targets the average teen dumb audience, wich is more and more common these days. Kids who just crave for bright images and loud sounds, focusing their short attention span in the shalow cliches and not willing to see below the surface.

I went in suspending my belief in what I knew about the fantasy world so I could have a very open mind. I came away enjoying this movie much more than I thought I would have. This movie did a marvelous job of creating a world with forces and dynamics at play that shape it in ways unknown to those that inhabit it for the most part. It made me, as a viewer wanting to explore this world more and to understand what else is out there. There are small scenes that form a kaleidoscopic picture of a very diverse, and interesting cast of races all smashed together trying to make it work. If you want to see a cool action flick, with really awesome fantasy elements then this is for you. Leave what you know about Lord of the Rings or Dungeons & Dragons at home, because this doesn't really follow that path and it shouldn't. I'm glad that there are studios still taking a chance on producing original films and this one fits in one of my favorites list easily.",Bright

613,bluedemon_dragon9,Profoundly Disappointing,4,5 January 2018,"I'm not sure they actually had a script for this movie. It feels more like they wrote a 2-page outline, told Will Smith and Joel Edgerton to ad-lib whatever they wanted, filmed whatever ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" scene popped into the director's head on any given day, and then left the rest to an overwrought editing team who valiantly tried to wrestle the resulting mess into something that sort of resembles a plot. If you squint. The pacing is a constant, jarring stop-start-stop-start, and the narrative is trying to follow several different threads at once, none of which are ever fully borne out. Subplots and (often irrelevant) side characters sort of drift in an out of scenes without any meaningful explanation. The worldbuilding is very slapdash: tediously over-explained in some areas and virtually nonexistent in others.
I gave it four stars only because the special effects looked pretty decent, and because Will Smith and Joel Edgerton have great chemistry, so the banter was alright and most of their jokes landed, but if not for that it would have been unwatchable, and I say that as someone genuinely obsessed with the urban fantasy genre, who had been excited about this movie ever since I first heard about it.

I have been very excited to see it and a bit apprehensive because both Will Smith and Netflix can be hit or miss at times, mainly hit. It was a really fun movie. It was Training Day meets Alien Nation meets Lord of the Rings in that order I would say. It was rated R so it's got everything a gritty action movie would need. It's got nudity, language, blood and guts. It's got a really edgy storyline with racial tension and fantasy racial tension but done really well. It also has a tense ""make it through the night"" aspect and a couple time where you don't know how they are getting out of this one. I love movies that are well written like that. I don't have much negative to say about it. It had a couple points that were a little slow but nothing more than any movie of this pacing to begin with. It was sci fi but done well to ground itself in reality. The fantasy elements are there almost more as a theme or to add lore to the plot more than to showcase and I loved that about it as well.

631,darkhorizons13,End of Watch in a reality 2000 years after the events of Lord of the Rings,9,24 December 2017,"Where to start with this film.... Well first off I don't get why critics slammed this movie, I watched it the moment it dropped and the first cameo had me hooked.
Bright has that depth to its world that makes it so engaging. The back N forth between Ward & Jakoby is amazing, done in the classic buddy cop style. For a fantasy it is incredibly grounded, with subtle nods to real world politics and issues our reality suffers. The blending between magic and science is cleverly crafted, the film really knew what it was a police film first and then a fantasy based story. This is complimented with great cinematography, strong soundtrack, enough action to full fill your blood lust, a very brilliant cast and seamless effects for the fantasy creatures. The characters are well fleshed out and the story although predictable is so well crafted that you wont be pissed about being able to guess hats going to happen next, instead you will be internally cheering the characters on as if they are reaching plot goals. This film does suffer from a sour face Will Smith syndrome, which I think was intended as his character is a crabby cop whose been shot before and not keen on it again. This is often juxtaposed by Joel Edgerton's Jakoby who is almost sweet for an Orc cop with that friendly demeanour on his face for the first 10 to 20 minutes of the film.So if you like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Dirty Harry, End of Watch, Training Day or any other gritty fun action pack film but you have also wanted to see it happen on middle earth then BRIGHT is a must watch.",Bright

Anyway, if you're expecting Suicide Squad...STOP. It's nothing like Suicide Squad, in terms of the acting, the action, the emotional/serious moments and the overall quality. It's much, much better than that movie, for anyone who was comparing to that movie. Now, It's not Hacksaw Ridge or The Godfather type quality, it's a typical buddy-cop set-up in a twisted, yet fun, fantasy environment. Think Lethal Weapon/Training Day/End of Watch meets Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit. Sounds weird, but you'll be pleasantly surprised.The chemistry between Will and Joel is great, the action is great and pretty much anytime Will and Joel have serious moments those are basically some of the most memorable ones out of the whole movie. There are very minor flaws, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Bright and I think audiences will too, I mean, go ahead and google the audience reviews. It's a Netflix movie, if people can enjoy bad movies and shows on Netflix, then people will definitely like this one. It's clearly a ""people's movie"", not a ""critic's movie"". WATCH IT and ENJOY!",Bright
636,mihaicmocanu,Do critics really matter anymore these days?,10,23 December 2017,"All I see lately is how critics are smashing movies I like and I really don't understand why, unless there is a masterplan somewhere. And this makes me wonder if their opinions really matter anymore.
I mean come on, a film is something so complex that you as a one person cannot decide for me or anyone else if I will enjoy the film or not.'Bright' is not the greatest movie of all time, but to say it's the worst movie of 2017 is a blasphemy.
The film is filled with action, the screenplay is decent, the fantasy elements are seamlessly blended in the real world and the acting is good enough for this kind of movie.
It is on Netflix so you can watch it anytime. 
Enjoy",Bright
637,MajorMatt,I really enjoyed this movie,9,23 December 2017,"I did not know anything about the movie when I found it on Netflix's. I enjoyed this move. Of course, I enjoy alternant reality movies. In some ways it reminded me of 1988 movie ""Alien Nation"". I like to think of this movie as Lord Of The Rings two to four thousand years later.",Bright
638,ajfootiemad,A Different Take,7,28 December 2017,"This is a different take on the fantasy genre but with the stuff they were doing this film felt like it was a sequel to something and a prequel at the same time, preferably I would of preferred a film explaining how the hell all 9 races came to live together. The cop stuff at the beginning was okay but wasn't there needed it could of done with more focusing on main story as that seem more interesting and also with the main story why of all places is that tree in gang areas when something of that type of meaning normally in fantasy worlds is located in a fitting location that was completely off. I would love to see more of this world but try and stick to the fantasy aspects the cops pulled it to far way from that feel. 7/10",Bright
639,regent-15821,You have to suspend your disbelief,9,26 June 2021,Once you buy into the premise you realize the storytelling is straight down the line. It never deters from the spine. The characters are who they are. The humans are human. The animals are animals. The magicals are magical. The evils have no remorse. The two mains are who they are. They have arcs and learn stuff like a regular Hollywood movie but in the end they are still themselves. I know people had problems with this film but I think it was because they wanted animals to act like humans and humans to be the nice guys. The concept was to create separate behaviors in each species and it held to that. It was true sci-fi. It was a three act story with three distinctive acts and a denouement. I was impressed and entertained. This was the third time I watched it 6/24/21) and enjoyed it even more this time.,Bright
640,lolipop1990,"Another ""Trailer is much more interesting"" Movie",7,23 December 2017,"Don't get me wrong, it is an ok movie, which actually worth an 8 out of 10, but I'm taking one point out because of the fantastic trailer.
Why? Because the trailer shows a much better presentation, like the beautiful pictures you see on the page of an online store. And then when you open the package, you get something that worth the money that you've paid for, but far less attractive compare to what you see on the web page.
It is a good idea to mix fantasy world with real world problems, but it is wasting the talent to reduce the fantasy world to a backdrop. Yes, it is not even background, it is a backdrop, looks fancy and when you touch it, it is paper thin. Zootopia did a much better job than this. As a fan of Sci-fi & Fantasy, I am disappointed by this movie. You can change this magic wand into a bag of gang money and it would work just as well.
For a police movie, it is a quite good one. If Bright is a regular non-fantasy police movie, I might be happier after watching it because my expectation would be different. Still, I would like to see another movie that will have similar concept, but really works on building this modern fantasy world.",Bright
641,tjcworld,"Pretty, funny and controversial",9,26 December 2017,"So I've not reviewed a film for quite a long time but I think this film deserves all the support it can get, the critic reviews I've read so far make very little sense to me unless they're being made with some political or social agenda, which would fit with the discrepancy between critic opinion and everyone else on the new Star wars film but I'm still hopeful I'll enjoy TLJ.
This film was fresh, ambitious and fun with some fantastic acting, visuals and just a fantastic film all round. If I read the script I might have said it should take itself more seriously but the comic relief actually made me laugh at times and was surprisingly not JaJa Binks-like! A jack of all trades!
I think most critics reviewing this must be orc racists to be honest, or just very closed minded to alternative racial dynamics, too fixated on possible implications to the real world with an added left wing bias. I probably would have enjoyed it regardless of it's interpretation of race however. I assume reviewers found the pacing bad probably because they were trying to hate the film.",Bright

Watch the movie!
Awesome film, very interesting, good story, great concept.
My only criticism is thatit wasn't longer and that I wasn't able to watch it on the big cinema screen. 
One of the best films I've watched 2017 to date.
Definitely need a sequel! 
It kind of reminds me of Lord Of The Rings and Lord Voldemort but delivered where they eventually fell off after the first two films, mixed with a Suicide Squad appeal. 
Great actors, all of them, they really work very well together.",Bright

This movie has violent scenes that involve fights and killing so read about it and decide if it's a good fit for your family.But on the other hand this film deals with prejudice against ""others"" - the ""others"" being Orcs - and includes blatant ""species"" slurs in the place of racial slurs.

Bright is an intriguing movie that had me laughing out loud numerous times while also thinking deeper into issues like race and equality (many parallels to modern society). While the ending did fall a little flat, the only thing wrong with this movie is that it should have been a TV series. Like all fantasy, there is so much of the world that could be built upon and more storylines to follow. Again, if you like urban fantasy, you will enjoy this movie!",Bright
659,bluegamer-96731,Critics be d*mned! Watch this movie!,8,5 January 2018,"This movie staring Joel Edgerton and the legendary Will Smith is worth every minute. The movie takes place in a fairy-tale fantasy world in the modern age. Think similar to Dungeons and Dragons or Lord of the Rings, but simpler and easier to understand. As a gamer, I frequently play games that sport a medieval fantasy world and Bright takes this setting and brings it to the modern age. This one element immediately brings a fresh and original twist to the police action drama genre, (say that five times fast.). The actual story is about a reluctant police officer, named Scott Ward, (Will Smith), who is partnered with the first Orc police officer named Nick Jakoby, (Joel Edgerton). The two cops are tasked with protecting a Elf woman and a wand that in the hands of a Bright can be capable of untold horrors. The real goal is to simply pass the responsibility off to a special task force that investigates magic anomalies, secures magic items... and the people capable of using them. The racial themes and real world parallels are unmissable and annoyingly prominent, but never unnecessary and even through the obligatory, 'I'm gonna pretend to be racist even though I work closely with you', moments, never become too painful to endure. Throughout the movie, various action sequences bring the two officers closer together and seeing their relationship evolve feels organic and natural. Without spoiling anything, Nick Jakoby's explanation to the task force of what happened is very funny. My review is vague I know, but I want to be careful not to tell you too much. I really want to encourage you to watch this movie because it's a adventure unlike others you've seen before.",Bright
660,thefunanimals,"Good, but not impressive",6,27 December 2017,"An amazing concept, a blend of super realistic cops movies with fantasy and fairy tales in one universe. (If the fairy tale creatures existed in our world, how would they be treated?). In that sense the film was superb, at least in potential, Will's performance was just amazing, but then lots of the potential was wasted in the lazy writing, it got boring and repetitive along the way, and the first good impression was diluted. In all cases it is a good attempt by Netflex to crack a real block buster this time, (may god forgive them for what they did to Death Note). Hope the next Netflex movies will be better.",Bright
661,Maturiosu,This movie deserves better fans,9,25 December 2017,"Wow, what a movie. Critics will tell you it's a flop. That it was too played out as what other movies have already done. That the dialogue is over stated, dramatic, poorly done. The reason this movie gets a 9 and not a 10 is because of the shallowness of it at times. But this is an awesome movie that seeks to be more than purported. Maybe the critics are just a bit too dim to get the points being made in the movie. Maybe they just wanted action all the time and we've convoluted the movie world with Michael Bay expectations of explosions 24/7. This movie will deliver on the action, drama, everything you could want. The problem is it also wants you to think, to see the world around us in a lens that is the view of others. Some won't like this and will lash out against it. Some will sympathize with it. Some will just enjoy it and gain a new perspective. But a film like this doesn't get made by a big studio because it is too risky. They took a chance to stand up for beliefs and that's what came out through this amazing movie. See the world a different way. Hopefully you don't have to think we need orcs in the world to know somethings wrong.",Bright
662,changx,Trailers made it look it was a modern fantasy world of awesome...,9,24 December 2017,"When I saw the critics reviews and I was a bit confused because the trailer looked like it would have been really good. Then I had a second to think and then uh-huh, it's just big studios paying off critics to attack Netflix so I'm gonna watch it anyways. Well I actually loved this movie. I love the fantasy world of orcs, elves, dwarves, and magic, and this movie did it justice bringing it into modern times. Storytelling by Ayer was good, sure there are unanswered questions about this new fantasy world, but if you read fantasy books or watch enough fantasy movies, you can get the jist of the movie pretty well and you will definitely have fun watching it but yearn for more of this fantasy world. However, for me as a fantasy action it's not a 10 unless there's the impending dread of a sinister evil villain/force that you just hate with all your guts. There's mention of the dark lord, but I just didn't feel the fear creeping inside me, just random chaos among the races. As a gangster cop movie, it was okay only, action was pretty good gun fights were solid, portrayal of each races is excellent. Would love to see more please! Bring on the Dark Lord!",Bright

667,alessandrowoodbridge,"The Critics are Blind, Ridiculous and Fake",10,24 December 2017,"The critics must be blind to think that this movie is even half of what it is currently rated. I created an IMDb account just to rip apart how terrible the critics are. I have never felt the heart to chirp or join in with the madness of the world that is reviews but after seeing absolutely amazing movies be completely torn to shreds because of narrow minded critics that have blown out of proportion reviews on what they think of the movie, is ridiculous. My top 3 favourite movies are Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now Bright. If you thought the other two movies were excellent then I gaurantee, and I'd even place a wager with you that you'd definitely enjoy this movie without a doubt. The movie industry are now truly taking us into an amazing, beautiful and 'brighter' new era of a cinematic experience. I've fully realised this after watching such an excellent movie that was expertly acted by cast. I never truly appreciated Will Smith as an actor until I have seen how he has continued to perform roles such as this with delicacy, respect and with integrity. Despite ridiculous critisicm it has taken I am more than proud that Netlix are helping fund for a sequel, hell I hope there's even a triligoy. I have nothing but excellent things to say about this movie and disgust at the movie critics. I mgiht even fancy being a part time movie critic if the current ones are destroying such enchanting, magical and captivating movies. Just take a look at most of the user reviews on this movie, this speaks movie speaks for itself. It is an absolutely sensational movie that took us on a rollercoaster of different emotions. So many values are shown, so many tales of heroism, loss, courage and more; a completely unpredictable tale throughout. I truly wish I could point out just one flaw as I am a brutally honest person in real life. Amazing, read all if you care for an honest review on an excellent movie.",Bright

671,brandonsousa,"Fun, Fast-paced, Doesn't Take Itself Seriously -- Great Action Movie",10,28 December 2017,"I loved this movie -- ignore the critics' reviews on this one. Check out the Audience Score versus the critics' Tomatometer. That same mismatch (audiences love, critics pan) follows on most platforms. Here's the reason -- critics want thoughtful, beautiful, complicated movies that push on abstract concepts in the film world, and audiences like movies that are fun to watch.This is a movie that's *really* fun to watch. The casting is fantastic -- Will Smith kills, Joel Edgerton as his nerdy, earnest orc partner is believable and lovable (adorkable, even). Noomi Rapace is disturbing, surreal, beautiful, as the dark elf villain. I also loved all the supporting actors -- Will Smith's lower middle class, no-nonsense, flashy, decent, loving wife, all the cruel, dangerous, tough-as-nails cops the main characters work with, the dark elf assassin sent to kill but failed and transformed into something beautiful and grotesque. Everything's interesting.The movie creates a fully-realized fantasy world without struggling to explain it to you. It's just the way the world is. With about 5 minutes of introductory coffee-news-work talk between Will and his wife, the movie explains just about everything you need to know, and the little pieces of information that are dispersed throughout the movie keep you interested in learning about this world.And, the movie does say something about the political moment -- the world it's set in is dystopian to say the least. The elves are the professional and ownership class, rich and isolated from the lower classes, humans are the middle class, spanning the range from poor to well-off, and orcs are the lower class. The movie isn't trying to say anything particularly important or heavy (that's why it's successful and fun), but mirroring the class divide is an interesting theme and sparks the imagination.Overall, this movie is fun. It's corny (picking up all the classic cop movie stereotypes) on purpose, it's action-packed, it's funny, it's beautiful and weird. Also, it's just the right length -- you're never bored, never overwhelmed. Loved it.If you liked reading Ready Player One, or watching Firefly and Serenity, or any other ""B+"" fantasy/sci-fi/adventure media, you'll like this.",Bright

During the course of the movie they fill you in. Its basically Alien Nation(which others have said) meets The Lord of the Rings(wands). With a little bit of In the Heat of the Night mixed in. They get it to work. Landis does a solid job. Given the major releases I have seen the last few months, maybe Im suffering from bad movie withdraw. Doesn't matter this got me out of that funk. It won't change your outlook on the world but you actually can get into the action and story. You can root for the good guys and want to see them succeed. I watched the entire movie and didn't realize that Leilah was Noomi Rapace.. After they wasted her acting in Prometheus via Alien Covenant. She does really well here. There are plenty of plot holes and misses but still a movie you can enjoy. I rated it a 10 purely because of the 6.6 I see it is receiving and that is BS.

The acting was amazing and overall the movie was a good combination of fantasy, action, comedy and drama. The only thing that the movie didn't handle well was the character development. Some characters would just appear and are supposed to be important and others were meant to have made us care for them but without the proper development I didn't really get into it.

The screenplay was bad and the final movie felt sloppy. Suffice to say the premise had potential but the story just wasn't there, in the end. Its a shame really, because I have often enjoyed Will Smith ever since his early TV roles, but I feel like he has been dropping the ball lately, maybe taking rolls that aren't right for him just for the money to support his lifestyle.

Honestly the only bad thing in my eyes was the inconsistent tone but it's not too hard to explain away given the circumstances. Orcs are less intelligent than humans that's pretty well established. Of course there's gonna be awkward moments! The film did kinda over do it but it wasn't as cringy as people are making it out to be. The world building isn't actually bad either. If you were expecting a vast world to see, you're not gonna see it through the eyes of two low ranking police officers. It gave enough to give circumstances to the plot and left enough mystery for the world, at least in my eyes, to keep me interested in the world. The world the film built is mysterious, not underdeveloped. I would definitely recommend it, although I do understand it won't be everyone's cup of tea.

I was very interested watching the trailer, but when I watched the movie, I felt like I wasted my time. Too general storyline, no deep meaning behind the movie, looked like a teenager directed the film.The whole story was like shoots, steals wand, shoots, shoots, the wand stolen again, explodes, enemy dies, yay.I don't recommend watching this.

I had a nice wine over a decent Italian meal I cooked of a recipe that involved parmezan cheese.And this movie complemented it whilst being in quarentine. I hope it gets higher rate. Story line is exciting. It's got the human xenopbobic element and every race plot turned good in it, with decent effects.Just liked the very likes of it to late because of serious movie raters who expect every film to be the equivalent of Beethoven's Fifth.The way that the epic Lord of the Rings has come together in a modern action movie, I dare you to do a greater job. The movie is a decent solid one.You go on and enjoy this stuff.",Bright

694,nabbs-62073,The movie is pretty awesome. Critics are shills for hollywood.,8,7 February 2021,"Modern world problems of racism, dirty cops, and classism brought to the surface and in your face with Orcs, elves and magic. Tons of great action. It was way better than I ever imagined and I was really sad when it ended.
This is one of those rare movies where you say, damn I wish this was an hour longer. What a ride.
Will Smith does an excellent job in his role and he really doesn't hold anything back. Its as beautiful as Suicide Squad and does so without all the bad acting. The casting was really spot on.Loved it .. please make another one or a trilogy.. no spoilers but three would be perfect for reasons you need to see for yourself.",Bright
695,kheldarath,Yes thank you,8,15 May 2021,"TL;DR: A solid contempory fantasy that draws on characteristic elements from fantasy novels and Buddy Cop action films. Done pretty well. Liked it!Ok.. So I have no idea why people hated this movie so much. I mean it has Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, buddy cop drama, action, comedy. It's just a couple of mismatched beat cops chucked into the middle of a massive conspiracy. This is everything you need from a buddy cop movie!Oh yeah and theres a hell of a lot of fantasy and magic and Elves and Orks in there too, and you know what... it is brilliant.This film was well executed. The story was standard but good contempory fantasy and its been too long since I saw anything that was able to pull that off well.Will Smith is his standard good self. I mean, yes he might be playing a character we've seen him play before, but the fact is, he does it with aplomb every time. Also, he doesn't take on the sole carriage of the movie. This movie didn't need Will Smith to be good, the fact that he is in it aswell, just ups its mark even more. Because, you see, Noomi Rapace's Leiliah is really great too, pulling off the mystical fanatic elf so well. In addition to Joel Edgerton's Nick Jakoby which also was well executed.All in all if there was anything to say to this film's detriment its just that it took a bit of time to find its feet at the start, but by the end it had it all together very nicely. People will draw the parallel's with Tikka and potentially Lelu from 5th element, but i think thats passable. Lucy fry did a good job as Tikka.Also, that it wasn;'t released in the cinema. I think if it had been, its popularity would have been higher.People highlight the social commentry as a bad factor as well it's true. But, really, sometimes films have to. It didn't pull away from the plot as much as people thought. It was a part of the plot, yes. But look at any fantasy story and you will probably be able to identify the same elements. Outcast/Orphan becomes a Cop/Soldier/Hero saves the day, becomes respected by his compatriots and the world as a whole. Its the hero of a thousand faces. As it should be in this kind of setting.Ok so the ending was a little predictable, but its not about the ending., its about the story.All in all I really enjoyed this. Honestly. Good work!So... when's bright 2?",Bright

And use them to make an allegory!!! about racism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What could possibly!!! be more!!! exciting??!!!!!!!!??!!!!!!!!??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Question: Do all those exclamation points make my review exciting? No? Well, neither do pounding waves of automatic gunfire make a movie exciting. The relentless, mindless gunfire in Bright only makes the proceedings excruciatingly tedious.This movie stinks. Not only that, but much of its plot hinges on seeing Elves used as stand-ins for Jews. In fact, this is the most remarkably anti-semitic storyline I've ever seen in a film. I don't say that lightly. When someone told me BEFORE I watched the movie that it was anti-semitic, I thought they were imagining things. Nope. This movie doesn't just comment on bigotry, it perpetuates it.",Bright

They did a great job with the script and a awesome job with the cast selection. It could've really been a very bad movie mixing Urban and fantasy but I can say they did it!! Part 2 can be so much better if they can fit it in the budget. ROTTEN TOMATOES NEEDS TO DO BETTER and please don't let there review or any other SO CALLED review website stop you from watching this movie. It's worth the 2 hours!!!,Bright
700,cortneyc07,Critics are afraid of original ideas.,10,23 December 2017,"Go to the movies and every preview will be for a reboot, or remake. The big studios are afraid to take chances on anything outside of the box, because critics will slam it. If this movie were released in theaters no one would have gone, because the reviews were so bad. But since its on Netflix people gave it a chance, and it actually a pretty good movie. Critics did the same with Seth McFarland's show the Orville. It was not what they expected so they slammed it. This movie is entertaining the critics are stifling creativity.",Bright
701,madtza,The hate for this movie is rather unjustified,10,2 January 2018,"First of all, this movie isn't really a 10 but more of a 6-7 depending where you're coming from, 7 for me. I just don't understand the amount of hate it's getting and I feel it's is unjustified. The idea is fresh(though not new-Alien Nation) and fun. A break away from all the comic themed waves we've been getting from the big studios. As a first installment of what we hope will be a promising franchise I think they did enough for the audience to want more of this universe. Also, why were a lot of people mad that more of the story wasn't explained? I certainly didn't feel like I needed another ORIGIN storyline in order to enjoy what it was offering and I don't think that was their intention. I've read/watched/gamed enough stories with orcs, dragons and elves to use my own imagination/curiosity of what could've led to where their world is today. I reckon another polarizing factor comes from the fact that we have ""big name"" people involved so expectations were obviously very high. This is by no means a Training Day but more like End of Watch(written by the same director) with more action and fantasy mesh up, you can actually sense the similarities between the movies. It's a fun flik to watch and you should approach it as such instead of wanting to give you a whole history and the action in the allocated running time. You want more(a sequel has been confirmed) then ask for more of the story and I'm certain Netflix will listen.",Bright

I loved the original Alien Nation with Mandy Patankin and James Caan, and this movie reminded me a lot of that flick.I enjoyed this movie immensely. Great action, costumes, and special effects. Really high-budget feel to the whole thing. Good writing and character development, too. Noomi Rapace is cast perfect here. She looks kinda like an elf anyway, so she really nails the look. She looks smokin' in this role! She should wear that elf getup all the time. Forget what the critics say and just watch it.

708,mcgow01,Tale of Two Movies,7,1 January 2018,"The first 20-30 minutes of this movies seem to suffer from poor editing and no clear direction. I didn't know if I was watching Training Day or Bad Boys 4. There were also tons of pointless scenes, shallow social commentary and pointless characters. The first part of the movie would have been better served building more background on the world and main characters. But then, the movie picks a clear direction (action) and it takes off. The action was very entertaining and all of the actors shined in the last 2/3rd of the movie. The whole ""Lord of The Rings in modern times"" worked well. This is a world I wouldn't mind seeing fully developed. Bottom line, when the movie is trying to be a funny/buddy cop film or trying to make a social statement, it falls flat. Once it leans into being an action film, everything falls into place and we get a very an entertaining movie.",Bright
709,jason-859-743185,Definitely worth a watch!,9,23 December 2017,"Regardless of what some of the ""professional"" critics say, I thought this was a very good movie.
While there wasn't a whole lot of background info as to how everything came to be, you will get a better idea towards the end.
With so many movies and shows out there and still coming out with horrible acting, poor special effects and even worse story lines this movie is one that keeps you guessing and leaves you thrilled all the way to the end.",Bright
710,indigz,"Great setting, bad movie",3,7 January 2018,"I am kind of a fan of Shadowrun universe, so seeing a trailer I was getting my hopes up for a movie that will explore a theme of a modern world with magic in it. And we did get that movie. Granted, the history of Bright differs greatly from Shadowrun but it was similar enough. Different races, magic, modern technology, even a dragon seen in the background!
After expected intro to the world the story starts. Familiar plot of two police partners who both don't belong but become buddies is nothing new for sure. But it works. First half of the movie you see same old tricks, well shown and exploited. But after the movie moves to expand on the plot, something strange happens. The action becomes erratic. Dialogues cheesy. Jokes flat. And then the whole story falls apart. Plot armor of protagonists, cliched phrases, unimaginative deus ex machinas, a whole lot of loose ends, anticlimactic ""final battle"". All in all it seems like writers ran out of gas mid-session.
Returning to the title. It is a great setting. You find it satisfying to see all humans as a whole because divide between them and orcs, elves, centaurs and dwarves is greater than between themselves. You get a glimpse in the history of the world, some great battles and turmoils. Magic is certanly a factor as are conspiracies. Nice CGI and camera work helped a lot. But this setting was wasted on telling some pretty bad story with no good ending. I am certain that a TV series or at least a mini-series would have been better. Without the pressure of two hour maximum screentime you can tell so much more coherent and well-written tale, spend so much more on the past of the world, explore side characters.
It is a shame to see on original narrative and setting wasted on third-grade movie after so many remakes of superhero movies.",Bright

713,rushtic,"Solid, but could have been great.",8,28 December 2017,"This genre lends itself to more of a PG13 then an R in my opinion. I know Game of Thrones seems to dispel that belief, but this is a movie. The world and concept of the story is awesome. The premise is solid, and it plays out well and has a excellent pace, but a little over the top sleaze wise in a couple of scenes, and I could have been happier if the sheer number of F bombs was reduced. It was actually distracting in several scenes. I also feel the constant hammering on the LAPD is a bit lame also, we get it, we've seen it in a million movies, a slight shift here could have enhanced the experience as opposed to weakening the story. As far a the Orc, Elf, Human, and other creature dynamic, it plays pretty strongly to social commentary and is a bit heavy handed. With all that said, the world as we know it doused in magic and swords and sorcery is awesome. I'm glad Netflix made this and was completely entertained. I watched it twice within days of it being released and will try it again with VidAngel to see if that distracts by removing the above mentioned things or improves the viewing. As for the special effects, you can see that the money was well spent, the way magic is portrayed is awesome, and the Orc makeup while not perfect is incredibly believable. I was happy with the acting quality and the action. I watch a movie hoping to be sucked in and immersed, I believe this movie accomplishes the task.",Bright

I rarely enjoy what has been put out in the past decade for entertainment. This was exciting and enjoying to watch. You need to use context clues to piece things together to understand the history of this alternate world, but it also leaves the door open to expand this universe into sequels. As a hard right winger, I think the social commentary is light, and maybe not leftist enough for general Hollywood, and very centrist for Netflix. Maybe the bad critic reviews are a result of this not being leftist enough? There was no ""orcs dindu nuffin"" like I was expecting.
TLDR; I don't know why other users/critics don't like this movie. Its an exciting movie with an interesting world. The only thing I would have left out is the few pop culture references, but they hold no weight to the story arc and can easily be ignored.",Bright

I was very pleasantly surprised, this is actually pretty legit. If you're a fan of fantasy, this is a damn good one.I love how Jakoby put on hammer smashed face in the car, and called it a great love song. Totally could see how Cannibal Corpse could be an all orc band. I like how they managed to flesh out the different species, just like some fantasy RPG. Humans were... humans, orcs had their strength stats pretty maxed out (that one orc lifting a car in the ghetto like its nothing), and how elves were so nimble and bounced all over the place. There was one mention of dwarves by that gang boss, hope they showcase some dwarves if there's ever a sequel.World building could have went on a bit more but I'm a silly nerd so not everyone would have appreciated another half an hour of talk about prophecies etc. The story was tight, I like how they mostly stuck to the cops instead of veering all over the city showing other storylines. Great chemistry between our protagonists. Action scenes were solid, orcs are tough as fuck.

Don't try to dig too deep into the whole ""why are there elves, orcs, and other mythical creatures in this world"" because I don't think you'll find the answer in this movie. Take it as a given, and focus on the relationship between Ward (veteran cop stuck with a partner he doesn't want or like) and Jakoby (the good to his core rookie cop that everyone hates because he's different). It's a good story with good action. Is it the best I've ever seen? No, but I would put it in the category of ""I'd watch it again""How I typically rate movies is like this (think of a 5 star system)1 (lowest): Couldn't make it though the movie, had to turn it off

3: yeah, it was OK

726,garrett-raney,Fun concepts and good execution held back by awful screenwriting,7,8 November 2018,"Pros:
1) I actually very much appreciated the vagueness of this modern fantasy reality. It's FANTASY, and the vagueness leaves more up to your imagination. This is a good thing, but will make the movie less enjoyable for those that don't appreciate it when a story has much room for creative interpretation.2) Maybe I missed something, but I have never really seen or thought much about what various fantasy creatures would be like in present day. I very much enjoyed the creativity in this aspect of the movie, and will recommend it based solely on it's uniqueness for that.3) The special effects and action sequences are entertaining. The movie is fast paced and relatively brutal (in a good way).Cons:
1) Other reviewers that are more articulate than myself have done a good job painting the picture of how elementary the screenplay is. I'll try to add my thoughts: Everything was teed up so nicely for a really cool, brutal treatment of themes including racism, class warfare, corruption, and out of control violence but then someone wrapped all that in a silly buddy-cop screenplay written for an under-age audience.2) Our seemingly every day heroes were far too Jedi like. Everyone else was terrifyingly effective at murdering each other, but turned into storm troopers when shooting at Will and his buddy. This got pretty annoying after a few scenes.Overall: this movie had so much potential. With the way these things go, it seems unlikely it's presumed sequel(s) will be able to turn things around, but I'll watch it anyway. At least that's more than I can say for Bad Boys...",Bright

730,sydney-253-665530,"Lazy, unfinished, boring",2,25 December 2017,"Very lazy writing. Everything from the characters to the plot to the dialogue was pretty poorly written. The script needed another round of editing. It doesn't bring anything new to the fantasy genre. It doesn't have to, but since it relies so heavily on high fantasy tropes and ideas, it feels like old news. The dialogue was written to be seen as witty, not genuine, realistic, or interesting. Character motivations either were not there or made no sense. The acting wasn't bad at all. It was a little melodramatic at times, but that's mostly on the writing. 
You can also tell that the director didn't trust the story. He relied more on fancy visual tricks than the actual plot to do the storytelling. The makeup and wardrobe was fantastic, though, and told the story better than the writing.

After having watched the trailer I thought «let's give it a shot», it really seemed interesting. But the plot was very predictable and the action scenes somehow felt unnecessarily complicated and were lacking sense. The overall humor was okay, as were the performances of the actors. 
It's a shame that no character, beyond the two main characters, were properly developed. I think thats one of the principal reasons that made me dislike the movie. There is just not enough context and the story feels forced. Also the ""villains"" were more of a joke for me.I really cannot understand how people can give this movie 10/10 stars.

The movie was above my expectations, better than the trailer, and the cast brilliant! I had just been discussing with my roommate how i miss the good old cop partner movies, where humor, action, and brolove makes magic. Lethal Weapon, Meets Bad Boys, meets Rush Hour, meets The Fifth Element! If you don't like science fiction, don't keep up a current events, and don't enjoy some friendship true love, then you won't enjoy this movie. This movie had all of the elements of a great 80', 90's cop partner action movie, plus the insights of the current and past history of social bull-shit we still deal with (and some), plus great acting, great special effects (very well balanced too so that the whole film is not just about ""watch us make an entire movie on a green screen""), and a simple story with unexpected turns. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat, hanging on with the characters, and guessing and hoping. 
I don't know what the critics say, i give them little credit because they're much like the judges on a beauty pageant contest -- just see who's wearing the most expensive dress and has got the bigger titties. This film is a jewel and i hope they make more films like this. I'm sick of movies about none sense. This film really balanced the relatable with interesting sci-fi that made every second of it worth my time. Love it! Can't wait to see more.",Bright

Will Smith and Joel Edgerton did a good job at portraying two unique and interesting characters, but they were let down by poor extras in places.A few times the quality of the cinematography and sound really dropped and Bright felt like a B movie, rather than a blockbuster. This seems to happen in every Netflix movie I've watched and I wonder whether the quality control just isn't in place or the final cut doesn't get given enough time.Bright had a good mixture of action, comedy and drama. A few areas felt a bit rushed and sometimes scenes and themes moved on far too quickly.

The show contains a very adult feeling sense of racist superiority against the orcs wiht Elves and humans displaying a very biased racial attitude towards Orcs because of the in world history of Orcs siding against humans and elves with the evil bad guy forces within the movie.

756,chulm,If you are one of those guys that needs constant explanation stay away !,8,24 December 2017,"Here is the most important information for anybody critiquing thios movie !
You are what is wrong whith audiences nowadays. All i read is constant whining about ""the world not being explained"" , this need to ""have everything spoonfed to you"" is what ruins most adaptions of otherwise great material ( im looking at you Ghost in the shell ). Because you guys want every little detail explained, studios tend to dumb down good storys and create the crap everyone keeps complaining about.
Shure the movie had its faults, but overall it was a well made, and pretty good executed movie.If you are into ther fantasy gnere, you realize that a lot of the setup didnt have to be explained as it just makes sense ( Orks being gangsters, Elves being snobs etc).
Shure its a simple action movie,and the ""racism"" element seemed a bit much at times but what else did you expect ? Nearly all fatasy worlds are deeply racist by default, just look at the LOTR movies for example. ( Elves hate dwarves, who hate orks and elves ,and orks hate everyone etc.).
So all in all the world seemed highly realistic to me for a fantasy setting.
To me it seems most of the critics saw this movie whith ""wrong"" or flawed expectations.
I dont go and see Die Hard if i hate action movies and afterwards complain it wasnt a drama for example.

Ignore the critics, Bright is a great movie worth watching. It will make you laugh, amilez and entertain.Critics often totally miss the mark of a movies purpose, to entertain. Are movies supposed to be a work of Art like Casablanca, Schindler's List, etc or entertainment like Iron Man, Home Alone, etc?Answer: Movies can be either or both. Just because a movie isn't a work of art doesn't mean it's a bad movie or deserves a bad review. Some movies are true works of art. Masterpieces that influence society and entertain audiences for generations. Some movies are so bad they enduce sleep or are used as torture in ""enhanced interegation."" A good movie entertains. They make us forget about our problems for a couple of hours. They can make us laugh, cry, feel love, feel hate, even get lost in thought pondering life. As long as a movie does one of these things, entertains, its done it's job.Bright is no work of art; however, it has laughs, great action, heartfelt moments, and a bit of magic and wonder. It does what it was meant to do, entertain.",Bright
763,jjbinoy,The critics do not understand the Fantasy Genre ... IT's Awesome,10,27 December 2017,"This movies was pretty good, decent plot, remarkable acting and dialogue delivery by both lead actors and fantastic directing, MIB humor delivery. Surprisingly good product from a non fantasy dominant director. Yes David Ayer is doing things right to hold his own in this genre since he is taking the right steps and an impressively mature decision from Netflix (Who would have thought) Spot the dragon and the centaurIts a fantasy come real and with a long history. Too bad its not based off a book and i have to stalk the web for news about the sequel, thats going to hurt.I do not consider Justice League, ironman, wonder woman as Fantasy (not anymore)..... it's an overexploited franchise which big studios use with outsourced super awesome animation and 5th grade story line, expensive actors (who are short on cash/talent) ... when they need a sure thing, as long people come to see it at least once they come out with a handsome profit. Harry potter-the book- (ones made into movies get worse as it progresses with the books) is a Fantasy, Bright is too. With a surprisingly simple storyline and a deep description of fictional classicism, this movie was no doubt the only one I will consider notable and unforgettable enough to be released at the end of this year. I never have listened to critics, more because they have been inaccurate about most movies for a very long time, but their reaction to this was appalling. Either they are not millennial's or they being connoisseur's of a particular genre, no one person can like all genre. Oh well I don't read the trash where their reviews get printed anyway except in Forbes which did have one that was acceptable, but Forbes is not in the movie critique business, thankfully.So if you like Fantasy you will like this",Bright

Sure, Bright does not have an over the top plot, but it pulls it off by making an action/fantasy movie with some twist to the 1,294,230,725 ""safe"" movies that are out there killing cinema, and killing creative writing.
Once more netflix proves that creative writing is not dead, and that new concepts can be brought into a 1h50m movie without leaving me thinking that I should just turn to gaming instead of watching the same crap over and over again. Yeah because nowadays when you think action/fantasy that equals DCU, MCU, Star Wars (Not against either of these - actually a fan) but god I want to see some original content.
Even though bright as is flaws, the hating buddies that get it right at the end, the over the top message of racism and brutally, and the plot segways that are just to easy. This is all blended by the okay action, the ( for me off course ) amazing performance of Joel Edgerton and the kind of refreshing set up of the story, monsters, magic and elf coexisting with man? Sign me up!So in conclusion let's all be humans and appreciate the effort put in movies like this and if you orcs are reading this just be aware that only because a movie isn't a reboot from a franchise in the 80's-90's doesn't mean it is simple bad.",Bright

But in this instance, one of the cops is an orc, despised by both humans and orcs and in an uncomfortable relationship with his human partner who tries to be tolerant of the other races but doesn't really want to be working with an orc.The relationship between the 2 main characters just doesn't really work. At no point during their time together on screen is there any chemistry that suggests these actors even like each other, let alone the characters for whom there's supposed to be some friction. The script does not adequately bring Ward and Jakobi together in any way and it's pretty dire all the way through.There are some very decent action sequences which is impressive given that the budget is estimated at only around $90m but there's a strong sense of haphazardness here as if many of the supplemental elements had just been picked out of a hat and added to the plot.Personally, I didn't mind it and I think most people who aren't cinema snobs will think it's an adequate 6-7/10. However, I do think that some people will get hopelessly lost within the first 15 minutes and if they do, there's nothing in the script to draw them back into it.In all, this is OK but not great.",Bright

-You have someone with a magic wand that could've fixed a number of situations earlier in the movie, but instead they wait until someone is dead
-Why do all these people appear to want a ""wand"" when no one can touch it except the Brights. 
-After they call for backup at the house, there's still enough time for the bad guys to get there and get out before any cops arrive.
-How is magic so useful if it apparently almost kills those that use it, so much so that they need to go and bath in a magic pool afterwards.

I will resume my review in these points:Positives (+):
An original story with a very promising fantasy world that has a lot of potential.Very good performance from 'the underrated' Joel Edgerton and will smith.A lot of mysteries and events that took place a long time ago are not answered which add a little curiosity for a sequel.It also shred a light on important social issues ( police brutality and racism....)Negatives (-):
Consumed story and the plot doesn't have much......Boring villain (antagonist).The wasted potential of it fantasy world because the movie just show us a small view (it like watching the world from a window without interfering).Side characters are not exploited very wellI really enjoyed watching a movie with a new idea in a year filled with sequels ,and i think that this kind of movies one need more support to deliver its full potential.
thanks.",Bright

790,carlosgbenjamin,Bright isn't....,5,2 January 2018,"I love all the mashup comparisons for this movie and can see the thought behind most of them. For me, Bright promised to be Lethal Weapon set in the LOTR universe, and who wouldn't be excited about that? Except possibly non-nerds who love Lethal Weapon but haven't a clue as to what an orc is. I found the premise of a modern world populated by fantasy creatures alongside humans to be brimming with potential, but that potentially was, for the most part, squandered in this big-budget bust of a Netflix original. So much material available and they hardly tapped the abundance they'd been given. ""Bright"" was actually not bright at all, but was lackluster in nearly every aspect, not that the title was intended to be an indicator of the mood, which is dark, or the creators who are likely quite bright but just didn't show it here. I'm not sure if the writers just didn't try very hard or if their thorough exploration of this universe was trashed before or during the filming, but the movie ends up being nothing more than a buddy cop movie with makeup and prosthetics layered on top.Had the script been more robust, the lackluster performance by Wil Smith would have torpedoed the production. I'm admittedly kind of Luke-warm toward the guy, but I never know going in if he's going to step up or just call it in. He was on auto-pilot throughout most of this film. Jakoby was the only character that had any backstory explained and there were plenty of others that needed some development, not least of which was the universe itself. It really needs more exposition and is probably more suited to a series, but if this was intended to be a pilot, they'll have to drag it out of the mud hole they created here and polish it up.... a lot.",Bright

793,eldridgeprime,Why critics fail to review Fantasy well.,10,25 December 2017,"Bright was an incredible film. It successfully combines modern storytelling and themes with mythic and fantasy ideas creating a wonderful amalgamation of strong qualities in a modern film. Film Critics often discredit Fantasy due to their lack of imagination and their enrapture with the themes of Modern Bleakness. Also, they are a terribly jealous lot fill with failed screenwriters. They poo-poo on anything that works well that they could not imagine.Fantasy allow for Mythic themes, Heroes, Magic, the struggle of Good Versus Evil and the possibility happy endings. Most of these ideals are anathema to the ""Modern"" film Critic.Bright has all these themes in the format of a ""Buddy Cop"" film. It has comedy and drama of personal interaction, as well as interpretation of race relations in an alternate reality. It has a brilliant script, fantastic direction, great (often gorgeous) cinematography, great acting and nuance inside an alternate now. Ignore the negative critiques. Give Bright a try and be amazed!",Bright
794,mymail-04906,Watch it in the WoW saga context,10,24 December 2017,"While watching it I couldn't stop projecting the story of ""Bright"" in the context of the ""World of Warcraft"" universe. All complaints about the movie suffering from a shallow and poorly portrayed background story become redundant if you consider it as a 2000 year later sequel of a legend descending in the retrospective mythology of WoW. I thought it was like an extended pilot episode of a promising TV series that Netflix should consider investing in. The only downside being they probably can't afford the cast of Bright. Anyway, the movie has its audience and the critics being so savagely rampant in their professional commentary atrocity will probably urge more and more people to watch the movie.

It's hands down the best movie I've seen in a long long while. The acting was amazing and the storyline kept me hooked from start to finish..

801,razhan,Too predictable movie however interesting to watch,7,23 February 2018,"If you want to pass 2 hours of your day, then this movie is a one time watch movie. The storyline is predictable throughout the movie, but it deserves 7/ 10 rating.
The characters are somewhat playful, especially the lead orc character(Jacoby). The orcs could have been portrayed as a bit more rough and tough characters like in previous orc movies. The connection between every characters were established amazingly and it reminds us of the real world racial picturisation as well.
It is obviously more of a humorous movie than an action one and I really hope that if there is a part 2, the characters become more serious and the storyline becomes an unique one as well.",Bright

I sometimes wonder if it's the dinosaur media vs new media? But I dunno...how this can be universally panned by critics, and the film is so awesome.Anyway, I came into this expecting it to be some dumb, identity politics driven narrative. And for the first 20 minutes or so of the movie, that's what it seemed to be. But I have to say, they did their very best to rapidly move away from that. And the film turned into something as bad-ass as ""Training Day"". I don't think my opinion of a movie has ever flipped so quickly. When the action starts, it's an action thriller fantasy like nothing I've ever seen. Very original, and funny dialogue too in places, even though the film is to be taken seriously.",Bright

If you remember the series 'Alien Nation' (cop and alien are partners), then it will come to mind when watching this. However, using Orcs, elves, humans, the Dark Lord etc. and mixing it with modern day humans was very interesting. The realism of racism and prejudice that would surely exist among the different 'races' was well represented and left me wanting to know more about how this world evolved. The story line was interesting (albeit slightly predictable, and lacking information as previously stated) but the acting and action was as well done as any other cop/sci-fi movie. If you are a fan of the action/adventure/sci-fi genre, you will probably come away feeling it was pretty darn good.

809,graemeanelay,"In an age of garbage, a Shadowrun setting, makes for more interesting action tat",7,30 December 2017,"Lets face it, this film is not going to be Citizen Kane, but it definitely fills a niche. If you're bored of watching versions of the Expendables 9, the Transporter XII ""Bus Pass to Vengance"" or whatever Steven Segal is up to these days, this film fills a slot. At least the roleplaying/fantasy setting allows you to be distracted from the same story we've seen countless times in every action film these days. Injecting some fake life into it. Though I think that the cultural undertones of having more races to deal with was under explored in this movie. Still, it was fun when it hit the mark & didn't take itself too seriously when it failed.But all together if you look at the numbers, what would you say was the better film, for all it's clunkyness and shmaltz?

812,flojoworldwide,Gary Gygax would have been proud.,7,28 December 2017,"After watching the movie, and reading several of the reviews, I can see that many people just didn't get it. Visuals? - Great! Story? a bit cliche. Acting? - a bit muddled, uneven flow, somewhat disjointed, as if the characters were still developing. Guess what folks - You've just witnessed the first chapter in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. It always starts out a bit rough, a bit disjointed; as the character role players are learning who they are and what the world is that they are playing in. I thought it was a great start out for a group of level 1 players trying to figure things out. We had a backstory for the characters, a setup of the world/multiverse, and an initial ""quest""/chase story to get the characters some experience points. Some initial characters lived, some rolled 1's and were written out. We had a world, a trail, conflicts, a dungeon, a tavern scene, all the elements of a D&D game. I think a sequel/mini-series follower is definitely warranted; I look forward to seeing how this world develops, and how the travelers continue on their quest. A mash-up of fantasy game world with modern Los Angeles was very creative, and I liked some of the background visuals and concepts. I think the racial strife plot line was a bit thick, but like I said, D&D story lines and characters start out a cliche as the players learn their roles. Can't wait to see what the folks at Wizards Of The Coast do with this - possibly a Netflix/Hasbro partnership? Lots of marketing opportunities. Maybe Mike Mercer has some commentary or should get in on the writing staff, maybe with Steve Moffat, who can really turn a tail twister.I think the secret is to think of this as a game, and not a 3-act Hollywood movie canned theme. Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe we have all been played, but I thought it was fun.",Bright

Made me remember of District 9 and we all know what an awesome movie that is. Plus I really like Will Smith despite some of his recent work. And also I love sci-fi, specially if it's cheesy. So I watched this with high expectations. Sadly, they were crushed by the uninteresting and convoluted mess of a plot, really crappy performances and characters and overall bad editing and directing. So, so bad. Remember the movie Crash, about racial stereotypes and violence? Well, this is the same movie but with orcs and elves. Yeah...
Let's just say that it shouldn't come as a surprise to find out that the director of this mess also wrote and directed Suicide Squad, another incredible mess of a movie with interesting ideas flushed down the toilet.

817,alexpgreenwood,499Reviews.com,6,19 May 2018,"I had high hopes for this Netflix made Blockbuster, mixing a few of my favorite genres into one big movie with a whopping $90 Million production budget. The concept for the film sounds great as an elevator pitch, ""gritty cop movie meets Lord of the Rings"" but sadly the end result is less, lets say refined, than I had originally hoped.The story follows newly partnered LAPD cops Ward (human) and Jakoby (orc), through a progression of events that spirals so out-of-hand by the end of the film that I forgot about the first 50 minutes by the time it finished. That's a crying shame too because the first half of the film is arguably the best part. There are some powerful moments as we meet the characters and the world they live in, a parallel to ours, but one in which all your classic fantasy races exist. Orcs are looked down upon as a lesser race because of a choice made by their ancestors two thousand years before the events in the film. We see and feel the pain that Jakoby experiences as an outcast from his people group, and an un-welcomed stranger in the LAPD as the first Orc officer. In that first hour, there are tense, painful moments where we see our officers struggle with each other, and with the situation they are put in by being partners. It's a decent social commentary packed into a world that is similar enough to our own that one really can feel the tension that still exists between races. It's not hard to pick out the parallels that the filmmakers wanted us to see, and I believe that's a good thing.
Sadly, the story starts to spiral into a whole different movie about halfway through, shifting from social commentary to a magic steeped thriller. I struggled to keep up with the various factions and groups that are introduced as Ward and Jakoby suffer through a series of encounters that all feel bland and compacted due to their beriviety and unoriginality, that you just kind-of forget about them not long after they are over. By the time the film is wrapping up, I had forgotten those few powerful moments in the beginning where we actually get to see and know something about the characters motivations and struggles. Honestly, it feels like this franchise (yes, there is more Bright content coming) could have been spread over two different films from this one storyline, but instead they smashed them together producing a film that gives you whiplash halfway through when it changes so drastically.Overall, Bright was an okay film that let me down due to its lack of commitment to one style and forgettable characters, but certainly sparked an interest in a new world that Netflix is committed to producing content in. I'm not sad I watched this film, at the end I'd even say I enjoyed it because of the setting. It's a shallow film that is hard to follow at points, but still a film worth seeing once.",Bright

820,secondemailforme,So much wasted potential,5,26 December 2017,"This movie is like the least entertaining parts of the Men in Black and Harry Potter movie franchises mated in the backseat of a 1985 Chevette. It is unfortunate, too. The universe that they filmmakers have created here seems like a tremendously ripe world in which to create deep, meaningful, nuanced stories; a world with multiple types of creatures living side by side in essentially a caste system. they decided to simply tell a run-of-the-mill cop story that could have been just as easily told with a cast of all human characters. Elves represent the stereotype of Jews; orcs represent the stereotype on inner city blacks and latinos; humans represent the working white class; and fairies represent illegal immigrants. The whole movie is nothing more than this with a few magical sounding words thrown in there to make it seem like it is something more. It isn't. It is a straight up cop-buddy movie. It really feels like the director and producer just said, ""hey, we want to make a movie about police/racial tensions in America, but we know not many people would bother seeing it. So, let's make a movie about police/racial tensions in America, but with MAGIC!"" The magic wand and prophecy pieces of the movie, which ostensibly are the main plot drivers, are almost treated like afterthoughts while the movie runs you over with it's message with all the subtlety of driving a Mack truck full of explosives into a brick wall.Had high hopes for this one, but way too much preaching with way too little plot or character development. I appreciate social commentary in my films, but this one takes the, ""as subtle as a seventh grader's student film project about racism"" approach while completely forgetting about telling an interesting story.Still, not the worst movie I ever saw. It was mildly amusing at points and I never hate seeing Will Smith act. Beats a lot of the indie films I've watched on Netflix, but does not even come close to being a theater release quality movie. If it starred anyone other than Will Smith, I would say this is nothing better than your average straight-to-DVD movie.",Bright

826,freddyhutt,First Review of My Life.... The Critics are too Critical,10,24 December 2017,"Allow me to start by telling you that I have never reviewed a movie in any way, in my entire life. But because of the poor reviews of this film to-date, I felt it my personal obligation to share the humble opinion of a regular guy.This film is faced with the daunting task of introducing us to an entire world that must establish its identity quickly. It borrows from what we consider our traditional fantasy world establishment and gives it the necessary twist. I watch movies frequently with people who distaste movies that don't establish what the 'rules' are fairly quickly. This film does a really decent job of that, without inhibiting our wonder. The action is great, without being too over the top or too caught up in the story ! The character development is okay, but we have many questions, which may also be strategic. I would certainly like to know a little more about Tikka and her situation. But again, this doesn't diminish the entertainment value of the movie. I think the Movie had to accomplish the objective of making watchers hungry for the next film or series..... There are gaping holes in the information provided, and we are left both entertained supremely, and excited to see the next installation.... hoping two things:#1... That the negative critics don't inhibit people from watching and Netflix from making enough revenue to justify Bright 2.
#2...... If we are given a second installation or a series, that we don't have to wait years !!It is impossible to make all of the people happy, all of the time, but this film can make most people happy, most of the time. Isn't that the goal...?",Bright

828,kgreensh,Excellent movie for its type.,9,20 May 2018,"Will Smith is the key to this story. If he was not cast in the main role, credibility would been a big issue. Smith embodied the part as a policeman trying to make it through to his pension. His character is not the young MIB cop but a seasoned skeptic. The other characters were well developed considering that there was no preamble other than the beautiful graffiti shown during the titles. This is refreshing. Too many Netflix series and other series rely on the ""flashback"" to develop characters or fill holes in the plot. With Bright you pick up background and history as the story moves along. The struggle for Nick Jakoby, the orc cop is tangible and very real. Joel Edgerton does an excellent job in giving depth to this important unusual character. Edgar Ramirez was the other stand out as a Fed. I like the way magic is a subplot and character development is first priority. David Ayer is a steady hand in pulling the pieces together and making a a common cop buddy story with a magical twist. Max Landis provides a fresh look at well known ""cop buddy"" genre, much like Lethal Weapon did in 1987 but with a touch of Alien Nation(1988).

Easily one of the worst shot, edited and written films of the year by far.The action sequences were so horribly shot and edited that I had no idea what was actually taking place, characters and plot points are introduced right out of nowhere and the themes in the film like racism and police corruption are not explored in a compelling or cohesive way.The story doesn't really have a natural flow to it, it feels like I watched a series of events that aren't related to each other in any real, significant way stitched together to make a incoherent, confused film. Though I'm not surprised that story was not very well mapped out considering that the screenwriter, Max Landis, also wrote Victor Frankenstein. It probably also explains why the movie felt 20 minutes longer that it actually was. it also explains why the screenplay was so void of any form of originality.A lot character's motivations are so dumb and confusing due to how shittily set up it was. The only positives I can think of is that Will Smith and Joel Edgerton have decent chemistry, they're not bad in the film, and the first act was more tolerable and easy to follow than the two acts that followed. Of course, it's still not good or anything. But it isn't the confused mess that the film turns into by the second act and even more so by the third act. But that's really about it as far as positives go.In conclusion, it tried to throw way too much shit into the pot that I found myself consistently confused by the character's motivations and choices as well as the story, again, being poorly mapped out in such an incohesive way. It's not *the* worst film of the year, but it's definitely in the top 10 worst of the year. Hell, maybe even top 5 worst of the year.",Bright

837,flarisparkes,A great movie hidden under some messy directing,7,22 December 2017,"Okay I was right. This totally doesn't deserve the critics savaging of it. One of them called it the worst movie of 2017. yeah no. But it still missed the mark. It was a great movie hidden under some messy directing and poor moment to moment acting. Good
Aesthetics. Top notch. From the makeup to the magical effects. They really did a lot with 90 million - Whatever Will Smith took. The Orcish church was great.
Setting wise, great as well. The opening scenes with the graffiti are great. Really not a cinematic movie, because I kept pausing to really study it in detail
Joel Edgerton was great. He gave a amazing performance, especially considering he is doing so through heavy makeup.
Joel seemed to get some really good wit. Will seemed to have a bit clunkier dialogue but still some decent laughs.
The humor was decent, mostly jokes and wit that sounded like natural enough banter.
Action wise was decent most of the time.
Really sold how powerful the Inferni elves are. Just would have liked a baseline to how they compare to normal elves, considering we only see Inferni.
Some of the scenes subtly selling the differences between races were good. Orcs felt hefty and strong. Elves felt athletic and flexible.
Mixed
Will Smith on the whole. He seemed very subdued for large parts of the movie, and then over the top at other parts.
Will Smith character also seemed to swing around from scene to scene. Some scenes he is being a total dick, others he is being super nice. Calm one scene, and then screaming Shrek insults later.
Soundtrack. Was fine, not really my jam but there were bits that were 'Insert Music video here'. Funny I got a ad for Bright , when I started the Spotify playlist to listen to one of the songs again. Spotify, I don't need a ad.
More time needed. So much stuff had to be merely alluded to that it really seemed like it needed a longer form media. At least it is getting a sequel.
The elf girl they have was a bit weird. It sold how she was in a cult, how she is constantly wonder struck by everything around her. But some of the things with her seemed like they were supposed to be comedic and just felt off.
The corrupt cops were done fine mostly, but are fucking dumb.
The agents are just there. They barely spoke and the human one was mostly there to stand there, and get told information in that one scene.
The fleeing felt like a bit of stumbling from set piece to set piece
Bad 
Messy direction, particularly later. The pool scene, the characters seemed a bit struck dumb and didn't know what they were supposed to do. This is the biggest issue I really had.
Then the leaving the building, and how things were happening around them were messy. It really needed tightening up.
The acting. It really varied.
Sound. I make a habit of watching with subtitles and that is absolutely needed. Some of the dialogue was very quiet or muffled. Not the orc stuff, but just the human stuff. Another non cinematic thing. Netflix's pausing and subtitles is really needed.
I feel the script was dumbed down. I haven't read the script, thought it is apparently online somewhere. But It feels dumbed down a tad.
I didn't like the Shrek crack. That movie must be vastly different in universe to work at all.
The Inferni elves are bland, and the gangsters are suicidally dumb.
The SWAT team was useless and barely fired their guns.
Thoughts 
So from the graffiti and the later talking about the Dark lord, he was defeated by a orc hero who united the army of the races right? Which doesn't entirely mesh with the stuff about the orcs all choosing the wrong side right.
The script/director is very murder happy. The death toll must be crazy high
Elves deserve a purging. I could really buy a communist style movement, uniting the 'lesser races' against the Elves, happening in setting.
For all the orcs side with the Dark lord, it is only elves in the Inferni. I wouldn't have minded a few more mooks, to have the Inferni suffer a few casualties in their fighting.
Overall Netflix really needs to go back over this and give it a bit more polishing. They can do that, considering their model.
The sequel needs some looking over as well, to prevent issues.
Will Smith isn't really needed. I would have preferred another actor.
How can orcs tell if a orc is blooded. They did the whole cut their hand, but nothing to Joel. ?",Bright

I sat through this movie in the futile hope it would get better. This is a truly ""desperation time"" movie --- only memorable as the worst movie I have seen in years. Cliche-ridden script, poor photography and really bad acting from all actors except Naomi Rapace characterizes this shabby so-called movie. Shame on you for wasting your viewers' time!

839,brigius-70325,"Bored of the usually Hollywood ""blockbuster""?",8,22 December 2017,"This is by no means a perfect movie. There is character development and development of the world around the cast of characters that leaves many questions unanswered. Some of these answers are thrown quickly into the dialogue but don't hold as much weight as they should. It leaves you wondering and asking questions about what is happening, but for a first movie trying to introduce you into the world Ward and Jakoby inhabit it does a good job of providing enough information to leave you wanting more. Bright has been much more than I expected.",Bright

While the world is vast and leaves some questions unanswered, that by no means makes the movie hard to follow or less enjoyable to watch. The action was fantastic, the characters were portrayed very well, and the humor was spread throughout to break the tension. I could see how much older viewers who aren't accustomed to a fantasy setting might have a hard time to follow, but if you're like me and prefer the fantasy genre you will most likely enjoy watching this movie.",Bright

It's really confusing because the movie looked great and I had fun watching it. The orcs looked fantastic, the elfs were bitchy and Will Smith was Will Smith. The only thing I didn't like was the face Will is doing so much lately. I think the face situation started in After Earth... he needs to shake that off. Everything else was fun.
Maybe the critics hyped themselfs to much by saying this will ""end hollywood"" and stuff. But instead it is a great action movie sponsored by Netflix with fantasy and social/racial elements in it.",Bright

846,thomaskuhn-41074,A good idea wasted - Spoilers don't matter,5,22 December 2017,"I really liked the initial idea of a society in which, fantasy creatures and humans live together and problems perform somewhere between reality and fantasy. Concepts like this can be deep by exploring human nature in either a comedic or serious way, or both. And certainly an action thriller can do this in its own rights compared to other genres. But Bright fails on nearly every level.The story is simple and at the same time so confusing, that I wondered for a long time what is going on. At some point they are searching for a wand, but I really don't know why. except that it is wanted by a dark lord and magic is somewhat dangerous. A simple storyline is no problem at all. If the movie would follow it through consistantly, But it doesn't. All the story elements are thrown in way too casual and are often only explained on sidenotes, without ever getting a real foundation within the movie. So what is the movie about?Is it the first orcish policemen who struggles to find a footage in either his community or his colleagues? Is it the elves who as an upper class that has traitors in their lines that work for the dark lord? Is it the human cop who himself is an outsider among his colleagues and struggles with the danger of his job within his family? Is it the chemistry between the orcish policeman and his partner after the orc is responsible for the human getting shot? Who is the dark lord, what does he want and why do some elves end up with him? Let aside questions like: How did a world like this evolve? Why is Jakoby the first orc to be a cop? What do they mean when they say, that the orcs decided to be evil 2000 years ago?Well the movie is about all of the above and nothing really.The movie in the end sticks with the one idea that provides the most action, which is the wand and the dark lord, loosely follows the problems of the orcish Jakoby and ends up with a boring plot, that just goes along with whatever works for the next action scene. Problem with this is that action scenes and one liners end up, to be everything the movie has to deliver and even the actions scenes become pale embedded in everything else that falls flat within the movie.It is a buddy cop story for which the fantasy elements do nothing to create something fresh but are just paced on something we have seen too many times already. Everything is clicheed up to the worst point possible even for an action movie. This movie is a wasted potential and a bad one at this.",Bright

It is a wonderful mashup of buddy cop films and the Lord of the Rings. The pacing might be a bit off in the second half of the film, but all in all, the movie had everything a good movie should. Fantastic world, funny characters you care about, and awesome action and suspense. Is this an academy award winner? No. It is exactly what you would expect. A fun, action film. I, for one, am glad Will Smith did this film. As for the professional critics? All I can say is, they kind of missed the point. I don't know whether they were expecting a different movie, or if this is just a backlash against Netflix for encroaching on big Hollywood's Ticket sales. Either way, I think if you take a look at most review sites you will find a huge discrepancy between the so-called ""professional"" critics and viewer's like the ones that are leaving their reviews here.

An initial thought that occurred to me was how the movie was giving no context to the universe it offers, a bit more into the movie however, this struck me as one of the most appealing & creative aspects of it; acting as if this a current reality. This was further endorsed throughout the movie in dialogue, scenery and bits & pieces of a background story.

I would've liked to have seen more from 'the feds' as they seem pretty bad ass but no real action from them. That possibly would've been the cream on top.It's one of those films that look cringy on the face of it, but as soon as it starts you warm up quite quickly.

I'm not sure what the critics were watching when they reviewed this movie, but history has shown they've been wrong about great movies in the past like Caddyshack and Big Trouble in Little China. Critics hammered those two movies at release and what ya know, they became cult classics that have been watched over and over again. What I like about Bright... It's completely unpredictable, not knowing what the hell is going to happen next. The CGI and action is great, yet still enough dialogue to make the plot very interesting, a great balance between the two. Never did I feel bored or not know what was happening in the movie, even though the storyline would probably seem complex if it was written down on a piece of paper. I really enjoyed the sense of humor in it too!The thing about Sci-Fi's is, either you like the genre or you don't. And I'm sure, since this movie was free on Netflix, there's going to be people here and there that give it an awful review. Those that love Sci-Fi, I suspect this movie will become a cult classic. I just hope they don't ruine the sequel, this movie very much deserved a theatrical release. Without a doubt I would of payed money to see this in the theater!The beginning of the movie, I thought the movie had sort of a End of Watch feel to it... What ya know, it was the same director and writer of the movie, David Ayer. This movie is sort of an End of Watch meets Lord of the Rings/Big Trouble in Little China, with a mixture of action, fairytale, and humor that keeps you wanting more.

Now, you can kinda tell that this director was a little too inexperienced but hey practice makes perfect right, why do you think they put Will Smith in it?! 
 Okay, now I am a huge Will Smith fan and I have a lot of respect for him as an artist because I am an artist myself, and this movie isn't as bad as everyone says it is! Will Smith makes it awesome! Honestly, if he wasn't cast in this movie, I really don't think this movie would have gone anywhere. And I do think it is comical how the one critic was referring this movie to Lord of the rings and sh!t. It's nothing like any other movie out there.

Orcs, elfs, dwarves and dragons in actual LA, how crazy does that sound? I feel fantasy fans will enjoy this movie, the missing details, I believe is better for the viewer to create its own context/background within Brights world. For me I took the LOTR world/characters(different movie I know) and from there I created my own story of how maybe Bright became to be as it is in the movie. It doesn't have to be LOTR, I used that movie as an example because well yeah theres tons of fantasy living creatures in that world. Bright doesn't have a ring but combining the small details that we know from the movie and adding in between our own ideas of what we believe bright's world should be then I feel the viewer can come up with its own satisfying story for them to enjoy when watching the movie. Thats why I feel this movie is not for everyone. I think Bright took a risk and it worked, its not going to be that kind of serious ""Training day"" movie because theres no way for us to relate with an Orc. We don't feel close to the conflict but we understand the issues of racism between the races in Bright and for that I give a 10 to this movie.",Bright

I loved the movie, it was interesting and made me want to see more of the world it created. Critics may hate it, but from my friends who have seen it to the user reviews on multiple websites it is clear that this was a well-made movie with far superior quality than the movie snobs let on.

Personally i adore NETFLIX for making a big budget movie and think it is a great move and marketing strategy for them, personally alot of the negative reviews i believe is because NETFLIX is competition now so lets put them down and get them out the movie industry qucik. Anyways the movie, I am a will smith fan and i can also say ive not liked all his recent movies etc. But in this his acting was on point so was the other cast made me believe the characters. Story was original and creative. The movie overall was very entertaining and found some bits funny and will watch it definitely again good repeat value. Thank you netflix keep em coming.",Bright

Budget-wise the money is well spent on cast, costume, props, filming and stunts. But the storyline goes thin. The movie is to much a blockbuster for being a good movie. The characters and what is being shown gives you a real appetizing feeling. However, the rush of saving the girl is prior on the essence of what the movie is all about: racial issues; equality treatment and so on. Therefore I was left with an unsatisfied feeling while watching further on. On the end of the movie I came to the conclusion that there are to many gaps in the story. Yes, some scenes do have thoughtful moments, but there is no time to explore. It seems to me the moviemaker was struggling making the movie a BigMac or a Beef Bourguignon.",Bright

The acting was good. The action was exciting. The special effects were excellent. The plot was interesting. This would have been a very good movie, but it was marred by bad language and brief nudity (which brings my rating down from an 8 to a 4). It is totally unnecessary to include bad language and nudity in a movie in order to set the tone, and they add nothing to the film. The tone of this dark world could just as easily been set without all the bad language and nudity if the film-makers were sufficiently talented. (See the original ""Blade Runner"" as an example.) If you can overlook these faults, the movie is actually quite good. The Orcs are humorously fun, and remind me somewhat of ""Alien Nation.""",Bright

It not only exemplifies buddy cop but it also introduces a tension between three different groups of people today. This movie perfectly portrays the tension between the different chromosome of people in the United States today and Smith's role clearly revives the message most people didn't catch while watching the movie.

I have always said if you want to watch a good movie find one that the critics love. However if you really really want a good movie find one that the critics categorically hate.Not sure why this is, maybe they spend so much time with stuck up technical jargon and filmography and other crap that they just forget how to simply enjoy something.I find it odd too that people miss the great irony of the black cop, who only a short time ago would have been treated like the orcs in this movie. Being the accepted with the outcast partner. Not very many years ago what you saw with the orcs was exactly what a black man would have faced in the USA.Imagine the first black cops that got onto the then all male, all the same size color high and weight police forces and what that poor individual had to face.

Yes, you have seen cop-movies before, probably more then needed, but Bright is different.
The Cast is great, the environment fits, the story is intriguing and the details make it interesting enough to watch it twice.
Maybe the tempo is a bit to fast sometimes and less shootouts would have been enough, but nevertheless this movie brings something new to the table.I would have loved to have more details on the whole backstory, I think it was a bit to vague, and it took to long to get a least some understanding of the environment.All in all, I liked it and Netflix shows it can compete with the ""big boy movies"" in Hollywood. I really hope to see some form of spin-off or sequel, the setting was just too good to be wasted.ps: there take on ""race"" and differences, racial-profiling and the problems was something that gave this movie a nice touch.

The Musem.",9,25 December 2017,"The exciting part for me was watching ""Will Smith"" usher in a new franchise with unlimited potential. The movie also showed a dark parallel between the world we currently live in and one where even in fantasy racism still exist.The movie begged sci-if movie lovers/conspiracy theorist on what was the message behind the movie. As we all know Will Smith picks his projects very carefully to convey a message. He does the same for ""Bright"", picking a role of a policer who does the right thing no matter what. This was a small message to remind the viewer that there are some good cops, who have to eat sh** from their superiors just like we do at work. The officers hands are tied in most cases as they just want to take care of their family. The movie highlights that. This also shows what's police officers have to deal with just to survive an eight hour shift. The movie also shows Jakoby having to pick a side to appease his partner, yet deep down he knows it's wrong to beat his own kind or shoot a human. This is why he let the kid go. Now imagine what goes on behind the scenes when real police officers have to accept brutality as proper policing just too fit in? What's its called ""Blue Wall"", well ""Bright"" shows what it's like for a good police officer with bad management. It's no wonder people always get shot, piss poor management. With all the purging going on did we actually witness the death of the illuminati and Bright just hints at it? Hey 100 years is what the movie said, but wasn't Harvey Weinstein and cohorts kicked too the curb about 100 days ago ?? No one can deny that the Hollywood went through a massive change of guard that left very few untouched. So what hint did this movie give? Who are the new the Elves (oops I mean new leaders) of Hollywood? And are you an Orc?? Bright was super fun to watch as a movie! 
Last but not least the soundtrack is AMAZING!! First album I've been album to listen too from start to finish in a long time. Good job young bucks! Music with purpose. As I stated before, for a movie lover ""Bright"" is fun to pick apart and to guess what's going on behind the scenes in Hollywood. Nothing is made without purpose, when it involves $90,000,000!

So second movie would introduce us to the conflict, its origin- and story behind the persuit for the item (maintaining the strong suspense in the movie).

Smith is always entertaining even if the plot or writing fall flat, however, this did neither. Its uncomfortable because it touches on racism and so I'm dumbfounded at how the critics, usually left leaning aren't fawning over it. It paints the cops in a neutral light, doesn't go for or against showing the heroic and the acidic underbelly that follows the usual cop show, but it does it as good as any of the others.The fantasy element is novel, intriguing, world building. More questions are raised about the classes/races than answered leaving you wanting to know more about them. The movie ends yet leaves all kinds of room for a sequel or spin-off series.I watched Last Jedi, apprehensive after the last one and felt so let down... this show, had everything that the Last Jedi did, less budget, less of a 'history' to build-upon and it did it right. Where Last Jedi had me bum'd for the end of 2017, Bright got me excited. Was it perfect, no, but it left me wanting more.Whatever these 'critics' are coming from they are out-of-touch with what makes a good movie... what moves a crowd and gives the inner kid (for a fantasy/Sifi should) what it wants.

915,jen-56260,Brilliant!,9,26 December 2017,"I don't ever write reviews, but wanted to add my two cents to the pile. The overall message of the film and how it hits you at your core and makes you think and ponder the role that our ""past"" (within a species, group, etc) has had on us before we ""wake up"" to the power we hold as individuals, may be ""hidden"" from those that are more ""concerned"" with other aspects of the film, and for this it serves a greater purpose than many still have yet to understand. What I found most beautiful is how it left certain things ""unanswered"" and yet still holds what is needed for the viewer to actually use their mind and put the pieces together. Entertainment is great and everything, however the movie is about ""magic"", and therefore without understanding that ""magic"" you really won't be able to ""get it"" because you are still too ""programmed"" to imagine that ""magic"" doesn't exist, or that it will somehow solve all of your problems or that somebody else is going to save you. I am a big fan of looking at the ""timeline"" aspect of a film, and revisiting each of those moments leading up to those that come after. The behind the scenes look at the man weilding the sword and being a part of the Shield of Light is telling and Jakoby ""listening"" but not really ""hearing"" what the man said, because the magic hadn't fully ""come in"" yet, is KEY to the rest of the movie.

Loved this from the opening credits to the end, it has a good idea that gives an alternate earth type, its not thrown in your face asking to be heard and excepted, rather your thrown into the deep end straight away no back story no nothing, it's there orcs elf's and others and humans so deal with it.
The story is simple and compelling and keep you wanting our cops to go further, and the more they do you begin to attach your self to them
The acting is brilliant by all players. 
The action is raw gritty and brutal and not to far fetched, no boring bits every time a gun went off I wanted even more blood. 
The special effects are amazing and subtly used
The musical score adds a real sense of humanity and realism. 
I really wanted to see this in the cinema and would have loved to see the 18 rating once again on an action movie.

for any non-critic, if you're already paying for Netflix..... then WTF, watch this, it isn't Lethal Weapon, but let's be honest, what is? It isn't LOTR, but again, what is? It isn't the best movie ever...... but again, that is down to each of us (Platoon before you ask, mostly for the Score and Dafoe...); what I will say is that this is a solid movie, and if it is the start of a franchise, then it's still better than DC's efforts (pre Wonder Woman OFC)......",Bright

First let me say this to the critics and users that gave this movie a bad rating.... You are entitled to your own opinion, that's what makes America great, but if you gave ""Bright"", a bad rating then ""you don't know JACK"". This movie was thoroughly enjoyable from the beginning to the end. I'm not even a huge sci-fi kinda guy, but this movie was done VERY WELL! Bright was kind of like a Training Day, Skyrim, and Grand Theft Auto combination that intermingled comedy and action into an unbelievably entertaining storyline, that had quality acting throughout! I can't BELIEVE they got Will Smith to do this movie, but man was he good. Will Smith is kind of like the Michael Jordan of acting.... ""he just makes everyone else around him better"". I'm just a simpleton from the mid west but this is in the top 5 most entertaining movies I've watched in the last 10 years. This isn't a first date kind of movie, but my wife enjoyed it as well (which really sold me on writing this short review).

This movie was great all around and I would have loved it had I payed to watch it in a theater.

933,paulleach-09979,A mish-mash of ideas.,2,30 December 2017,"So people like dumb movies. This director KNOWS this. Heck, he's written, directed, and produced some of the worst examples of in film history. His get outs are Training Day and Fury, both gems of film making that act as balance against the likes of Suicide Squad and The Fast And The Furious. This film tips the balance though and not in a good way. One dimensional characters. Too many genres/tropes crammed into the screenplay, no consistency within the action scenes, weakly explored themes, below par cinematography, and an overall impression that the director was filming by numbers. It could/should of been so much better. The idea to mix a buddy/cop movie with an undertone of racial tension all set to a backdrop of a modern world/high fantasy setting. I can see why this idea got a green light from the producers. It has all the requirements to make an outstanding movie. All except one. The script. Maybe less time making CGI sequences and painting people as orcs, and more time on making sure the script is up to standard, would of allowed this to become the film it ought to have been. It's not the worst film of 2017 (that accolade belongs to the Emoji Movie) but it's still a great big Christmas turkey that I find hard to award more than two stars. It'll appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience and as such will probably have great success with the masses. So as a business commodity it's great, as a film it sucks.",Bright

The elves are the ruling elite, humans the majority, the orcs have never been forgiven for siding with the Dark Lord 2 millennia before - they face ongoing prejudice, racism and are treated as the dregs of society. Genius! I was so excited by the setting and where this story might go. What did they do with it? Two hours of repetitive, boring, clichéd car chases and fights. Zero development or exploration of the context. A waste of an opportunity, a waste of my time, so disappointing.",Bright
940,tshammer,Very good movie with so much potential,8,2 January 2018,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the all bad reviews. The critics got this so wrong.I found Bright to be a fascinating and compelling movie with a unique universe -- the world of magic, elves, orcs and other fantastic creatures live amongst us today in plain sight. Bright is an intriguing story that puts the viewer ""on the streets"" with the cops that ensures a gritty and realistic tale while presenting just the right amount of humor. It's like ""Alien Nation"", ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" all wrapped up and dropped into the modern world. The acting was excellent, the pacing was good and the story was compelling. I don't understand why the critics were so harsh on this movie. It's as if they had an agenda or something. I would love to see more of this universe. The potential of this universe is vast: What is rural America like in this universe? How does the government keep order between the races? Do dragons ever appear? If so, how do the nations respond to the threat? Do ""bad"" countries like North Korea use magic for their own uses? What are the magical creatures like in Japan, India, Russia, Africa, etc..? There are so many more stories to tell that this needs to be made into a series.

I'll admit the first 5 minutes you'll roll your eyes but once you get into the film it really starts to take off. The characters are very well laid out, the struggles of each characters really get you hooked and what they have to go through is portrayed well, albeit in a typical fashion. 'The return of the dark lord' was teased so much, yet it never happened.. which for how much it was teased I think left me a bit sour, but from a script stand-point I can see why, it would have tipped the movie overboard.

Fuck it, let's just set it in modern times in an alternate reality.""And then Imagine that you're the same guy who did End of Watch, so you have a lot of cop and gangster props just laying around left over from that anyways. So you're like ""Our main characters can be COPS, and one of them can be an ORC, and they can fight evil elves and other orcs who are GANGSTERS!!""Then imagine that you have to come up with some sort of premise to get all this conflict started... So you settle on a very thinly fleshed out story about a ""Dark Lord"" who attacked Russia or something 17 years after Jesus died. He was helped by the orcs, and contrary to all evidence otherwise, humans in this universe have the attention span required to remember that kind of shit in the present day and hold it against the Orcs. (Seriously, ask anyone on the street who the 4th president of the US was, or which countries supported France in the Napoleonic Wars.)Imagine all this shit.

Not a second of this film felt genuine and you always knew what was going to happen. And it was pretty annoying that the orcs obviously had lots a elements from black culture while the all white elves lived in their habitat at the centre of town controlling the world...

This movie is a creative masterpiece. It introduces and entire reality that is similar to our own so it is easy to relate to. With that being said everyone knows that when a new reality is created that the possibilities are unfathomably endless. Hats off to the creators of the movie and everyone involved for making something like this possible. I hope that there will be multiple sequels to a movie this interesting.

972,autumcook,very good,7,1 February 2018,"""Bright"" is a recently released movie, starring will smith, that focuses on aspects that have a much deeper and a much more powerful meaning than most movies. This is a well written movie with alot of thought, detail, and a great story line. In this movie, it focuses on racial injustice, division between races, teamwork, corruption, overcoming racial prejudice, and so much more. It's really satisfying watching a movie that shows the racial problems we have in today's society. Throughout the movie, it successfully related to the problems we have today.I think it was brave and incredibly insightful to create such a meaningful movie that relates to its audience. For example, in the beginning of the movie, the two races fight, dislike each other, and they have their stereotypes, as we do in today's society. Today we have, blacks, whites, hispanics, and we have our stereotypes that correlate them. In the movie they have orcs, elves, fairies with stereotypes to correlate them as well. It shows corruption and injustice towards an individual's race, as we do today with police brutality towards colored individuals. It shows many dilimas we have today with race and inequality. But despite all the painful reality, it also shows the fight towards racial justice and equality. I really enjoyed watching the two main characters come together despite their differences and even become good friends despite it not being the societal ""norm"". The movie has many different races all living against one another. But by the end of the movie, all the different races come together to fight for the greater good. It gives a hopeful ending not only for the movie but for society today. Not only does this movie tackle the injustices we have, but we get a heart touching, powerful ending that almost feels personal.",Bright

The prophecy that is repeated though out the movie coming to nothing as it's not the character they say, but Will freaking smith who has to save the day. Will Smith doesn't need to be the hero everytime. The sad part was it had good roots. instead it didn't advantage of any possible interesting story path for a recycled script that had gangs, race issues, clubs and such.

The game was an rpg from the late 80's through the 90's it is similar to CYBERPUNK another game from the same time, but Shadowrun includes magic and orcs, trolls, elves, etc. With the context being that the movie takes place in a sightly future world where elves, orcs, trolls, and magic exist this movie explores racial/species bias very well. It has great action scenes, dynamic interplay between cultures, it is well written and the dialogue fits the setting perfectly. This has become one of my go to movies for those moments I want something playing in the background. I'll be honest I would have given it a 9 but the critics torched it because of their lack of knowledge/ lack of appreciation for the lore of the material. Check it out, and you will find it is a really great movie.P.S. CYBERPUNK 2077 comes out this fall, this is a perfect prep movie for that highly anticipated game.",Bright

984,waynedadof,"Promising, but ultimately mediocre",5,13 October 2018,"My first review on IMDB and not to be my last.I had to write a review on this movie just because of the sheer amount of inaccurate user scores ( 10 / 10 ?? ) and woefully inadequate critic reviews. Bright was a movie that had me intrigued from the concept sold to us. Fantasy buddy cop movie, and for once, not made for kids. This pulled me in as the concept reminded me of a cult favourite for many, "" Alien Nation"". Clearly Bright took some inspiration from this which is no bad thing as the idea for Alien Nation was quite unique in its time and to my recollection hasn't been anything quite like it since. Where Alien Nation itself wasn't quite as good as it could of been, a modern take on it was very appealing. Sadly, Bright failed to set the bar higher and falls flat from the 2nd act. That's not to say it didn't have its positives, clearly something the critics failed to acknowledge.From the outset it is clear that movie didn't want to weigh itself down with the whole mythos of the Orc / Elf / Human coexistence back story and to its merit in the first half an hour, that worked in the movies favour and gave a grounded realistic setting in a fantasy world where the racial tensions between humans and orcs for example were at the forefront of the plot. This was well executed to begin with and you genuinely feel for Nick ( Joel Edgerton ) as he's trying to fit into his new environment as a police officer. Unfortunately, David Ayer of Suicide Squad fame *cough cough* badly changes direction of that part of the plot by overloading the fantasy element of the story, firmly placing the drama aspect in the background. Problem is, that wouldn't of been such a terrible thing if the fantasy elements weren't so, what I feel, rushed into story. You've seen the plot before in many fantasy films, bad guy, sorry bad lady in this case ( played by the excellent Noomi Rapace) has an evil scheme and will destroy millions of people yada yada. Not a problem with that, but the way it's executed feels massively rushed and without the backstory to solidify the mythos, it becomes somewhat of a wasted opportunity. Which is a shame as this detracts from the genuine moments of a potentially good movie. The buddy cop relationship between Will Smith & Joel Edgerton is solid, very believable and helps carry the movie forward and the wonder of the fantasy world they live in keeps you intrigued. The action is also solid, with both a gritty and fantasy element that actually work well together in this case and does keep you invested in the movie. But sadly with the rushed plot and to be honest, quite pre teen World of Warcraft terminology used in dialogue at times, it ultimately becomes a forgetful movie that struggles to identify what it wants to be. Bright would of been better as a Netflix episodic series to give the characters and the fantasy environment time to flourish and truly establish a genuinely fresh take of the world it so desperately needed to explore. Pros:
Intriguing and somewhat unique concept
Great performances from Rapace and Edgerton 
Larger than life Will Smith at it again !Cons:
Larger than life Will Smith at it again!!!
Rushed incoherent plot

987,cossierhood,Are the critics even real people?? Epic film!!!!!!!,10,7 November 2018,Are the general public and film critics a different breed? They must be as this film is amazing! It is such a great story which genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat and still gives a grown man goose bumps when he watches it! Critics do one and stop the Netflix bashing!!!!!!,Bright
988,pathumtj,Quite Simply a Masterpiece,10,13 November 2018,A day will come when move fans and critics alike will applaud Bright as one of the masterpieces of modern cinema. Similar to the way Scott Fitzgerald thought The Great Gatsby was a failure in his death bed; the world as we know it is too primitive to understand the concept and beauty of this film. The story told in between the lines is compelling and very much relevant in modern times. The metaphors used makes watching the film more like a studying of a biblical language than gazing at a piece of visual effect. David Ayer has certainly redeemed himself of the gauchely creation named Suicide Squad through this venture. Let's hope Bright receives the true respect it deserves sooner rather than later.,Bright
989,grantpowell-20162,Terrible muddle,2,8 December 2018,"As a WS fan I expected more from this offering. The narrative was very busy with characters appearing with no context. For a film with so much action and fantasy elements, the first half hour was a massive drag. The racial subtext was so in your face that I would be surprised if a 4 year old didn't get it. Nothing clever or complex about this film. It was a cringe fest app of the way through. All of that said, i would usually have turned a film off for being so poor but I did watch until the end- there must have been something about the plot which kept me engaged.",Bright
990,drmoise,Such a waste of time,1,11 October 2019,I wanted to like this film. Sat to the very end of what turned out to be a complete disappointment.,Bright
