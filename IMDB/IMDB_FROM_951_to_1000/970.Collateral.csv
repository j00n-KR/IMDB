0,Leofwine_draca,A thriller with style to spare,9,18 April 2016,"Michael Mann, famous in Hollywood circles for his '90s crime thriller HEAT – a film I found distinctly average – comes back for a second go with COLLATERAL, a film which received publicity thanks to Tom Cruise's atypical performance as the bad guy. COLLATERAL is one of those films it's best not to say too much about; suffice that it takes place over the course of one night and that the city backdrop is a major character in its own right. Many scenes are simple two-handers between Cruise and good guy Jamie Foxx, who finds himself battling with his conscience as he converses with the cold assassin.Cruise has been in many enjoyable films over the years (with the notable exception of WAR OF THE WORLDS, where he was given a dull and derivative, utterly bland character by Spielberg) and this is another one to add to that list. As the grey-haired, immaculate killer, you can tell he relishes the role, and he's really good in it too. Cruise is matched by newcomer Foxx, who holds his own, making his taxi driver a guy you respect and care about. Supporting cast members are pretty decent, including Jada Pinkett Smith, who I used to dislike, and Mark Ruffalo, exceptional as a sympathetic cop on the trail.Mann breaks the building suspense up with some excellent set-pieces, with the massive shoot-out in the nightclub being a notable highlight. The film is actually at its most effective in the smaller, more original moments, like the opening body-on-the-cab shocker, the police intervention and the bag steal. The script is witty and relevant and nicely cyclical come the last image. There are also some humorous moments to engage the attention, like when Foxx asks for help and ends up getting mugged! That's America for you Things become pretty clichéd and predictable for the routine ending, which becomes one of those psycho-thriller things in which a killer stalks his victim in an empty building. For its type, though, it's still strong and decent music adds to the suspense. I could have done without yet ANOTHER scene on a train but Mann handles the camera well and makes the premise seem fresh and real, despite its hackneyed history. COLLATERAL is an action flick with a brain and a film wholeheartedly recommended.",Collateral
1,SnoopyStyle,great performances in Michael Mann thriller,7,23 July 2015,"L.A. cabbie Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) has a conversation with his fare U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). He wants to start a fun limo service and she's concerned that she's unprepared for her case. They strike up a connection. His next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruise) who hires him for $600 and an extra $100 to get him to the airport after making five stops. At the first stop, Vincent throws a man off the roof onto the cab. He kidnaps Max making him drive. LAPD detective Ray Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) finds the crime scene of his CI and starts putting the pieces together.Director Michael Mann creates a stripped down thriller. Both Foxx and Cruise excel. Cruise is especially great as a cold-hearted killer. I do have questions about the movie. Why does Vincent need a cab? Why wouldn't he just kill Max and stuff him in the trunk? Why doesn't Max escape when he gets the chance? These and other questions are better off left behind. I choose to believe that Vincent kept Max for more than his GPS abilities. I choose to believe that Vincent is lonely and finds Max to be a fun plaything. It's better to simply enjoy this slick Michael Mann production.",Collateral
2,Horst_In_Translation,"2 hours edge-of-seat, great thrill ride",8,29 December 2014,"""Collateral"" is a film that came out 10 years ago and is a definite contender for Tom Cruise's finest career performance (Vincent). It is basically a two-man show, similar to ""Training Day"", with the White guy being the bad guy however. Strangely enough, Jamie Foxx got the Academy Award nomination though, and what is even more strange is that it was in the supporting category. Foxx' Max was everything but supporting here. Without him, no movie. It is about a contract killer who forces a taxi driver to lead him through Los Angeles, so he can kill those five people he is supposed to kill.This movie has only one real weakness. They wanted to go for a happy ending so bad that they just sacrificed all credibility for it. Max, a man who never held a gun in his hand, managed to kill a professional contract killer at the top of his game (what police officers and heavily armed bodyguards did not manage) while, at the same time, he has to make sure his future girlfriend won't get killed. And as if that was not enough already, he manages to take out a cop some minutes before. There are some other minor criticisms. For example, it feels too much of a coincidence how Ruffalo's character Fanning appears first at the crime scene early on and later stands in the elevator with Vincent and Max. Another one would be that Max' love interest does appear of course on Vincent's list. It's not really credible, but it's acceptable for the fun of the film and definitely not as bad as they screwed up with the ending. If they really wanted to go out on a high note they should have just finished without Vincent killing Max or they could have left the ending open. The real Max is the one who tries to throw something through the glass without success, clueless and inexperienced.This movie has more than a handful truly tense and great scenes and references. One would be the Asian club scene with a great song playing there. Another would be the talk with Felix, although Max almost was a bit too much of a hero for me there. Then there is also the scene where those thugs try to get away with Vincent's suitcase, the subway reference, or the two cops who almost open the trunk. Very tense scene and I really wished they would just go away. In retrospective you also have to say that this movie has a brilliant cast. Foxx (actually that same year) and Bardem are Academy Award winners by now. Ruffalo looks likely to score his second nomination this year and Tom Cruise...well he already was a big star back then and still is today. Jada Pinkett is okay, but does not really have much to work with. Director Michael Mann worked with her husband on his previous project and got him a lead actor Oscar nomination.I liked a lot how things kept going wrong in this movie from one second to the next. There were so many game-changing moments, such as the corpse who fell on the car, the flight at the hospital, Max' car crash idea, Fanning's murder and many more. Fanning's murder by the way was one of the highlights. You actually never knew, but hoped that he could save Max as he was the only one who realized what was going on. But nope, not with a guy like Vincent. Also, the relationship between Max and Vincent was interesting. It seems he lets Max live after the car crash although he killed his driver in the past and said earlier that people he works with should not see him. Apart from that, he helps Max many times in the film. He defends him when he talks to his boss. He kills somebody right before they can kill Max. He gets him back his purse. He tells him to call Pinkett's character etc. There seems to be some kind of connection, at least from Vincent's side.This was already the third time or so I watched this movie written by Stuart Beattie and it is something that truly stays in the mind, much more than his work on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". It's all the small components going together and one I did not mention already is probably that it plays pretty much in real time almost. We go through the night through various settings with Vincent and Max, settings that fit the whole atmosphere nicely. And what a journey it is. Highly recommended.",Collateral
3,Prismark10,Collateral,6,31 December 2020,"Tom Cruise is Vincent the bad guy in Michael Mann's neo noirish Collateral.With his steel grey hair and steely determination. Vincent is a contract killer who accepts a briefcase in a fleeting cameo by Jason Statham.It contains details of five hits that Vincent has to carry out in one night in Los Angeles.Vincent gets in a cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx) and he gets his one slice of luck.As the audience gathers from his earlier fare, prosecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith.) Max knows his way around the city. Vincent needs someone like Max in a night like tonight where time is of the essence. He offers Max $600 for the night claiming that he is here for a real estate deal.In the first stop a body lands on the roof of his cab. Max soon realises that his passenger was the cause of the death. If he wants to stay alive, Max needs to go where Vincent wants to where he can carry out his hits.However the police soon realise that something is amiss as the bodies pile up in the morgue.Cruise shines as the charming but chilling sociopath Vincent. There is stone cold scene in a jazz club, where you think Vincent has taken Max to relax and take his mind off what is happening.Foxx manages to keep up with Cruise. The everyman who takes pride in his job and has a dream for a better life. His own limousine company.Mann does have flaws with the story and they just cannot be covered up. Vincent is supposed to be a smooth efficient and invisible hitman. His clients do not know who Vincent is. Several of the hits happen in public places such as a crowded club with too much collateral damage caused by Vincent.I did think it was neat how Annie gets dragged into the story later on. Leading to an over the top showdown between Max and Vincent.",Collateral
4,claudio_carvalho,"Although Being Very Exaggerated, It is a Good Action Movie",7,2 April 2005,"In Los Angeles, the taxi driver Max (Jammie Foxx) is hired by a costumer, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who introduces himself as a Real State broker, to spend the night driving him to five different locations where his clients would be waiting for him. After the first trip, Max realizes that Vincent is indeed a hit-man. Along the night, the number of bodies in the morgue increases, and the police force and the FBI chase Vincent in the cab. ""Collateral"" is a good action movie, and one of the best with Tom Cruise. Jammie Foxx has a great performance as a support actor, in the role of a dreaming taxi driver. The problem with the story is very usual in these Hollywood blockbusters: the screenplay is very exaggerated and the viewer cannot think how plausible the situation is, otherwise he will not enjoy the film. For example, in one moment, there are police cars and helicopters chasing the taxi in LA streets. Suddenly, all this police apparatus vanishes, and the streets become desert. In the subway, there is a great shooting in the train. The conductor probably is deaf and cannot hear anything, since he never stops the train in a station or calls the police. Anyway, this movie is above the average of action films and is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Colateral"" (""Collateral"")",Collateral
5,jboothmillard,Collateral,8,12 March 2007,"I heard quite a lot about this film when it was at the cinemas, and it being directed by Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Heat) intrigued me. Basically cab driver Max (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jamie Foxx, the same year he won the Oscar for Ray) has lived a mundane life for 12 years in Los Angeles. He gets to know a fare really well, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) who gives him her card to contact, and soon after he gets another fare who is connected (well, he doesn't know that). Vincent (a great grey-haired and bearded Tom Cruise) is a contact-killer, and is on a mission to kill all involved with a federal grand jury, including key witnesses. He kills all these people in brutal ways, and Max is trying everything to get away or stop him, but not interfere himself. Vincent even forces him to be him to get his information about all his targets when his computer's destroyed. Of course, it is when Max finds out Annie is taking the case, and that she is his last victim that he plucks up the courage to stop Vincent. Also starring Windtalkers' Mark Ruffalo as Fanning, Peter Berg as Richard Weidner, Bruce McGill as Pedrosa, Irma P. Hall as Ida and Patch Adams' Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel. Filled with fantastic camera-work, editing, and a great car crash sequence, this film is one to watch! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing, and it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction. Tom Cruise was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Collateral
6,ccthemovieman-1,Another Michael Mann Winner,9,15 November 2005,"Nobody's perfect, but it's hard to go wrong with a Michael Mann-directed film, especially when it's a crime movie.Although this isn't the quality of his 1995 ""Heat,"" it wasn't far behind in its ability to interest and entertain the viewer while providing some slick visuals.Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award. No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures. You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story. The intense film is definitely worth more than one look. Check out the behind-the-scenes documentary, too. You'll be glad you are not an actor in one of Mann's films.",Collateral
7,rmax304823,A Desert of the Mind,6,14 May 2006,"In this one, Tom Cruise is a hit man who's job is to wipe out five witnesses scheduled to testify against a drug lord, and then beat it. He's a real pro. He's a steel gray inside and out, from his hair to his suit and socks. He kills ruthlessly, with no regard for whether the victim deserves it or not. ""I do this for a living."" But he explains to the cab driver (Jamie Foxx) whom he has coerced into driving him around that he was abused as a child, so that explains everything.There are a couple of minor subplots. An LAPD detective (Mark Ruffalo) begins to twig to the fact that the people being murdered so quickly, one after another, seem to form a pattern among the drug community. It's the serial murderer routine. There is even a boss (Peter Berg) who refuses to believe Ruffalo and says, ""I'm tired. I'm going home."" Then there's the woman. Jada Pinkett Smith, looking and acting pretty good. Her main function in the film is to give Jamie Foxx somebody to get hysterical about saving. There is the expectable scene in which he calls her on a cell phone and warn her that Cruise is inside her building, looking for her. ""Max,"" she tells him, ""isn't it kind of late to be calling?"" And will his cell phone cutting out, Foxx stutters, ""Anna, Anna! Listen. You've go to listen to me! Anna?"" Tom Cruise is a killer made of ice except that he saves Foxx's rear end in a shoot out for no discernible reason. He seems to stalk through the movie like The Terminator on meth. Jamie Foxx isn't a seasoned actor but his very tentativeness, his awkwardness, contribute to the effectiveness of his performance as the pleasant unreflective dutiful son who is satisfied with keeping the cleanest cab in town.None of the other characters registers much except for one -- the city of Los Angeles at night. You know how they say, ""You're always loneliest in a crowd""? Well, you would never be lonely in L.A. because the streets are completely deserted. A few exceptions, true, such as when the plot requires a couple of street muggers. But, otherwise, we can be sure that if we happen to glimpse a pedestrian he is only walking a short distance, from one car to another probably. There is practically no traffic on the streets. The marmorial office buildings themselves are flourescently lit and morgue-like in their carpentered right-angled purity.The director, the photographer, and the art director have this urban desert in their grasp and it makes the entire movie better than an average action flick, although the skeleton of that primitive structure still shows through what we see on the screen.But -- well, take a scene like this. Cruise is forcing Foxx to drive him to another destination along an empty thoroughfare. They stop for a red light. There is no music or other sound. The cab rolls to a halt in slow motion. Neither of the two men speak. And then, out of nowhere, trotting across the city streets in front of the car, two coyotes with gleaming eyes go about their business while the two men follow them with their gaze. The animals seem certain of being ignored, and why not? Everybody ignores everything in L.A. It's brief but telling. Someone had to actually think about shooting that footage and editing it in.There is a final shootout on a ghostly subway train. The damsel in distress is saved.It's an ordinary action flick in its conception. No doubt about it. But its execution is more impressive than the original imitative script deserved.",Collateral
8,Tweekums,Tom Cruise plays against type in this solid thriller,8,4 December 2013,"Jamie Foxx plays Max; a Los Angeles cab driver who dreams of owning his own limousine company; he is fooling himself of course but that dream gets him through the nights as he drives various people around. Usually people just want to be taken somewhere and be dropped off but tonight is different; a man wants to be driven to five different locations before catching a morning flight. That man is Vincent, played by Tom Cruise. Vincent is a hired killer; very cool, very professional it's just a job to him. Max learns what Vincent does at the first stop off when a body crashes onto the roof of his cab; after that he is forced to take Vincent to his other stops and it is very clear that if he fails to do as instructed even more people will die.Going into this film I had little idea what to expect; all I knew about it was what was written on the box; it turns out it was a pretty good film. It was great seeing Tom Cruise playing against type as the sociopathic gun for hire; he made the character frightening yet strangely likable even though he was doing terrible things. Jamie Foxx also put in a solid performance as Max. The action was solid and there were quite a few tense scenes as well as some real surprises; I certainly wasn't expecting the police officer investigating the murders to get killed himself. If you like your humour dark there are quite a few good laughs to be had as well as some more poignant moments. There are some flaws of course; the finale is a little cliché and relies of one hell of a coincidence but that doesn't spoil the film. Director Michael Mann did a great job keeping the action tense and filming night time LA in a way that made the lights of the city and its constant traffic seem genuinely beautiful. If you are a fan of thrillers this is definitely worth checking out.",Collateral
9,ma-cortes,Thriller and action with two top-notch actors : Cruise and Foxx,7,20 November 2006,"The movie focuses on Max (Jamie Foxx), he is a cab driver from Los Angeles town . He makes his rounds at night dealing with various characters (Debi Mazar , Jada Pinkett Smith) in the car talking with them. Along the way, he dreams of have his own Limousinas company, though to his ill mummy (Imma P. Hall) tells her that he is already an owner . While Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a cruel killer with an engaging contract who offers a large sum of money to drive him through locations around L. A. Then, Max realizes he is a murderer who has been hired to kill a number of people . Events go wrong and Max becomes a hostage and he must find a way to rescue the last deadly objective. Meanwhile, Police Inspectors (Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg) are tracking down the nasty killer.The picture packs action, violence , drama , shootouts with exciting scenes. Casting is frankly excellent , the main protagonists give
first-class performances. Jamie Foxx (recently his Oscar for ¨Ray¨) as a hapless cab man is awesome similar to Tom Cruise as the relentless murderer , besides Jada Pinkett (Will Smith's wife) as obstinate prosecutor is magnificent and brief appearance by Javier Bardem . The film contains stimulating action set-pieces as the impressive gunplay developed in a tumultuous discotheque or the breathtaking final pursuit in the building and on the train . Atmospheric and moving musical score by the master James Newton Howard. Colorful and spectacular cinematography -although some dark due to be mainly shot by night- by two nice cameramen , Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron . The motion picture was well directed by the successful director Michael Mann (Red Dragon, Heat, Last Mohican , The insider) . The film will appeal to Tom Cruise devotees and action film enthusiasts .Rating : Better than average . Well worth watching.",Collateral
10,moonspinner55,Coyotes in Los Angeles,5,14 October 2007,"Uncontrolled action flick with no resemblance to reality. ""Collateral"", a noir-ish mixture of character study, police drama and suspense-thriller from Michael Mann, is completely wacko and out of control. You know you're in for it when L.A. cab-driver Jamie Foxx is introduced to us with the caveat that he wants to give it all up and retreat to an isolated tropical island (this is done by the musty cliché of having him continually looking at a postcard he has in the driver-side visor). Don't all cab-drivers long for the silence of an isolated island? The plot, with sociopathic assassin Tom Cruise taking Foxx for a ride, is equally clichéd, occasionally irrational and unlikely, and very often stupid. The picture doesn't particularly look good despite the two cinematographers credited (each equally fond of showy overhead shots of Los Angeles à la ""West Side Story""), nor does Stuart Beattie's script sound good. Beattie drops the ball during several big sequences, such as the elongated one in which Foxx visits his mother in the hospital (culminating with a chase on an overpass wherein Foxx does something with a briefcase that defies explanation--except that it leads us to the next irrational scene). As for Cruise: he gets shot, he gets up; he slips on glass, he gets up; he's involved in a car wreck, he crawls out. Some may argue this is just another method of acting. ** from ****",Collateral
11,dbdumonteil,Tom Cruise + Michael Mann = a tepid thriller,5,29 April 2006,"Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver in Los Angeles and works mainly at night. It's a nine to five work reversed as far as the time is concerned. A humdrum life which he dreams of escaping. One night, after he took a lovely black lawyer, he accepts the alluring offering of 600 dollars from a weird, cynical customer, Vincent (Tom Cruise) to go and stop at five different places where he has meetings. But during the first one, a corpse falls on Max's cab and reveals him the true nature of his customer. He's a serial killer and the taxi driver has no other choice than to obey him.Public made an ovation to this ""Collateral"" in September 2004 and users on this site seem to like this movie very much. I have mixed feelings about this thriller made Michael Mann who is certainly an American director to remember with works like ""Heat"" (1995) or ""the Insider"" (1999). It's true that it's suspenseful as one could wish and there are twists, a good dose of fighting, shooting sequences in store to keep the aficionados of the thriller happy. The backdrop, Los Angeles at night adds to the unsettling aura the film tries to convey. Besides the fans of the film would rejoice more if they could watch it all lights turned off. Mann is also certainly a technical virtuoso with prime camera work. So what could possibly go wrong?Well several drawbacks. First the choice of Tom Cruise. In spite of his commendable efforts to try to convince the audience that he can act a cast against type role (here a serial killer) with gray hair to show that he has grown up, it doesn't really work. Several actors had contemplated to do the same thing, that is to say to get out of their ordinary roles commonly attributed to them. Some have succeeded like Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club"" (1999) or Jeff Daniels in Clint Eastwood's ""Blood Work"" (2002) but other failed like Robin Williams in Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" (2002). Cruise definitely enters this second category. He's also almost totally bland but his partner Jamie Foxx is better than him. And the film goes unravel because of some sequences in the taxi. In these moments, Cruise explains to Foxx his motivations for his actions and what he learns from these lessons. In short, the scenarist inserted dialogs that were supposed to be ""deep"" and ""meaningful"" but I don't find them truly convincing. And some of his traits is exaggerated. As Max says: ""did you have to kill this cop who was married with children?"" And when the story starts to stagnate, Mann boosts the interest again with far-fetched tricks. It's better illustrated in the sequence when Foxx starts to speed up and they have a car crash. Cruise absconds to fulfill his last contract. Max, meanwhile discovers the identity of this last person and... I'd better stop here but I think the end of Max's nightmare smells the reheated and doesn't really redeem Mann's work. His film is also marred by unlikeliness.Does ""Collateral"" does the job it was made for? Yes but that's all. If you're not too demanding and if you have time to kill on an evening in front of the telly, this might be your cup of tea. Otherwise, pass by.",Collateral
12,blanche-2,film noir directed by Michael Mann,8,6 June 2011,"""Collateral"" is a very exciting noir starring Tom Cruise with either his new chin or his new nose, and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays an ambitious, likable cab driver, Max, who picks up a hit-man named Vincent (Cruise) as a fare. He and his taxi are taken hostage as the hit-man drives from place to place killing Federal witnesses for a drug lord named Felix (Javier Bardem).The film is loaded with action and suspense. Cruise is perfect in the role of the hit-man. I have never really ""bought"" his acting. It always seems very external to me. It works well for this role because the killer is a cold man who's just doing a job.Jamie Foxx isn't the world's greatest actor, but he holds his own as a cabdriver who refers to ""the sociopath in my backseat"" at one point.I went along with everything in the film until the very end. I don't understand why Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) didn't just stop the elevator between floors and sound the elevator alarm. Of course, if they had, we wouldn't have been treated to some very suspenseful moments, but I admit it bothered me.Otherwise an excellent film.",Collateral
13,Quinoa1984,"constantly re-watchable with entertaining storytelling, a good serious neo-noir",9,28 July 2006,"Michael Mann's skills as storyteller, stylist, and controller of mood and psychology of characters is in one of its finest forms in Collateral, a summer blockbuster that's with equal measure of excitement and thought, dark humor and tough moments of violence and suspense. It's also one of only a handful of times in Tom Cruise's career where taking a chance dramatically with a complex character pays off. It's a 100 million dollar+ grossing movie, but its story could just as well be one set in the noirs of the 40s and 50s- a cabbie with some aspirations for his own business (and for a girl he picks up at the start of the film) gets taken over by a hit-man who's doing his rounds of murders all in one night. There's also cops on the trail, as well as FBI, but it's really more than anything about these two guys and the very stark, expected but still compelling climax. After the set-up gets underway, the film is as much character study as a typical crime thriller, and it's one of those splendid examples of style matching substance, where both contain some unconventional bits in what could have been a lesser film.Along with a good script by Stuart Beattie, and Mann's perfectly nuanced digital night-time photography (more suitable and exacting for the mood than the recent Miami Vice), there's the acting. First, of course, are the stars with Cruise in a turn-around role as the antagonist, who spouts out little bits of Darwin and I-Ching, but for the most part is a stone-cold sociopath. Cruise, wonderfully uncharacteristic for what he usually does in his star vehicles, is more low-key, ominous, and at the end quite dangerous. Jamie Foxx, too, in his real deserved Oscar-nominated turn, is also unconventional here as a common guy who's put between a rock and a hard place. Maybe his best scene, or at least the one I would show as him being a much better actor than he sometimes gets credit for, is when he has to meet Felix (Javier Bardem) to get a new 'list' of people for Vincent. That and a few other scenes are both tense and with an undercurrent of cynical, harsh humor that helps balance out the dark nature of the events.Collateral is also pretty re-watchable for a fan of this kind of picture, with a great score/soundtrack, great locations, and a couple of interesting ending images.",Collateral
14,ComedyFan2010,An exciting thriller that doesn't always make sense,9,29 April 2018,"I definitely enjoyed this movie. It keeps you on the edge and doesn't make you want to stop watching. It's one problem is that it doesn't make sense. Besides the fact that hitman Vincent takes the same cab his last victim just took there is also the fact that Vincent seems to do everything that will make it hard for him to keep it low and stay anonymous. What hitman would kill a guy right in front of the cab driver? And then go riding with the same driver to the other murder destinations? One would think he would go, do his job, return to the cab quietly without making Max suspicious. Then get out and take another driver getting lost in this huge city. I can tell myself that this is because Vincent is an overconfident sociopath but he does it for a living, he should know better.Still, I can overlook this problem since otherwise the movie is really good. It is filmed in a pretty stylish way. I keeps one exciting. It has some amazing and creative scenes and ideas. And the acting is top level. I loved Tom Cruise as a villain. It is different from his typical role and he was great at it. Jamie Foxx was also showing us his amazing talent. The dynamic between the characters is great. Vincent has this cruel power that we can see Max is feeling. He is a villain that is different from the ones we know and while we never really get to know who he is he seems to have many character levels. Max on the other hand shows us how he feels under the pressure of this extraordinary client. Him not knowing what to do in this situation and how it leads to the actions towards the end of the movie.Really good job, I am sure glad I chose this movie to watch today. One of the better thrillers I have seen lately.",Collateral

He must find a way to save both himself and one last victim.It was directed by Michael Mann.Nightshift cab driver Max Durocher,Jamie Foxx in an Oscar nominated role, drives U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Annie Farrell,played excellently by Jada Pinkett Smith.She goes to her office to spend a night preparing for a pending federal grand jury drug indictment case convening the following day. Annie has an instant attraction to Max that makes her leave her business card as he drops her off her office building. Vincent,Tom Cruise in one of his best roles in his highly successful movie career,is a contract killer that hails the Max's cab next, explaining he is in town for one night closing a real estate deal.He bribes him with US$600 to chauffeur him to his five appointments. As Max waits at the first stop, Vincent enters an apartment complex and shoots Ramone Ayala and unexpectedly falls out of the window.The victim falls directly onto the cab, forcing Vincent to reveal himself as a killer to Max.He,then coerces him to hide the body in the trunk and continue with their arrangement through the night.Thus begins the adventure and unlikely relationship between Vincent and Max.This is one of the best crime thrillers I have ever seen.Stuart Beattie's screenplay is realistic and just far from being an ordinary thriller that was far from predictable from beginning to end. The characters are portrayed with honesty especially Vincent and Max.It is noteworthy that Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx has excellent chemistry.Also commendable is the superb direction of Michael Mann.Overall,the movie is highly recommended and deserves a 10/10 rating for people who not only loves crime thrillers but great movies as well.",Collateral

It's the postcard element, when Tom Cruise - or Jamis Fox - hands and watches the little postcard, showing the Pacific island. The impossible and ultimate dream of a life time. How not to think about THIEF, with James Caan handing a kind of photos patchwork of this whole past life, and showing it to Tuesday Weld, the girl whom he wants to live with. One picture means future, the other the past, I admit, but I could not prevent myself to think about this detail, me who has both features so many times. So many. That's all folks.",Collateral
19,hitchcockthelegend,Why? What are you going to do about it?,9,15 August 2010,"Collateral is directed by Michael Mann and stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. It's written by Stuart Beattie, scored by James Newton Howard and the cinematographer is Dion Beebe. It's set in Los Angeles, California and takes place on the night of January 24 to 25, 2004 from 6:30 PM to 5:40 AM.Max (Foxx) is in a job rut as a taxi driver, he constantly dreams of a better life. Tonight his life will change when he picks up the smartly attired Vincent (Cruise), who is in town for one night, an assassin with five stops to make.By the time of Collateral's release, Michael Mann had firmly established himself as a purveyor of slow burn intensity with the likes of Heat & The Insider. Collateral is no different. In what is essentially a two hander featuring two polar opposite characters sharing the same space, the film is like a tightly coiled spring just waiting to explode. Though the original casting for Vincent and Max was to be Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler respectively, the final casting turns out to be a master stroke. Pitting one of the biggest stars in the world against a young comedian turned actor makes the story ooze credibility. While simultaneously it provides the buddy buddy genre with one of its oddest, yet most rewarding, couplings. But as good as both actors are (Cruise trademarks as he lets Foxx thrive), this really is about its talented director.Shooting it on digital video (using the Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera to be exact), Mann instills a colourful noir essence to his shady story. Be it the LA skyline or shots of road crossing coyotes, the low light colouring effects cloak the story with a bleakly atmospheric sheen. Particularly in relation to Vincent, where he may be smart and well spoken, the utter professional in fact, but he is icy cold, and Mann & Beattie frame him just right. The writing, too, is smart. There is no need to enter into psychological realms of the Vincent make up, it's purposely left alone, why he does what he does is not known. He throws a curve ball statement or two, but do you believe him? Does Max? It's all as grey as Cruise's hair is for the film (looking like a chilly Richard Gere actually) and it makes for better rewards when the finale arrives.There's also the other things that have become Mann trademarks, that of his astute musical cues and action set piece constructions. Here he again does not disappoint with a night club gun battle sequence that's as consummate as it gets. He's also aware that the film has to get out of the cab, in spite of it metronomically working so well, at some point to drive the narrative forward. This is where the minor players play big parts! Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg's coppers, Bruce McGill's FBIer and Javier Bardem's gangster type, all serve to flesh the story and further the characterisation of assassin and chauffeur. There's a slight misstep in the finale with a coincidence that is not befitting such a meticulous director. But if we have learned one thing from Michael Mann, it's that he is not lazy, so an error of judgement is on this occasion easily forgiven.One of the best film's of 2004 from one of the modern eras finest auteur directors. 9/10",Collateral
20,Theo Robertson,Good Film Though The Michael Mann Flaw Strikes Again,7,27 February 2005,"As thrillers go COLLATERAL is outstanding for the most part . Michael Mann visual approach is beautiful , tense and very well paced . Tom Cruise , an actor who I've never been too keen on gives his best performance for many a year as Vince a ruthless hit-man but is overshadowed in the acting stakes by Jaime Foxx as Max the cab driver . The real star of the movie though is Stuart Beattie's screenplay because it's not very often major Hollywood studios produce something so well written that turns up the tension !!!! SPOILERS !!!! Throughout the movie it looks like Max is going to come to some serious harm "" Open the trunk sir "" "" Is all this necessary officer "" "" Just open the trunk "" Which will have the audience screaming OMG how's Max going to get out of that ? OMG they've taken Vincent's briefcase , OMG the cops think Max is Vincent , OMFG As I said this is a film that will have the audience biting their fingers . That is until the last act where the movie loses a lot of its momentum . I wouldn't say the ending sucked it's just that Vince trying to kill the only person who knows that Max isn't Vince is a rather average and anti climatic plot twist . I also couldn't help noticing that this is a problem with most if not all of Mann's movies . THE KEEP has a ridiculous and confused ending , LAST OF THE MOHICANS and HEAT are very anti climatic with the best bits taking place in the middle of the movie and I haven't mentioned the crap endings of every single Miami VICE episode . Like everything else Mann has made the best bits ( Like the aforementioned scenes and the nightclub shoot out ) happen before the end COLLATERAL still manages seven out of ten despite the slightly disappointing ending",Collateral
21,jotix100,Taxi driver,8,25 September 2004,"Los Angeles, a soulless city, is seen at its best through the eyes of director Michael Mann. For two hours we are asked to come along for the ride in a film that will surely please a lot of viewers, while others might think they've seen it already. The screen play has a quick pace and Mr. Mann uses the music intelligently to enhance parts of the film.The big asset for this movie is the pairing of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Both actors give performances that are amazing.Tom Cruise is the hired killer on his way to eliminate a few people throughout his night in L.A. Mr. Cruise is an actor that excels when he has good direction, as is the case in this one. Also, this actor, like Richard Gere, show their best when playing against type. As a romantic hero, Mr. Cruise can be bland, but as Vincent, the assassin, he is a force to reckon with.Jamie Foxx is excellent. He holds his own against Mr. Cruise and makes the picture his own, in many ways. This Max is a man that has ambitions but has, as yet, to realize them. His mind is in the Maldives resort where he would like to be, away from the stark realities of the daily grind of driving the streets and highways of the city of angels. The rest of the cast is equally good. Mark Ruffalo, as Fanning, makes an appearance that is completely different than his recent ones. This is an actor that always surprises. Amazing Jada Pinkett Smith is also good as the prosecutor who befriends Max at the beginning of the film. She is a lovely woman who projects an inner beauty that is rare to find in other young actresses. Finally, Irma P. Hall, as Ida, Max's sick mother makes the best of her short trip in front of the camera.One final note. It appears there is a trend among production designers to include chase sequences in the Los Angeles rapid transit system, as we have already seen in ""The Italian Job"", among others. Yet, for all the turmoil we see, the trains are immaculate and no there is no graffiti in sight. Hooray for L.A.!This is a film for action fans. It will reward the viewer in many ways.",Collateral
22,Hey_Sweden,Enlivened by on-target star performances.,7,1 January 2013,"Working from an intriguing screenplay by Stuart Beattie, producer / director Michael Mann offers up a crime thriller with a nice twist, with a dazzling array of Los Angeles locations and cityscapes serving as the backdrop, all of it very well shot by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron in a hi-def digital format. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man from out of town called in to eliminate a quintet of characters. He has easygoing cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) drive him around, and forces him to become an unwilling ""partner"" when things start going wrong. And this is where ""Collateral"" is the strongest, at portraying this antagonistic and yet compelling relationship. As we will see, Vincent is very cold blooded and ruthless when it comes to his trade, but at many turns he works at understanding his new acquaintance and trying to manipulate his life. Try as he might, Max has a very hard time breaking free from this sociopathic creep; they're pretty much bound together for a long and eventful night. This is also that refreshing variety of genre picture where the action supplements the story rather than the other way around. There are some pretty brutal and visceral scenes, but they never take over. The only time that the film ceases to be less than satisfying is when it turns conventional for its last act, turning Max into a hero all alone in his struggle with the bad guy. Still, it's worth noting that Max is not a hero from the beginning: his resolve has to grow as initially he feels impotent and useless. Vincent is also able to see through Max and realize that the cabbie's big dreams of starting up a limousine company may never come to fruition. After all, he may claim his taxi driving job is temporary, but he has been doing it for a dozen years...Foxx's performance is believable, and one is able to sympathize with him. The real surprise here is Cruise, who completely inhabits the role of the killer. You can actually forget you're watching a Cruise performance here; he's that good. The strong supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, Irma P. Hall, and Barry Shabaka Henley, with Javier Bardem contributing a riveting, memorable cameo as a crime lord and Jason Statham appearing fleetingly at the start of the story. In addition, Mann turns the city of L.A. into something of a character itself, taking full advantage of many of its locations. Overall, this is a good, solid diversion, one that really does keep one watching and interested to see how things will develop. It begins in a calm, deliberate fashion, but the tension is soon wound up and the story moves forward faster and faster. Well worth watching for fans of the stars and the director.

23,LeonLouisRicci,After the Suspension of Disbelief Kicks InIt's an Entertaining Ride,8,13 February 2015,"A Stylist, Director Michael Mann always Delivers Sleek, Sharp, and Colorful Vibrant Visuals. He seems Right at Home Working with Digital. Only about 20% of the Movie was Shot on Film.The Film-Noir World is often a Heightened Reality bordering on the Surreal and Expressionistic. In this Neo-Noir the Removed from Reality Ambiance is used as the Story is Virtually Unbelievable in any Sense of the Real World. Polished, Professional Hit-Men Simply do not go about Their Successful Sociopathy with this much Carelessness. But Without said Carelessness there wouldn't be a Story.At least Not This Story. So with Suspension of Disbelief Firmly in the Mind the Audience is Ready for the Michael Mann Painted Canvas of Smoggy Green and Glittering Nighttime Lights.

His Confidence is ""Scientologist"" Mandate and is Believable Hubris. The Fine Supporting Cast doesn't Do Much but are Noticeable when They are called to Add Plot Suspense.Overall it is another Exercise in Style from the Director and Decent and somewhat Engaging Performances from the Leads.

24,Boba_Fett1138,Michael Mann does it again.,8,5 February 2005,"Despite some flaws, especially in the story, ""Collateral"" is a thrilling and suspenseful movie with a great style and atmosphere.Perhaps most surprising thing about the movie is Tom Cruise. He is great as a bad guy and almost unrecognizable. Tom Cruise is one of those actors that you'll always recognize in a movie as being just Tom Cruise. At times throughout this movie I forgot I was watching Tom Cruise, I was watching Vincent! Jamie Foxx was also great, I was enthusiastic about this young actor ever since ""Any Given Sunday"" came out in 1999. I'm sure he'll win his well deserved Oscar some day. Perhaps this year? He is being nominated for both his role in this movie and for his leading role in ""Ray"". Looks like 2005 will be Jamie Foxx's year.The character development in the movie is great. We slowly get to know the 2 main characters and see Foxx his character slowly transform.Leave it to Michael Mann to keep this movie interesting to watch the whole time, even the scene's in which nothing happens. The movie is more a thriller than an action movie but when the few action sequences come, it truly jumps of the screen. The movie also features some of the most realistic executions since the ""Godfather"" movies.If you can look past the flaws of the story, you'll find ""Collateral"" a true treat.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Collateral
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,What is it with Mann and endings?,7,31 October 2004,"I saw this film tonight, at the theater. It started out pretty good, with some good dialog, some nice-looking cinematography, some good acting and some surprisingly good character development for a film directed by Michael Mann(who did Heat, which is probably the slowest moving action film that I have seen and didn't hate). Then it slowly degenerated into a typical pointless Hollywood action flick, and by the time the ending came, I was almost sure it couldn't really sink lower whilst still being so stylish... then the ending came, and it did. What is it with Mann and endings? Heat had a really anticlimactic ending as well. The film just lost any point, apart from its theme/morale, which I suppose is good enough. The plot is decent, but riddled with holes and clichés(the cop who just ""knows that something else is happening here..."", the stupidity of the FBI/cops) and is often poorly paced. There were also quite a few scenes that didn't seem to make any sense, but were there to show L.A. at night(which Mann seems to love) and take up time. The acting is good enough, with a few exceptions that were great... Cruise makes a great villain, Foxx a less great hero. The character are pretty much clichés and stereotypes. The villain had no redeeming qualities, but was just easy to hate. The film is stylish, and I kind of like how it(at least early on) dodges the usual ways of setting up major action scenes, and instead lets the viewer relax, sets up a scene that allows some for some nice comic relief and character development, and then let things go to hell suddenly. The humor is(apart from just surprising, considering that it's a Mann film) pretty good, natural, and not forced. Cruise and Foxx have a pretty good chemistry, and some good exchanges of dialog. Not much else to say... a fairly good film that could have been much better. I recommend it to fans of the actors and of Mann's directing style. 7/10",Collateral

I gave the movie high marks particularly because of the excellent acting on the part of Cruise and Foxx. I also thought it deserved high ratings for how the movie was done. The entire movie takes place in L.A. over the course of a day with two people being the crux of the movie. It is not easy relying so heavily on two characters to make the movie a success with little to no special effects and scene changes (ala ""Phonebooth""). The writing, directing, and acting had to be superb to make this movie work and make it bearable, and they were all excellent. The movie had a nice blend of suspense, action, and good dialog.

There was plenty of material for an interesting character study, but chronically inconsistent director Michael Mann instead goes the action movie route, which finds Foxx turning into superhero while Cruise tracks him down like the Terminator.Foxx received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this in the same year that saw him win the lead Oscar for ""Ray.""

I thought he could be considered deserving in both years. In this Michael Mann directed flick, Foxx puts in an excellent performance, and Cruise also does a fine job as the cold, business-like hit man. It's when Foxx's character discovers that his woman, an attorney with the Justice department(Jada Pinkett Smith), is one of Cruise's targets, he takes major steps in trying to save her and put an end to his troubles with Cruise, who isn't as lucky on the L train as he was in ""Risky Business"".",Collateral
29,ferguson-6,I Keep on Dancin',7,11 August 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Michael Mann became famous for his work on ""Miami Vice"" in the 80's and has had his ups (""The Insider"" ""Manhunter"" ""Thief"") and downs (""Heat"" ""Ali"") as a feature film director. ""Colateral"" is a mixed bag of both.  Casting usually good guy Tom Cruise as the souless hit man is what provides the initial interest in this film and Cruise does a fine job in this new territory.  Couldn't help but mentally write the script with this Vince as a grown-up Vince from ""The Color of Money"".  Of course, the playfulness has been replaced by ice water in the veins.  As with many movies these days, the script comes up short and prevents this from being what it hinted at being.  The best scene is the taxi cab banter between Jamie Foxx and Mrs. Will Smith.  You sense that they could really help each other learn to live life.  Foxx does an admirable job as the whipped, day-dreaming, somewhat scared of life part-time for 12 years cab driver.  He has the gift of gab for the fares and really risks nothing in his everyday life.  Everything changes one night when he accepts Cruise as a passenger and accidently discovers (with a bang) the mission this real estate professional is really on.  The most absurd scene is the nightclub scene where guns are blaring, fights are everywhere and the dancers keep dancing.  What kind of capture and rescue plan was this anyway?  Was it possible to put any more civilians at risk?  Anyway, the screenplay is way too loose and is just plain awful towards the end.  Despite the flaws, it is a very watchable film and interesting because of the Cruise character.",Collateral

Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who hopes to start his own limousine service someday but for twelve years he has delighted in serving his passengers until he picks up Cruise. Upon the first stop a body crashes upon his cab thus placing Foxx in a tragic position. He is forced by Cruise to drive him to his other targets. Clever with witty dialogue and a suspenseful cat and mouse conclusion. Director Michael Mann uses the same technique he used in The Insider. He shoots it like a reality T.V. documentary. Cruise is fantastic as a killer skilled at what he does and views it merely as a job. Foxx demonstrates a heart that bleeds and places himself in crucial danger for the final target. Jada Pinkett has a key role as an attorney whom strikes up a positive encounter in his cab in the opening. Mark Ruffalo as an investigating officer is effective as he attempts to bring Foxx to safety but the handling of this character is too abrupt and perhaps unnecessary. Irma P. Hall plays Foxx's mother who is in the hospital. He visits her and the affects Cruise's reaction. Strong theme regarding the taking of life and the timing of death. Score: 10 / 10",Collateral

The faces have come and gone from his rear- view mirror, people and places he's long since forgotten.....until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When a trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to kill the key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this night that Vincent has arrived, and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral. Through the night, Vincent forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined........Just lately, Mann has fallen off track with his directing, and when you compare the likes of Miami Vice and Public Enemies to this, Heat, and The Insider, it's quite frustrating when you know that the man is a veritable genius.Even though the film is set in the dead of the night, Los Angeles has never looked more alive in a movie. Manns L.A is reminds on of the first Terminator movie, raw, dirty, and dangerous. Yes the song said 'I love L.A', but the song wouldn't have been that good if it elaborated 'just not these parts'.The relationship between Vincent and Max is fundamental to the films progression, and it is one strange relationship. In some parts, the narrative really leads you to believe that Max will survive the night, and there are times when you think to yourself, 'just go with it Max, Vincent's quite reasonable'.And this is why Vincent is so dangerous, Cruise portrays him as a reasonable person, almost a friend to Max, when stereotypical plot narrative would just tell you that Max wouldn't survive. This is why Collateral is so innovative, you care for both hero and villain.Cruise is wonderful, and it's one of his best roles, and what Mann does with Vincent's apparel is another genius stroke, as his plan begins to fall apart and Vincent begins to lose it, his clothes become more frayed and damaged, just like his psyche.The final third of the movie is tense on the verge of uneasy watching, you feel just as helpless and desperate as Max, when he sees Vincent on the floor below his next intended victim.As the sun rises on a steam-punksesque L.A, a story told by one of the characters comes into to its own, a perfect ending to a great thriller.",Collateral
32,mm-39,Miami Vice meets Tom Cruse via Hitchcock,7,8 August 2004,"The story is very strong, and has the Michael Mann ""You belong to the city"" feel for it.  Tom Cruse is the lesser of two lead actors in order to fit the role of Vincent.  Tom, if I can call him that like I really know him, is a high mileage actor.  Tom is good at his trade, but after using up similar characters over the years needed to re-invent the Tom Cruse persona.  Maybe, next movie one might see an even darker Tom; (AKA a Nazi in a war movie, or as a evil spirit in a haunted house)only Tom will know.  ""Collateral"" has a Miami Vice or Heat feel that mixes a Alf Hichcock story with plot twists to it.  A great date movie, when I was 17 or 21 and dating say my wife, as the girl friend of course, this movie would be great.  Too be fair I need to watch this movie another time to give it a accurate rating, but I would tell everyone to go see it at the Drive In or Theater before Collateral is ready for on demand or DVD rental.  7 or 8 out of 10.

Years ago, someone suggested ""Collateral"" to me on the basis of Tom Cruise's performance (""You really believe he's a hit-man""), and they were absolutely right. Cruise is operating on a whole different level here. He can go from preachy a**hole to nightmarish assassin with the flip of a switch. The precision in his weapons-handling is fascinating, and when the character is in his zone, there's simply no disrespecting his tradecraft. Whatever your feelings on his personal life, they just melt away while you're watching this. And I still think this is his best performance.But ""Collateral"" doesn't stop there, because Jamie Foxx more than holds his own. Both men bring added dimension to their characters, and they make simple conversation scenes riveting. Pretty much everyone in the supporting cast is bringing their A-game, and it's a fully rounded Mann movie; it looks good, the shootouts are explosive, and it's just an all-around stellar movie from start to finish.9/10",Collateral

As this will involve him making five different stops, he asks Max to be his personal chauffeur for the evening. (The action all takes place on a single night, between 6:30 PM to 5:40 AM according to the director Michael Mann). Although this is against regulations, Max reluctantly agrees when Vincent offers to pay him double his normal nightly profit.The first stop is at a tenement building, and while Max is waiting outside a body falls onto his cab from an upstairs window. He realises that Vincent has shot the man, but he is unable to escape and is forced to help Vincent hide the body in the trunk. It transpires that Vincent is a hit-man, and that his real reason for being in the city is to murder five people who are potential witnesses in, or otherwise connected with, a prosecution that the Justice Department are preparing against a local criminal gang. Max is forced to drive Vincent to his other destinations as he sets about eliminating his targets.""Collateral"" is a film about which I have mixed feelings. On the one hand there are many things about it that are very good. It is sometimes regarded as an example of neo-noir, the modern equivalent of the classic films noirs of the forties and fifties. I am not sure that I would agree with this description as it lacks many of the classic noir characteristics such as a complex storyline and a tone of cynicism and moral ambiguity. It is in many ways a straightforward story with a straightforward good-and-bad morality. Nevertheless it does share one characteristic with many noir and neo-noir films, a powerful sense of atmosphere conjured up by Mann's dramatic photography of the Los Angeles cityscapes, the night-time setting and a colour scheme dominated by dark blues, greys and whites.The acting is also good. Jamie Foxx was nominated for a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar, even though the role of Max is really a leading one rather than a supporting one. This was presumably done so that Foxx could receive two Oscar nominations in one year; this was, of course, the year in which he won the ""Best Actor"" award for ""Ray"". The characterisation is deeper than in many thrillers; Mann said that the general theme of ""Collateral"" is the clash of ideals behind the two main characters. Max is that classic thriller character, the little man who accidentally, and through no fault of his own, suddenly finds himself at the centre of a crime drama. He is conservative, cautious and painstaking, disliking changes from his set routine. We learn that he has long cherished the idea of setting up his own limousine company but has never done anything about it because he believes that the idea needs careful planning and preparation. He is also a devoted son; a visit to his hospitalised, and rather demanding, mother, with Vincent in attendance, plays an important part in the plot.Vincent, by comparison, is proud of ""living in the moment"" and of his ability to adapt and improvise. He even taunts Max for his supposed lack of initiative. The irony is that it is the cautious planner Max who is forced to improvise and think quickly as he desperately tries to think of a way in which he can thwart Vincent's schemes. The film is notable for the fact that Tom Cruise plays a villain, something he rarely does; in most of his other roles he has played a sympathetic or heroic character. Although he makes Vincent a cool and stylish, if ruthless and sinister, villain he did not, unlike Foxx, receive an Oscar nomination. Cruise does not, in fact, seem to be a favourite of the Academy; he has in the course of his career received three nominations, but has never won, and some of his best performances (""Rain Man"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and the recent ""Valkyrie"") have been overlooked altogether. (Perhaps his support for Scientology is to blame). Despite the obvious differences between Max and Vincent, Foxx and Cruise are able to suggest that a curious rapport, verging on friendship, is growing between them, even though we are well aware that their relationship is bound to end with the death of one or the other. What I didn't like about the film was the way in which the plot seemed to stretch credibility well past its breaking-point. There was an over-reliance on coincidence; for example, Vincent's final target just happens to be the female lawyer who was Max's previous passenger before him. More importantly, I found it difficult to believe that a hit-man would go about his business in the way shown here. Vincent's cover story was rubbish; a businessman trying to put together a real estate deal would no doubt go to downtown offices in normal business hours, not at night to residential addresses in working-class neighbourhoods. Would a professional killer really be so careless to shoot his victim in such a way that he falls out of an open window? Would he really carry out a hit in a crowded nightclub teeming with potential witnesses? Would he really make his way around the city by taxi, thereby providing the police with another witness who could testify to his movements? And would he really pride himself on his carefree, improvisatory attitude to life? It strikes me that his is one profession where his every move needs to be meticulously planned if he, and those who hire him, are not to end up on Death Row. This was a film that was stylish, atmospheric, well-acted but at the end of the day none too credible. I suppose, though, the same thing could be said about some films noirs that are today regarded as classics. 6/10",Collateral
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,An exciting and high packed action thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat,10,22 May 2005,"What excellent performances! Why didn't Tom Cruise get nominated for an Oscar as well? I thought both him and Jamie did a remarkable job in ""Collateral"".This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Everyone told me that this was the movie to watch if I would rent, so I figured to give it a shot. The whole movie you just keep wondering what would happen next and how it would turn out in the end. It was kind of weird, because you feel like Tom was in some ways right as a hit man, but then you snap back into your senses and ""Wait! No! He's killing people!"". I'm very serious when I say that he is so in tune with his role. He was very convincing as well as Jamie. Jamie does well as a man who is on the edge of insanity. I felt like if I were in the same situation, I would've reacted the same way too. You eventually just loose it and do your best to keep it together doing things you never expected to do in your life.This was a very terrific movie, and I would highly recommend it for anybody.10/10",Collateral
36,=G=,One night in L.A.,8,15 December 2004,"In ""Collateral"", an icy contract killer (Cruise) hijacks a cabbie (Foxx) who he forces to drive him around L.A. while he makes his stops to take care of business. The film neatly knits a scant human story including a babe and some cops with action, drama, suspense, and intrigues into an engrossing if not spellbinding two hour tale. When all is said and done, this taut action/drama ties up all loose ends including the question: Why would a hit-man hire a cabbie to drive him around L.A. instead of renting a car thereby eliminating the hostage/witness problem? And, although ""Collateral"" doesn't break any new ground and does follow the Hollywood play-book to the letter, it is sufficiently intelligent, busy, unpredictable, and entertaining to be a worthwhile watch for anyone into cop/killer flix.

37,MovieAddict2016,Good and entertaining but heavily flawed - Mann's direction is the highlight,7,25 December 2004,"""I'm just Collateral."" Max (Jamie Foxx) has had a long run as a taxi cab driver in the less savory areas of Los Angeles for longer than he ever wanted or imagined. Almost oblivious to the amount of time he has dedicated to his job, Max has reached a state of denial  every passenger who enters his cab seems to receive a lecture on how it's ""just part-time"", serving as a means of cash until he is able to pursue his long-time dream job: Opening a limo service.Max's dreams come to a startling close on the fateful night that Vincent (Tom Cruise), a cool, calculating gray-haired assassin, enters his cab. Vincent is in town to kill five people, all in one night. Max is his personal driver. For $600, and held at gunpoint, Max is forced to carry Vincent from one destination to the next.""Collateral"" is a terribly unrealistic motion picture  but it is not terrible. In fact, it's quite good. Despite its flaws (and it has its fair share) it manages to maintain a hard edge and hold the audience's interest in the face of utter absurdity. Vincent, like the Rutger Hauer character from ""The Hitcher,"" seems to be some unattainable wise guy who knows everything that is going to happen, is happening, and has happened. The movie stretches its limits of believability when Vincent visits Max's ill mother in hospital. Also, when Vincent takes the time to wander into a jazz club and talk to his victim for a half hour before killing him  in front of Max. It's just a bit too silly for such an otherwise realistic picture, and this also leads one to question Max's motives  through all of this all he does is whine and try to run away a few times, but he never at any point attempts to truly stop Vincent -- until he finds out that the last victim happens to be the woman Max is falling in love with. (What a coincidence!) So, either Max is incredibly stupid or he's incredibly selfish and uncaring. I hope it's the former.Also, considering the fact that Vincent is a professional veteran hit-man, he doesn't seem too worried about leaving fingerprints, witnesses or other evidential materials behind. He's sloppy and careless. He enters a nightclub armed with a handgun and shoots a handful of men in a crowd of at least a hundred. One must wonder why, in eight years, Vincent has not been identified by police. There are video cameras that capture his presence, but we are led to believe no one has any idea who he is. Despite the fact that we are also led to believe that he's killed hundreds, if not thousands of people in his eight years as an assassin.Then there's the plot, which is ridiculous. I highly doubt a hit-man would use a taxi cab driver as Vincent does  even as collateral. It's beyond belief, and I am willing to give scenes in ""Commando"" benefit of the doubt.Then again I do think the film isn't supposed to be taken at face value. It is a bit of a moralistic tale told with metaphors and philosophical monologues. ""One day you wake up and it's gone,"" Vincent states in regards to life. ""Collateral"" is less about reality and more about appreciating life.In the end neither of the lead actors really manage to light up the screen. Cruise is cool and brutal but little else. His motivations are not clear and he comes across as being quite stupid rather than clever. Foxx is good but as I said above, his character's motivations are a bit dubious. He's a bit too willing to drive around being friends and talking to a hit-man all night. I find fault in the script  it's a nice idea but absurdly childish in execution. ""Collateral"" does not take place in an adult world  it takes place in a world where people perform acts in order to help along the script.The real showcase of this film is Michael Mann, who once again proves that he can take fairly obvious ideas and really make them exciting and even seem unique to a certain extent (also see the superior ""Heat"" from 1995). He captures the essence of a dark, grainy LA night perfectly with use of digital cameras and rear projections. Also, he proves here that he's capable of directing intense action  the climax of the movie is stupid and clichéd and runs itself into a wall (it's way too ambiguous for its own good as a thriller) but Mann handles it like an epic and all in all the audience walks away from ""Collateral"" thinking it's a lot better than it probably is.I liked this movie a lot, I purchased the DVD and I think multiple viewings will only improve it, but it is by no means Mann's best film and in comparison to ""Heat"" it seems quite poor. My review seems to be a heavy criticism  I am merely pointing out the things I disliked. Considering it runs two hours long, and these are my only major complaints, I think it's safe to say that ""Collateral"" has more plusses than minuses.",Collateral

39,KineticSeoul,My favorite Michael Mann film,9,13 August 2015,"I remember watching this for the first time at the theaters and thinking that it was a very entertaining and attention grabbing film. Watching it now, it's even better. This film is freaking suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish, and it's really entertertaining. The direction is quite fastpaced, but just about any moviegore can understand what is going on. The plot is about a hit-man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) that hires and then forces a cab driver played Jamie Foxx to go from hit location to hit location. The turmoil, havoc, interactions and discussions is not only enticing. It's intriguing, thought provoking and has depth. The discussions of fallen dreams, fears and negligence to pursue what they want to pursue. And the interaction about how people will usually stay close to their comfort zones to withold going through what they perceive as suffering and fears over seeking what they really want out of life. There is a lot of interesting existential discussion in these conversations that just about everyone has or will think about. But it's really impactful how it was discussed and shown in this film. Tom Cruise really hits the mark when it comes to playing this cold blooded, psychotic, mysterious and persistent hit-man. A character will not backdown on his mission and will see it through no matter what, unless he is dead. He is the villain of the story, but a very interesting villain overall. This is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys suspense and action. It's probably my favorite Michael Mann film.9.8/10",Collateral
40,sddavis63,A Pretty Decent Action-Suspense Thriller,7,4 March 2009,"Highlighted by great performance from Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, this is a movie that holds your attention and basically picks up steam as it goes along, leading to a pretty good last half hour as Cruise's Vincent stalks his last victim, and Foxx's Max stalks him in return. The plot was intriguing enough. Max is a cab driver who unwittingly picks up a hit man (Cruise) and is then forced to drive him from hit to hit all over Los Angeles, becoming more and more deeply involved against his will. I enjoyed seeing Cruise in this role. He was rather convincing as the cold as ice, professional hit man who cares not one iota about any of his victims (and he even got to do one of his famous ""Tom Cruise running frantically"" scenes!). I also enjoyed the fact that, while there's a lot of violence in this movie, there's also an interesting psychological study of both Max and Vincent: Max the frustrated cab driver who has big dreams, and Vincent as the philosophical and well-cultured sociopath. If there's a weakness to this movie, it revolves around the character of Annie, played by Jada Pinkett Smith. Annie was Max's last passenger before Vincent climbed in. She's also a prosecutor who just happens to be going after the man Vincent has been hired by, and turns out to be Vincent's last target. That was just way too much of a coincidence for this to be truly believable (and, for that matter, it was also very predictable) and while that last half hour involving the three main characters is very suspenseful, it also stretches credibility a bit, as Max gets such a clear view from the street (a fair distance away) of what's happening 14 and 16 floors above him. Annie was also not a particularly believable prosecutor. At the end of the movie (which was itself a bit anti-climactic) she simply leaves the train? She doesn't alert the train's driver about what's happened? She doesn't call the police? What kind of prosecutor is she? Stretches in credibility aside, though, this was a pretty decent couple of hours. 7/10",Collateral
41,Buddy-51,first rate thriller...up to a point,7,3 September 2005,"What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate? Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller ""Collateral,"" a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.""Collateral"" is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime - at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is. But for starters, writer Stuart Beattie has come up with a humdinger of a premise to get the ball rolling. Max has been driving a cab for twelve years now, but he still has dreams of owning a fancy limo company one day, then retiring to his own private little island getaway in the South Seas. One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever. Vincent is a paid assassin who virtually kidnaps Max, forcing him to drive him around town so he can track down and execute his assigned hits. Max can do little but look on helplessly as he gets pulled further and further into this cat-and-mouse game of cold-blooded murder.""Collateral"" is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills. As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter. Tom Cruise, cast against type as an unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired villain, is chilling as a steely-eyed killer seemingly cut off from even the most basic human emotions of empathy and concern for one's fellow man. Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in ""Heat,"" that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does. Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.Unfortunately, ""Collateral"" falls apart long about the last half hour, as the plot mechanics take over and the characters become pawns in the hands of an out-of-control screenwriter who obviously could find no workable way to bring his tale to a satisfying conclusion. The tension in the first three-quarters of the film derives from our knowledge that Vincent has, for all intents and purposes, caught Max in a snare from which he cannot escape. Thus, that cab becomes a crucial factor in the human drama taking place within its restrictive confines. But once Max and Vincent leave the cab and become separated in the closing stretches, we lose that sense of claustrophobic entrapment so essential to the tale, and most of the tension evaporates. Thus, what starts off as a severely circumscribed tale of two men caught in their own private little hell ultimately devolves into a damsel-in-distress, knight-in-shining-armor action fantasy that undercuts the realism and seriousness of all that came before.Still, taken as a whole, ""Collateral"" is a thriller well worth watching.",Collateral
42,thesar-2,Undamaged Collateral,9,23 December 2012,"It's amazing that, after eight years and the only other time I've seen Collateral, the main attention was on Jamie Foxx. And people didn't even know Tom Cruise was crazy back then!I take that back – I never bought the Tom Cruise crazy talk crazy talk. I couldn't care less what happens in his personal life. Sure I see a snippet of ""what goes on in his personal life,"" much like Mel Gibson's, but who knows the real story, but for those around him and himself. Nevertheless, the guy continues to amaze and entertain me.Here, he gave once of his best performances and quickest wit and the focus was on Foxx and while he was decent, nearly great, that is, he was overshadowed big time by both Cruise and the fantastically written character, Vincent, Cruise plays.Remembering back in 2004 when I first saw this, I really liked it, and sadly gave it very little thought until a 2012 Black Friday special presented me with the BluRay for only $5. Since I liked it a lot back then, why not? Five bucks and BluRay – my favorite combo.Well, I liked it tremendously more this time than last. I will admit, the ending, or climax, kinda weakened the project, but the overwhelming positives, shots, music, score, acting and dialogue made up for the last 10 minutes or so. And furthermore, the film's premise could've died out in a few moments of screen time, and yet, it continuously reinvented itself to freshness with each transition. I loved this movie.Big time dreamer and taxi driver Max is coerced into aiding Vincent's, a hit man, night of kills.Really, that's the premise, and as thin as it is, the movie is still wildly original and is pleasantly, methodically and completely slow, and yet, suspenseful from the get-go. And this is coming from someone that both steers away from slow fare and Michael Mann directed films.Mann's sooo slow for the most part. Here, is no exception. But, with the powerful performances, excellent interactions, smart lines and ongoing build-up, I would watch this over and over.Oh, and I loved Vincent's character, even as brutal as he is, as violent as he is and as unremorseful as he is. Cruise's portrayal was a breath of fresh air eight years ago and holds up today.Highly recommended.",Collateral
43,sol1218,Collateral Damage,8,7 August 2004,"****SPOILERS***** Early in the film ""Collateral"" Vincent, Tom Cruise, the hit-man with ice water in his veins for blood tells L.A cab driver Max, Jami Foxx,that in the city of L.A people are so detached and impersonal that he heard a story once about someone dying on a L.A transit train and nobody noticed he was dead until a day and a half later. Vincent didn't know it at the time about just how prophetic he was. Nail biting big city crime thriller about an out of town hit-man commandeering a cab as a getaway car with the reluctant driver going along for the ride. The hit-man makes his rounds in taking out a conglomerate of mob bosses crooked lawyers and government protected mob witnesses. As well as about a few dozen police mobsters and FBI agents in the process. Over-the-top and exciting but never boring movie has Vincent go through both the mobsters and law enforcement officers in L.A like a mad bull in a China shop seeing red with L.A cabbie Max unwillingly tagging along. Max picked up a pretty young federal attorney at the start of the movie Annie, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Annie was so impressed by Max's driving and knowledge of the city that she gave Max her card that had her business address and phone number. Unknown to both Max and Annie at the time it turned out to be a real lifesaver. Max later picking Vincent up at the L.A airport is given $600.00 by Vincent for him to drive him to five different stops as he does his rounds as a hit-man for the rest of the night. That $600.00 didn't make up for the damage that it cost Max who's cab was totaled and who's nerves were shot to pieces by the time the night was over. Vincent does his job with style and pizazz as well as bullets by blasting people out of windows and in high-rise law offices as well as during jazz sessions and in crowded nightclubs. Towards the end of the movie there was a incredible shoot-out at an L.A Chinese night spot, the Fever, that made the shoot-out at the OK Corral look like an episode of Sesame Street. ""Collateral"" is the type of movie that you really can't take too seriously and have to suspend some belief watching it. The connection between Max and Vincent is a bit too contrived and very strained with Vincent putting up with all the nervous and unexpected acts that Max's does in the movie. these antics could have cost Vincent his freedom or even his life. Where at the same time we see Vincent blast away anyone in the film, who as much as looks at him a little funny, with out a show of emotion. But if Vincent did Max in right away the movie would have been over. At the same time if Max was too terrified to talk or even think and just went along with Vincent, even when he left him alone like Vincent did a few times in the movie, it would have taken away Max's personality which was what made the movie as effective as it was.""Collateral"" is not a great film it has a lot of loose ends that are left untied by the time the movie is over but it keeps the pace and action moving. Especially with the sharp and funny inter-action between Max and Vincent in and out of Max's cab and on the streets freeways high rise buildings and subways of L.A. ""Collateral"" is sure to become one of the summer of 2004 biggest hits.",Collateral
44,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 June 2019,"Not as big of a fan as the first times I watched it. It is still good, but it just doesn't seem special in any way. great acting and directing. but the story is fairly straightforward and drags at times especially in the beginning (3 viewings)",Collateral
45,ElMaruecan82,"Karma hangs on the tiniest details, like a perfect script...",10,18 April 2017,"Reviewing ""Collateral"", I'm tempted to use my rhetorical shtick, praising the film's noir undertones while throwing in each paragraph words like 'existential', 'nightmarish', 'life-changing' or 'character-study'. But watching this film a third time made me question my habits and my certitudes as deeply as I could relate to Max, the humble and sympathetic cab driver who gets a real taste of that vague notion of something ""that happens"" and that starts with S. And that's exactly the point, Max at 6 pm doesn't know it yet, but he'll be a totally different man at 4 am.What happened to make this transition so believable and captivating is something I don't want to intellectualize much; its intelligence speaks for itself. So many directors try to achieve greatness through artsy stuff and heavy symbolism, but Michael Mann doesn't need any of these artifices. All it took was a good script, good actors and a good story, perfectly crafted by Stuart Beattie, with profound dialogues that never feel overwritten. It is crucial because the film's tension relies on the credibility of the interactions between Max (Jamie Foxx) and his client, Vincent, the ruthless killer played by Tom Cruise. If Max is the talkative driver who asks customers where they're from, he becomes a cliché and the film is over, just as if Vincent was a sort of human Terminator.This is a film of a few characters but with no room for improvisation. Speaking of this, one of the most memorable moments involves a jazz-man played by Barry Shabaka Henley. He's got such a terrific story about Miles Davis that it is worth watching the film just to hear that man recalling one of his life's happiest moments. I wasn't surprised, watching the bonus features, that Mann and Beattie had written detailed back-stories about each character so they could be immersed into their lives just before playing them. What Cruise, Foxx and all the other cast-members did was approaching the lives of their characters even when it didn't interfere with the story. Mark Ruffalo took shooting lessons although he never fires his gun. The point is to make you care for the character as someone with a past, before watching him in the present, which is the whole point of Max and Vincent's conflicting principles: once you know someone's past, you can't shoot him.Now, take the very first scene between Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), at first, he knows exactly how long the road will take and how to avoid traffic jams. That's not a detail, when we spend days and days driving in the same town, we know these things. I trust Mann who knows L.A. more than any other director and if I did a movie about Casablanca, I could also reach such precision. But see how this works in the film, from his exactitude when it comes to predict the exact timing, he manages to elicit a positive response from her and one thing leading to another, he tells her about his plans to start a limo company and that his cab business is all temporary, that's the way relationships start. And when she leaves, we immediately understand why Max is angry, he forgot to give his phone number but then she comes back and gives him her card, it's even better because that just saved her life. Had Max given his phone number, she would be dead by the end.And this hazardous aspect of Karma structures the film: if two cops weren't called in emergency, they would be dead too, if Max hadn't shouted for help, two thugs would've been alive. Sometimes, life hangs on the tiniest details, like a good script. In ""Collateral"" many things are immediately guessable when you pay attention to the lines, to the body language. Max' exactitude also plays like a conversation starter with Vincent, although he doesn't expand his heart but he says that he wants to start a business and makes enough an impression on Vincent so that he inevitably asks him to drive him the whole night, for seven-hundred dollars, Max needs money and Vincent, with his gray suit and gray hair, looks like the man of his job, Max' instinct is failed. In fact, all through the film, many mistakes are guided by habits, routines and misguiding instincts, in other words, things we take for granted.Viewers also take things for granted with action movies: shootouts, car chases seem like obligatory ingredients but the way it is handled by Mann is beyond any clichés. I used to dislike the ending because it felt too conventional but then I realized it made some clever and stylish nods to Hitchcock and it was the only way to make Vincent's entrance in Max' life pay off. Had Vincent killed Max and Annie, it would have been pointless and then make Vincent's point about life's pointlessness in the 'grand scheme of things' but that was an angle the script didn't take. If anything, ""Collateral"" proved that the world is, paraphrasing ""Se7en"", a nasty place worth fighting for. Vincent wasn't 100% wrong though since his death did prove his initial point about people's carelessness.In fact, there are many things in Vincent that Max uses for his own good and that might help him for the future by the end of the day, Max has learned a lot about himself, and gotten many things straight by ""finally"" acting like Vincent. That's how you close a character's arc. As for Vincent's arc, I was wondering how could a pro like him miss Max in the subway, the reason is even more brilliant, he's a professional. Vincent trademark three-point shooting two in the thorax, one in the head hit the sliding door, Max shot on the glass and got him, as simple as that, like Max, Vincent was victim of his habits.See, ""Collateral"" is very good but with an eye for detail, it becomes a masterpiece.",Collateral
46,dromasca,"solid, well-acted thriller",8,7 January 2005,"'Collateral' is a well done thriller, with an intelligent script, logic, pace (for most of the time) and succeeds to avoid many of the traps and clichés of the genre The action takes place in LA at night, and although the large concrete jungle plays a role in the action I feel the director could have done more with the location. Cruise as a paid killer on a multiple murder mission tries to break his positive characters type, and succeeds it very well, in a cinema season where we have seen other great actors Ike Hanks or Robin Williams taking the main negative role in movies with similar good results. Foxx is his positive counter-part, a cab driver becoming tool and victim of Hanks, and the strange and developping relationship between the two is the backbone of the movie.Not all is perfect in the movie. Some script details around are not as original as the main story, and the ending needs to wrap-up everything, and it does it in a sligthly commercial and disappointing manner. Overall it's a good film, worth watching, and not only in order to see Tom Cruise. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",Collateral
47,ThomasDrufke,Think anybody'll notice?,9,2 December 2014,"I really appreciate the actors who step out of their box and take roles that are unlike anything they have done before. Tom Cruise here plays a ruthless contract killer who's run in with an everyday cab driver turns out to be much more than what he thought. Cruise, to my knowledge, has never really played the villain. So to see him absolutely kill this role makes me think of the endless possibilities for his future career. Collateral is a near masterpiece in the crime thriller genre. I can even see influences of it in this years Nightcrawler. It is quite simply one of the best crime films of the past decade.Michael Mann gives us another classic but also presents us with a terrifically well rounded cast. Cruise and Foxx are great as the leads. But Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are also great. Not to mention the brief but memorable cameos by Statham and Bardem. I loved the dynamic between Cruise and Foxx. Max (Foxx) is just a man who never really went after his dreams while Vincent (Cruise) is just killing people for money but also at the same time wants to be known for something. I really loved the way the film presented these crimes and how Max reacted to them. Most films display murder to a normal person and they shake it off like it was nothing. But Max is truly terrified of Vincent and what he's capable of. They were never truly meant to spend significant time together, but one thing leads to another and we have the most dysfunctional relationship possible. And even Max resents Vincent for what he is doing, there is some sort of mutual respect present here. Max at one point seems to look up to him.The rides are great and it's interesting watching Cruise seamlessly play this character, but it's the ending this film is worth watching for. It was a great way to be both highly intense but at the same time mostly realistic. There may have been a few times where it seemed unrealistic, but it never took me out of this roller coaster crime thriller.

The one silly scene I can think of is the night club scene. It is so ridiculous that most everyone continues to dance and not even notice as Vincent breaks people's necks and starts shooting people.Two of the best scenes were the jazz night club when Vincent, Max, and owner are sitting and when Max is eating in the cab and gets a sign from above. Now that made me jump.I thought the script writer started getting lazy toward the end when it seemed like your average chase thriller once Max calls Annie to warn her.But, I was surprised at the ending because I guessed wrong at who dies.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching, better than most so-called thrillers out there.",Collateral

50,CuriosityKilledShawn,Worst Assassin in history,6,15 January 2005,"If any of you have ever played the Hitmas video games you will probably think that you could do quite well as contract killer given the right tools. You'd probably be right, or at least you'd be a hundred times better than Vincent in this movie. Apparently the phrase ""silent assassin"" is not in his vocabulary. He doesn't even use silencers on his very loud gun.Tom Cruise plays Vincent - a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills - all in a night's work.This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA, leaves fingerprints everywhere, and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill. I know the face and name need to sell the movie, but surely you'd remember a suspicious guy who looked like Tom Cruise being at the scene of every murder in LA during the course of one night.Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. Using a combination of digital cameras for the car scenes and 35mm (Super35 sadly, not anamorphic) for the interiors there are many gorgeous shots and stunning compositions.Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.Look out for a blink-and-you-miss-it cameo from the Transporter himself right at the very start.",Collateral
51,851222,Great thriller as well as great character study movie,9,20 May 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Collateral"" (2004) serves as a very good thriller as well as good character study movie. There are two characters are its core, and they are both very interesting due to great performances and very good script.First time i saw ""Collateral"" back in a year of its release. Second time was today. 16 years ago i rated it 9/10 on this page. Today, 16 years later, i would rate it same - great movie from one of my all time favorite Michael Mann. Yet this time i saw faced i did not notice 16 years ago: Mr. Mark Ruffalo & Mr. Javier Bardem - two of the greats in a supporting roles here, you can see why these actors year later went to the top.Overall, ""Collateral"" is the only movie were you will see T.Cruse in a villain role. Or isn't a villain? Listening to him, you kinda starting to doubt. What a great script and great performances in a very good movie.",Collateral

Michael Mann has followed up with his 1986 ""Manhunter"" with a more substantive, cinematographic exploration in the similar fashion of Sophia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation."" Mr. Mann has combined his grainy, realistic photography techniques with layered images and great sound effects with a deliciously various sound track that keeps the audience absorbed. Mr. Mann has been able to avoid the overly graphic violence, the high tech flavor of Manhunter, and the stream of life experience of ""Lost In Translation."" Both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give memorable performances that are deep, emotionally satisfying. There is humor and emptiness, pathos and comedy. This movie is a mainstream, art film that blends the best of drama and thriller in Mann's stylistic genius. Except for a waitress shot that distracts the end of the jazz scene, this movie is nearly perfect. Nine out of Ten Stars.",Collateral

Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Mark Ruffalo are all brilliant and Jada Pinkett Smith (whom I've never cared for) is even good, I shouldn't be surprised as Mann used her to good effect in his previous movie Ali, in fact Mann uses a few actors from Ali again Foxx, Bruce McGill (also in The Insider) and Barry Shabaka Henley are the ones I noticed, there could have been more.The movie is filled with fantastic dialogue and great well written roles, including the supporting characters. This is actually an interesting character study as opposed to your routine thriller, there is more on show than you think.I would have preferred it if the movie didn't end with a chase scene an a damsel in distress, but it's hard to criticise a movie that gets so much right!! Foxx was rightly nominated for his performance, and I rethink Cruise should have been too. He is brilliant. Mann really does know how to get great performances from his actors. Once again, the movie has a fantastic score mixed with some random songs. Side note Jason Statham has a cameo as the guy Tom Cruise bumps into at the airport.Anybody who has not seen this movie needs to. Anybody who hasn't seen it for a while, needs to revisit it.With a domestic gross of $101 million Collateral gave Mann his biggest domestic Box Office gross and ended the year the 23rd highest grossing movie of 2004.",Collateral

55,sol-,My brief review of the film,8,12 February 2005,"A technically rather well made and rather slickly directed thriller, the film delivers thrills as well as some character study. It is still a bit on the routine side nevertheless, with very typical thriller moments, a typical thriller twist, and not enough depth to the characterisation for it to be worth the extra length, as the film felt too long. Had it a shorter running time, and had it been more believable and less contrived, it would have been quite a film. But with good technical credits to its virtue, and Jamie Foxx in an effective Oscar-nominated performance, it is still a very solid film nonetheless.",Collateral
56,tomgillespie2002,"Thrilling and fun, wonderfully performed by its two leads",7,2 December 2014,"In Collateral, Michael Mann - a director who was still working at the top of his game back in 2004 - combines his favourite and familiar traits - an ice-cool soundtrack, buckets of visual style, and a conversational showdown as important as the physical one that inevitably follows. It follows one night in the life of Los Angeles cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx), who after accepting a multi-stop fare from the slick-looking Vincent (Tom Cruise), has his life turned upside down. Vincent looks and sounds like a businessman looking to close multiple deals in the course of a few hours, but when a dead body lands on the top of his cab at the first stop, it becomes clear to Max that Vincent is a hired killer.The two verbally poke and prod each other - Max at Vincent's complete detachment from real-life and the emotional abuse and/or neglect he must have surely suffered to lead him on such a dark path; and Vincent at Max's tendency to procrastinate at every aspect of his life. Max frequently flicks down his sun-visor and stairs at a picture of a desert island, waxing lyrical about his grand plan to set up his own limousine company. At the start of the film, Max drives Justice Department prosecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the two share a spark. He should ask her for her number but he doesn't. Luckily she takes the initiative and gives it to him anyway. Vincent may be a remorseless psychopath, but at least he grabs life by the balls.Such an engaging character study and a film so packed with marvellously shot set-pieces should lead to an equally great climax, but like Heat (1995), Mann's other L.A.-based crime noir, the film ends on a weak note. Vincent just may be the worst hit-man in cinema history. He's physically capable of taking down multiple foes with fists and weaponry, but his decision-making is laughable at times, and in the end he is forced into a rather bland chase after his prey through a subway. But for the most part, Collateral is thrilling and fun; at it's best when its two leads are simply sitting in the cab and conversing, wonderfully performed by Foxx and Cruise.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Collateral

58,Dr_Coulardeau,Noir with a psychological twist,9,28 September 2008,"This film is not particularly rich as for the content. A professional killer has been hired to eliminate all the witnesses and even the cops and other prosecution personnel in some criminal case. Banal. He does not want to drive his own car and he does not want to hire a car and an accomplice to drive him around. So he comes at night and just hires a taxi and its driver. That makes him difficult to trace. But that creates some problems because the taxi-driver is not really willing to do the job. And then the two are like mutual prisoners or custodians. One cannot work without the other and one cannot escape from the other. Yet the taxi-driver, after a long series of killings, finds the courage to cause an accident which means the arrival of the cops, but that also means the discovery of the first body that had been put in the trunk and the taxi driver's discovery that the next and last target is the woman he had transported just before this embarrassing and invading client. He decides to escape from the cop who is trying to arrest him, and who was alone on his car patrol, and to prevent the killing of the girl. He will even go slightly further. But that's not the main interest of the film. We could have predicted all that from the very start. Then it's only details. The interest is the rhythm and the twists in the fabric of the tale. In fact it is economical in blood and even bullets because it centers on the psychological profile of the taxi-driver and the relation he establishes with his customer. Strangely enough it is more psychological than we could have expected and that saves the film from banality.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Collateral
59,Floated2,"Mixes well crime, drama and action",9,20 June 2016,"Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a unique and intelligently well done film by great director Michael Mann. In this hostage story, the script is on thin ice though the actors and writing make it work well, and better than it should have been. The plot requires that Max and Vince stay together, even though it is in Max's best interest to try to get away. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery would all be just contrived enough to ruin a script. Vince is a professional and Max is an expert at driving in L.A. whose life is on the line. The script needs to be at least as smart as both men. Luckily there are no glaring holes in the logic, and Max very nearly manages to get away from Vince on a couple of occasions. What makes the film great, other than the visuals is of course the acting from the leads Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Rarely has Cruise been the second or co-lead in his films and rarely does he portray a villain, but in Collateral he delivers one of his finest performances. He blatantly steals the film and delivers on every scene he is in. For a film running at 2 hours, it has a great pace and does not feel boring or slow. Right from the beginning, we are engaged and interested in the story and the characters. The ending is not quite as expected but also not too unpredictable, but it is a well delivered ending to a great film.",Collateral
60,johnnyboyz,So much more than just a two hour action film.,8,18 April 2007,"The state in which the crime genre is in when it comes to modern day Hollywood is that of one teetering on a brink; but what that brink is, I don't exactly know. Long gone are the days of those voiced over film noirs with their sultry femme fatales trying to distract the detectives from their missions but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. You do get the odd throwback (I'm thinking Sin City) but nowadays; fast, pulsating films with recognisable Hollywood names that lighten up the screen seem to be the norm when thinking of the crime genre. In Collateral, we have a perfect example of a fast, flashy but with a relatively simplistic concept for a film all mixed up to produce an entertaining piece of film-making.I was appalled with Miami Vice; another modern day crime film made through the conventions described above and coincidentally, another Michael Mann film but here, Mann succeeds and this is through a number of things. First, there is an atmosphere. There is an awkward, unpredictable atmosphere that sucks us in. Second, Mann actually makes good use of the film's setting. Like Miami Vice, Mann uses a colourful yet seemingly deadly mass urban utopia as the setting only this time, it's captured perfectly on screen; something he also did in Heat. Here, the setting is used well; the film isn't confined to a taxi cab for two hours and whenever the character's are outside we are allowed to breath and take in our surroundings as the action continues; whether it's on top of a sky scraper in a race against time or a foot chase over a pedestrian bridge.What's also effective is the way the film manipulates its viewer; often, I'm sure, without them even realising. Tom Cruise plays a character called Vincent and to say he really, really sheds his skin is an understatement. Off the top pf my head, I can name the first two Mission Impossible films, Top Gun and The Colour of Money as Cruise films I can recall seeing. In Collateral, Cruise really opens up and shows us he's much more than we take him for. His character is something that not only plays games with Max (Foxx) but also with the audience. We're made to like Vincent: he's smart, he's sharp, he's just cool  too cool. What's more, he completes his first two hits without us even seeing him do it, meaning that we are not yet put off this cool cat as we haven't yet seen him kill any one. Max, on the other hand, is just playing a boring taxi driver. How are we meant to associate with him? This is clever as it turns on its head half way through and by the end, everything is completely upside down as the film has manipulated you into rooting for someone you thought was reasonably lame in comparison to this super-duper hit-man who can now be viewed as a bit of a psychopath. This is the first little clever thing Collateral does.The second is the feeling and overall theme. For a film to have a theme is great enough on its own. Some fantastic films over the years have had themes. Pulp Fiction's was redemption, 2001: A Space Odyssey's was evolution and Collateral's, from my reading, is circulation. Everything comes around and goes around every once in a while. Now and again taxi drivers pick up the wrong fare and Vincent's story half way through (that echoes at the end) about circulation as he rides off (so to speak) leaves a taste in the mouth that isn't quite bitter but isn't exactly sweet, either.Although with some rather ludicrous product placement very early on; Collateral is not only a popcorn-esqe thrill ride with chases and shootings; but also a more deeper, more sensual look at life as a whole. Combine this with clever film tricks and traits only good experienced directors can produce and you've got yourself a truly memorable film.",Collateral
61,filipemanuelneto,"Despite the plot's flaws, it's a good movie.",6,5 June 2017,"This film is a very competent thriller where an ordinary taxi driver ends up involved in a series of crimes, as his nightly passenger turns out to be a professional killer, hired to kill several people in one night. The plot starts from an excellent idea but the unfolding of the film reveals a lot of plot holes. This is its main problem. Gun shots that miss the target in a weird (but convenient) way, astonishing car crashes where no one gets hurt and other unrealistic or convenient situations complete the script's problems. The best in this film are the action scenes, truly capable of making us forget (or forgive) the mistakes I mentioned. The way the characters are presented and developed is also very good. Taxi driver Max is the most blatant example. In the beginning, he was perfectionist, dreamy and shy but he manages to overcome these blockades and face the problem where he was involved. This made him dear to the audience, who cares about his fate.The work of the actors is very positive. Despite being the most popular name in the cast, Tom Cruise deserves no more applause than Jamie Foxx, who shone in a way that didn't allow Cruise to dominate. In fact, it's unusual to see Cruise, an actor used to histrionic roles, in a character as calm and restrained, but that pleased me a lot. Jada Pinkett Smith plays the lady in distress satisfactorily, but it never ceases to be a cliché. Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem are also part of the cast, but the plot doesn't take much of their talent. Cinematography is very good, betting on close-up, aerial or scenes with the camera in motion, which gives greater movement to the film. Good special, visual and sound effects complete the good technical details of a film where only the screenplay is deficient. But event this is going to be a lesser evil if we get carried away by the movie.",Collateral

63,imseeg,"Why watch ""Collateral"" when ""Heat"" is the ultimate classic?",6,18 May 2018,"Tom Cruise fans surely will love this movie. But all others that arent particularly fan of Tom Cruise, be wary, because the story of this movie is not very credible: cabdriver gets hijacked by a serial killer and is forced to drive him towards the locations of 5 designated killings. Sounds thrilling. But it unfortunately lacks story credibility.I must admit though that I have watched ""Collateral"" several times, but suddenly I got irritated about the uncredible story. So probably a lot of people who enjoy gangster thrillers will love this flick during first viewing, when one more easily gets swept away with the suspense of the story. I only wanna warn those who expect more: lower your expactations about story credibility...Michael Mann as a director has made many great other gangster movies. ""Manhunter"" is a classic. ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp is great. ""Thief"" however is the debut of Michael Mann and this movie is truly COOL. It is on Tarantino's favorite list. And for a good reason. Because ""Thief"" has got everything what ""Colletaral"" has NOT got. ""Thief"" has got balls. Men are real men in ""Thief"".Michael Mann truly made his life's achievement though with the classic thriller ""Heat"" starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. My advice to everybody would be to wach ""Heat"" instead of ""Collateral"" and you will have a guaranteed credible story, with mindblowing acting performances and a killing suspense with a gloriously dark final.",Collateral

So so cab driver Foxx who acts well here, leads an ordinary life, driving the cleanest taxi in L.A. He's saving up for his dream of owning a limo business, that's if he ever gets it off the ground. In steps cool handsome Cruise, a hit-man for the mob, where soon these two are in conflict. After all Cruise is practically hijacking the taxi, forcing Foxx to drive around while he makes his kills, the last contract bringing a twist to it's identity, where to a truly intense race against time scenario, ensues. In his first bad guy role, Cruise shows real professionalism, as cool contract killer, Vincent, you actually can't help liking the guy. Despite his evil doings, he's a real character, who we learn about, so important in film. And it's not just Vincent. We are taken on this hairy journey, a fun thrill ride as only Mann could deliver. This movie was somewhat of a surprise, better than I thought it'd be as actually seeing it, before it hit cinema. Of course the cops get a dispatch, just as Foxx was about to open the trunk, as ordered by the cops. Just imagine if the cops didn't, how this film would of panned out. Again the music scores impress as they do in other Mann films. Foxx, Cruise, Pinkett all deliver in what is powerhouse entertainment, an exemplary film you should not miss out on.

Small problem, though: Turns out Vincent's deals are actually hits. That might cost extra on the meter.Michael Mann's dark action film is mainly a two-character study of the hijacked Max and the confident Vincent. Will Max ever get the psychological upper hand on Vincent? Who will win out? Will Vincent complete his ""rounds""? The other characters are merely background decorations, for the most part, as this is a batter of wits between a cold master and a warm, pensive dreamer.Critics have raved about this movie, especially about Foxx's performance and about Cruise's ability to disappear into a character. I can't agree with the latter of those two assessments. To me, Tom Cruise never stopped being Tom Cruise. You can whiten his beard and give him a salt-and-pepper mane, but you can never completely take away the very distinct Cruise mannerisms. You can never, in other words, completely forget Vincent is Tom Cruise, Movie Star, and that's where the movie really suffers. I believe Cruise was miscast in this movie, because another, less-mannered actor would have given a much more-nuanced performance.Foxx, on the other hand, was perfectly cast, and this (along with Ray) is surely a breakthrough role for the former In Living Color vet. Foxx immerses himself so much in his character that one completely empathizes with Max's plight. We understand when he's uncertain about calling Annie, the lawyer who was the fare before Vincent. We know where he's coming from when he's asked to do reprehensible things by Vincent over the course of the long evening. We never have to stop and ask ourselves why Max is doing something, or - more appropriately - why Max isn't doing something to stop Vincent.There are some holes in the story itself, which never bodes well when the movie is as plot dependent; even worse, though, is that the plot - particularly the ending - seems far too contrived and tidy for the people involved. Things happen in the movie that would be considered mere coincidences in real life, but here they look manipulated.Because of this, Collateral was a disappointment to me. Even if one sawed through the hype of the movie (""Ooh look! It's Tom Cruise looking old!"") and took it at face value, the plot contrivances and hamminess of Cruise ultimately sink it, at least to some degree. It's not a wholly unentertaining movie, as it's fun to watch Cruise and Foxx interact. It's just not as satisfying as it should have been.",Collateral

I am not generally an admirer of Mr Cruise but he has blindsided me here with a portrayal of a man who, whilst exhibiting all the signs of a sociopathic personality, is occasionally prey to human frailty.He seems almost puzzled as to where these traits are drawn from when they show themselves unexpectedly.It is a mature,assured performance. In L.A. for one night and contracted to kill five witnesses due to give evidence against a drug cartel,Mr Cruise hires a cab driven by Mr Jamie Foxx who reluctantly becomes embroiled in the action.

Will the character be believably villainous? Will we be able to forget all those occasions that Ethan Hunt or John Anderton or Jerry Maguire or Maverick saved the day with his gallant efforts, and instead learn to loathe this character? Not surprisingly, a grey-haired, quick-witted Tom Cruise does incredibly well, reminding us that he is a superb actor, after all!Max (Jamie Foxx, 'Ray,' 2004) is a Los Angeles cab driver. Having maintained the same job for twelve years, Max yearns for change, but he can't accept that his dreams of starting a limousine company will never materialise. It is then that Vincent (Tom Cruise, 'Minority Report,' 2002) takes a seat in Max's cab. He instructs Max to travel to an apartment complex, and, once they arrive, to await his prompt return. Waiting patiently, Max is thoroughly shocked when a body plummets from an upper-floor window and obliterates his car windscreen.A cool and collected Vincent returns, a pistol clasped in his hand, and he commands Max to drive him around the city to each of his hits. When an aghast Max splutters, ""You killed him?"" Vincent replies with a matter-of-fact, ""No, I shot him.

Tom Cruise isn't the best actor in the world, but with a career spanning well over 20 years and with each role he's taken in his years as a big screen performer, has been more varied and detailed.With ""Collateral"" however, two Hollywood wild cards come together to make what is certainly one of the most entertaining and stylishly-crafted action thrillers I've seen in a long time. Add to this equation a popular and talented comedian - Jamie Foxx - and you've got pure gold.Foxx is no stranger to serious performances despite his stature as a stand-up comic, since he has worked with Mann before, on 2001's ""Ali"" and earned widespread acclaim with the recent made-for-TV drama ""Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story."" Here in ""Collateral,"" he plays an innocent cabbie named Max, who makes the unwitting mistake of picking up a cool and casual hit-man named Vincent (Cruise). Vincent has come to Los Angeles to wipe out five people and needs a ride around the city and Max has just the nice enough vehicle for the job.What we get with ""Collateral"" is a slick, stylish and intelligent thriller that utilizes the talents of its two leads almost perfectly. Foxx provides a valuable counterpoint of dark comedy and fear, artistically-speaking of course, to Cruise's all-too-savvy Vincent. There is even a romantic interest, provided by Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, who unknown to Max, is on Vincent's hitlist.Michael Mann gives us one of his best films in a long time.

I mean, I have been hitting on this `Collateral' film review for the last few days. In other words, I have been a review hitman. Hey, I know times are tough with the economy and all of that (for more of this issue: see `Fahrenheit 911').  So if you do not have cash, we will accept that. However, you must leave something as collateral. Ok, don't go and leave this review! Stay collateral with me on this one! `Collateral' of course stars Tom Cruise as Vincent, a psychopath hitman who is on a job to exterminate 5 L.A. witnesses & district attorneys involved in a drug trafficking case. On his mission possible, Vincent collaterals with Max; an L.A. cabbie who reluctantly drives Vincent to all his hit locations. Eventually, this Mad Max gets quite aware of the lethal weapon that he is driving. Cruise was a real hit as Vincent! His grayish hair & suit represent a certain decrepit aura about him; a self-assured villain who is really an enclosed catastrophe.  Cruise commands the screen; you can't take your eyes off him. There is no gray area in that statement. Foxx was a real foxxy cabbie with his outstanding neuropath work as Max. This breakthrough performance puts him in the elite category of one of the best African-American actors of today. I will give up my left nut as collateral and bet that these two will garner Oscar nominations. Ok, so I am a little nutty! How can I forget about the main mann of this film though? Director michael Mann's stylish techniques in manifesting a turbulent evening in Los Angeles is manly enough to be highly regarded during awards season. Also, screenwriter Stuart Beattie did not beat around the bush while scribing some eye-opening dialogue.

The premise of this film sees a contract killer get into a cab to fulfil a job and ends up in a confrontation of wills with the driver. Now usually in films Tom cruise plays the hero that everybody roots for but in this film he plays a conflicted dark psychopathic character that was just so interesting to watch. Yes he fits the action scenes but his character was really interesting and a deep character that is easily one of cruises best performances. Equally as impressive is Jamie Foxx as max the cab driver, you see this guy evolve as a character throughout the movie and even though he is also flawed he is the character that the audience are meant to relate to and he does a fantastic job at it. Mark ruffalo and jada pinkett Smith are good in this film it is just that you don't really know too much about them and there characters aren't that well fleshed out. The story is enthralling with two different types of thrillers in one film. You have the cab scenes with incredible character depth and dialogue between the two characters that really interests you. Then you also have the LA night time scenes that are also really cool and interesting and add a great backdrop for the movie. The script is fantastic, with all the dialogue being great and really helps make these characters incredibly interesting to watch.

73,Chris_Docker,Stylish film noir,8,3 October 2004,"Over-used scenes on the subway and cat and mouse in a tall office block and comparatively minor flaws in what is otherwise a superb thriller from director Michael Mann (who made the similarly evocative 'Heat'). The story revolves around a taxi driver who is pulled into the tangled web of a trained assassin, much against his will. It is shot in DVD which enables Mann to produce very rich colours at nightime - not like the garish or washed out colours that are often what you get with celluloid night time shoots. It helps to produce a visually succulent but also very lovingly portrayed Los Angeles. The scene in the jazz club is so convincing you actually feel Miles Davis was there - and the subtext about jazz as a metaphor for life is one of the gems in what is generally a very tight script (about structure - but the important thing being the spontaneous melody that lies *behind* the tune). But the over-riding impact is from Tom Cruise, playing one of his memorable characters since his cameo in Magnolia. His performance is so convincing - he could be a role model for that type of bad guy.",Collateral
74,MaxBorg89,A night to remember...,10,28 June 2006,"When this film was shown at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, some critics complained about the fact that it was out of competition, since it was the best picture of those screened that year. They were right. Collateral is a beautiful, stylish, moving film. If it weren't for Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Million Dollar Baby, it would be the best movie of 2004. It's a remarkable achievement, made with expertise and inspiration.The film is set during a night in Los Angeles (the time frame being 9.30 PM - 5.40 AM). We meet a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), a man who's been doing that job for twelve years, hoping that sooner or later he'll be able to have enough cash for a project he's pursuing. He's a nice person, willing to take short cuts so that his passengers won't have to pay too much (how many taxi drivers would actually do such a thing?). But after that night, he'll never be the same person. Just after an attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith) has left his vehicle, a new customer shows up. He tells Max he has to make five stops before 6.00 AM, and offers him 600 dollars for the ride. The unsuspecting driver accepts, only to regret his decision minutes later: Vincent (Tom Cruise) is not an ordinary passenger. He's a professional assassin, hired to kill five people and then leave L.A. before anybody notices. And now Max has to help him, whether he likes it or not.The film is directed by Michael Mann, whose other masterwork, Heat, also took place in Los Angeles. In fact, Mann has become to L.A. what Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and Woody Allen are to New York: he knows every single corner of the city, and by shooting the film on with DV cameras he makes sure the audience gets to see what a beautiful place it is at night. But Mann's genius lies in the fact that he doesn't let the aerial shots of the buildings distract us, but makes them a vital part of his protagonists'journey, which is the core of the movie.The bond that is created between killer and hostage is arguably the best ever dealt with by Mann. If you liked De Niro and Pacino interacting in Heat, you'll be in awe when you witness the confrontation between Max and Vincent. Rarely have we seen two people so radically different: Max has lots of ambition, but won't do anything to even try improving his life. Vincent, on the other hand, is completely uninterested in human life. The only thing he cares about is doing his job perfectly, regardless of why he has to do it (""Should I only kill people I know?"" he asks at a certain point) or what consequences there will be, since in his opinion we're all ultimately insignificant if compared with the rest of the universe. These are two loners who desperately need each other: Vincent depends on Max to get the work done in time, and our cab driver needs his adversary to realize it's time to take action and do something that makes a difference. It's a fascinating relationship, given additional depth by two excellent performances: Cruise is perfectly at his ease playing against type, while Foxx steps out of anonymity with a powerful, compelling, Oscar-worthy effort (he eventually lost out to the equally good Morgan Freeman, who won for the aforementioned Million Dollar Baby).Those who believe in cinema's ability to move as well as entertain should give Collateral a try. It truly stands out as one of the best genre films ever made (shame it wasn't considered for Best Picture of 2004, though).",Collateral

Tom Cruise was, surprisingly, utterly believable as the cold-hearted killer. It was probably fun for him to play against type. Jamie Foxx showed his dramatic chops as well. But you have to suspend a lot of disbelief to enjoy this film. Why would Vincent (Cruise) take a taxi to all these appointments, when he could rent a car more cheaply? Unless he planned to kill Max (Foxx) he gives up all anonymity, even if all went well. Why carry around the corpse of the first victim, while leaving all the others? Shouldn't he just have dragged it off into the darkness, or alternatively, dumped it later? And how about the gigantic coincidence of two consecutive passengers of a random taxicab being later linked by the plot so intimately? If you can get past these things, then as I say, it's definitely worth a rental. Grade: B",Collateral

You can almost make it into a game of looking for resemblances to _Heat_. It is good to re-use some of the elements that worked. But at the same time that just keeps pointing to the other movie and shows the weaknesses of this one. _Collateral_ succeeds at what it sets itself out to do. What is lacking perhaps is more complexity; Mann can easily handle greater sets and more involved plots. I get the impression that Mann needs to find a classier place to feature as the locale for his movies. LA is great and all, but so many movies featuring LA is tiring.",Collateral
80,EUyeshima,Stylish Action Built on Character and Mann's Bravura,7,5 March 2006,"For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique film-making style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camera-work by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from ""Rear Window"" and ""Speed"" with a touch of ""The French Connection"". Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.",Collateral

He gets a fare, an attractive woman named Annie (Pinkett Smith). He starts to talk to this woman, more than the usual small talk, and they really connect. She is an prosecutor in the middle of a big case and really stressed out. The ride ends with he giving her a picture he uses to relax, and he of course gets her phone number. The next fare, a middle-aged man (Cruise) is a little strange. He says he has some business to do around the city, and hires Max to be his ride for the night. At their first stop, a man drops on the roof of the cab. Apparently, his fare is a professional hit-man. Max is not so keen to be the driver of a hit-man but is forced at gunpoint. So, their journey begins, an odd relationship evolves between the cold calculating hit-man and his driver as they go on their tour. And then both police and criminals get on their tail.Comment: An interesting story with some sparks of pure violence in between of long stretches of talk and or different subplots, primarily in Max's cab. It is those stretches that differs this movie from others, and giving it an extra dimension. Both characters are given time to develop and form an odd relationship between them. Max's character is extremely well played by Foxx, and nicely described in the movie (by small details). Cruise is equally good (or better) as hit-man Vincent. In the movie we for once get an evil hit-man that is more than just evil. This character actually has a background, feelings and a depth that is rarely seen in movie bad guys. In addition to the tremendous work on the characters there are more cinematic diamonds. The use of music and sound effects are stellar, with different themes and a fine-tuned relationship between story and music. There are other interesting, sometimes unusual, choices by the director (and crew) in editing and camera shots. Refreshing and very well done. There is also different themes and details in the scenery that it may pay off to pay attention to.There are some similarities in this move to director Mann's previous movie Heat. This movie is not as good as Heat, because, frankly, Heat was nothing short of brilliant. This movie is still very good, well worth both time and money. I've seen this movie twice now, and I must say that it wasn't until the second time around that I really discovered all the small details, so my advice would be. Watch this, at least once, and pay attention. Don't become passive but search the details, they're there, and they're great.9/10",Collateral

Let's face it, the city is the real star in the movie, illustrating its compact world and displaying why it looks so multi-cultural. The lights, the darkness, and the shadows all mesh well with the technology and shallowness that is always associated with the city.But enough about L.A. The film in general is worthy of its late summer release: enough plot movement to keep you interested and a script that isn't weighed down with overbearing cliches. Throw in the great camera work and a not so hammy Tom Cruise, and the film works on multiple levels. And speaking of Cruise, the more he tries to get out of his typical character, the better he seems to look. His portrayal of Vincent is spot on, even if a few of his monologues in the cab seem a little bit contrived. Jamie Fox also produced the same effect, showing that both actors can actually do something if they work with a talented director.It's hard to say much more about this film due to its utter (yet fascinating) simplicity.

86,ShootingShark,"Stylish, Exciting, Well-Crafted Thriller Of LA Cab Driver Who Picks Up The Wrong Guy",7,27 January 2010,"Max is a Los Angeles cabbie who works nights. He picks up Vincent, a guy with several errands around town, who pays Max a hefty bonus to be his personal driver for the night. Big mistake - Vincent turns out to be a hit-man whose errands are all assassinations, and Max has become his unwilling accomplice Michael Mann is a great director whose recent work has been a little uneven, but this is a cracker of a thriller in the slick style of previous greats like Thief and Heat. The plot may have the odd cliché - you can be sure that the beguiling woman Max meets at the start is gonna be the last name on Vincent's hit list - but it has great character archetypes, terrific action scenes, fascinating performances, and a dreamlike three-o'clock-in-the-morning atmosphere flowing through it. The dynamic between Max and Vincent subtly changes as the story progresses to the point where both men come to an unpalatable realisation of how empty their lives are; Max has big plans that he's never gonna follow through on, and for all his slickness and live-fast ethos Vincent is lonely and unfulfilled. One lacks the courage to break his routine and the other lacks the courage to make a routine. Foxx is a great Everyman, not afraid to play Max as a somewhat nerdy loser, whilst Cruise (with a rather stylish grey hair-dye job) makes a fine egotistical psychopath in his first (only ?) villainous role. Watch out too for the first English-speaking role by Bardem (No Country For Old Men) as the gangster who tells the chilling Black Peter story, and a walk-on right at the start by Jason Statham as the airport bagman. I love it-all-happened-in-one-night stories (see Assault On Precinct 13, Miracle Mile, many others) and the surreal, spaced-out quality of the picture is intense and absorbing; Max and Vincent seem to be drifting through a weird alien planet of neon, dusty palm-lined avenues and endless freeways. James Newton Howard's cool score and the eclectic source music add to this odd quality, and complement Max's journey from control freak to victim to hero. This is a great return to form for Mann, an impressive change of pace for Cruise and a cool, exciting, crime thriller to be savoured.",Collateral
87,rbverhoef,Terrific action thriller,8,31 January 2005,"Here is a film very different from the action thrillers you normally would expect from Hollywood. It takes its time to develop the interesting characters, it does not cut every three seconds, the perfect cinematography is not distracting but adds something to the atmosphere, even the more conventional closing scenes are a lot better than you would expect if I told you what happened there.Cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) has a passenger named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They have a conversation that plays like a real one, again taking its time, and in the end we feel we know these characters quite good. At least better than we know characters after complete films or even series of films. The conversation ends with Annie reaching her destination and after hesitating a little giving Max her business card. We understand she will return in the story. Max's next passenger is Vincent (Tom Cruise). He offers Max a lot of money is he can take him to a couple of addresses, one nights work. Max has doubts but agrees. He stops at the first address, Vincent goes upstairs, a body lands on the car Max is driving. If this was not spoiled in the film's commercials it would be a real surprise.From this point the film develops in a way we expect, but done a lot better than we expect. With each of Vincent's victims the film takes it time to introduce them right until we know them, then the almost sudden, swift action comes and it is done terrifically. On the way some unexpected things happen, they feel like little pauses between Vincent's job. Like I said the third act is a little more conventional but I liked it. Director Michael Mann handles the scenes carefully and therefore he does not step wrong. When Max tries to save the day, of course you knew this, there is real suspense and the outcome is not sure. The same as in Mann's 'Heat', with good guy Al Pacino and bad guy Robert De Niro, you start to sympathize with both Max and Vincent.Michael Mann has made terrific films like 'The Last of the Mohicans', 'Heat' and 'The Insider', had a weaker film with 'Ali' with its strong performances, but returns with this terrific film. 'Collateral' belongs to the best in its genre.",Collateral
88,rosscinema,Mann delivers again,7,4 September 2004,"While every other so-called action film is long on action and short on dialog this film is the opposite of that and it's one of the many reasons why I consider the director one of my personal favorites. Story is about a Los Angeles taxi driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) who dreams of starting his own limousine service and impresses a fare named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) who tells him she is a Federal Prosecutor and gives him her card. Later, Max picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) who convinces him for $600 to drive him around for the evening but while at their first stop a body is thrown out of a window and lands on Max's cab. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Vincent comes back and Max comes to find out that he's a hit man with a list of five names and he must drive him around Los Angeles to kill each person on the list. Meanwhile, a cop named Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) notices that some of the bodies that have been popping up at the morgue have the same pattern of gunshot wounds and after talking with the FBI they discover that the victims are all witnesses in a case. After deliberately crashing the cab Max gets away from Vincent but notices that Annie is the last name on the list and tries to contact her before Vincent tracks her down.This film is directed by Michael Mann who has always specialized in gritty street dramas from ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" to ""Heat"" and one of the things about his films that I have come to notice is that even his flawed efforts like ""Ali"" are still very interesting to look at. Mann has always had a strong visual flair and here he perfectly captures the nightlife of Los Angeles from the street lights and small bars to the heavily lighted buildings of downtown. Even with the action and gun play that take place the highlight of Mann's films is the terrific dialog that is uttered and many of his films are mainly character studies with action scenes taking place every so often. Foxx and Cruise have many of these scenes where they do nothing but drive around and talk and the tension and excitement never eases from it and actually enhances the films mood. The character Vincent played by Cruise is not exceptionally well drawn out but it's not supposed to be as he merely acts as a catalyst to the character Max. By the time the film is over we never find out to much about Vincent except that this is his job but with Max we discover many things from how long he has been driving a taxi to his relationship with his mother. While this probably won't rank up there with Mann's best films this is still exceptionally well made and also gives more evidence to the talent of Foxx who is slowly becoming one of the more interesting actors working today.",Collateral
89,Galina_movie_fan,"What I like and dislike about ""Collateral"" (2004)",5,9 June 2005,"What I like about the movie:Michael Mann loves Los Angeles and it shows  the nighttime LA is one of the film's true stars and director uses quite a few helicopter shots to show it's beauty and magnificence. Film looks and sounds great  Mann is known for the great soundtracks in his films. Beginning of the movie was promising: Before Vincent (a hit man with five targets) hops in the cab; Max (the cabbie who gets hired by Vincent for the night) picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They talk about their lives, their dreams. He guesses quiet accurately what she does for living; he's got good observation skills and sense of humor. The chemistry between Foxx and Pinkett Smith is undeniable.Cruise and Foxx both act wonderfully in the movie. I actually went to see it because I wanted to see Cruise as a ruthless bad guy who made killing people his full time job. Both, Cruise and Foxx play against their types, and it works for both of them.There's one splendid supporting role - a jazz club owner played by Barry Shabaka Henley. The scene between him and Cruise is, IMO, the best on in the move. What I did not like:Where this film fails miserably is in its plotting  too many coincidences, and the movie relies on them too much. I guessed the end of the movie after first ten minutes  and it was correct.There's an absurd nightclub sequence when people keep dancing even when the whole hell turned loose. Nothing would stop them from dancing, not even gunfire and dead bodies next to them.The ending also belongs to the much inferior movie  with obligatory cell phone go low on battery. Cruise character's determination which is more like obsession brings to memory the crazy Nazi character played by Malcolm McDowell in The Passage (1979)  and that's not the best territory to dwell. Overall, it was a disappointment  the movie that I wanted to like by director whom I admire with Tom Cruise playing against his type.",Collateral
90,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Gets worse with each viewing,2,7 September 2021,"I recall seeing this years ago. Maybe because Jamie Foxx was getting Oscar hype. And I thought it was fairly cool. Probably because the Scion Tologist was playing something other than a pretty boy.When I saw it about a decade later I realized how ridiculous the climactic scenes are. Everything from the setup, to the warning call, to the characters' actions, to some super-natural eyesight. And all built upon the ''he's in the house"" type of horror-movie setup that was fresh for about 5 minutes 50 years ago.When I saw it again tonight the whole thing was absurd. It's hard to even know where to start, but let's stick to the cultist's character. He's supposedly a world-class hitman. Admittedly, I'm not a hitman myself. But I bet if I were I'd try to take care of business while creating a lot less hullaballoo than the mydgyt creates on this night of bloodshed. Granted, he appears to be a superhero, surviving a triple MVA rollover and a bullet to the head in the space of about a half hour. Plus, he appears invisible to police helicopters.Characters just seem to drop off. Javier Bardem was interesting. And then he disappeared. Did they cut his scenes so they could leave more of Will Smith's wife's scenes in? Bad decision. The former is a world-class actor.

In between he also drives him to places to kill some other people. It's not the greatest of plots, but that's irrelevant when the execution is so great. I always adore seeing Tom Cruise as a villain, this man was made to be evil. Just check out his composure during the nightclub scene, Tom Cruise just has no business being nice. Jamie Foxx is also very good as the voice of reason throughout all the crazyness, he portrays a character you can really side with and you even don't really want him to die. Michael ""Heat"" Mann is probably as close to Hitchcock as this generation will ever get, and ""Collateral"" definitely contains some real gems when it comes to suspense. To me the absolute highlight is the jazzman scene, I could watch it over and over again for days straight. It's just perfect, the way it's built up is so brilliant. The only bad thing about ""Collateral"", the only thing that keeps it from being one of my absolute favorites, is the silly ending. It doesn't fit the movie, and it seems a lot like something the producers came up with long after the script was green-lit. A disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic movie.",Collateral

I would even say that this movie works because of the strength of the performances of the two leads. Tom Cruise is really great as Vincent, the professional hit-man who has to kill five people in LA in one night. He's unbelievably cold, heartless and untouchable, yet philosophical, nice and compassionate as well. Jamie Foxx, playing Max the taxi driver who's been driving temporarily - for twelve years - to earn enough money to start his own limo-company, was at least as good as Tom Cruise. Max slowly learns how to grow from the ordeal, perhaps even appreciates Vincent even though he knows all to well that any mistake can be his last one.What I really liked as well was the way everything was portrayed. The way LA was shown was really well done. Seeing them drive through this seemingly indifferent and cold city was very nice. I don't know LA, but the director sure knew how to portray it so that you get to know it.What just wasn't as good as it should have been was the script. Not that it was bad, certainly not, but it took me quite some time to get fully involved in this movie. Especially the first 30 to 40 were a little bit too messy and without much meaning to really appeal to me. But after that, the movie was truly great. I reward it with a 7.5/10, perhaps an 8/10.

Cruise then retains his chauffeur driven services under duress as he dots around LA on stopover, taking care of business, hit-man style.There's a couple of good fight scenes in which Cruise, playing a silver-haired, Armani-wearing mercenary displays his wu-tang skills (the dancefloor scene is a little reminiscent of ""The Terminator"", though obviously with a more diminutive terminator) on just about anyone foolish enough to go mano-a-mano with the trained killer. Fox is confined in a role that is mostly performed from behind the driver's wheel, albeit with some attempt at establishing a character who is struggling to rise above his job and take a shot at reaching his full potential. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the Government legal eagle impressed by his gab, who becomes his lifeline as his usefulness evaporates.I usually enjoy a Tom Cruise movie about as much as a poke in the eye, but ""Collateral"" isn't as bothersome as those others; he's still irritatingly self absorbed (in-character), but the film has an undeniable attraction even if the ending is a shallow attempt at pathos. Some hard-hitting action, maybe worth a look.",Collateral
94,brando647,Gripping Suspense and Some Great Performances,9,17 November 2008,"At this point, I haven't had a good deal of exposure to Michael Mann's films. The only film of his I'd seen before this was 1986's ""Manhunter"" and I wasn't all that impressed, but ""Collateral"" blew me away. It's an intense, character-driven thriller that had me hooked to the screen from the Cruise's arrival at the airport in the opening scene. The concept of the film itself is simple: Vincent is a hit-man who hires/forces cab-driver Max to drive him around Los Angeles over the course of a night while he completes his assignment of wiping out five key figures in an upcoming trial. While the story and cinematography were great, it was the main characters that had my attention.As odd a person as I find him in his personal life, I have to admit that I find Tom Cruise to be an awesome actor. I love nearly every performance of his and that goes double for his role as the villain in this film. Cruise is the hit-man Vincent, and he does an awesome job of portraying the cold-blooded killer while keeping him charismatic (to an extent). The majority of the movie is his interactions with Jamie Foxx, in his role as Max. Foxx, who I've only ever really seen in primarily comedic roles until ""Collateral"", pulls off the role nicely and it's fun to watch his attitude evolve from the frightened, panicked cabbie in the beginning to a strong-willed individual who takes his life into his own hands. In addition to the main characters, the film is FULL of high-quality actors/actresses in supporting roles. I have to admit, I didn't even recognize Mark Ruffalo (as LAPD Detective Fanning) or Javier Bardem (as Felix) until they were pointed out to me. Ruffalo, another actor I'm primarily used to seeing in comedic roles, is really absorbed into his role of the cop on Vincent's trail.After reading/learning as much about this movie as I have, I am seriously impressed with Michael Mann. I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but I gained a whole new respect for it when I learned of the detail he went into as a director to develop the characters of the film into what they are. He went so far as to write up complete background stories for both Max and Vincent to give the actors a sense of the character's histories and personalities, and I think it's really reflected in the movie. I've seen that this movie does get a bit of hate from some people out there, but I fail to see why. It's more than entertaining, the suspense keeps a tight hold on you until the end, and I feel that these are some of the best performances from both Cruise and Foxx. In my opinion, this movie is worth checking out, if only to form your own opinion.",Collateral

I mean there were many turns and twists and the story succeeds in involving the audience. You guess every time what comes next now and you may think oh god no, no and so on... Sometimes it was a little bit too slow paced but the movie compensates it with a good camera work, great actors, good picture, nice music and a story that edges you more and more from your seat. There were also some good jokes and special scenes. Thank you Michael Mann for this great job and thanks to the writer for this idea. Please go on.

96,mjw2305,One of Cruise's Finest Performances,9,31 July 2005,"Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a ruthless, yet cool and calculating killer, Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cabbie. A quirk of fate throws the pair together when Vincent uses Max's cab as transport between hits.The result is a first rate thriller that is totally compelling and thoroughly entertaining. Despite Vincent's relentless and cold nature the viewing audience will still find it hard to dislike him, and this is due to the fantastic character portrayal that Cruise pulls off.Michael Mann's direction is as good as you have come to expect, with films such as (Last of the Mohicans, Heat and Ali) and even though he didn't write this, that doesn't detract from the movie experience.It would be wrong of me not to mention the performance of Jamie Foxx, as it is also great.Overall Collateral is a top film, and a must see for thriller fans.9/10",Collateral
97,DeeNine-2,Whiz-bang thriller with some substance,8,12 January 2006,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.This stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man. I mean, what is with this sub-genre? Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s: 2 Days in the Valley (1996) Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides ""on the lam"" movies and mafia glorifications. I also think this sub-genre has something in common with ""the whore with the heart of gold"" flick. It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute. Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman? Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend. Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction. The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.",Collateral
98,leftbanker-1,How Could Such a Good Movie Have Such a Terrible Ending?,6,1 April 2016,"At the end of the very forgettable 1984 ski movie, Hot Dog, the protagonists decide to settle their quarrels by competing in a ""Chinese Downhill."" In one of the movie's few jokes, an Asian companion of the heroes—who has heretofore not uttered a word of English—asks, ""What the f#ck is a Chinese Downhill?"" Allow me to answer that question. A Chinese Downhill is any movie ending that—lacking any shred of originality, purpose, or reason—simply devolves into a chaotic and completely stupid string of car chases, mindless violence, death, and mayhem. This boring cliché is to be expected of a low-rent mess of a movie like Hot Dog but some viewers expect something a little more sophisticated in big-budget productions, many of which make Hot Dog look like Citizen Kane. A paroxysm of bomb blasts and gunfire is a pretty lousy substitute for good writing; it's not even a substitute for really bad writing.Collateral has some brilliant moments and a couple of scenes that set it apart from any other action movie. The acting is top-notch all around with Tom Cruise putting in a stellar performance as the frightening and completely believable hit man. The shoot-out in the disco rates up there with the best shoot-outs in movie history, perhaps topped only by the botched bank heist in Mann's Heat. So why does he end the movie with the really stupid coincidence of the cab driver actually knowing one of the victims? The only thing stupider than this coincidence is the final chase scene and totally unbelievable shoot-out on the train. Heat also had a completely stupid ending, if you will remember which ruined what was a really great movie.So, in review, don't end a movie with a Chinese downhill.",Collateral
99,pyrocitor,More of a drama than an action thriller,10,25 January 2005,"Not to be mistaken for Governor Schwartzenegger's 2002 film 'Collateral Damage', Michael Mann, one of the finest modern crime directors takes his latest shootout down a quite different path. To quote the movie's tagline: ""It began like any other night"". Max (Foxx) is a peaceful, even tempered L.A. cabbie who is hired by a mysterious man named Vincent (Cruise) for the night to make five stops. After a body flies from a 3rd story window and lands on Max's cab, it becomes apparent that Vincent is no ordinary passenger. In truth, Vincent is a contract hit-man who has five witnesses to a drug bust to eradicate, and one night to do it. The rest of the film follows him carrying out his five hits, Max's constant attempts to escape, and the police officer tracking them down. (Ruffalo)Collateral is impressive by it's balance between more typical action violence and excitement and the perspectives of the characters. Vincent seems to be the personification of all good parent and teacher's beliefs that all bullies are unsure of themselves, and push others around to improve their self esteem. This becomes quite clear, as Vincent is openly aggressive in conversation with Max, forces him to visit his mother in the hospital, and drags him into a jazz club, forcing him to tell his interpretation of the music. When Max begins to question Vincent about his reasons for becoming a hit-man, Vincent becomes verbally abusive, and threatens to kill him on the spot. But Vincent also becomes surprisingly philosophical, musing about the reasons behind the crime and corruption in Las Angelos. Wonderful jobs all around for making Vincent a human being instead of a heartless killing machine.Tom Cruise continues to diversify his recent film roles as he dominates the screen as cold, intense hit man Vincent, playing the role to utter perfection. Foxx also continually impresses as his unfortunate victim Max, and a strong supporting cast is supplied from Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo.One of the most visually impressive films of the year, Collateral was filmed almost entirely with a digital camera to provide a more gritty look. The effort payed off, and Mann pushes the limit between a realistic and fantastical look with the canvas of dulled purples and blues that is his vision of L.A. at night. The frequent overhead shots and Michael Mann trademark constantly changing camera angles also help to embellish the visuals, with a highly satisfying result.A good story, masterfully helmed by a great director, combined with some stellar acting and strong characterizations proves to be a winner. If you aren't deterred by violence and some strong language, I would strongly recommend seeing Collateral.-9.5/10",Collateral
100,seymourblack-1,The Hit Man & The Hostage,8,27 November 2016,"This entertaining action thriller is distinctive because of the quality of its characterisations which add so much depth and interest to an otherwise unremarkable plot. Its story about two men who travel the streets of Los Angeles during one long night in order to carry out a series of killings, focuses on the huge differences between them and their relationship which goes through numerous changes as the night progresses. At its outset, neither man realises how life-changing their shared experience will become as one guy becomes the catalyst for the profound change that the other one goes through.Good natured cab driver, Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) is meticulous in everything he does and regularly works the night-shift through choice. After high-powered federal attorney Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) gets into his cab and describes the precise route that she wants him to take to her destination in downtown L.A., Max informs her that he knows a quicker way and offers to waive her fare if he's wrong. She accepts his offer and is suitably impressed when Max is proved right. She responds positively to his unassuming manner and they share a friendly conversation during which she describes how anxious she gets before a big day in court and he tells her how therapeutic he finds it to keep a postcard picture of a tropical island behind his sun visor so that he can pause and look at it whenever he starts to feel stressed. He then gives her the postcard as he believes she needs it more than him and as she leaves his cab, Annie passes her business card to her obviously delighted driver.Max's next fare is a well-dressed man with a briefcase who surprisingly offers him $600 to chauffeur him around to the five business calls that he has to make that night. Max is conflicted because the offer is too good to refuse but also it would mean that he'd have to break his company's rules in order to drive continuously for the length of time involved. Having decided to go ahead anyway, Max takes Vincent (Tom Cruise) to his first call which is at an apartment building and parks in the adjoining alleyway. Shortly after, a dead body falls onto the roof of the cab and the normally placid driver goes into panic-mode before Vincent returns and cleans up the mess on the car and they put the body into the trunk. Vincent admits that he's a contract killer and their previously affable relationship changes abruptly as Max effectively becomes Vincent's hostage and is forced to co-operate.As they work their way through Vincent's business calls, Max becomes increasingly agitated and after the two men take time out to visit his hospitalised mother and she engages Vincent in conversation, Max takes the opportunity to run off with the hit man's briefcase and laptop which contains the names and addresses of Vincent's targets. Despite managing to destroy the laptop by throwing it under some passing traffic, Max soon finds that his ordeal is nowhere near over and has to take some extremely positive actions to get himself out of the predicament he's in and save Annie's life when he finds that her name is on Vincent's list.Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the cold-blooded hit man who ridicules Max's ambition to run his own limo business because he sees the cabbie as being a passive dreamer who'll never be anything else. Max, on the other hand, is appalled by Vincent's cynicism and philosophical outpourings which he uses to rationalise his sociopathic behaviour. Jamie Foxx is terrific and makes his character incredibly likable, decent and ultimately incredibly strong. His performance is also pivotal to the success of this movie because he's the character that its audience relates to and cares about most strongly. The supporting cast is also exceptionally good with Javier Bartem, Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo all excellent.Probably this movie's greatest quality is the way in which it incorporates so much character development without ever losing the momentum that's so important to any action thriller and this, no doubt, must have contributed greatly to its huge commercial success.",Collateral
101,Angelus2,The Greatest Movie Ever Made,10,5 December 2007,"Collateral is probably my all time favourite films. I watched this film on the plane and was thrilled to find Tom Cruise almost playing Vincent with total ease. Max is a cab driver with big dreams; one night he meets Annie a lawyer and there's definitely a spark between them both. As Max counts his earnings a man named Vincent arrives looking for a cab and leaves seeing that Max is busy; Max shouts out to Vincent and calls him in, making a big mistake; Vincent reveals he needs to make a couple of stops to close a real estate deal and soon it is revealed Vincent in fact is a contract killer. Max watches as Vincent does only what he can do best, kill, this night will change them both.Mann shows the seedy under belly of LA; and the criminals that run it. Leave yourself on 'Cruise Control' when it comes to this film, all the characters play their part perfectly no matter how small or big; the best bit of the film is the Club Fever shoot-out. In my view this is the greatest fight scene and gun play I have ever seen, gun control by Cruise is phenomenal, he oozes coolness while shooting the Korean Gangsters; the music by Paul Oakenfold is perfect it catches the whole thrill and 'cool' of Cruise.Overall this film can never be topped!",Collateral
102,Spuzzlightyear,"Fun, if you don't take it seriously..",9,22 May 2006,"I thought Collateral was a pretty surprising movie for something which I wasn't expecting much. Essentially Jamie Foxx plays a cabbie who is taken hostage by a contract killer (played by Tom Cruise) who takes him all across L.A. to do some jobs. Obviously Foxx is very reluctant, but well, when you've got a gun pointed at you..This was actually more of a fun movie, I found myself chortling in several places in this movie because it looks to me you weren't REALLY expecting this to take this too seriously, and I didn't, and I wound up enjoying this very much.Tom Cruise looks like the Wrestler Christian in this movie btw.",Collateral
103,bobsgrock,A first-rate thriller all the way.,9,4 June 2008,"This film has opened up new paths for many. The two biggest paths opened up are those for lead actors Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, who both give outstanding performances and should get similar roles in the future. AS for the film itself, this is suspense at its finest art form. It opens up simple, with very little action and lots of close-ups to get familiar with the surroundings. Then, the characters meet. Vincent (Cruise), is a killer hired to make five stops in one night, so he hires Max (Foxx), a cab driver to chauffeur him around Los Angeles until 6 am. You would think that nothing too outrageous will happen, but eventually Max finds out Vincent's line of work and the police are on their trail as well.This is a terrific film, filled with exceptional performances, excellent writing, and marvelous directing by Michael Mann that holds us in suspense just long enough to finish the story, but not too long that we begin to not care. All elements come together to make this a first-rate thriller in every way. The ending is satisfying and the scenes leading up to it are heart-pounding. See this film if only for the mesmerizing performance by Tom Cruise. Cold, ruthless, and completely lost in his work, this performance is one of the very best in modern movies.

While there is some compelling character drama, there are also a few twists which are thrown in very well. Cinematography is excellent, especially during the action sequences.

However acting by Tom Cruise is good and he was not recognized by us with his white and different style hairs. Only middle part is watchable other wise movie would be totally garbage. Jamie Foxx is not looking cab driver and acting like a cop or spy whereas he was simple a cab driver from last 12 years and he can climb building, stairs and having all knowledge which should have by a spy.

It is enormously well-written; the story works on all levels, also as an action movie. Exciting, realistic, well-acted, well-directed - impressive in every way. Everybody involved did a stellar job, resulting in an action thriller of rare quality.I rate the movie a solid 8 out of 10.

107,hnt_dnl,An edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride with a soul,10,9 March 2008,"COLLATERAL is the best film of 2004! It includes what very well may be Tom Cruise's greatest film performance, and to me, that's saying a lot. He gets too much flack for his personal life and beliefs, so Hollywood pretty much hates him and is biased against him. The irony is that 20 or so years ago (when he wasn't so strange) and when he was doing critically acclaimed films like COLOR OF MONEY, RAIN MAN, and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, the excuse for not giving him an Oscar was that 'he was too young' or 'he made so much money so he doesn't need an Oscar, too' or 'his time will come'. Well, the time is long past. He should have won for JERRY MAGUIRE, a glaring oversight in 1996. Now EVERYONE in Hollywood makes a ton of money. For some inexplicable reason, Cruise is held up to a higher standard than a lot of stars that I believe are lesser than him talent-wise. So, now they don't have that excuse not to give him the award, so the excuse now is that 'he's a nut-job'. ...Whatever!Cruise's performance in COLLATERAL is truly memorable and ironically underrated as he was not even nominated for Best Actor (as he should have been). It's one of the most fascinating performances of this decade so far. Cruise is totally believable and enthralling as a charming, lethal, detached, world-weary assassin. Cruise is not the only star of this film, though. Jamie Foxx is a revelation himself in COLLATERAL and he and Cruise form one of the best pairings in recent Hollywood history. Foxx gave Cruise a lot of credit for lifting his performance and Cruise immediately called Foxx to congratulate Foxx on his Best Actor nom for RAY (which COLLATERAL kind of set this up for; Foxx also got nominated Best Supporting Actor for COLLATERAL). You see, everyone doesn't hate Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise isn't the worst human being alive, folks! OK, back to the film. Appropriately, it starts out with our introduction to Tom Cruise's character. We don't know his name yet, but he is very unique-looking (grayish hair, sunglasses, bright suit), but doesn't stand out too much. He ""inadvertently"" bumps into another guy at LAX, which is an excuse for them to switch bags. Then this unknown cool dude heads for downtown LA. Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cab driver who is a perfectionist at his job (cab stays clean, uses the fastest/safest routes to get fares to their destination) but he has wanderlust and ideas, but fails to follow through. Max ""purposely"" picks up a fare Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith in a sexy and mature performance), who is a prosecutor. Max and Annie have an interesting conversation that really sets the tone for the rest of the convos in the film. Max drops Annie off at her office building, then Cruises character arrives by subway-rail at the same time. They cross paths briefly as she goes up the escalator, him down. He ends up being Max's next fare and we learn his name is ""Vincent"". What do you wanna bet that's not his real name?!Vincent needs Max to drive him around LA at 5 stops, saying that he is a salesman and has dealings with 5 ""clients"". He gives him $600 to do this. At the first stop, while Max is waiting, a dead body falls from the apartment complex above on Max's cab and he realizes that Vincent killed him and that he is a contract killer. From here on, Max is Vincent's prisoner and he is compelled to drive him to his destinations. The 2 men establish a kind of uneasy simpatico during the course of the rest of the film. Interestingly, both men are professional when it comes to their jobs, but Vincent has found his calling and Max has not. Vincent is focused, confident and without hesitation, while Max, personality-wise, is rather shy and under-confident. The core difference is that Vincent has a kind of charm and ease with how he deals with people but he is utterly detached from developing any deep connection with anyone, while Max is more shy, but he has the capacity to care.There is a parallel story to Vincent and Max's, with a Latino cop Det. Fanning (excellently played by Mark Ruffalo) working with his police cronies and the FBI trying to figure out what is going on with the killings. Along for the ride are a bunch of supporting characters, some of which are basically cameo or one-scene roles, but you remember them long after you've seen the movie: the aforementioned Pinkett-Smith as Annie, Max's mother (scene-stealer Irma P. Hall), saxophone-player Daniel (exceptional work by veteran actor Barry Shabaka Henley), Vincent's employer Felix (superbly performed by Javier Bardem). Really, this cast is brilliant, all unique, believable characters.Michael Mann directed the film and, in my opinion, this is his GREATEST accomplishment as a director. The film has an uber-cool, leisurely, atmospheric feel and tone which helps drive the story. The eclectic music in the film is perfectly placed and timed and places a unique signature for each scene. There are many great moments that stay with you long after you have seen the film. The true genius of this flick is that while the story idea/plot is 100% convoluted and unbelievable, the way that the situations play out are very realistic. A thrilling joyride of a movie that is contender for best film of the decade...THE END!",Collateral
108,one9eighty,"The ride is great, the destination a little less so.",7,23 December 2020,"Directed by Michael Mann with writing by Stuart Beattie, this 2004 stars Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Mark Ruffalo. It has a runtime of about 2 hours and is rated-R due it's violence and language. Made with a budget of $65 million this film became a commercial success grossed over $220 million at the box office. Since then it has gone on to gain cult success too with many of the plaudits complimenting the acting by Cruise and Foxx, and the character development being shown off.LA cab driver Max drops off one customer picks up another. During the course of the last ride he had developed a bond with the customer who turned out to be a US Justice Department prosecutor. His next customer turns out to be equally interesting; Vincent, a property developer who wants to hire him for the night for a flat fee of $600 with an additional $100 if he gets to the airport on time. Vincent claims to be in the city for one night only to close some deals and get some signatures, as soon as he's done he'll be leaving. With Max dreaming about one day having a limousine business he reluctantly takes the deal on, but at the first stop it becomes clear that Vincent isn't all he claims to be. After a body crashes out the top floor window of an apartment and hits the cabbies roof Vincent confesses to being a hit-man. With Max knowing this he is trapped into completing the fair or losing his life. Max tries his hardest to talk his way out of the dilemma, but with the FBI and LAPD on his trail it's becoming more difficult, even more so with hit-man Vincent learning all about Max's life. With the discovery of the last targets, Max feels he is forced into action to change the outcome of the night.This is an interesting and action packed film which presents some really good performances from its leads. Tom Cruise is as far away from the all-American good guy that you can get as ruthless hit-man Vincent. He is cold and callously menacing and really projects an authentic bad guy performance. Jamie Foxx goes from easy going and cool to show his characters truth of bewilderment and impotence, before going full circle and learning to stand up for himself rather than let life drift him by. Both actors characters work wonderfully together and they really share some good screen time and dialogue. They are given a script which, while it appears simple enough, is transformed due to weight of delivery given to it. The pace of the film is set fairly early on, and as soon as the ride starts it is a genuine roller-coaster - there are more calm moments where the characters are sat down and talking; and then the pace shifts up as the roller-coaster descends a summit and people are being killed on-screen. Collateral is the first feature film to use Viper FilmStream High-Definition Cameras, which have added a uniquely beautiful look to the film; it feels both cleaner and dirtier at the same time. Sound wise the film is sparce till later on the film so that dialogue shines through. Later however the score reflects the film fantastically; starting with soothing music, riding through more chaotic jazz, hitting banging club music later on, until there is louder and faster music at the climax of the film to really finish things off.I really enjoyed this film. I wasn't sure that I would but as soon as I sat down to it I was drawn in with intrigue, which quickly turned to suspense as the characters started to develop. I liked the way the film came full circle on itself with Jada Pinkett-Smith's character, while it was slightly predictable it was still a fun ride getting there and seeing how it would happen. The acting in this film is as good as any I have seen and credit must go to Cruise and Foxx for the characters they brought to life - especially Cruise who usually brings us all-American hero's but has somehow given us a cold machine of a bad guy hit-man.I have to be honest and while I have been generally complimentary about the film there are a few negatives too - there are some moments that are there for show or just for the way they sound on film. Some of the symbolism that Mann drives towards in creating his vision aren't always clear to the entire audience. Some of the things that Vincent let's happen are sloppy for a trained and seasoned hit-man, and Max's character sometimes let's himself walk into obvious set-ups. The ending of the film isn't as strong as it could be and things kind of get wrapped up quickly just to end the film; the Ruffalo getting shot; LAPD and the FBI kind of ending their pursuit; Max being able to take down a trained assassin so easily.Putting these things aside though this film is still a gritty and tense ride which is enjoyable to its audience. I am happy to recommend this film as a good way to pass a few hours; it's engaging and fun; it looks good and there score is great; and Cruise/ Foxx and in fact the rest of the cast too, give great performances.7/10",Collateral
109,Stampsfightclub,Exciting ending to an acceptable crime story,8,12 September 2006,"This Oscar nominated thriller came highly recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad to have watched it after a mixed beginning and middle with a fantastic ending.Jamie Foxx (Ali, Ray) stars as lonely cab driver Max who wishes for that something else in life but what he gets is not what he has in mind. Foxx is juxtaposed with Tom Cruise (Magnolia, Mission Impossible) who plays a hit-man bent on doing his job as quickly as possible, without any interruptions.Placing two very different characters side by side was genius. The very unstable character of Foxx was beautifully portrayed and he definitely deserved his Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Foxx's movements are brilliant. He shivers when troubled, cries when disturbed and releases harsh dialogue when frustrated.Place him next to the confidant, stylish and aggressive figure of Tom Cruise and you have one of the best partnerships in crime thriller history.For me personally so far this is my favourite Cruise performance. Mission Impossible II failed to convince me and the acceptable performances in The Firm and the Colour of money didn't make him my favourite actor but from this performance I have finally realised his potential as he portrays the bad guy stereotype beautifully. Aggressive, harsh, business like, somewhat humorous and direct throughout he has brilliant and the pair made this film what it was.The story was very good. when in the cab at the beginning when the customers are talking general you feel very involved and its very sociable and reflects a real situation, making I believable and acceptable for the audience.A lot of actions such as Cruise's job may seem clichéd and predictable to some but for me I loved the ending. The film turned around and became fast, upbeat, more involved and riveting stuff and is worth watching just for that.Having the whole film more or less in the cab works wonders because audiences aren't then involved all over the place but at times is exaggerated and not acceptable because it tags on too long.Anyone who loves crime and an exciting plot it is a must watch for you But it's the acting that captivates the story, particularly from Foxx who is at his best once again 8/10",Collateral
110,Bob-45,Maybe I Expected Too Much,7,8 January 2005,"I was genuinely excited to watch collateral. The previews looked so promising. Tom Cruise playing a bad guy was just too much to pass up. I've liked Jamie Foxx ever since ""In Living Color,"" and admired Michael Mann since ""Thief"". Sorry to say, I can understand why ""Collateral"" barely broke even. Despite fine performances, I never felt drawn in, only an observer of a slick, manipulative movie. Some of the dialogue was nearly unintelligable, which also didn't help. Also, there seemed only minimal chemistry between Foxx and Jada Pinkett, possibly due to the contrived opening scenes between them. Mann also should've used a better known actor to play the undercover cop that tries to help Foxx, and maybe a lesser known actress to play Pinkett's role, given her passive efforts in the story.WARNING: SPOILERS Yellow cabs with broken windows stick out like a sore thumb. I know, my first day in LA in the seventies, I was stopped ten minutes after I got on the road in my car with a broken windshield. Why didn't Cruise find another car, even another cab instead of running the risk of being detected? The worst thing about ""Collateral"" is the ending. Jada Pinket, as a prosecutor, is an officer of the court, and she committed a criminal act when she and Jamie left Cruise's dead body on the train. Why didn't they just pull the emergency handle? Besides, don't LA Metro trains have TV cameras in the cars? Further, Cruise may have still had the memory stick on his person. There was a chance the LCD unit left in Foxx's cab would fail, costing him the only physical evidence that Cruise was ""Vincent"".END OF SPOILERS Despite these whoppers of logic, ""Collateral"" is still an entertaining movie. Just don't expect a great one.I give ""Collateral"" a weak ""7"".",Collateral
111,jon.h.ochiai,They do this for a living-- Good for Us,10,16 August 2004,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are electrifying in Michael Mann's powerful ""Collateral"". Director Mann brushes his canvas from a crisp, taut, and dark shockingly humorous screenplay by Stuart Beattie. Beattie has an acute ear for smart dialog, and dramatic twists. Michael Mann is a master storyteller, whose nocturnal Los Angeles is a visually stunning and enthralling character onto itself. ""Collateral"" spans one night. Mann's narrative is lean, intense, and transforms into a eloquent character study that is unexpectedly poignant. Mann also evokes amazing performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise, playing against type, is powerful as Vincent. This is perhaps his best and most chilling performance. Mann and Beattie casually open ""Collateral"" as a collision of fate. We observe Vincent (Cruise), who arrives in LAX. Cruise looks differently: grayed hair and beard, gaunt, and icy cold. Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a cab driver in L.A. for 12 years. On this particular night he picks up a beautiful District Attorney, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Max tells Annie about his dreams of starting his own limousine service. She tells Max about her anxiety prior to her opening arguments on big court cases. Their talk is comfortable and flirtatious. Annie gives Max her business card. Before he can argue himself out of giving this gorgeous woman a call, Vincent gets in his cab. Vincent says he is in L.A. for a real estate deal, and has 5 stops to make. He will give Max $600 for the night, and a $100 bonus if he drives the entire night. Max reluctantly agrees. However, after a body crashes onto Max's cab, he realizes that he made a bad choice. Max says, ""You killed him?"" Vincent replies unflinchingly, ""No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him."" Yes, Vincent is a contract killer. Apparently, Vincent's ""real estate deal"" involves terminating witnesses in a major drug cartel indictment. Max, himself may become the victim of Vincent's collateral damage. Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor. His Max is doing his best to survive, and keep his wits about him. Foxx is believable as a man thrust into a seemingly no-win situation. Max at the beginning is holding on for dear life, being that Vincent is a sociopath and expert killer. Foxx as Max actually grows stronger from this unusual partnership with Vincent. The fact that Max brings along Vincent when he visits his Mom is a masterful touch. The captivating scenes in the cab with Foxx and Cruise, just talking, demonstrate their magical chemistry. Tom Cruise is powerful. One must acknowledge the risk he took in playing a cold professional killer which is so against type. His choice to play Vincent as a charismatic, intelligent, and charming character just slightly off moral north is brilliant. He never overplays the villain. Instead his Vincent has all the symptoms of a hero, but skewed toward darkness. Cruise gives Vincent an air of nobility, shrouded in manic rationalization. He tells Max, the people that he kills are really criminals. Cruise slowly unveils Vincent's past as the movie progresses in such a natural manner. Killing is a business for Vincent-- there is nothing personal. Cruise defends the line where Vincent's behavior is never justified, only understood. As Vincent, Cruise is both credible and deadly.Vincent is a professional cold hearted killer, who is terrifying. Cruise intensely trained for the fighting sequences, and they are performed expertly. Vincent dispatches his victims with a controlled brutality, and great style. The ""hit"" at the Asian nightclub is simply stunning. Tom Cruise's intensity and charisma are leveraged effectively in ""Collateral"".The final twist in ""Collateral"" is effective. Michael Mann's action movie, character study works on so many levels. He pulls the audience in from the first frame, and we can't take a breath until the last. Jada Pinkett Smith is very strong and charming as Annie. She holds her own with Foxx and Cruise. Jamie Foxx is a great actor. Tom Cruise gives a commanding and mesmerizing performance. He deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work here. And ""Collateral"" deserves to be seen.",Collateral
112,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Quite the suspenseful thriller, Tom Cruise pulls off his part eerily well and Jamie Foxx portrays a quiet hero excellently.",9,8 March 2019,"Having seen this film many years ago when it came out, a recent re-watching of the Blu-ray at home with my wife has cemented itself as a tight and well-done film. While most action films like to confuse the audience with shaky cameras and quick cuts, this one starts calm and builds to an exciting conclusion.Of course, it's not just a steady and methodical thriller, it loops back on itself, tying up all loose ends and bookending the whole plot in a neat little package. Each of the segments where they drive to the next destination gives a chance for excellent character building as well as giving the audience a break from the brief moments of action (which steadily get longer and more intense as the film progresses). Along with the overhead tracking shots and expert use of depth of field, this film almost borders on art. These are what good action films should be.What's also interesting, upon a second viewing almost 14 years later, is how many recognizable actors are in this film. Some of them are bit parts, and they don't quite look like their more famous character portrayals, but inevitably you'll go, ""Isn't that so-and-so?"" From Jason Statham at the beginning, Jada Pinkett Smith on either end, Mark Ruffalo with some ""ethnic-looking"" facial hair, and Javier Bardem years before No Country for Old Men (2007). Most of these actors had not hit their stride quite yet, but Jamie Foxx definitely gave a great portrayal of a character who undergoes plenty of superb character development (which is partly why he was nominated for this film, along with Ray (2004) in the same year).Quite the suspenseful thriller, Tom Cruise pulls off his part eerily well and Jamie Foxx portrays a quiet hero excellently. I give Collateral 4.5 stars out of 5.",Collateral
113,Holt344,"Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller with brilliant writing and acting, a must watch",9,15 September 2021,"Collateral follows Max, a Los Angeles cab driver and his customer Vincent. When offered a high fare for driving to several locations, Max agrees but soon finds himself taken hostage by Vincent who turns out to be a hitman on a contract killing spree. The two stars are played by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. The supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Bardem and Bruce McGill. If not for the brilliant writing Stuart Beattie in terms of characters, dialogue and overall story. Also the astonishing and incredible work Michael Mann did in terms of producing and directing. The film wouldn't work. It's an astonishing work of cinema. But what makes these two main character work and the situation Max finds himself in when a contract killer is one of his fares, it's the two actors and the huge amount of work they did going into the roles. We got Max who are a kind and relatable character working a normal job with dreams, then we got Vincent who're a cold-blooded killer who's great if not the best at his job. Both are written so perfectly and human but also brilliantly acted by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. It's one of the reasons why I rewatched this film.Collateral was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2004, and I agree. There's so many things that the film do right and almost nothing it does wrong, but it isn't a masterpiece. Jamie Foxx received an oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor; while film editors Jim Miller and Paul Rubell were nominated for Best Film Editing. The editing is impressive and so is the cinematography.Though an interesting and original story with actors doing some terrific acting, plus Tom Cruise's performance as a villain. The great character development and brilliant action sequences, there are lots of things that this film does flawlessly. It is sadly not a masterpiece as the pacing and second half of the film doesn't hold up to the brilliance of the first half. It's mostly how the film could have been trimmed down to a lower length, but Michael Mann created a fascinating and great film.",Collateral
114,Hollywood_Yoda,"Collateral, What a Cool Movie",10,12 January 2005,"This movie is about a guy who rides around in a taxi all night, killing people. Michael Mann comes up with some astonishing ideas. Tom Cruise, as a gray haired man, who murders people for a living, is really spectacular. The graphic nature of this movie is somewhat better than most action films of our day.The scripting was very good also, in that it follows through and never, never, slows down. That is something I like about good films. They are fast, and they get the job done.The cabbie, Max, played here by Jamie Foxx delivers a stupendous role as the man who must drive Tom (Vincent) around to the murders. Until Max learns that Vincent has plans to kill the woman who Max has feelings for.Maybe I am telling too much, but if you want to see a fast paced action/thriller, this is the one for you. I give it 10 of 10.",Collateral
115,SmileysWorld,Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.,7,27 January 2005,"If Alfred Hitchcock were alive and making movies today,I firmly feel that they would look something like this excellent thriller from Michael Mann.Tom Cruise makes an excellent turn going against type as a hired killer.Also excellent are Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith in their supporting roles.It's very rare that you can compare any modern day thrillers with the likes of Hitchcock,but I feel safe in saying that he would give a thumbs up here.It has enough plot twists and turns to keep the audience on the edge,and again,Cruise does a great job of making us hate him,if only for a couple of hours.It's definitely worth the rental, and worth buying and placing with your Hitchcock favorites.",Collateral
116,gregsrants,Another feather in Mann's cap,8,8 August 2004,"There are few directors that I would consider to have a resume that is flawless. Not Steven Spielberg (sorry, Hook and Always jump off the page too quickly. Not Ridley Scott (1492 and Legend bring back nightmares) and even the great Stanley Kubrick had his Eyes Wide Shut. However, there are a few directors who have yet to have that career back step due to a colossal misjudgment. Michael Mann is one of those directors.He might not be a household recollection, but with credits including Heat, The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans and now Collateral under his legacy belt, it is only a matter of time.Collateral stars Tom Cruise as Vincent. We first meet Vincent in an airport when he discreetly exchanges briefcases with another unsavory character. Vincent is not the Tom Cruise that we have come to know. Here, the character has gray hair and a matching beard. He wears a gray suit and his eyes look locked-in to his objective. We first meet Max (Jamie Foxx) in his cab as he picks up fares and shares dreams of an island getaway. Max is a 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles' taxi force and can ramble off directions, streets and ETA's quicker than most of us can name our own family members. He has dreams of starting up his own limousine fleet and the night had started like any other.Max and Vincent both meet innocently enough. Vincent is looking for a ride, and Max just became available. Vincent reveals that he has five stops to make and offers Max $600 to rent his services for the evening. Although against company policy, Max accepts the more than gracious offer, and an evening rampage is then born.At their first stop, Max is minding his own business when a body falls on the roof of his car from a 4th floor window. Max's emotional confusion over the event is tempered by the calm demeanor of the now reappearing Vincent. In but a few moments, Max puts the pieces of the murdering puzzle together and realizes that he has been driving a killer to his prey. This realization transforms Max into a victim who is essentially kidnapped and forced to drive from kill to kill until the evening's work is complete. The movie then follows the travels of the two participants as investigators and feds try and get a jump ahead of the contracted killer and as Max tries desperately to free himself from his abetting actions. On paper, the storyline might not jump out and bite you like a Discovery Channel shark attack, but in the hands of director Mann, this movie sizzles with action and with as much mood as I have seen on screen since Kill Bill Vol. 2. Tom Cruise continues to take on roles that are completely opposite from his preceding film vehicle, and as contract killer Vincent, he is a force to be reckoned. His fast draw hands and his ruthless and unemotional attachment to his victims would give Hannibal Lector cause to write him fan mail. When two street thugs take Vincent's briefcase from the cab, his resolve is quick and decisive, leaving both men dead, one being shot as Vincent is already walking back to the taxi and focusing on the jobs still to be carried out. As educated as he is implacable, Vincent justifies his actions to Max by comparing Rwandan villagers who were slaughtered to his one take down of a known criminal and how our Western lack of physical reaction to the news of tens of thousands being wiped out in other countries makes us a form of hypocrite. Ying to his yang, Max is the conflicted 'good guy'. He is pressured without a successful exit strategy into helping Vincent on his evening killing spree and when efforts to escape fail, he beings to inquire as to the mechanisms behind the killers intentions in almost an innocent way of passing the time while taking ones mind of his criminal involvement. Max eventually reaches a breaking point that is a believable reaction to a night of extraordinary circumstances and soon after he finds himself as the only one between Vincent and the final target. Watching Cruise and Foxx banter and bludgeon, I could not imagine any other pairing to successful pull this thriller off as believable. Early reports were that Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler were both in consideration for Vincent and Max, and thinking of those two behemoths of Hollywood in the similar circumstances, just doesn't work with even the most inventive imaginations.Much like Mann's Heat, there are great face-to-face confrontations, secondary characters that don't become overbearing and actions sequences that explode in Dolby Surround Sound. Where Heat had the DeNiro/Pacino talk in the restaurant, a cheating wife and a shootout that still stands as one of the best ever filmed, Collateral counters with a great conversation between Vincent and a jazz bar owner, cops who don't smother the screen in their revelations and a shoot out in an L.A. hot spot that had the audience squirm towards the edge of their seats. In a summer that has been better than expected with an eclectic group of theatrical entries, Collateral might just be the best of them all. Thrill seekers can revel in that week over week, we have bettered the format in bringing The Bourne Supremacy, The Manchurian Candidate and now Collateral to our local playhouses. Collateral in all likelihood will not garnish any trophy consideration come the end of the year, but that is not due to the product. Mann has cast perfectly and directed through an evening in Los Angeles with the precision of a brain surgeon. And now that Collateral has offered him another feather for his cap, I think he can finally make that Indian headdress that other directors can only dream of.",Collateral
117,Rogue-32,The Tominator,8,7 August 2004,"Michael Mann has directed a lot of films I haven't liked, but Collateral, I am very pleased to say, is not one of them. This is a fantastic movie, with superb performances from its two leads, Jamie Foxx (soon to be a major star, I believe, thanks to this performance and his starring role as Ray Charles in the upcoming Ray), and Tom Cruise, who is perfect as the killing machine I affectionately named the Tominator around four-fifths of the way through the film. Collateral is sophisticated, clever, sordid, witty, outrageous, stunningly visual and diabolically intense all at the same time; chalk it up to Mann's penchant for showing off the best and worst elements of his terrain - in this case, it's Los Angeles, and every scene is perfectly shot (no pun intended) and beautifully enacted. There is a slick little plot twist toward the end - a precocious little plot twist, I call it, because technically we shoulda seen it coming (and perhaps a lot of viewers did), but I was so caught up in all the splendid distractions that I didn't realize where the film was heading, but it was one of those twists, that, when you DO realize, you find yourself literally giddy with excitement at how it's going to play out. This hasn't happened to me in a Michael Mann film before. And also thumbs up for the casting of the great Javier Bardem as Felix -- his Santa Claus story was priceless.",Collateral

119,agmoldham,Slick not special,5,25 September 2004,"Mann is one of the premiere movie makers of today. I can't help but think that he's slightly more interested in the craft than the end product. It's hard not to be impressed by this visually, but the script and arguably the acting are not to the same standard.The story is almost solely about the interactions between Vincent (Cruise playing the bad guy for a change) and Max (Foxx) who is a mild mannered taxi driver. The longer he spends with Vincent the more streetwise Max becomes, but this doesn't quite ring true, since I'm sure any taxi driver that's worked for 12 years will have had a few nasty moments.This film makes LA look far more beautiful than it really is and it's quite clear that Mann loves the place.

A nice script, good tension, and Tom cruise making a good job, which is quite a surprise (he seems to give his best only when playing amoral characters -maybe he identifies more with'em-).Michael Mann knows exactly what the audience wants, but that doesn't mean he has to make second rate products. Not at all. When it's tome to film a big project with big money, and some stars, Michael is the ""mann"". Not everything is perfect in ""Collateral"" though... The character of the girl (Jada Pinckett) is pretty diffuse and forced. One of the best films of the year as far as the commercial movies is concerned.*My rate: 7.5/10",Collateral
122,TheNorthernMonkee,"slow to start, but overall well made",8,24 January 2005,"SPOILERS There's a well known fact about Tom Cruise that whenever he makes a film, his face is always dominant on all posters. Whilst not always deserved (out performed by Ken Watanabe in 2003's ""The Last Samurai""), Cruise's box office power is well known and richly rewarded. Once again, this is shown in 2004's ""Collateral"". Slow to start, this film is a superb thriller which keeps you on the edge of your seat for vast periods at a time.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a ""part-time"" taxi driver with plans for the future. One night after dropping off lawyer Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) at her offices, Max picks up his next fare. This time however, the fare is the mysterious Vincent (Cruise), and this encounter will change Max's life forever.""Collateral"" is made by two key aspects. Firstly, an absolutely superb performance by Foxx keeps the film moving as his character struggles to cope with the lifestyle of the assassin Vincent. Outperforming Cruise in a film designed for the actor's face, Foxx dominates and is well deserving of awards.Foxx alone does not make this film however. The crucial part about ""Collateral"" is the direction and production of Michael Mann.Mann, who's most famous producing roles are probably ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"", gives this film an amazing sense of light as Foxx and Cruise drive around LA. Whilst it is definitely true that his style is difficult to get used to, after 30 minutes of the film, this style of camera angle and lighting grow on the audience until a stunning final half.Ultimately there are definite flaws with ""Collateral"", not least in it's slow beginning. However, once the film begins to get going, some amazing lighting and superb acting by Foxx, keep the audience focused and tense. As a film, ""Collateral"" is brilliant and definitely worth viewing. Sadly however, it relies on the audience surviving the slow beginning. It's worth it though.",Collateral

During and after seeing ""Collateral"" (2004), a film by veteran and master director Michael Mann, I was thoroughly impressed. From the sharp story/screenplay (with its ingenious dialogue) to the acting by Tom Cruise as Vincent and Jamie Foxx as Max, this is one thrilling ride (pardon the pun!). The interplay between them not only works really well, but you actually begin to understand how both Vincent and Max think, even to the point you start to feel sympathetic for both characters. The cinematography is top-notch too, as well as the music. A true gem - a 10 out of 10.As a special note: though I think Tom Cruise in some films gives an okay performance, there are times like in this film where I see his true genius come out - this was a role that was the right fit for him, a GREAT performance!",Collateral
124,FilmOtaku,Excellent thriller,8,17 February 2005,"Sometimes serendipity can be a blessing, and other times a curse. Max (Foxx) a Los Angeles cab driver, finds that serendipity isn't going his way when he picks up Vincent (Cruise), a seemingly normal looking man in a suit who asks him to become his personal chauffeur for the evening while he makes some business calls. Max is reluctant, but the $600 he is offered makes it a lucrative evening, so he agrees. Unfortunately, while sitting and waiting for Vincent at the first stop, a body comes crashing down onto his cab, and Max realizes that Vincent's blasé and no-nonsense approach to dealing with this certainly unusual situation isn't just good coping skills. This is just the first stop of five, but other people either become involved, or get in the way, of Vincent's spree and essentially become collateral damage. All the while, Max is trying to not only save his own life, but when he figures out who one of Vincent's future victims is, he has to try to save theirs as well.I absolutely loved this film. I am naturally drawn to films where actors take on roles that are set against their regular ""persona"", and since I am generally ambivalent to Tom Cruise to begin with, I was anxious to see him play a bad guy. He did an excellent job portraying Vincent. With his gray hair and sort of ill-fitting suit, he looked like Jeffrey Wigand, a character from one of Michael Mann's earlier films, going medieval. His lack of emotion and constant drive reminded me of Yul Brunner's role in ""Westworld"". He gets knocked down; he gets up and continues after you without hardly breaking his stride. Cruise was intense and frightening, and I thought he did some fantastic work. Jamie Foxx also was very good as Max; he was able to do something very important in his role (at least for me since his roles in every other film and television show I had seen him in up until this point other than ""Any Given Sunday"" made me cringe) and that is make me forget that he is Jamie Foxx. I am not so shallow of a person that I will not like someone no matter what role they play, but I kind of had Jamie Foxx in my ""Jim Carrey Category"", where I won't watch his comedy, but will give his other roles a shot.Michael Mann's direction is just excellent. The slick colors, sleek digital cinematography and urban settings were just perfect for the script. The pacing of the film was perfect; there was not one moment where I felt like a scene dragged, particularly toward the end of the film. He also worked in some great subplots without drowning us in exposition (the stories of the cab driver from a couple of years ago, Max's mother, his business) which made the film entirely believable. (Which is kind of frightening.) I had to kind of figure out how the ending happened the way it did, but it wasn't so outlandish that I was irritated or anything. I also was kind of questioning the use of the hard rock music in the soundtrack, but in my opinion there's a silver lining to that as well; how often do we hear music like that during a film like this? I wish I had gotten around to seeing this film on the big screen because I think that on the big screen, with digital sound it would have been breathtaking. With a script this good, direction this dead-on and performances that are this strong, one can see that it is a strong Oscar year for the major categories since this one did not garner any major award but a supporting actor nod for Foxx, but I guess that says something for both the offerings we had in 2004 and subsequently, the strength of this film to stand out as one of the best among many great works. ""Collateral"" gets a very strong 8/10 from me.--Shelly",Collateral
125,EijnarAmadeus,Highly exciting heat of the night thriller,8,14 March 2005,"Michael Mann is a director of characters with depth, dialog of meaning and brilliance - great movies like Heat and The Insider shows both of these elements. Heat telling the story of two basically very alike men, on each side of the law - cop vs crook, Pacino vs De Niro. In his latest thriller he offers a relationship between a pro, dangerous, smooth talking assassin and a pro, man of dreams LA cab driver, Cruise vs. Foxx.COLLATERAL is, to be said; one of the best movies of 2004. It kicks off and the movie has started it's rush down the highway before we literally remember the title fading onto the screen. And that's the way of the movie, and that's the way of the whole genre in ways - it's a nonstop tale with nonstop action happening. Whether there's not being fired bullets or anything, may be just talking - the storyline is so intense and already dramatic that there can't be placed any relaxing moments between the pure action. Tom Cruise entering the scene early off wearing a expensive gray suit, featuring a white shirt and black shades, and for the first time Cruise having his hair in a gray color way - making him look awfully much older than in his previous films. Jamie Foxx acts superbly as the cab driver really not getting anywhere with his life, planning everything but not realizing them, though being a marvelous taxi driver he gets stuck in this nightmare in the heat of the night.And Michael Mann has done a fantastic job there; capturing the intensity and excitement of the whole night scene. Using brilliant camera use flashing the colors switching elegant and suspiciously from black, gray, brown, violet and blue - this giving the movie a very dark mood in a director top-notch way. As COLLATERAL introduces us to a very unlucky night scene, the whole City Of Angels falls into a creepy hole only offering the clubs, cops, traffic and crime.Max is a Los Angeles cab driver, having big dreams about a limo-company, through it seems never to really be a reality. Being just another working night, he's just dropped off a charming female as a smooth talking man named Vincent enters his cab. Having five stops to make, to meet some friends - it all seems to go well until it's soon revealed that Vincent is a assassin, and that the five stops are all targets to be killed...The whole idea isn't that original, but is a very good thrill and off course with Michael Mann driving the taxi it's tensed and very exciting. It's just as entertaining as Speed, and as the movie takes leap back and forth as things happens, the movie is a extremely tight tale. Tom Cruise doing his Vincent in a rock hard, greatly way showing sides of himself that's seen before, but not in this intense load. Jamie Foxx also acts in a absolutely great way, and with this swooping together COLLATERAL is a nonstop action/thriller offering what you expect and a bit more! Scene for elegance and mood to be noted; as two wolfs walk over the street in front of Max's cab.",Collateral

127,jdkraus,"A true scary, nightmare thriller for cab drivers!",9,9 August 2004,"i really enjoyed this film. it is of the better of most films made these days, on the top ten best of this year's best! The two performacnes of Jamie Foxx and tom Cruise are extreme! all the movies i've seen of Cruise, he has a played a hero who can be a wimp. However, Collateral and The Last Samurai are two of his best films. these films changed my thoughts about him dramatically from dreadful, to awesome! I honestly have never heard of Jamie Foxx, but this film proved he is useful. Now director Michael Mann, i never thought he would do this kind of movie, but no one better could have done it than the Mann. His crime film HEAT however is still slightly better than this film, mainly because do of actors. Cruise, Foxx, and Smith saved the film, the rest I don't care for. I enjoyed the action sequences, the talks of philosophy, the music, and the story itself of two totally different personalities colliding into an act of violence. 9/10 for Collateral! Watch out cab drivers for a scare!",Collateral
128,TheOtherFool,A tad boring movie with a silly ending. What's all the fuss about?,6,4 November 2004,"Cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) finds himself caught with psychopath-hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) in his taxi on a night with murder in the air...Vincent is doing his thing with a couple of witnesses of some sort of crime (I forget what it was), and his last stop is procecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Now it's up to Max to stop that.Not really an amazing storyline, and to be honest, not really a special movie in any way. Foxx is pretty convincing in his role, but Cruise is nothing special and the ending is rather strange and silly. It's almost laughable when Cruise does his Terminator/Matrix thing on the subway...Movie has some compelling moments (the scene in the nightclub comes to mind) but is surely not the instant classic some people mistake it for. 6/10.",Collateral
129,tomimt,Cruise shows what he's made of.,8,1 June 2006,"I must confess, that I am not a big fan of Michael Mann. He knows how to do films, there is no question about that, but sometimes he looses his control and his movies become pointedly annoying in some sense, like 'Heat', which was like a masturbatory tease of building a situation, where Pacino and Deniro were on a screen together.And yet 'Collateral' is very similar to Mann's other movies, but it still is different, as the pacing is far more faster, as the story happens during one night. But Mann still takes his time to reflect upon his characters from metaphorical scenes and images. The trademark music video scenes are intact and the action masterfully directed. The actors are good and the atmosphere is gripping. 'Collateral' is, even though the story line lefts some room for improvement, perhaps the best of Mann.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver who picks up a fare, who introduces himself as Vincent (Tom Cruise) and makes him a offer of 700 bucks, if Max just drives him around the city for this evening. The thing is, that Vincent is a hit-man on a job.Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx do a astonishing job, and Cruise hasn't been this good since 'Magnolia': he's a perfect bad guy, a role he should play more often, as his calm, maniac approach on Vincet is extremely intriguing. Foxx is perfect counterpart for Cruise, and it is evident that he actually is the better actor of the two, but Cruise is the one who dominates the movie.The only thing not up to par in this tale is the plot line, which lets the infamous lady faith to do far too much convenient circumstances. It also leaves unexplained why so weathered hit-man as Vincent suddenly seems to forget to guard his back. But this is just nitpicking on a movie that is in its own right a good one. It is rare to see action oriented movie, that really works in other aspects besides the action scenes themselves.",Collateral
130,Christian_Dimartino,A superb thriller. Tom Cruise is electrifying.,10,9 July 2010,"Tom Cruise does some of his best work as a contract killer in Michael Mann's astonishing thriller(ha that kind of rhymed), Collateral. Cruise kind of sunk down in the year 2006. But now, after i've seen some of his films, such as Magnolia(his best performance), Tropic thunder, even Knight and day, Tom Cruise has grown on me. And he is a terrific actor. His work in Mann's Collateral is electrifying, and incredibly memorable.For once, I actually wasn't that annoyed by Jamie Foxx. I actually liked him in his Oscar nominated role. Though he didn't deserve it over Cruise, who's last nomination was for Magnolia. And didn't win. Injustice. Anyways, to the story plot.Foxx plays a cabbie who has dreams of doing other things. But never expects what happens when he meets Vincent(played by Tom Cruise). Vincent wants him to take him to numerous places and return him to L.A.X. by about 6 in the morning. Things go well... for a couple of minutes. Then he finds out that Vincent is a contract killer. And he tries to escape. Eventually, the cops are after him instead of Vincent, and even worse: He finds out that Vincent is going to kill a girl that he met earlier that day(played by Jada Pinkett Smith).Collateral is a very engaging thriller. But it would be nothing without Cruise. Cruise can be funny, Cruise can be menacing, Cruise can be dramatic. That is everything that he does. And he does it so well. Cruise even scared me. Not in the way that he did on Opra either.Cruise is a wonderful actor. Definitely should've been nominated for this film, and we all know he deserved the Oscar for Magnolia(i'm not even saying that cause it's my favorite movie). Overall, Collateral is a well acted, fast paced, fun, funny, electrifying,dazzling thriller that will have you hooked in the blink of an eye. This is a film that started the career of Javier Bardem, who is also menacing when he doesn't even try. Overall, this is a great film.Collateral: A+",Collateral
131,bopdog,Brilliant directing and acting. Cruise and Foxx proved themselves masters; the Oscar nom is well deserved!,10,7 February 2005,"Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise both proved they are real, actual actors, and not mere 'celebrities' or cutsie poster boys. This movie is a tad dark, but it is very exciting. For me, there was never a moment where the violence seemed gratuitous. That is, there were many moments throughout the film where a 'typical' thriller action movie would have resorted to familiar clichés. Here, Jamie Foxx's character really seemed to react in the same way most of us would have as well. And Tom Cruise, cursed by overly cute looks, has always run the danger of being smarmy, but has avoided it for the most part. In this movie, that danger was never felt, nor ever sensed. For me, that proves that his acting and his portrayal was so solid, and so real, and so right on the money, that its genuineness and veracity were never in doubt.Overall, this movie is violent, although not gruesome. It is directed and acted with subtlety and finesse. It is worthy of Foxx's best supporting actor Oscar nomination--- although Cruise deserved one too. But hey, that's the way it goes, sometimes. Paul Giamati deserved one as well for 'Sideways', along with his nominated co-star, Thomas Hayden Church, but didn't get one this year. I gave this a 10 out of 10.",Collateral

Finally another film that has the action and suspense i always crave for, yet is not absurd and idiotic. Cruise gives one of his best performances, while Jamie Foxx was great as well. The direction and script is perfect in this film, very entertaining, very well written, with a great score as well.

133,gigan-92,"""It's only a dead guy.""",10,10 July 2012,"I'm starting to more and more notice Michael Mann. I know many see him as merely a director of action films and while many of his films sport dazzling spectacles of bullets and body blows, he makes sure characterization is first and foremost. That's the focal point of this movie: character. I've watched the documentaries exemplifying how much of a background Mann gives the characters in addition to Stuart Beattie's original screenplay and its astonishing. Of course, on camera only so much can be put in to keep the film streamlined. That's Mann's style; still each character feels very fleshed out due to not just the dialogue but their subtle mannerisms.Jamie Foxx honestly surprised me with his performance. He played a withdrawn character and perfectly so. Jada was pretty damn good, and so was Mark Ruffalo. Practically taking the cake though is Tom Cruise as Vincent. In my opinion its one of his best roles ever. Nihilistic, logical and best of all a cold-hearted efficient killer, this character is a testament to a downcast ideology but one that is impossible to dismiss. Well done, Cruise, well done. The movie is basically a tale of different lives suddenly becoming intertwined.A damn good movie.",Collateral
134,innocuous,Mann is still unable to end a movie strongly.,6,31 December 2004,"---THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!---Mann has made a very good movie, but, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the ending is clichéd and silly. His other movies share this problem. Inevitably, the protagonist survives and (usually) gets the girl.In order to make this happen, Mann has to invest Max with the most unlikely equanimity and a phenomenal natural skill with weapons. He also has to make Vincent, a practiced and well-trained hit-man, act like an idiot with suicidal urges.To be fair, this is really Stuart Beattie's fault. I guess he has been watching too many ""Die Hard"" movies. But I would have thought that Mann would have insisted on a little more reality (hmmmm...maybe I mean a more realistic unreal plot) and authenticity. This is even more mysterious because Mann had no problem killing off main characters and love interests in the ""Miami Vice"" series.I would have given this movie another star if Vincent had ultimately killed the prosecutor and then said something philosophical to Max before simply walking away. The evening and morning would simply bookend a night in which many characters enter Max's life, change it, and then disappear forever, leaving him a changed man.*** out of *****",Collateral
135,moviesleuth2,Effective psychological thriller,7,30 May 2010,"There's something eerie about driving through Los Angeles in the middle of the night; things are moving and there are people about, but overall the large bustling city is sleeping. No one can capture this feeling like Michael Mann; he did it in his modern crime classic ""Heat,"" and he does it here. This film has the earmarks of a classic thriller: a brilliant script, an expert director, and a couple of nice performances. Unfortunately, the most important role in this film is miscast.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a nice guy cab driver who would rather help a stressed out fare (Jada Pinkett Smith) get to her destination faster than go her way and get a few extra bucks because it takes longer. However, the stressed out yuppies that he usually has to deal with are going to be the least of his problems. Late one night, a man walks into his cab and tells him that he will pay 600 dollars to have Max drive him to six destinations in one night. But it isn't before long before Max realizes that the man, who calls himself Vincent (Tom Cruise) isn't closing a real estate deal; he's knocking off targets.For the most part, this is a two-man game of cat-and-mouse between the cold Vincent and the meek Max. It's almost all dialogue and no real action, which would be okay if the film had a better villain. As written, Vincent is a cold, brutal killer. As played by Tom Cruise, he's just Tom Cruise without his famous cheeky grin. Cruise is just not up to the task of playing a conscienceless villain. As the soft-spoken cabbie Max, Jamie Foxx is terrific. His strong performance keeps us interested in this unfolding drama, primarily because it's impossible not to like him.After ""Heat,"" this is easily Michael Mann's best film. It's stylishly filmed, and it oozes with the after-hours atmosphere. There are moments when it drags slightly, and things can get a little confusing here and there, but Mann is a master craftsman.Without a doubt I recommend the film. The suspense builds steadily into a heart-pounding (if slightly overdone) ending, and it's almost always interesting. But I just can't help but feel that this movie could have been so much more if someone more able to play a sociopathic killer than Tom Cruise could have played Vincent.",Collateral
136,lawprof,Entertaining But as an L.A. Noir Flick One Essential Ingredient Is Missing,7,28 August 2004,"Director Michael Mann successfully pulls off an entertaining noir flick set in Los Angeles that gives co-star Tom Cruise his most appealing and sympathetic role since ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Cruise is Vincent (a Man With No Last name), a contract killer who has worked for years in what he euphemistically calls ""the private sector.""Jamie Foxx is cab driver Max, a fellow with big dreams of starting his upscale limo outfit. He takes a pretty woman to her office and they exchange banter - the promise of a relationship is boosted by her giving the cabbie her card. She's an assistant U.S. attorney pulling an all-nighter on a big criminal case. That's all we learn but it's enough to have most viewers pretty sure of what the last scene will offer.Next Max picks up Vincent. No, Vincent picks up Max and offers him a wad of cash to be his exclusive all-noir chauffeur while he runs errands. Max reluctantly accepts and they head to Vincent's first stop. Enter a dead guy who crashes thunderingly onto Max's cab (but does remarkably little damage).Max now learns that he's the local guide and ground facilitator for a hit man. As he takes Max from one murderous assignment to the next, a relationship of sorts develops but there's no Stockholm Syndrome here. Max remains true to the values inculcated in him by his beloved mom.Speaking of Max's mom, there's a diversion to a hospital, demanded by Vincent, so Max won't miss his daily visit to his recovering mother, Ida. Ida, in a short but delightful scene, is played by the wonderful Irma P. Hall. My pleasure was somewhat darkened by wondering if she could only play a bed bound character as I know she hasn't really recovered from her near-fatal Chicago car accident of over a year ago.Only one cop, Fanning, well played by Mark Ruffalo, begins to piece together the multiple night-time deaths and he realizes the F.B.I., interested in these victims, hasn't made certain proper connections (just why the F.B.I. is concerned with organized crime figures in L.A. when they ought to be investigating USA Patriot Act offenses is never revealed).The action speeds up as Max increasingly finds a new courage that kindles a drive (pun intended) to thwart Vincent's assignments, especially his last one (now YOU know who the intended last victim is, right?). We're treated to short bursts of Vincent's sociopathic take on life, love, philosophy, economics - he covers all the bases.Cruise and Foxx make a good acting team but their plasticized portrayals are more the result of the director's derivative vision rather than their own shortcomings. The L.A. of ""Collateral"" is too pristinely clean at night. Even the club where Vincent launches inspired, multi-weaponed mayhem seems like an okay place to take a first date. What's absolutely missing in this movie is that most essential L.A. noir ingredient - grittiness. It's there in full measure in both ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mulholland Drive."" Instead ""Collateral"" is essentially a star vehicle for two fine actors but the story suffers from the constant view of them and not the painfully sharp, dark, sinister corners of a roiling, brooding L.A. that can make a noir film grip an audience.Not surprisingly, instead of the melodrama produced by fine acting and good dialog, stunt driving and crashes are indispensable to the director's vision.Near the end Vincent lets loose some real emotion with a plaintive cry to Max, ""I do this for a living."" That's been apparent since the film's first moments so, perhaps, director Mann has Vincent uttering a too common American complaint: dissatisfaction with a career path that can't be abandoned. Yes, even contract killers may wish they owned a KFC franchise instead of a Glock.While fun to watch, ultimately there are too many improbabilities in Vincent's night in Lalaland. ""Minority Report"" seems, in retrospect, more real (but that film as well as this one insures that Cruise can continue to pay his bills).Fun but a good opportunity for a really gripping film missed.7/10",Collateral
137,joachimokeefe,Miami Vice producer meets Caribbean Pirates writer and...,1,4 April 2008,"...the result is a film that feels like a TV crime show with over-extravagant set-pieces. Collateral is written to the classic 'Hero's Journey' formula. To précis; Jamie Foxx refuses the call to adventure, is mentored (by the villain), then passes the threshold, enters the belly of the whale, undergoes the ordeal, seizes the sword (the cop's gun) and brings back the elixir of some revelation or other. Nothing wrong with that, but following that thread is the only thing that kept my attention in this flashy, overwrought thriller that ultimately collapses into cliché. It stops working when Jamie Foxx throws his case away and Cruise doesn't kill him. So any sense of urgent motivation is lost. After that, when Cruise attacks the busy club, it's so confusingly directed that my mind started to wander, and the immense plot hole that others have mentioned yawned open. Why is this supposedly top hit-man going round in a car with a big light on the top? Why can't he drive himself? Why can't he take the subway? Is it self-destructiveness? A sense of tragedy is feebly hinted at, but it doesn't wash, it's lip service. I didn't know Michael Mann had produced and written on Miami Vice but it makes sense. Collateral is strong on visuals and weak, very weak on thought processes. And then they hit you with a coincidence straight out of 3rd Grade storytelling: the DA is the hit-man's final target, but she just happens to be Jamie Foxx's prospective love interest. Nah. You blew it. There are a few interesting touches: there are vague echoes of Blade Runner, they try to deconstruct a couple of clichés (the bin through the glass door), and it has to be said that Tom Cruise is convincingly scary - that may be the Lizard People Theory association. But long before the time Collateral gets to the climax you can't suspend your disbelief any longer. I mean, this guy can pick out targets with a thirty-round clip in a crowded club but he can't hit two people in an office? And to end it with a subway chase is an Eighties' homage I could do without. Disappointing.",Collateral
138,movieguy1021,Collateral: 6/10,6,29 July 2004,"There's nothing better than going into a movie you thought would be bad and walking out pleasantly surprised. There's nothing worse than going into a movie you expect to be great and come out with a feeling of mediocrity. The latter is how I felt about Collateral (not to be confused with the Schwarzenegger Collateral Damage), one of the movies for which I was most excited in the summer. Both of the trailers looked great, with them seeming dark and being an action film with a dramatic overtone. Instead, we get a film that has its moments, but just doesn't know what to be. Is it a drama? Is it an action movie? Is it a comedy? I don't agree with the third, but everyone in the test audience was cracking up like crazy. I doubt that that's a great sign for a movie like this.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver stuck in a rut. He picks up a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) in his cab, and gets her phone number. It started like any other night. Then Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters the cab and pays him off to drive around to five different locations for ""real estate"" deals. When a body falls onto Max's cab, however, it seems that Vincent is going around killing people, as he's a contract killer. Max then has to go along with Vincent, because it's good to have a good argument, but better to have a good argument with a gun in your hand.I didn't know whether Collateral would be a thriller, an action, or a drama, but I was prepared for any. What I got was an uneasy combination of the three. The movie begins in a somber way-something that a good drama could have cone out of. There's a few action scenes thrown in (they're actually pretty cool-they'd be better if this was actually an action movie), and the music was so unbearable loud you'd think it was a thriller. I mean it, the music (by James Newton Howard) was so obnoxious and it played the emotions so much that it is the one factor that ruined the film for me. For example, Max calls Annie (Smith) on a cell phone, and I was literally about to yell out to the screen that she wouldn't be able to hear him talk because the music was so loud. What was Michael Mann thinking?Speaking of Mann, he does a great directing job here. He chooses a unique style, which isn't always good (like Man on Fire), but here it works. He keeps only a small amount of the screen in focus by using a telephoto lens, which really emphasizes the characters, which are both well developed. The cinematography in general was very good, with quite a few helicopter shots, and the whole thing's pretty steady for what looked like to be a hand-held camera. Although the quick cuts were necessary in the action scenes, they weren't overdone, which I felt thankful for. Everything technical looked very deliberate-and I can only attribute that to Mann. Although he won't be, it would be great to see him nominated for Best Director. He wasn't the one responsible for the uneven script, but he did make it constantly interesting. At times, it's interesting but unexciting, then it's interesting and exciting, then it's interesting and boring. At least it's always interesting.Foxx, best known for his roles in stupid comedies (except 2001's Ali, also directed by Mann), really proves himself here. He puts in an outstanding acting job here, alienating himself from his previous, fluff roles. Cruise seems to be paychecking his way through, although, since he's a generally good actor, he does a good job. Although the movie overstays its two hour welcome (the ending seemed especially drawn out and clichéd (that's just not possible), Collateral is a different film, to say the least. It's a combination of genres, but, unlike, say, Donnie Darko, it doesn't work that well like that.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence and language.",Collateral
139,0w0,Cruise's only ever portrayal of a villain in his entire career,7,17 May 2020,"First plot-hole: A professional hitman or professional assassin would ALWAYS have a silencer on his gun, so that's the first major plot-hole in the movie... it makes no sense that a professional would want to attract unneeded attention to themselves... and in the movie, the fact that he DOESN'T have a silencer does indeed end-up in him getting noticedAfter that the movie progresses fine but later on another plot-hole appears due to Tom Cruise's character not wearing a seatbelt and not making Jamie Foxx's character stop the car... he could EASILY have made him stop the car (like by hitting him in the head with his gun), yet he didn't and that created a plot-hole... a massive plot-hole in fact, which changed the course of the entire movie.Overall it's an interesting movie and it's an important film because it's the first (and only) time ever that Tom Cruise played the bad guy (Tropic Thunder doesn't count because he was a supporting character only and he wasn't a bad guy either, he was just a corporate a$shole). Who knows if he will EVER do another movie as the villain? It's been 16 years and he hasn't done it again, so my guess is not... so until then, this movie will stand as a testament to Cruise's ability to play an evil character.

140,WriterDave,Near Perfect L.A. Crime Story,9,25 August 2004,"Watching Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" gave me some of the same feelings I had when first watching David Lynch's ""Mullholand Drive.""  Yes, Mann may go astray and deliver us a ""Last of the Mohicans"" or ""Ali"" every once in awhile (just as Lynch gives us the rare ""Elephant Man"" or ""Straight Story"") but let's face it, he's a niche director, and Mann's niche is crime stories, particularly ones taking place in Los Angeles.  David Lynch is best at directing David Lynch movies and Michael Mann is best at directing crime thrillers in the city of angels.So, here we have a director basking in the glory of what he does best (I loved the lighting, the cityscapes, the eclectic music choices, the camera angles, and even the digital photography which for the first time in my book was put to appropriate and artistic use here).  We also have the biggest movie star on the planet, Tom Cruise, relishing in a chance to go against type and play a ruthless, yet somehow endearing hit-man.  And thirdly we have a star-making turn from Jamie Foxx as the not so hapless cabbie who has the misfortune of picking up Cruise's fare, also going against type and excelling in a dramatic performance when so many people know him only from his comedic turns.  It's so rare to get such a trifecta out of a movie, and to top it off we have Jada Pinkett-Smith as a lawyer looking more stunning and beautiful than she ever has and sparking some genuine chemistry with Foxx.  Yes, it gets a bit predictable in the end, and it might not be the epic that Mann's ""Heat"" was, but along the way we get treated to the best choreographed shoot-out in recent memory, some genuine chemistry amongst big stars, thoughtful dialogue, and classy suspense.  All in all, it was the best time I had at the movies this summer.",Collateral
141,dr_foreman,"A-list stars, Z-grade movie",1,6 August 2004,"America's film critics have finally succumbed to madness. Collateral enjoys a healthy 85% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes site, yet it is easily one of the ten worst films that I have ever seen. I'll grant you that the average moviegoer will probably not hate it as much as I do - nobody goes to a modern thriller expecting a masterpiece - but I think it's fair to say that many discriminating viewers will find this film trite, instantly forgettable and deeply disappointing. Worse yet: it's boring.Beware, for some minor (and hopefully vague) spoilers follow. I need to give away some of the plot in order to convey just how inane this movie is. I'm sure you already know that Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who picks up a hit-man played by Tom Cruise. Foxx is placed in the unenviable position of ferrying Cruise around the city, watching helplessly as his passenger bumps off key witnesses in a major trial. Think about this plot for just a second, and a host of potential problems will rear their ugly heads. Surely, Cruise will have to kill Foxx at the end of the night - otherwise, Foxx will go to the cops and spill his guts. Yet Foxx doesn't seem to realize this. For the first half of the film, he goes along with everything Cruise says, putting up only a frustratingly wimpy front of resistance. His character is so clueless that he actually visits his mother with Cruise in tow, not realizing what everyone in the audience knows; Cruise only wants to meet mom so he can hold the threat of her death over Foxx's head. Though Cruise runs rings around Foxx for quite a while, our hapless cab driver actually has about five or six great chances to escape, all of which are squandered. He fails to give Cruise the slip in a hospital, in a bar, and in a crowded nightclub. Cruise threatens to shoot innocent bystanders, but since he's already killing people, surely it behooves Foxx to make an escape attempt anyway? Of course, Foxx does panic and flee at one point - and, within seconds, runs from a crowded area into a completely deserted one. Like you would, under those circumstances.Why is Foxx so scared of Cruise? Maybe because the hit-man is virtually indestructible. He shrugs off injures from car crashes and bullet wounds to the neck, soaking up damage like the Terminator and springing back to life every time he apparently dies. At one point, Cruise actually takes on a whole squad of cops and bodyguards in a packed dance cluband kills them all. Never mind that there are dozens of people around, and all anyone really has to do is grab him. I mean, come on - since when does one hit-man take on an entire crowd? Aren't assassins supposed to be subtle? Credibility is stretched so far that, even by Hollywood standards, the movie is goddamn absurd. Naturally, Cruise has to inexplicably wimp out in time for his final battle with Foxx, because we can't have the evil guy winning, can we?If only the action was the only lame part. Alas, the screenwriters pour salt into the wound by veering into 'philosophical' territory. Cruise waxes on about his abusive father (is this supposed to make him sympathetic?) and gives Foxx a tedious series of 'seize the day' speeches about following your dream - recycled, no doubt, from the equally annoying scripts of Fight Club and Dead Poets Society. Hollywood writers would have you believe that, if you just apply yourself, you can go from convenience store clerk or penniless cabby to successful entrepreneur in a matter of weeks. All you need is an eloquent bad guy to give you a boot in the a**! Any moment now, I expect Doctor Doom to come crashing through the wall and give me an inspirational speech about cultivating my writing talents. Or not.Shameful! It's just shameful. There's not a line or a scene in this movie that hasn't been lifted from another source and put through the trivializing machine. There's even a subway chase that feebly echoes The French Connection. The horror...the horror...Time to shut up now. You know how it is with bad movies; there's so much to complain about that it's tempting to overindulge in the smorgasbord of sarcasm. Incidentally, the increasingly silly Roger Ebert gave this three and a half stars - the same rating he gave The Shawshank Redemption...",Collateral

The story might be slow at time but there is some action interval from time to time (though not very long).But every thing comes down to the end (which I don't like). After all I find what Vincent said was right  he's a professional and Max is not, and how the hell it ends up this way. (It seems the story favor the main character than reality.)

All I can say for this movie is that it was simply great. The acting by Jamie Foxx and especially Tom Cruise was magnificent. I thought Jamie Foxx was good and I guess you can call him up for an academy award but Tom Cruise gave one of his best performances. Usually his acting is a little cheesy, but in Collateral, he just put up a great role as a bad ass hit-man and he was a ""bad ass."" The script was definitely a plus too and had great dialouge added to it. The movie is just very stylish and is tied on being the best thriller with Phone Booth. I usually like all of Michael Mann's films but this is probably one of his best films. Great camera view and action. A simple entertaining film.

144,Antagonisten,Excellent,7,1 April 2005,"I enjoyed ""Collateral"" quite a bit. Not that surprising maybe since i consider Michael Mann a very competent, but maybe not that exciting, director.""Collateral"" has a few things going for it. First of all it has a story and script that is original without being revolutionary. Also it's reasonably plausible without becoming dull or too focused on staying true to reality. With this script the movie could have been a decent thriller. However there are two things that lift this movie and make it better than decent. The first of which are the actors, the second the directing.Tom Cruise is something of a mystery to me. I have trouble standing him when he does his frantic noisy parts, like in ""Jerry Maguire"". But as soon as he comes to his senses and keeps it down he can be excellent. He is very good in ""Collateral"", better than i thought he could be in a part like this one. It doesn't feel like familiar Tom Cruise territory to say the least. Still though Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise and i expect some quality from him. The one who surprised me was Jamie Foxx. I still feel that somewhere along the line i missed something with this guy. One day he was the irritating guy in ""Any Given Sunday"" or the loser in ""Booty Call"". Next day he's excellent in movies like this one, and perhaps most notably in ""Ray"". The chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise is perhaps the biggest key to why this movie works.I also mentioned the direction. There is a sense of style to everything that Michael Mann does. Even if i find him rather dull sometimes i can't deny his talent and his sensitive fingertips. Here the visual style, the music and the pace is mixed in an excellent way. Scenes that could have been pathetic are carried with a steady hand by Mann, all the way through the rather weak ending.So, what about flaws? This movie is not a ten, so what's wrong with it? Well, for one i DID find the ending to be weak. It just didn't live up to the rest of the movie. Of course i can't really say any more without ruining it for you. But still. Also there is the thing about originality, but that is a minor thing.So, even though this is not one of the most original movies in recent years i think most people will enjoy it. I found it to be a display of excellent film-making, acting and directing. While a few more elements of chance and surprise would have spiced things up, this is still well worth watching and one of the best thrillers of 2004.I rate it 7/10.",Collateral

146,dfa120374,It's Not Leon But It's Still A Pretty Solid Hit-man Movie,6,17 January 2015,"Collateral is brought to us by Michael Mann, the man who has done films like Manhunter, Heat and Last Of The Mohicans. My own personal opinion is that Heat is the best film Mann has done and while Collateral isn't on the same level as that, it's still a good action/suspense thriller. Anyone who has seen any of Michael Mann's films know that this isn't going to be an over-the-top action film where there's more gunfire than story and has a leading star who comes out with more bad one-liners than a low-rate stand-up comic.The story of the film is quite a simple one, but the way it's filmed is what takes it from a simple story to a great one. Mann has a way of making a seemingly slow movie much more interesting and suspenseful to watch, and he does this with Collateral. There are parts in the movie that had a danger of being repetitive and boring, but the way that the story and suspense is built up for these scenes there's no worries of them becoming either.Also, you may think to yourself ""Tom Cruise?! As a hit-man? Yeh right!"" But in all honesty, he does a really good job of playing a hit-man. Granted, he's no Leon but he still does a good convincing job in the role of Vincent. Jamie Foxx does an equally good job in his role as playing Max, an L.A. cab driver simply trying to make some extra money to start his own business.The interaction between the two makes for good viewing as there are quite a good few moments in the movie where you wonder how Max is going to get out of the situations that he's being put in. The only let down for me cast wise was Jada Pinkett Smith because she can't act to save herself and this is one of the few roles I've seen her in where she's not over-acting playing a stereo typical head bobbing, finger pointing, snarling black woman. Thankfully she isn't in this movie a lot, however, which is a relief.Collateral is definitely worth watching and if you love movies like Heat and Leon then you should enjoy this one.",Collateral
147,ronakkotian,Thrilling with so much depth,8,10 June 2021,"Seeing Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx in a film together got me wanting to see this for a long time and I have to say, I really loved it.Collateral follows Max, a cab driver who becomes the hostage to a contract killer named Vincent as he takes him from one hit to another during one night in Los Angeles.This is my first time seeing a Michael Mann film and I honestly cannot wait to see what else he has made. I had high hopes for Collateral but did not expect to like it this much. What really caught my eye was Collateral's depiction of LA night life. The atmosphere of the night adds to the tension as we're taken through dark, abandoned streets and alleyways that drum up the thriller aspect of the film. The scenes inside the taxi create tension and claustrophobia as we're on edge thinking about what move Vincent is going to make. Mann does a terrific job introducing both characters in the beginning. When we first see Vincent, there is a feeling of mystery surrounding his character. When we're introduced to Max, Mann gives us enough character development for us to connect with his character and care about him for the rest of the film. Some of the best scenes include Vincent and Max talking to each other in the taxi. We get a better view of their personas and history. Their conversations are so interesting to listen to due to how deep and philosophical they get over time.The acting from Tom Cruise is terrific. We normally see him playing the hero and a good guy so it's refreshing to see him on the other side of the spectrum. He's fun to watch in the action scenes but I feel he truly shines during those scenes in the taxi with Jamie Foxx's character. I hope he plays more villainous roles like this one in the future. Jamie Foxx also gives one of his best here. He does a great job making Max a likeable person. His character goes through a lot and Foxx conveys all the right emotions required. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as usual and Jada Pinkett Smith also does a great job.Collateral is a well made drama thriller. The script is well written as we learn so much about our two leads and the glorious portrayal of LA night life keeps the thrills going. Michael Mann's direction is superb as well as the acting by Cruise and Foxx which make Collateral an entertaining watch.",Collateral
148,MichaelMargetis,Michael Mann is Back and in Full Form!,8,2 April 2005,"As summer starts to boggle down, I start reflecting on many things that I have done during the summer, and the films I saw. The summer of 2004 films weren't that good. It was probably the worst summer of movies in five years, I guess either the production companies are waiting for Oscar season, or there is just not good films being released this year. During this summer the highest review grade I gave out were B+'s (and only to four films), considering last summer I gave out two 'A-' grade reviews, and the summer before that I gave out a 'A+' grade review. But I'd have to say out of all the movies I've seen this summer, Collateral has to be the very best (besides Harry Potter but that's a given)..From the trailers, I gathered ""Collateral"", the new Michael Mann picture, was just going to join the handfuls of disappointing summer fluff, due to the fact one of the very worst actors in Hollywood stars in the title role. Yes, I'm talking about Tom Cruise. I was kind of looking forward to Jamie Foxx's performance, due to the buzz of his upcoming film where he is set to play the late great Ray Charles. But twenty minutes into Collateral, I haven't been this intrigued and impressed with a film's flow since this year's Kill Bill Volume 2 (Grade: A).The best qualities of Collateral are the script and direction. The screenplay just flows with so much creativity and sheer talent it has you thinking things you thought you couldn't believe. I know that's confusing, so I'll give you example. Tom Cruise's character Vincent, is a hit man who kills very innocent people in cold blood, yet you still love him, and admire his personality. The screenwriter creates a kind of anti-superhero in Vincent, that makes Spider-Man and Batman look about as cool as a physics majors. You'll be rooting for Vincent throughout the movie no matter what evil deeds he does, you'll even be encouraging it. Michael Mann does a fine job directing the film. I especially like how he staged the night-club shoot out scene. This is probably the best film Michael Mann worked on since 1995's Heat (Grade: A-), and he very much deserves a Best Director nomination at the Oscars this year.Tom Cruise surprisingly does a fine job. That is very rare for him, the only two films I've seen where Cruise was remotely good were Magnolia (Grade: A) and Risky Business (Grade: B-). Although Cruise is very fun to watch on camera, even more fun to watch is Jamie Foxx's character Max, the driver of the taxi that Vincent steps into for the night. Jamie Foxx creates a perfect blend of comedy and drama, for his character. Overall, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx make one of the best on-screen duos in recent years, and their interactions (in my opinion) are far more compelling then all the action the film has to offer (and the film offers a crap load of action sequences.). The supporting cast is fun to watch, and if you look closely you'll see British actor Jason Statham (Snatch, The Transporter) in a cameo at the beginning in the airport. Overall, Collateral is great film, and it's definitely a must see at the theaters.

149,saadanathan,A thrilling and shocking story 8/10,8,30 July 2020,"""Collateral"" is a great movie directed by Michael Mann. The script written by Stuart Beattie tells a story of the antagonist affects the life of the protagonist in one faithful night. From the first scene with the protagonist max (Jamie Foxx) you can see how uncertain he is about his life, he lives in his own world in a ""temporary"" job and doesn't change. Once the antagonist Vincent shows up (Tom Cruise), you see how different he is from max, an anti - max in other words. As the story goes on max doesn't change his character by himself but rather the antagonist forces max to break his character under the circumstances he is in. The audience can notice slowly how because of Vincent's actions Max is forced to adapt himself to the situation and act more like Vincent. Even in the scene at the midpoint of the movie when Max enters the club and addresses himself as Vincent, to meet with the boss (Javier Bardam). The words of Vincent come out of his mouth, showing the audience once again how max is breaking his character and finally changing. ""Collateral"" is a great movie that tells a brilliant story of tension and thrill. Probably one of the best movies by Michael Mann ever made. With amazing actors and cinematic expression.",Collateral
150,dragokin,i laughed for the better part of the movie,2,6 November 2013,"The only thing that really stuck in my memory about Collateral is the suit Tom Cruise was wearing. Actually, i bought a similar one some time down the line.The movie has an intriguing start yet quickly proves to be a poor script backed by substantial budget. Or maybe i had too high expectations... Anyhow, i quickly forgot that i'm watching what should be a suspenseful thriller and perceived it as bad comedy. I laughed through the rest of the movie which might have disturbed the other viewers in the theater. Sorry about that.Jamie Foxx offers his standard performance and saves the world from Tom Cruise. The latter had one of those roles that should display his skills but are superfluous due to poor script, unlike in, for example Minority Report (2002). Jada Pinkett Smith was there, as well, but was a side role, in true sense of the word.",Collateral
151,departed07,A wild ride!,10,13 May 2005,"Life couldn't get any easier for Max (Jamie Foxx) as night after night he drives a cab and can't get his dream of owning a limo business, but his night is about to become even worse ""Collateral"" starts off slow with Tom Cruise's character Vincent walking with a luggage from an airport with his frosted hair, dark shades and a silver suit as a man trips over him, Vincent tells him ""Are you alright?"" With just his look, he means business. Also in the beginning, Max drives a workaholic lawyer named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) for whom he tells her if he takes Annie to her firm in time, then she doesn't have to pay the fare. He wins the bet, but she exchanges her phone number while Max gives her his lucky postcard to remind her of relaxation.After that, the thrill ride begins as Vincent goes into the cab and offers Max six-hundred dollars to take him for an all night ride in which case becomes a killing spree. In a comic relief, Vincent tells Max ""This is the cleanest cab I've ever seen."" Not for long.In the film, Vincent is working for a mafia crime boss for which he must assassinate five different people (a drug dealer, a jazz player, a business man, a Chinese millionaire and a lawyer) who are witnesses from his boss's case. And throughout the night, he goes on a killing spree shocking Max for his dear life; but Vincent doesn't want any witnesses so Max becomes his hostage that entire night and doing exactly what he tells him. Especially when Max's mom is in the hospital, Vincent tries to be boy charming by buying her flowers and letting the nurses keep the change; even finding the truth that Max has been lying to her.What's interesting about the character Vincent is that though he's a killer, he is more of an aid towards Max as he tries to get for him be more confident towards the dispatcher on the radio (his boss) who has been treating him like dirt; not to mention be more aggressive as Max pretends to be Vincent when seeing the boss that Vincent works for.Though I've only seen one Michael Mann film (Heat), what I really like about this movie is that he shows the entire city of Los Angeles at night; the atmosphere is very realistic it is, as if we've become characters in it.""Collateral"" is a scary ride from minute one where the suspense never ends, not to mention the performances from Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise for which is kind of weird since Foxx is a comedian (""In Living Color"", Booty Call) and Cruise has always played the hero (Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai); this is a match made in heaven.",Collateral
152,Spanner-2,Good except for the ending,8,31 August 2004,"Michael Mann's latest thriller has Tom Cruise cast as a hitman who rides along in Jamie Foxx's cab on his way to comit his murders. The film relies primarily on the personalities of its two leads and their interaction. And in the scenes between Cruise and Foxx the film is very good. The two of them play their parts well and have a nice dynamic that makes their conversations interesting. The film is also shot very stylishly, making good use of digital video... The film is very good up until the ending, which takes several wrong turns into ""Die Hard"" territory with a silly cat and mouse bit in a highrise. Until then I was completly in the film. Jada Pinkett Smith shows up in a completly unbelievable performance as well, the films other weak point. Still, on the whole a fairly effective thriller featuring two solid lead performances.

155,CinematicInceptions,Pretty solid in all areas.,8,30 September 2017,"This didn't strike me as anything amazing when I watched it and still doesn't, but looking back at it there's actually a lot more depth to this movie than I had originally thought. Sure, there may not be any great message or moral argument going on in it, but there are some themes that are worth exploring. There's a bit of a nihilistic theme from Vincent, that is interesting in a way and is slightly reminiscent of the bar conversation about apathy in Se7en. Collateral is hardly the first hit-man movie that we've seen, and Vincent isn't all that different from most of the hired guns that come up throughout action movies. What sets Collateral apart is that we view such events through the lens of Max, who is a much better character than one might expect. Max is swept up in a night of violence that he is totally unprepared for, and because of this we might expect him to behave more passively and just watch in horror as Vincent goes on his rampage. But he doesn't; instead he progressively becomes more and more active in opposing Vincent. First, he is only concerned about his own survival, but as the night goes on and more complications develop he begins trying harder and harder to minimize the bloodshed and stop Vincent. On the surface, it might seem that Vincent alters Max's world view or maybe unlocks heroism inside of him, but I don't think this is the case. Max is shown to be a good and hard-working man with decently grounded beliefs prior to meeting Vincent. Max is the type of guy that would at least consider running into a burning building if he thought it could save someone. At least, I like to think so.The whole police investigation storyline was a little bit lost on me, but I think this is mostly because I watched a lot of the movie on my iPad in the car and couldn't hear a lot of the dialogue. I wasn't huge on the ending where Max goes back and saves Annie. Yes, it was dramatically satisfying in a way, but it also felt pretty contrived and implausible. I don't know how the story would have ended otherwise, but I feel like Max would have had the nerve to call Annie and it seemed cheap that he got to swoop in and save the day instead of just calling her back.The script did a pretty job keeping me interested, but it wasn't totally gripping. The action and hit-man style scenes were not anything special, but they weren't bad either. What stood out to me from an execution standpoint was the performance from Jaime Foxx. Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise, but Jaime Foxx did a really good job making Max a relatable character whose emotions felt human and real. I'm not sure why he was nominated for a supporting role Oscar instead of a main role, but it was a well-deserved nomination.So I would recommend this to any given viewer. It's a little intense, but there's nothing too gruesome or dark in it. It will fulfill your wishes if you're just looking for an action movie, but if you care to look closer, you may find some themes awaiting you. Overall Rating: 7.7/10",Collateral
156,iohefy-2,I FOR ONE DID NOT LIKE THE MOVIE,5,12 August 2004,"I am a big Tom Cruise fan and went to see this preview with much enthusiasm but found that I was disappointed. He looked good with the gray hair, but the story was a real nothing. Jamie Fox gave a good performance in this lack luster movie, as wellas Tom Cruise. When you have a story that really has no body to it, I think it makes for a weak picture.  I know most people like violence in their movies, but enough is enough.  Tom may have enjoyed his evening, but let me tell you I did not.",Collateral
157,AKS-6,Great action thriller,8,20 March 2005,"Collateral is a great action thriller by Michael Mann. The premise isn't the most original (a normal guy -- played by Jamie Foxx -- gets drawn into a chain of events that he can't get out of), but the execution is exquisite. The movie looks great. Cinematography, editing... everything. It also actually works as a thriller: I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat a couple of times which doesn't happen often anymore. Compare it to another thriller (very different though) that I just saw. It was Taking Lives and it tries so hard to put you at the edge of your seat, but only manages to be boring. It feels like Mann doesn't even try, but he pulls it off anyway.The acting is great as well. Tom Cruise as a bad guy. Grey hair, grey suit. We haven't seen him in a role like this before, but I think he did a great job. Jamie Foxx was also very good in what is the biggest part in the movie (supporting actor? I think not). Max goes from nervous taxi driver to hero and I think that the transformation is quite believable, thanks to the script of course, but also thanks to Foxx's great performance.So, Collateral is a great action thriller with fine performances. Highly recommended. (8/10)",Collateral

159,Offworld_Colony,"Coming at early the intersection of film and digital, and a real evolution point of Michael Mann as a filmmaker,",10,18 February 2020,"Collateral is a tight, finely tuned, experimental and influential existential action movie that gets nowhere near the acclaim it deserves.There's something resonant in the movie where every action, reaction, choice and beat of interplay feels charged from some hidden backstory or led by something we've already seen or heard earlier in the movie. Motivation and metaphor bleed together in typical Mann style and it creates something magical.Collateral is a tone poem painted visually. It's about dreams, doubt and self-deception. It's about ambition, duty and assertiveness. It takes well-worn tropes and structure and uses it to blow the doors off the action genre, and is more influential than it ever gets credit for.Beattie's script is a masterclass. It teases and delivers the correct amount of information. It's tangible in the way John Wick isn't and yet is mythical in the same proportion. It's crackling dialogue and rich slowly evolving characterisations are broad and cinematic and yet distill down the heart of man. And with this weaving script that manages to add and build, there's still a sense of immediacy to it. Mann elevating the material to something that's not stilted when it could be or bloated and instead is a compressed life-changing intersection.It's hard to overstate how unique it was to see Tom Cruise on screen portraying what felt like we we're seeing a new kind of professional on screen. A worker. His grey suit the perfect tool to obfuscate or blend in. He's a smart guy. A real guy, but a different, a broken man. The mechanical workmanlike specialist. The utter professional, a modern big city equivalent counterpoint to Reno's Leon. And Foxx is spectacular in this, the role he really needed. Rich, nuanced and shows range and a clear arc.The creepy plot of a mechanical hitman, more Terminator or Jason than Jason Bourne was new at the time, the film layers in just enough information so that the thought that this has happened at least once before, successfully, lends a different air of tension to their conversations. The fact that he's killed the taxi driver before twists everything we're seeing. Mann reminds us he's a wild animal, a hunter, a consummate professional and by virtue, a virtuoso, a jazz musician currently on his stage.Mann's evolving use of the digital landscape where I'm sure he flirted with it in Ali, intensifies how personal and different this movie really was. Mann uses digital teasingly, almost mockingly grainy at the start until the true uniqueness of digital is shown in the night shots, the interplay between foreground light and colour, the closeness to the subjects is uncomfortable and apt. The editing and framing creates an uneasy personal tension in a paparazzi-esque manner.The sound mix does this also to mixed-effect; the gunshots and the crashes and the cracking of bones is a palpably shocking, realistic, frightening affair (sort of started a new trend in action flicks after) and the road noise rumble of the cars is lyrical and musical in its own special way, but sometimes the mix swallows dialogue up, or causes the cardinal home movie sin of making the viewier have to adjust volumes between types of scenes. But then most of Mann's movies do this, I think it's just the way he likes it, it does support his style and his choices but it makes for intermittently unenjoyable viewing. His choice of music, however, has the same quality and taste it always does. In this case it's just sumptuous, poppy and jazzy armchair choons.Collateral is a great fusion of a clever script from a good writer taken on a spin by an auteur in a different but equally special way.Also Peter Berg and Mark Ruffalo play cops. That was nice.",Collateral
160,ethanbresnett,Tense and exciting,8,9 December 2020,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx - what's not to love! Two fine actors going toe to toe in some excellently scripted scenes, it is a real treat.Collateral has a great premise, which I won't go into detail over as it's best to let that unfold before you first hand, but suffice to say, the story is incredibly fun and engaging. It felt very fresh, with some of the usual tropes and cliches, but wrapped up in a very unique and intriguing package.As mentioned, the standout from the film are the performances of Cruise and Foxx. This was quite a deviation from Cruise's normal 'heroic' characters, so it was great seeing him get stuck into this role.The direction from Michael Mann was very stylish and slick. The pacing was fantastic, and the characters were well drawn out and developed.If you're looking for a well executed and stylish thriller / action, look no further than Collateral as you won't be disappointed.",Collateral
161,DavidSim240183,The best action film I've seen in a good long while.,10,22 February 2006,"If you had told me a year ago I would be submitting a film review with Tom Cruise in it to the IMDb I would have thought you were crazy. I must confess to having a rather intense dislike of Tom Cruise as an actor. There is just something about the man that seems so obnoxious to me. And with his recent outspoken behaviour, I will probably continue to have that opinion of him for many years to come.While Jamie Foxx on the other hand is a very likable, down to earth guy who I'm sure would like very much if I ever met him in person. Whoever thought of putting the two of them together must have had a very keen foresight. Michael Mann's ultra-stylish Collateral is one of the best action films I've seen in years. It's certainly on a par with Die Hard, my all time favourite.The opening scene has an almost unrecognisable Cruise as Vincent at LAX airport in LA. Dressed in a snappy grey suit, grey hair and sunglasses (oh and stubble) he bumps into somebody who gives him a briefcase.The scene then changes to Foxx, who plays Max, a down on his luck taxi driver. He's been stuck in the same job for 12 years, he has a distant relationship with his mother, and his dreams of starting his own limo service are being crushed every day because of the never-ending tedium of his job.But on one particular fateful night (which happens to coincide with my birthday) it appears Max's luck is about to change. Annie (Jada-Pinket-Smith), a sexy, intelligent LA lawyer gets into his taxi. And starts talking. About their prospective lives. Their careers. Their hopes and dreams. You wouldn't think this was the setup for an action film, but this scene very clearly defines Max's character, and allows us to sympathise with him before his excursion into the cab ride from Hell.After Annie leaves Max her business card, then Vincent comes into his life. He has five stops to make before he leaves town, and would like to hire Max's services for the evening. For a generous fee of course. Vincent's first stop seems perfectly ordinary, until a body suddenly falls onto the taxi.What Max hasn't realised is Vincent is a hit-man, contracted to kill five people who are witnesses that could make life very difficult for his employers. With one of them already dead, Max must now drive Vincent to his assigned targets if he wants to live to see another sunrise.I didn't mind Tom Cruise in this film, because he inhabits the role of the villain very well. His conversations with Max about life in general are rather insightful, but in terms of character development, Vincent won't learn anything. He is a cold-blooded killer through and through, and he won't let anything short of his death stop him from completing his assignment. He's like a sly fox with a temper like a steel trap ready to spring at a moments notice.With Max trapped in this nightmarish situation, now an accessory to murder, Foxx really brings lots of dimensions to Max's character. From being afraid for his life, to his embarrassment at being berated by his mother in front of Vincent, to pretending to be Vincent at one point, Foxx gives one of the most nuanced performances of his career.Both the action scenes and more thoughtful conversations between Vincent and Max are handled well. In fact, Collateral is a very talky film most of the time, but I found it refreshing in this day and age of mindless shootouts and bloody violence.Michael Mann's sure-footed direction lends the film a sharp, crisp focus, not to mention a visual delight in the urban wasteland of downtown LA in the middle of the night. An added bonus is the blues numbers and jazz tunes in the film that give Collateral an extra sense of style. I like action films that are stylish, because you don't get many of them, and also like Die Hard, the way it all takes place over the course of a single night made it even more satisfying for me. The events escalate steadily and logically too, with the police and FBI gradually catching on to Vincent and Max's trail. The suspense just keeps on building until it reaches critical mass. Like the pulse-pounding, adrenaline pumping shootout in a night-club.The ending comes to a gripping climax that takes a leaf out of Rear Window's book, when Max discovers Annie is on Vincent's hit list. I would have preferred if it had ended in that high-rise rather than a subway train, but nonetheless, Mann directs the climax well with a fine touch. It's even added a philosophical edge when Vincent muses over the implications of his own death. His dead body cuts a lonely figure as the train moves on in the end. People will come on this train, and not know who this man was, making Vincent's death a little tragic.Fine performances from Cruise and Foxx, sharp, taut direction, catchy tunes and memorable set-pieces make Collateral one of the most satisfying action films to come out of Hollywood in a good long while. Hope we don't have to wait too long until another comes out.",Collateral
162,MovieCriticOnline,The biggest problem is the writing,3,11 July 2019,"It was just terrible. Vincent is running around shooting people in neighborhoods, and taking the time doing it and no one seems to notice. The cops just let them slip by over and over again. If you see a taxi with smashed windows parked in front of a club and you suspect it of something you don't let it go. There is also ZERO way they would have picked up audio from when Foxx said he was Vincent at the club.Also the video look was distracting, likely shot at 30fps. You could just tell.. also Foxx kept fighting Vincent by arguing with him and trying to run, despite the fact he knew he could get killed in one second.Also I hate Mark Ruffalo, he is boring and uninteresting and not believable as a cop and I didn't buy Peter Berg as a cop.Then you want me to believe that cops chased him inside a club and didn't tell anyone at the club or close it down before they started pointing guns and taking down Foxx?? Then there is a full on fight and shoot out and people just kept dancing... Come on, man.. Just ridiculous. 3 stars for Tom Cruise...",Collateral

I enjoyed the first half but I gradually lost interest  this is perhaps strange since the second half was by far more action-packed than the first. However something about it just made it more generic and less exciting. This is also true for the whole film; some parts and generic while some are truly gripping.Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are both great in their respective parts, Foxx as a cab driver leading a mundane life driving nights in L.A. and Cruise as the contract killer hitching a fare in his taxi to do his dirty work all around town. In spite of having a reasonably grounded and plausible storyline, Collateral occasionally features events and developments that feel altogether unbelievable. Max the cab driver (Jamie Foxx), for instance, picks up on his hit-man ways quickly and seemingly effortlessly whenever it calls for it. But the experienced professional hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) has a lot of trouble even shooting straight and covering up tracks.The philosophical ideas that are put forward in the film (by forcing them into conversation during the cab fare) are meant to add more depth to the story, but in truth, end up as pretty bland and well-milked observations. For example, Vincent frequently talks about how people are insignificant and about a dead man on the subway going six laps before anybody notices him. ""Get with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars, in a speck on one in a blink. That's us, lost in space. The cop, you, me... Who notices?"" He is, of course, trying to justify his killing. I would like to give Collateral 6.9/10, because it IS actually a well-crafted thriller... but since you can't rate in decimals, and I am reluctant to giving it a 7, this will only get 6/10. Sorry, Mann - not your best film.",Collateral
165,lagudafuad,Here is a movie i will always remember,7,7 May 2013,"Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching.Collateral is a beautiful thriller and Jamie Foxx's portrayal of his character is welcoming and it gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Collateral is a crime thriller film from one of the best directors around Michael Mann and his directorial ace is how he paced the movie, not to mention the packaging and the way the plot unfolds is just magical. Cruise did very well in his portrayal of a villain he was so well composed and the way he spoke will pass the message across that this individual is ready to do anything to get the job done.Collateral has a hired assassin going on a ride with a taxi driver names Max (Jamie Foxx), all in the aim of making some stops and taking out some individuals that he was paid to do so. Max on the other hand had no idea that the passenger he was so eager to carry was one he never forget. Vincent (Tom Cruise) was the name of the passenger and he was ready to pay Max six hundred dollars to take him to some places.Now Max has been a Cabby for 12 years and $ 600 in one night just from one person looked like a nice deal, so he took it and not long things started to change and Max latter regretted the decision. He also had to stand up to Vincent which took some guts, and in the end we learn, if it sounds too good to be true ($ 600 for a night for some stops), probably it is.Collateral approaches you from a view of the hired assassins, and it solidifies the thought we have of them, heartless psychopaths with no morals at all. When you view the movie's build up to the eventual fallout of the relationship of the assassin and his unwilling apprentice, you just have to marvel on the way the story just kept flowing without send you to sleepyville. Perpetuation is one thing that this movie has, although it doesn't get tiring you will notice it. This nice thriller did have some cinematography flops especially when there are trying to achieve a close up, it looked amateur, which was the idea mind you, but it was not cool.The whole idea of a bad guy all up in suit and with white hair was just cool, as in Cruise looked cool in his portrayal. Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching and if you haven't seen it, I'm wondering why.www.lagsreviews.com",Collateral
166,Cinemaniac1984,Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are excellent in this top notch thriller.,9,27 December 2015,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are both cast against type in Michael Mann's thriller Collateral. Both are excellent in this top notch thriller that had me engaged from beginning to end. Michael Mann who is best known for the crime caper Heat (1995) can add another excellent movie to his filmography with Collateral as one of his best movies.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver who is meticulous in his routine and knows his way through the streets of Los Angeles like the back of his hand. He's seen it all as he's been doing it for 12 years. Max also has big dreams of having his own limousine company which has not eventuated. Amongst his passengers include US Department of Justice prosecutor Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) who has taking a liking to Max. Soon after a mysterious man dressed in a grey suit named Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters Max's taxi and offers Max $600 to drive him around Los Angeles for the entire night making various stops along the way. The first fare turns out to be anything but routine when a man riddled with bullets falls out of an apartment window and onto Max's taxi. Vincent later reveals himself to be a hit-man and takes Max hostage, ordering him to drive him to various stops to complete his task. Not only must Max work to save himself, he must also try to save the remaining targets. Hot on the path and trying to make the connection between the victims is LAPD Detective Ray Fanning (Mark Ruffalo).Everyone is used to seeing Tom Cruise as the good guy but without a doubt this is one of his best performances as the cold and sleek hit-man Vincent. It was a shame Tom Cruise did not receive any awards for his performance because this was one of his most memorable roles. Jamie Foxx who frequently plays loud and charismatic characters also goes against type as the mild mannered and diligent taxi driver Max. Jamie Foxx was a well deserved nominee for an Academy Award for his role as Max. Rounding out the supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, Barry Shabaka Henley, Javier Bardem and in a brief cameo Jason Statham.Director Michael Mann brings to life a neo noir thriller with his trademark visuals and a tightly wound story that does not have a single dull moment. Everything about it is vintage Michael Mann. Australian writer Stuart Beattie brings to his life his excellent work which originally started as an idea which popped into his head as a 17 year old catching a taxi from Sydney Airport to his home. I bet he's glad he put that idea on paper and seeing it brought to life on screen.Collateral is a top notch thriller. Not only is it engaging from start to finish, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are both memorable in their respective roles which keeps the film moving at a cracking pace. Collateral truly deserved its critical acclaim.",Collateral
167,PyrolyticCarbon,"Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.",8,28 September 2004,"very well filmed thriller from Michael Mann who once again proves his mastery of Directing, with Tom Cruise being equalled for performance alongside Jamie Foxx. Cruise shows how good he is at portraying a bad guy, just as much as his good guy roles, if not better.The film starts off low key, and continues for the majority. Despite Vincent being a cold hired killer, his demeanour and relaxed, open attitude makes you feel that he's not that dangerous after all. At some point along the way I started wondering where this was going, I knew Cruise can play a great bad guy, but he wasn't really playing much at all, just any other character. Then I caught some of the subtleties of the character and the way he was calming and controlling Max.What was then interesting was where it went from there, where the story kicked off into high gear and the characters changed under the pressure of the night. There's even a growing understanding between the characters before the final sequences.Excellent action scenes and superb camera work with a fantastic score edited into the scenes adding another layer of tension and storytelling.Imagine a straight line through the centre of the plot showing predictability, this story follows that path, but instead of a straight line it curves back and forth crossing it throughout but always keeping that steer. So what you find is you expect something to happen and it does, just not at the time or in the way you thought, it's always just slightly off centre. That makes it interesting, and although there is predictability, it doesn't detract one bit from the movie or it's style.Let's face it Mann is about style and atmosphere, with a great score and some fantastic action sequences (check out the club scene), and this delivers. On top of that are the slower paced, low key scenes from the beginning which provide a great level of realism and character sympathies while setting the plot devices clearly in front of you.Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.",Collateral

171,supertom-3,Cruise control!!,9,1 November 2004,"Michael Mann returns to the crime thriller for the first time since Heat and it's the genre that has garnered most of his fan base. I personally think he is a master at this genre as proved with Heat, Manhunter and Thief. This is a tense and superbly unique piece of work. Unique in the fact that it's shot on digital at night with no real conventional lighting in most of the film. In this respect the film has an original and highly atmospheric look. The night time setting of LA is at once both cold and warm and the subdued colour gives the film a really interesting tone. The plot centres around a cabbie named Max who picks up a passenger named Vincent. Vincent then in effect hijacks Max and his cab and has him take him around LA to wipe out federal witnesses. It's a simplistic premise and the film like Mann's other crime thrillers are fascinating character studies. The characters of both Max and Vincent are the core of the movie and the relationship between them. As you would expect this acting is top notch. Tom Cruise is brilliant, truly worthy of an Oscar nod. It's a brave role that manages to let Cruise shift the Cruise mantle he has upon him. Many of his roles, despite his excellent efforts still do feel like it is Tom Cruise there, but here he shakes his star status off and is completely immersed in an adverse character. It's so far form his image and he inhabits the role so brilliantly that we see him as the character and not as Cruise playing a character. There is no whiff of this being a star vehicle that at times tarnished an other wise exemplary performance in Last Samurai. Also Jamie Foxx is also excellent. He is an up and comer of real promise and already being talked up for an Oscar nod for his performance in Ray. Also offering good support is the gorgeous Jada Pinkett Smith.Mann as usual seems to effortlessly create style and tension and excite. His uber realistic approach really gives the film an edge with it's action. Cruise as the hit-man is every inch like a highly trained assassin. Authenticity is something that is always in evidence in Mann's work and it is clearly evident here. This is a brilliant piece of work. It's exciting, highly atmospheric and despite a far from original premise, feels unique. I hope that in a slow year for Oscar fodder, that this film will get appreciation for Cruise and Mann in particular. This is one of the best films this year. *****",Collateral

An intriguing and original story, crackling dialogue, fantastic performances, superb direction, and some great action set pieces. The film is just all-around excellent. Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry and play off each other well, and the supporting characters add to the story without taking away from the two leads. The cinematography is simply stunning, and is showcased to full effect in the film's highlight, the nightclub scene. The end goes off the rails a bit, but it's simply an extension of what had been building the entire film. And the ending, though abrupt, is perfect for the film. Just a fantastic film.",Collateral
173,EthanBJones_03,Where oh where do I begin!,10,19 July 2017,"'COLLATERAL' was directed by Michael Mann and stars Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. ​Cab driver Max(Jamie Foxx)'s day is going well. He gets a lawyer(Jada Pinkett Smith)'s number and is offered $600 by a customer(Tom Cruise) to take him to 5 separate locations. Things begin spiralling out of control, however, when Max uncovers what the mysterious Vincent is really doing.Where do I god damn begin with this film? It is awesome, amazing, inventive and I highly, highly recommend it. All the performances are great, the story is riveting, the cinematography is out of this world; it is a masterpiece, plain and simple. I've only watched this film once but I am sure it will be just as riveting(if not more) with multiple re-watches and thus I intend to obtain the film as soon as possible. I've given my first impressions, let me go in depth.The story. The god damn story. It is excellent, genius writing and I loved it. Collateral is two movies in one. It is a tight, claustrophobic thriller between Vincent and Max while in the Cab, and the interplay between these two powerhouse performances is phenomenal. It is also a open thriller in the streets of Los Angeles, where Vincent is doing his thing. Both of these movies combine together to make one utter masterpiece of a script. I cannot praise it enough. The dialogue between the characters is fantastic. And the ending.The ending to this movie is one of the best ending I've seen in a long time. There is no dramatic twist. There is no shocking revelation. It is a pure, unfiltered clash of ideas between the main characters. I cannot flaw the last moments of the film; my jaw was on the floor for them. The buildup to these moments was genuinely terrifying and you have no clue what will happen. Truly an excellent screenplay - thank you Mann, Beatie and Loeb.Jamie Foxx has proved he can be a brilliant actor when given the right material. This movie has allowed me to forgive him for Electro. He is THAT good in this movie. He 100% deserved that Oscar nomination, he was brilliant in this movie. I'll also briefly comment on Max, our protagonist. Max isn't an ex-SAS soldier, he isn't a superhero, he isn't the best at anything - he is a normal cab driver and that is what makes his character so enjoyable to watch. Over the course of a single night, we watch how he changes and evolves and how he does what he must to survive. It is a fantastic portrayal of what someone will do when pushed to the edge and he is genuinely a brilliant character.Tom Cruise. Two words that let me know I will probably at least enjoy a movie. And he steals the show. It hurts me he wasn't nominated for an Oscar because this is, for me, one of his best performances he has ever given. Cruise never plays a villain and has always been typecast as the charismatic, charming hero. Not here. He is charismatic but certainly not charming. He is ruthless, cold blooded and, surprisingly, Cruise sells this role expertly. I can not envision another human in the role of Vincent because Cruise was just that great in the role. Cold, Calculating, brilliant. Three words to describe him.Some comments about Vincent as a character. As previously stated, we rarely see Cruise portray a villain. Vincent is the type of villain that starts of as likable and calm but slowly devolves into a true cold blooded killer. Vincent is relentless in this movie and that makes him genuinely terrifying. He will not stop, he has no remorse, he feels no emotion; he is The Cruisinator. Jada Pinkett Smith was perfectly adequate as Annie and I definitely bought the evolution of her relationship with Max. Overall a well done character but I don't know if she was 100% necessary to the movie. Probably just my opinion though.Mark Ruffallo's performance as Fanning also goes under the radar for many people in this movie which I think is wrong. Ruffallo gives a solid performance as Fanning and I was actually interested in what was happening when he was on screen.The cinematography in this movie could warrant 1000 words in and of itself so I will keep this pretty brief. Cinematography in this movie is beautiful. It is masterfully shot and edited and it is should be retroactively awarded an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron deserve at least that much for their masterfully crafted camera-work. It is truly exceptional how this movie is shot and directed. Visually stunning does not even quite cover it.This movie also has a great score, in case you were wondering.I mean if I haven't convinced you to go watch Collateral yet, I don't know what will. It is a great action movie. It is a fantastic thriller. It is a testament to how excellent movies are made and how movies should be shot. Don't delay seeing this movie any longer, you'll be glad you saw it. I'll rate this movie a flawless rating of 10 Cruisinators out of 10.",Collateral
174,christian123,The cast and crew make this an above average film,8,24 January 2005,"Collateral is a slow paced thriller that lacks action but its still an entertaining movie. The plot is about a Los Angeles cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) who gets in over his head when he agrees to drive a killer named Vincent (Cruise) around Los Angeles to his various hits, an arrangement that is not so easy to get out of. The story is very interesting and fortunately the plot is carried out well. Tom Cruise is very good as Vincent and I was surprised he did not receive a Golden Globe or an Oscar Nomination for his role. Jamie Foxx is very good as Max and he sure makes up for that horrible movie Bait. Jada Pinkett Smith has a small role in the film and she plays her role well. Mark Ruffalo also plays his role as a cop well but he isn't in the film very much. Also on a side note Jason Statham has a cameo in the beginning. Michael Mann does an awesome job of directing and he should defiantly receive an Oscar nomination for his work. Collateral is more for mature audiences because it lacks action so the film has some boring moments. For the most part the film moves along easily because of its cast and the two hours are over before you know it. Collateral isn't a brilliant film though since the plot is a little unrealistic like I had trouble believing that everything in the film took place in one night. The ending is a little disappointing but doesn't bring down the film too much. In a summer with disappointing blockbusters Collateral is a winner. Rating 8/10 great performances and a great director save Collateral from being an average thriller.",Collateral
175,NoArrow,The best performances yet from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx...an excellent film,8,19 August 2004,"'Collateral' features the career best performances of two seemingly different actors: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is a heavy-hitter; every one of his movies usually makes good dough, and a lot are good. Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies. When you hear their names mentioned for the same movie, you don't think it's stupid or impossible, just that the product movie will be some sort of run of the mill, action/comedy buddy picture.When I first read the synopsis for 'Collateral' I thought I knew what it would be like: a PG-13 action comedy that is more concerned with A) getting stuff blowed up good and B) setting its characters up as very cool instead of very complex. It only makes senseI mean; Adam Sandler was in Foxx's role for a while before dropping out.Anyway, I was wrong, and glad about it.The plot follows Max (Jamie Foxx), a quiet, mild-mannered L.A. cab driver that knows all the best routes in town. This becomes clear early on in a tender scene where he picks up a lawyer (Jada Pinkett Smith) and they bet on whose routes will get them to her destination faster. On the way they talk and get to know each other, and we get to know Max. Sure, Smith's character has significance later on, but this scene would be just as important if she didn't.Max's next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruise), a grey-haired, hard looking real estate agent who, judging by his facial hair, looks like he spent his last two days on an airplane. He convinces and pays Max to drive him around to his five real estate deals that night. Max is reluctant, but Vincent is a fine-looking guy so he accepts.The next thing that happens is a surprise. If you have somehow managed to dodge all information on this film then don't read on.While parked in an alley waiting for Vincent on his first job, a body suddenly falls onto the top of Max's cab. Max is shocked, and when Vincent appears in the alleyway he cries for help. Vincent is cool and unaffected though, and he explains to Max that he is not, in fact, a real estate agent but a hit man, and Max is his getaway driver, whether he likes it or not.What follows is a complex character study and a simple thriller packed into one night, most of which takes place in a cab. Vincent and Max start off at odds, and though they do not become friends, they gain a deep understanding of each other as the night goes on. Vincent constantly tells Max his world view, that if we're all just specks on a dot in the universe, who cares if one person is murdered? Max ignores this and realizes that Vincent 'lacks the standard parts that others have'. Vincent also analyzes Maxhe tells him that he talks and does not do, that he's spent his life planning but taking no risks. They trade their analyses in a later scene that's supremely directed and acted.The film is mostly a cab ride/conversation between the two leads, which breaks occasionally to show us the cop on pursuit (Mark Ruffalo) and some of Vincent's hits, and Irma P. Hall as Max's mother in a scene that's funny and revealing. We also have Barry Shabaka Henley as a jazz club owner in a scene that's possibly the film's best, it's suspenseful, heartbreaking, and practically tears open Cruise, Foxx and Henley's characters.And what characters this movie has! Vincent is one of the screen's best villains; he's cool and menacing, but also very complex. He seems like a sociopath murderer, but he's more than that, and you can see the pain inside when he's mistaken as one. He's humanized when he is around people he likes, like Max and Henley's nightclub owner. He has elements of other famous villains, like Henry Fonda's Frank character from 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and Orson Welles' Harry Lime from 'The Third Man'. And just as Harry Lime has his famous cuckoo clock speech, Vincent has his own speech, about a man dieing on a subway train and not being noticed for hours. Cruise executes his character perfectly; it's both his finest character and his finest performance.But the film would die without both the Max character and Jamie Foxx. Max is just an average guy with his own dreams and goals and flaws, thrown into a desperate, dangerous situation forcing him to thwart a man he fears. He tries and tries for the whole night, tearful and shaky by the end, and he has an awesome scene where he turns the tables on Vincent and puts himself in control of their duo, causing Vincent to flip out.The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night. Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.This is one of the year's best films, and with hope it will be up for many Oscars, including Cruise and Foxx in the leading categories. Cruise and Foxx both mastered their roles, this is the best acting I've seen in years, it'll be a crime if the Academy doesn't honor them (especially after nominating 'Training Day', a movie with a very similar plot line that wasn't nearly as complex a character study).Another magnificent aspect is the ending. I wont spoil it, I'll just say that Vincent finds out the answer to the question, 'Who notices?' The symbolism of this scene is delicious, and it is emotional, dramatic, exciting and perfectly acted. A must-see, this is one of the best movies in a long while, 8.5/10.",Collateral
176,kgprophet,Wacky story pulled off by talented Mann,7,19 August 2004,"The premise is like ""Phone Booth"",  a very unlikely scenario is supposed to be swallowed by the audience without it turning into a farce.  How can a movie convince an audience that a weak-kneed cab driver can become an accomplice for a hit man? Our beloved hit man, Cruise, has a ludicrous assignment of laying to waste so many people in such a way that could not happen in reality.  ""Phone Booth"" pulls it off by pulling the plug on the idea quickly before it gets lame (it clocks in at 81 minutes).  
Director Michael Mann, the stylistic director of ""Thief"", ""Heat"" and producer of ""Miami Vice"", is very skilled in setting up the characters with well written dialogue.  Mann's editing style includes throwing in ""garbage"" shots.  He will dwell on something insignificant, such as something you might stare at while waiting for a traffic light. Mann is underrated as a director.  He consistently gets convincing performances from talented actors.  Jamie Foxx stands out as a major star in this film by underplaying his character.  Cruise, has no choice but to play Tom Cruise.  In this case, he is a nice bad guy that kills bad bad guys.  Shot in very cold fluorescent looking light, he is convincing as a hit man.  Mann plays with the HDTV format.  You would never guess this is the same format used to shoot ""Attack of the Clones"".  There is a video artefact called trailing that is reminiscent of older video technology. I'm certain that this effect was deliberately incorporated to give it a 'reality' feel.  Compared with the night video shot for the ""Cops"" TV series, or other HDTV movies with night photography, this pushed video 'look' seems to also include the look of the glare from bright lights that are in the frame.  I am still not a fan of HDTV video replacing good old 35mm film, but it makes sense in this case, when considering the overall tone of the film.  This is somewhat ironic, whereas most ""films"" shot on video want to try their best to avoid the 'video' look.
During this two hour movie, the cabbie named Max is forced to examine his life while he is being confronted with the life or death situation involving Cruise. Here is where the true core of the movie resides.  The screenwriter(s) adroitly avoid the machinations of a plot that looks contrived on paper, and instead concentrate on the three central characters (the third being Annie, the pretty prosecuting attorney).   Once we get inside the head of Foxx's character, we can believe the series of events (but barely at points) that drive this film. It is rare that a film delivers on both story and action.  The action scenes are quick and violent,  and keep the adrenaline pumping. 
While this film will not change the minds of anyone about Tom Cruise, nevertheless he performs well when in the experienced hands of renowned directors (Scorcese. Levinson, Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick, Pollack).   The audience can be assured also that you won't readily be able to predict how the night will end, which keeps you involved in the third act.  I would not be surprised if the film is remembered at Oscar time, including acting by Foxx, and director Mann.I give it a 7 out of 10.",Collateral

178,dvc5159,One of the best thrillers in recent years.,9,4 December 2007,"Max (Jamie Foxx), a taxi driver, falls victim to Vincent (Tom Cruise), who takes him hostage so that he could complete five hits in one night in the city of Los Angeles. With a basic plot at that, one could think about how predictable the show would become.Thankfully, it doesn't.Thanks to a solid script and masterful performances by Cruise and Foxx, the movie is saved from losing credibility. Mostly a character-driven movie, Collateral is a throwback to the old Noir genre of the 50's, and we get it with a modern and masterful touch, kudos of director Michael Mann, who, no matter what, seem to inject flair and energy into his actors. I mean, just look at Heat! Notice how intense Pacino and De Niro were acting. This shows how good his direction can be.Cruise steals the limelight of the show, something he could not quite achieve during the previous years. Here, he plays a cold-blooded villain for the first time, and he makes the character into his own. He has believability and that look of viciousness in his eyes. In fact, I myself did not believe that Cruise was playing the hit-man until 50 minutes into the movie. It is with strong belief that Cruise was robbed of even an Oscar nomination.Jamie Foxx is also excellent as Max, the cab driver. His character is an ordinary human, an Average Joe, that is suddenly thrown into the world of crime and violence the moment Vincent steps into the cab. Foxx also delivers credibility into the role, making us wonder what would he do next, as Foxx's character represents us, the regular, normal, audience, who is experiencing the fear that he is while watching the movie.Supporting actors are also good here. Mark Ruffalo delivers a credible performance as Fanning, who is investigating the five hits. Javier Bardem is superb as his brief portrayal as Vincent's employer, Felix. And Jada Pinkett-Smith is good in her brief performance as Annie, a lawyer who is dropped off by Max right before Vincent steps in.The storyline is basic, but it's the screenplay that compels us. The lines are sharp and crisp, and made even more believable when executed by the actors. The tension is there, and it makes the story more human. Layer by layer, minute by minute, the story unravels slowly and in a steady pace, so that the audience is able to understand the situation and become engrossed in it.The action sequences are handled nicely. Superb camera work and editing. They are loud, fast, swift and brutal. The best example of such a scene is the climax. I won't spoil it for you, see it for yourself.The direction, as mentioned earlier, is superb. Michael Mann adds another classic movie to his resume. Here he adds his elements into making another one of his masterpiece, that made ""Heat"" great. Overall, he really injects life and credibility into the movie, giving such realism and flair in the picture.The cinematography is handled also superbly. Here, Mann shot the film in HD so that we would be able to see night-time Los Angeles in all its glory. Add a haunting score by James Newton Howard, and you have an atmosphere that is gritty, urban, and most of all, realistic.Overall, a breath of fresh air from the now not-so-original Hollywood, and one of the best thrillers for the new millennium. Kudos to Cruise for giving an outstanding performance and to Mann for making an old story seem new.A must see.8.894/10Delton",Collateral
179,bix171,Star Power,4,22 August 2004,"This year's submission in the Tom Cruise Oscar grab is a stylized noir thriller from director Michael Mann, whose previous entries in the genre ('Heat', 'Thief') were bloated and derivative. Things aren't much better now: Mann's still derivative, though this time less of the subtle noir of the Forties than of modern gangster epics such as Brian DePalma's 'Scarface' with their razzle-dazzle nightclub shootouts. He might think he's making a small, intimate picture built on performances, but by encouraging underacting, he's actually oversizing the effect, with Cruise's megawatt star power unable to keep a lid on things; the movie gets louder and less interesting as it progresses. Cruise plays a hired assassin who employs a reticent cabbie (Jamie Foxx) to squire him to five various hits around Los Angeles. In writer Stuart Beattie's hands, there isn't much tension--you can see the structure of his screenplay from the first scene and the action set pieces seem baked in solely for Beattie and Mann to advance the dull interplay between Foxx and Cruise which spirals into conversations that inevitably boil down to the dreaded 'existential' despair that made 'Thief' and 'Heat' so unbearable. The film's meant to showcase the city's dark side but doesn't (Ken Russell's 'Whore' and Quentin Tarentino's 'Pulp Fiction' do a better job of that) because of Mann's fussy concentration on fitting Cruise into his visual scheme: he sports a short salt-and-pepper haircut and wears a gray suit, in line with Mann's sleek, blue-steeled, fluorescent building interiors (though certain scenes incorporate the neon that was emblematic of Mann's TV series 'Miami Vice'). Cruise is competent as usual, doing everything he can to keep his Vincent enigmatic, yet he only sporadically compels the audience's curiosity about his backstory. Foxx, as the driver, is better, though he's saddled with Beattie's caricature: his docile dreamer Max gets to be an outraged black man when he's able to seize the opportunity, which has the unfortunate effect of making what was supposed to be a brooding noir seem more like a self-actualization course.",Collateral
180,brenttraft,"Yin, Yang, and I Ching",10,29 August 2004,"Collateral is part action thriller and part high concept, existentialist psychological drama.  As a thriller, it works okay but for me the best parts are when they are sitting around in the taxi talking.  This is one of the rare films where someone put a lot of thought into the script before turning it into a film.  Who would of thought that Stuart Beattie, who wrote one of the Mummy scripts, could actually write an intelligent (dare I say intellectual) script?Vincent is the epitome of evil but he justifies himself to Max and in some regards, he is right.  Vincent might be evil but he is a doer.  Max is a dreamer.  Max is always trying to do the right thing but given a choice, he would just as well keep things the way they are.  Max needs everything to be perfect while Vincent likes to improvise.  Because they are opposites, they need each other.  Neither man seems to have much intimacy in their life and they seem intent on trying to convince the other on the legitimacy of their views.   Upon first viewing, you are caught up in the thriller part of the story and it's hard to notice the nuances and symbolism.  On subsequent viewings you can pay more attention to the psychological details and surreal elements. For instance, at one point Max actually becomes Vincent.  In several parts of the film, Vincent is helping Max and acts as sort of a malevolent benefactor.  It is at these levels of the film that make it so special.  The film also has some genuinely funny moments; it does not take itself too seriously.Los Angeles late at night is an eerie, seductive and beautiful place and the filmmakers capture it well.  The action parts are adequate but it is the quiet passages that make this film special.  The acting, script, photography, music, and directing are all first rate.  It works well as a thriller but is even better as a psychological drama.  I consider this an instant classic.  10/10.",Collateral

182,MogwaiMovieReviews,"Improvise, Darwin, I Ching",8,13 August 2021,"Rewatched this last night again, the second of Michael Mann's two great and unsurpassable LA thrillers, following 'Heat' (1995). Both have more tension, suspense and thrills than almost any 10 other films of their type combined, but it's the feel of it, of the chill in the air of a vast, anonymous, lonely and lifeless desert city before dawn, that really stays with you, and the scene with the dead-eyed grey shark-in-a-suit assassin Tom Cruise watching fellow predator the coyote cross the intersection at the traffic lights, is it all in a frozen moment.The film has an excellent script - seldom exploring its ideas with any real depth, but just enough to give weight and meaning to the propulsive, heart-stopping action setpieces without slowing them down.The only real letdown for me is the lack of a perfect final image in the last 30 seconds of the film, which meanders a little when it should surely have just faded out on Tom Cruise's body, slumped alone on the subway, as the doors close and the train picks up speed, doing laps around the city for 6 hours before anyone notices.Great film, anyway, and one of the most spellbinding thrillers ever made.8½",Collateral

I think maybe because Cruise plays a bad guy and that wasn't his thing...usually.Watching it again I can now appreciate what a talented actor cruise is and how well he and Foxx worked together. The acting from everyone is great, the pacing is fantastic. The story can get a little weak when you see a major coincidence happen, I won't spoil it, but you can totally look past it and enjoy the show.Would recommend this to anyone who likes action/thriller and likes to see Tom Cruise shooting dudes.

That bronze hair and that steely accent just redefined him as a perfect villain here. You can't get a single bit of that handsome good guy with pretty smile. In ""The Last Samurai"" he was quite good, but here he is magnificent. And let's not forget Jamie Foxx also. He got an Academy nomination for this and why shouldn't he? Foxx perfectly portrays the simple-minded average-character taxi driver. Tough for him that ""Million Dollar Baby"" released this year, otherwise he got a fair chance for Supporting Actor too; although I'll argue that Foxx's character wasn't confined to a mere 'supporting' category.And Michael Mann is a top quality filmmaker. And I think this is better that 'Ali' or 'Heat'. There are several shots of the city L.A. which somehow adds to a totality in the film. I like this style... this calm description of a suspense story. And the music used throughout the film are excellent. Definitely one of the best movies of 2004.",Collateral

186,jpintar,One of Cruise's best,9,6 August 2004,"Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances since Ron Kovic in Born On The Fourth of July as Vincent in Collatoral.  In it, he plays a hit man who is out of touch with humanity.  Nobody knows who he is, what he looks like, and where he comes froms and he likes that way.  In Collatoral, Vincent kidnaps a cab driver to help him kill five people.  Jaimie Fox is also terrific as the cab driver.  Fox is best known for his comedic work.  Here, he manages to show what a great dramatic actor he is also.  If we didn't care about Fox's character, then the movie would be an incredible waste of time.  Jada Pinkett Smith gives her best performance since The Nutty Professor in a supporting role.  At the end, there may be a few too many coincidences for a moviegoer to take.  Overall, however, it is a strong story with a strong cast that makes it a terrific movie.  This movie is third on my summer list after Spiderman 2 and The Bourne Supremacy for best movies. 9/10",Collateral

That is how tense Michael Mann's icy thriller is. The work put in by the cast and crew is so excellent and in keeping with Mann's direction that he creates one of those few movies that can hook you and not let go until the credits roll.The premise is simple but superbly effective. Everything blends together without feeling cheap or convenient. There are brilliant lines of dialogue and deep characters. For a fairly routine story, there are thrilling twists and turns throughout. It will keep you guessing all the way through.The most kudos for the film I feel belongs to cinematographers Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron, and editors Jim Miller and Paul Rubell. They create a clean, sharp shots of early morning LA, and weave them in juxtaposition with Collateral's ruthless violence. Its a technique I loved.The other kudos for the film belongs with Jaime Foxx. I'm thrilled that he won the Oscar for Ray this same year, because its the only acceptable circumstances for him not winning for this. The best film, without exception, is his scene against Javier Bardem. In one second, he's convincingly playing a nervous cabbie out of his depth. In another, he's pretending to be a ruthless hit-man, and does so with such conviction that he persuades us as much as Bardem. There's a lingering feeling of dread all throughout Collateral, as I said, like a knife is suspended above your very neck. Now that is master filmmaking.",Collateral

Jamie Foxx, was nominated for his role in this, and rightly so, however, I felt that Tom Cruise was just as good, if not better in his portrayal of a killer, and should have been nominated too.The writing is excellent, the intensity factor is way up there, and the acting is terrific. Mark Ruffalo, is also a co-star in this, and did an excellent job too.It's a definite watch, maybe even a good DVD to own. It's a great flick, so check it out.",Collateral

Tom Cruise plays maybe his best role of all time, especially as a villain, Vincent is a truly unique character.

The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, and Bruce McGill. Peter Berg, Javier Bardem, and Jason Statham also have brief cameo roles in one of the few movies that impressed me because I really enjoyed this film. Tom Cruise is electrifying as Vincent a cool calculating contract killer on the top of his game. Jamie Foxx is equally impressive as Max a cab driver who finds himself driving for Vincent while he takes out five people who are going to help bring down a dangerous crime boss known as Felix (played by Bardem). The rest of the cast are solid in their roles but it's Cruise and Foxx who stand out amongst them. The action sequences are well executed and paced evenly throughout the film. Michael Mann continues to show his amazing talent as a filmmaker with Collateral. It's got everything you could ever want in one of these kid of movies. Collateral has an interesting story, characters who are well developed, great acting by the lead actors, with just the right amount of action, suspense, drama, and some humor that makes for an enjoyable movie to watch.

""Collateral"" comes apart with wimpy, formulaic climax",6,9 August 2004,"[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]After making one of the dullest biopics in recent memory, ""Ali"" (2001), director Michael Mann returns to his crime-drama roots in ""Collateral,"" looking to rekindle some of the brilliance of his last thriller, ""Heat"" (1995).Unfortunately, ""Collateral"" is no ""Heat.""Despite an eye-opening dramatic turn by former stand-up comic, Jamie Foxx, ""Collateral"" promises much, but doesn't quite live up to its potential.Mann's thrillers take time to unfold. He revels delving into aspects of characters' lives rarely, if ever, seen in the fast-paced world of Hollywood crime dramas. That's what made ""Thief"" (1981), ""Manhunter"" (1986) and ""Heat"" such good films.His films also take place in a visually stylized urban milieu. Mann's films may be noirish, but his asphalt jungle is sleek, glossy; its inhabitants slick, urbane, even though some of them might very well be slimeballs. Here, Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron's striking cinematography makes nighttime Los Angeles look sexy.The premise of ""Collateral"" is basic: Cabbie Max (Foxx) gets unwittingly engaged for the night by Vincent (Tom Cruise), a hit man with five targets in one night. But ""Collateral"" feels like two disparate films. On the one hand, there's the intriguing mind game between Vincent and Max. Their conversations are thoughtful and utterly convincing. They develop an almost morally uncomfortable intimacy. On the other hand, there's everything else in the film.Mann's films usually give us interesting supporting characters we get to know well. That's not the case with ""Collateral."" There's one splendid supporting role - a jazz club owner played superbly by Barry Shabaka Henley, who was the best thing in Spielberg's ""The Terminal,"" earlier this year.But there aren't many moments like this in ""Collateral."" Instead, we get entirely forgettable supporting characters, including two police detectives, played by Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg. They're worked into a superfluous subplot and given the film's most stilted dialogue. Excising them would have cost nothing.""Collateral"" begins promisingly. Before Vincent hops in the cab, Max picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They flirt, talk about their lives, their dreams. The dialogue flows well, there's believable chemistry giving scene a pleasing rhythm.Cruise and Foxx hold this film together. Villains always are more interesting than heroes and Cruise, playing against type, almost pulls off the killer without a conscience, someone Jeff Bailey might have referred to as ""awfully cold around the heart."" Foxx proves he's not to be pigeonholed as a comedian and turns in a surprisingly good performance.Where this film fails miserably is in its plotting.With most other filmmakers, we could anticipate who Vincent's final target will be. But since this is a Michael Mann film, we expect something different. And this is where he disappoints. He sticks rigidly to formula and gives us exactly the gutless denouement we'd expect to see in any other conventional thriller. Mann and writer Stuart Beattie create scenes that begin fascinatingly, but end hackneyed. There's a traffic stop that builds slowly and intensely, only to conclude with one of the most overused cinematic clichés.Any sense of reality gets obliterated in the final act, starting with the Felix scene. And there's an unbelievable nightclub sequence that could only take place in the movies. Apparently in LA, people will continue dancing even if the person next to them has his neck snapped by an assassin and gunfire erupts in the club.Then there's the ending, complete with a cell phone that's running out of power, a victim who waits too late to call 9-1-1 and the requisite foot chase. It seems so horribly tacked on, not what we expect from Mann. ""Collateral"" isn't necessarily bad. Given the talent involved, it's merely one of the huge disappointments of the year.",Collateral
193,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,a daring and epic thriller,10,4 January 2005,"Tom Cruise shows everyone just how good an actor he is in 2004's hit thriller, 'Collateral', playing a villain for the first time in his career. Also putting in a great performance is 2004 Oscar Winner Jamie Foxx, who received an Oscar nod for this movie as well. Collateral's dark, gritty, and realistic feel and mood will have you clinging on the edge of your seat for the entire time.Max (Foxx) has an honest job as a Los Angeles cab driver, and he's among the best, knowing his city like the palm of his hand. Tonight's been going well for him. He even managed to get the phone number of a very attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith) as she rode in his cab. His next customer is a medium heighted man, with grey hair and a suit to match. His name is Vincent (Cruise). Vincent quickly points out that he has a few stops to make, and that he'll pay a hefty fee to Max if he can drive him to and from these stops.While waiting for Vincent at stop number 1, Max will be shocked as a body flies ontop of the cab. After a few shrieks from Max and cool yet deadly talk from Vincent, Max discovers Vincent's real plan: he is a hit-man, and is using Max to get to and from is assignments, killing them along the way.Tom Cruise's performance is certainly Oscar worthy, but he didn't receive a nod, as the competition was better. He definitely deserved it. Every second of the movie, you will know that Vincent is in control. You'll actually feel as if you're watching Vincent, not Tom Cruise with a hefty hair change. Jamie Foxx turns in a stunning show as well, and he shines towards the end. I'm not spoiling anything here, but all I'll say is that you'll either love or hate the end.Michael Mann's direction is superb, and I'm surprised he didn't receive a best director nomination. He makes every detail of Vincent's personality and past extremely important by emphasizing every single detail. He also makes Vincent the ultimate bada** villain, in many ways that are so cool, I can't tell you because it'd be spoiling. The film is extremely well written, and the only fault I have for it is that it becomes a tad unrealistic towards the end of the film, but with a thriller, that is to be expected, and it doesn't take away from the fact that this is a diamond in the rough. You'll love it, and come away from it feeling like a totally different person, having watched perennial good-guy Cruise play everyone's worst nightmare of a villain.10/10 --spy",Collateral
194,asifahsankhan,"Cruise's most nuanced performance of the modern era, or any era of his career for that matter!",9,19 May 2017,"First off, let me remind you: Tom Cruise is the ""movie star."" If you didn't know that already, then, hey, welcome to the planet earth (an apology in advance for most of my nonsense). A staple of cheesy '80s movies (Riskey Business, Cocktail, Top Gun, All the Right Moves, etc.) he escaped into the next two decades to front some very fine and profitable motion pictures and as of 2017, become one of, if not THE, highest paid actor in Hollywood (he is actually but the media won't claim it because he told them not to). But merely being paid well for acting doesn't mean you can actually act (but let's not point fingers shall we?). With the impending release of the Mummy, that same action movie with a different twist, Collateral is one of my favourite Tom Cruise movies and where he demonstrated his best work being on the opposite side of the law the main antagonist. AND it's right on the money!Collateral is hands down Tom Cruise's most nuanced performance of the modern era, or any era of his career for that matter. Playing off of mostly Jamie Foxx during the entire run of the film, Cruise plays the role of Vincent. He's just a guy who's in Los Angeles for a couple of days, with some time to kill. Actually, he has some people to kill as well, and he forces Foxx's character of Max to ferry him around from murder scene to murder scene in order to finish the jobs at hand. Naturally, Max puts up a fight and tries to escape with some rather crafty and unconventional means.However, Vincent wouldn't be very good at his job if he wasn't able to improvise and adapt to his environment, which means Max is going to have to put up a huge fight to escape his supposed fate.The reason that Vincent is Tom Cruise's best — and probably most important — performance of his career is that it's one of the rare moments where he plays someone we're not supposed to root for. Sure, he previously got to flex his villain muscles in Interview With The Vampire, but Lestat has more of a comedic edge to him that makes the character more enjoyable when he murders people in cold blood.Jamie Foxx's Character, Max is a decent guy, a taxi driver who is sort of in love with one of his passengers. He knows where she live since he's the one who carried her around in that taxi a coupe of times but can't seem to build up the courage to ask her out. Cruse's character, Vincent, on the other hand, is an existential sociopath. He wonders what our place on this Earth is all about, and so far the answers he's come up with aren't strong enough for him to stop killing people.The man is goal focused to the end, even taking some hits as he chases Max down during the film's action-packed finale. And just when you think he's about to close in for the kill, he's gunned down by sheer, dumb, cosmic luck. In that final moment, he realises that it's all for nothing. No one will notice he was there, because it was what he'd always aimed for. His goal was always to leave no trace behind, and he succeeds admirably.While he's the film's villain, and a cold-heart-ed killer; Tom Cruise manages to have some of that mischievous fun that he had with Lestat so many years ago.His performance as Vincent walks a tightrope of calm logic, fierce rage, and grinning idiot. Yet somehow, he gets you to feel just a little sorry for him at the end, as he's slumped over on that train – which calls back to the story told earlier in the film. I hope Cruise and director Michael Mann get to work together again at some point in the future, as this film brought out some of the best qualities of why he still remains an acting force of nature. If you've never seen Collateral, or haven't experienced it in a good long while, I highly recommend you do so. The film is as fresh today as it was back in 2004.",Collateral

196,gregeichelberger,Cruise-n with a Zen hit-man,4,24 June 2012,"Originally published on Aug. 5, 2004: There were high hopes for Tom Cruise's newest film, the Dreamworks release, ""Collateral,"" but despite fine cinematography and a fairly literate script, the enterprise fell just a bit short, in this humble scribbler's opinion.Fresh off his ""Last Samurai"" role, Cruise plays out-of-town hit-man, Vincent, in town to whack a few government drug trial witnesses. Somehow, though, he stumbles into the cab of resourceful, yet stuck-in-rut driver, Max (Jamie Fox, ""Ali,"" ""On Any Given Sunday,"" ""In Living Color"" TV series) for a trip to his first victim.Once Max sees a body fall onto his hack and then observes Vincent come running back, however, he knows what has happened. Worse, yet, he is forced to drive the killer to his next appointed round.What takes place over the next few hours is a cat-and-mouse game between the two, with Vincent spouting Zen homilies on taking control of one's life and seizing the day. Meanwhile, Max, who has no backbone and no reason to stand up for himself, is growing more and more confident.Late in the film, he is even able to stand up to the murderer. He becomes a worthy adversary, and when Vincent targets a federal prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith, ""Ali,"" ""The Matrix Revolutions"") Max met earlier, he goes into action to stop the carnage.The scene on the LA subway is pretty silly — especially when an almost indestructible Vincent appears on the back of a speeding train, while the final battle seems straight out of ""The Gunfight At the O.K. Corral,"" but it somehow manages to work if one does not think too much about it.There are some nice individual scenes in this film (directed by Michael Mann, ""Heat""), including Vincent wiping out two skinheads who stole Max's wallet; and a great shootout in a nightclub. The picture, though, seems vague much of time and viewers will no doubt question the whole point of the endeavor.Is it an action/adventure, a crime thriller or a cerebral drama wrapped around a puzzling enigma, as well as a few murders? I, for one, never really figured it out.It's not a bad film, by any means, it just needs a little more focus and direction.Other than the leads, only the federal prosecutor has any other significant role, but these are very well-developed nevertheless.Cruise's Vincent draws from his recent past parts in ""Samurai"" (flailing martial arts killer), ""Magnolia"" (smarmy pseudo pyschobabble) and ""Jerry MacGuire (with his folksy, aw-shucks demeanor) to form a violent hit-man with amazing deadly physical skills, but with an unbelievable amount of personable charm.As for Foxx, he does a terrific job as the bitter, frustrated cabbie who harbors the bile and resentment of a failed dream (to own his own limousine service), even deceiving his own mother for years.Dark, brooding cinematography (Dion Beebe, ""Chicago"" and Paul Cameron, ""Gone in Sixty Seconds""), which captures the seedier, as well as the more attractive parts of Los Angeles, adds to whatever enjoyment one may derive form this fairly depressing and almost desperate motion picture",Collateral
197,nesfilmreviews,A taut thriller with two strong performances and one great director.,7,8 July 2013,"""Collateral"" isn't a terribly original motion picture. However, it's the strength of the lead performances and the stylish direction of Michael Mann that obscures the weaknesses in plotting and credibility. . For the most part ""Collateral"" remains a sharply taut thriller but ever so gradually towards the end it tests our plausibility nerves. The movie never fails, but it never really deepens either. The story line never deviates from going somewhere unexpected, but at least it's always satisfying.Los Angeles cab driver Max Durocher (Foxx) lives an incredibly mundane life. He drives a cab day in and day out - and has for the last twelve years. His only escape from reality is a photo of a tropical island and the fact that he wants to start his own limo company. All that changes when a government investigative attorney named Annie Ferrell (Jada P. Smith) gets in his cab from the airport. She's wound tight, getting ready for a big case the next morning, but he charms her into talking and makes a favorable impression. Immediately after dropping Annie off downtown, he picks up a fare that is known only by his first name – Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max a deal he can't refuse - $700 for making five stops, then getting him to the airport for his flight out of LA. As the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. begin to put the pieces together, they race to intercept the two of them. Max and Vincent's survival becomes dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined.The survival-of-the-fittest, do-or-die theme eventually becomes rather one note. The amusing, exceptional first half of the film is undermined when the story races towards a prevailing, mechanical conclusion. Acting and atmosphere define the film, but there are times when style can become substance, and this is one of these instances. The performances by Cruise and Foxx are the highlights, and Mann's direction guarantees that any chance of boredom or disinterest will not materialize.",Collateral
198,Brogan,Another winner from Michael Mann!,10,4 August 2004,"COLLATERAL has been the movie I've been anticipating the most this past summer. Yea, movies like SPIDER-MAN 2, TERMINAL, BOURNE Supremacy, and THE VILLAGE were films that I was excited about, and was very pleased with the finish product. Then films like SHREK 2, and MANCHURIAN CANIDATE were films that I wasn't excited about, and winded up being pleasantly surprised. Yet, I was expecting a majority of the summer films to be like I-ROBOT, DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and VAN HELSING, look good, but no substance. COLLATERAL was a different story, since the least appreciated director working in Hollywood today, Michael Mann, directs it. Watching the sneak preview tonight, everybody in line was psyched up because it was the new ""Tom Cruise film."" I sat in line with my tiny Pocket Essentials copy of the filmography and career of Michael Mann. When I asked people in line if they knew who Michael Mann was, I got from everybody, ""uh, nope!"" No surprise there. I've been building up my excitement for this movie the last couple of weeks by watching the previous films from Mann's career, Thief, THE KEEP, MANHUNTER, LAST OF THE MOHICIANS, THE INSIDER, ALI (director's cut), and my favorite HEAT. I also watched the episode of the directors that airs on Encore about Mann's life and career and reading my two paperback books about Michael Mann's films (no big surprised, both books were published in England). In short COLLATERAL in America will be hyped as the ""New Tom Cruise film"" in Europe, it will be known as the ""New Michael Mann film."" To put it simply, I analyzed and studied what all of Mann's films have in common and what his style was, then I watched COLLATERAL. COLLATERAL has a hit man, Vincent (Tom Cruise), arriving at LAX in the late afternoon, with not really giving details at first what his objective is. A cabdriver, Max (Jamie Foxx), is shown beginning his evening shift. After Max picks up a customer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), he convinces her that he knows the fastest way to get around Los Angeles, and proves it to her. By having an enjoyable conversation, Annie is intrigued and interested in Max, so much that she gives him her business card, hoping to talk to him again soon. After what seems like what is going to be a great night for Max, the next customer is Vincent, who asks if Max can take Vincent to five different stops in L.A. for the evening, paying Max twice the amount for a cab driver's pay. Max doesn't see this as a problem, until while at the first stop; a body falls down on Max's taxi. It turns out that Vincent is a hit man and the five stops involves with five different people that Vincent is planning on killing. While Vincent and Max travel around L.A., with Max hesitating with what he is doing, a police detective, Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) visits the apartment where Vincent made his first kill, the man isn't there, but there's a broken window and evidence of struggle. While Vincent has Max take him around L.A. to different locations for his contract killings, Fanning is investigating on who did murder the man in the apartment. COLLATERAL similar to Mann's previous crime films, (Thief, MANHUNTER, L.A. TAKEDOWN, and HEAT) is very intelligent and clever, that is what I love about Mann's films. The criminals are smart, while the police officers are also smart (no bumbling crooks or doughnut eating cops in Mann's films). The character of Vincent shows that he is a professional with his job by the way he holds his gun (the similar way all of Mann's characters hold their guns, holding it up while aiming at the same time). While the character of Fanning shows logical motives to what could have happened to the people who were killed. This isn't a slam-bang action packed film, but then again, there isn't a Michael Mann film that is all action and no plot. HEAT and Thief gives complex characters with their motives, feelings, ambitions and personalities, while COLLATERAL does the same thing. If you pay attention to what the characters have to say in COLLATERAL (at least Vincent and Max), you will see them as people, not characters. COLLATERAL is a thinking man's thriller. The acting by Jamie Foxx is good; it's nice to see Foxx being able to give a performance that is different than the comedic roles that he has played in the past (BAIT, HELD UP, BOOTY CALL, etc.) COLLATERAL shows that Foxx can do a great job being a serious actor, and hopefully for his sake, will be seen as a serious actor. While Ruffalo, and Pinkett Smith also do good jobs with their supporting roles. But it is Tom Cruise who proves to do a fantastic job with his role as Vincent. Not since INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE has Cruise left his good guy, heroic image for a dark character, (well the same might also be said about MAGNOLIA). But Cruise shedding his handsome image shows that he really put a lot of effort into playing Vincent. The character of Vincent is for me the most enjoyable and fun villain that I've seen since Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher in GANGS OF NEW YORK. A villain that shoots out fantastic lines like a Sergio Leone film. But it is Mann's directing is what really impressed me with this film. All of his trademarks are shown in this film. First the digital high definition camera work looked great! Since Mann hasn't worked with Dante Spinotti since THE INSIDER, both Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron do a great job giving COLLATERAL the Mann look, blue lighting with the various TOT (tricks of the trade) shots. I've said it before and I'll say it again, only Michael Mann can make a city like Los Angeles and make it look like a beautiful city with the cinematography. Besides the cinematography, Mann uses his other trademarks, the great soundtrack, this time it is techno music mixed with, blues, and Latin, and the characters (particularly Vincent) dressed sharp and stylish. But since Vincent is a criminal, he doesn't wear a tie, similar to Neil McCauley, DeNiro's character in HEAT. Plus Mann shoots on location in L.A., making the city more realistic, mixing office high rises with Koreatown stores and nightclubs, and old well kept apartment buildings. In my review of HEAT I praised Mann for giving the viewer an accurate look of Los Angeles. Since L.A. is my second home, Mann uses the same moves in COLLATERAL. I could go into more detail why I loved COLLATERAL, but why spoil the party? This is the best film I have seen all summer and perhaps this year (although I still love KILL BILL VOL. 2). My expectations were met and like all of Mann's other films, COLLATERAL requires multiple viewings. For people who love Michael Mann films, I would rank this film his 3rd best, behind HEAT and THE INSIDER. For people who enjoy a smart intelligent thriller, like BOURNE Supremacy, but not as much action and less jerking of the camera, then COLLATERAL should please you. But if you're looking for an action packed Jerry Bruckheimer /Michael Bay film, then watch something else. But COLLATERAL is the first film this year that can be considered worthy of an Oscar nomination or two. Great show! ***** (Out of five)",Collateral

Combined with top notch direction and acting, Michael Mann has produced a fresh and captivating action thriller that is destined to be one of a kind. This is a thriller that is perfectly thrilling and highly enjoyable at whatever aspect you look at it from.The seedy, dim-lit light of L.A. is astonishing and brings the audience in closer to the story in which Collateral takes pace in. The acting is even more fantastic and proves to be witty as well as nail biting. Cruise is in cruise control and whirl's up a fantastic performance as contract killer Vincent. On the other hand there is Jamie Foxx who, is just as polished and excellent as Cruise who equally shares his acting brilliance through each scene with Foxx.",Collateral
201,Atavisten,Mann is the man!,8,5 March 2006,"This was quite the surprise. A super tight film noir coming out of LA for once is not daily (or yearly) routine. I watched 'Heat' while a mere teenager and liked it, but I also liked 'The Rock' and 'Broken Arrow' so I didn't expect that Michael Mann was such a master director. He takes Tom Cruise and a comedy actor, put them in a taxi in L.A. and it turns out as 'Collateral', the best thriller/noir I have seen in a long time. Jamie Foxx is very good as the taxi driver, but Tom Cruise excels as the hit-man. I have never seen him as good as this, he could even take the almighty guv'nors job in 'Terminator' with success with this killers determination.Pictures are very beautiful also even if L.A. is not.",Collateral
202,kyrat,kind of boring actually,5,28 June 2006,"I admit I was prejudiced from the start - the ads turned me off - I dislike Tom Cruise (how stupid do you have to be to be a Scientologist?) and what was up with that hair? I understand he's trying to mask his identity but that fake hair calls attention to him. Also, the plot of the just looked dumb. Unaware taxi driver participates in shootings?Then a coworker convince me to give it a try. Knowing I like Noir films he said I would like it.I like Noir films, I like films with character study /developemnt/exploration. I enjoy films that have some action but more dialogue. I should have liked this film!I felt no connection to, no interest in, no empathy for any of the characters (not even the poor taxicab driver). I did not feel there was self-realization or any bonding going on between the two characters. Both actors were adequate -if unexciting. The scenery was nice (there were a few nice shots of LA at night), but not spectacular. The ""action"" sequences were just there in the service of the story. The plot was boring and generic. I barely cared enough to watch the thing all the way through just to find out what happens. (Out of the entire film, only that scene in the jazz club interested me- that was interesting, well filmed & had a nice twist.)Maybe it's just the director's (Mann) style I don't get. I remember seeing Heat and being surprised that everyone was raving about it. It was interesting but not the end all be all or anything too original. (I can think of several Chinese films that have done that bad guy/good guy bond/find similarities much better- City On Fire to name one.)I felt like this film was trying for something but failing. Was I supposed to find the last bit of Tom Cruise's dialouge philosophical interesting? Was the last shot supposed to be ""ART""? It seemed trite and a bit pretentious.P.S. for someone who's supposedly an acclaimed director why did he need to bow to the ever-encroaching product placement by including lingering shots of a Bacardi ad? I took away a whole star just for that!",Collateral
203,buzznzipp1995,"Tinged, Riveting, Cruise, transcends from boy actor to 'Mann'.",9,11 September 2006,"I didn't rate this a ten, but that doesn't mean that I felt that this was inadequate. Michael Mann has an uncanny ability to show and tell a story, whether in speech or a quiet very composed shot, he most definitely has a gift at bringing out the interesting in his set-up style.His craft is completed it seems once he has taken you to the edge of the tale, sometimes over it...and sometimes back. Tom Cruise, has his ability, wrapped up in his own form, in other words Tom always seems to be Tom. No matter if he has a different accent or speaks plainly, Cruise is who he is. The 'Gifted' part that I see Mann perform again and again is, his ability to change and actor's regular style. He usually directs them into the character he is written them for. For example take the alleyway, where the two young street boys are looking for an easy target as they rob, Max (The cab driver) and take Vincent's briefcase too. Vincent confronts them in deafening action when threatened by them. It is a flash of deadly force! It jars your mind. Fast and final. Even down to the way the cops communicate with each other and the Feds, it looks and feels real, it's authentic.. Nothing short of amazing. I loved Bruce McGill's Federal agent character, calm collected and in-charge. Lending a good slice of style to Collateral.Though, I disagree with the ending and the office scene, from the street where you could see into the building and propel the movie's storyline on further by sight, is immaterial. I do however, think that by not seeing where Vincent was during that time at the office of the attorney, it would have brought a different element of chaos and a better serving of panicked anxiety. Sometimes the most powerful suspense you can give is by having loose ends, not seeing whats there until you're right in front of it. But, the way it was shot and the expanded audio feel that Mann gives us with the 'film-grain' is a delicious exercise for the senses.The feeling of paddling along in murky deep water, trying to quickly escape an impending disaster is what I felt in this visually pleasing story of cat and mouse. Tom, for a couple hours, with Michael's help was in fact Vincent, the killer. Wow, Mann loves to do the turn-around, and seems to always do it victoriously. Bravo Mr.Mann you did it again.I love the way, this hits you when you are watching it intently, with nothing else happening on a superior audio visual system.(***)",Collateral
204,oneflewovertheapocalypse,"Well it was good, but it wasn't what I wanted for an ending",7,15 January 2005,"I loved the way this film looked. In parts it really looked like a fly on the wall documentary where you were actually there apart of the chaos of Max's life. If Jamie Foxx needed a film before Ray to prove his ability as an actor then Collateral is his defining moment. Cruise is excellent as always but is playing a character which has been done before with Cruise adding a few new elements to the character. Michael' Mann's direction is gritty and full of suspense with jump shots and quick cuts but when the film finally ended I felt let down to the ending. It reminded me o a certain ending from a previous Michael Mann film, not saying which one.Max is a cab driver with dreams of running a limousine company. He does nights and meets friendly and not so friendly people on the way. One night he meets a passenger which he wishes he didn't. That person is Vincent who is asking for a drive like no other Max has taken before. After general chit chat Vincent asks Max to take him to five different places so he can get a contract signed. What he doesn't know is that Vincent is the one who has signed a contract to kill five people in each different five places, much to Max's dismay he finds himself in the middle of a nightmare which he finding hard to get out of. There is a great flow of dialogue between the two leads and each scene is relevant to the story and doesn't get boring at all. After a while the story comes together and everything about the film is looking great till the end comes which is not a bad one but is not the great one I was hoping for. Michael Mann is a great director and has made some classic films but he is not taking his new film to new depths, it just feels like the end scene is a carbon copy. The scene may be different but the tone of atmosphere isn't. In most peoples eyes the ending is satisfactory to them but the ending for me made me go back and think less of the entire film all together. Although the film has great moments, these moments are building up throughout every scene and to put up with the end we have been given is not good enough for me.There are many questions about Max that aren't even answered at the end of the film. Throughout the story many things occur in Max's one night of hell and there is no conclusion to where he goes from here at the end, fro example when everyone believes he is the assassin as Vincent is making him pose as him in one or two parts of the film and the ones who know the truth, end up dead leaving everyone else to still believe Max is Vincent, we never see how he gets out of that. I suppose you can say ""well I'm sure the cops figured it out at the end"", as I am sure they did, but with film finishing under 2 hours it wouldn't have gone a miss to see Max prove his innocence.Excellent performances all round and Michael Mann's direction never fails, but what does fail is the story which builds you up for a great finale which is what you get but not exactly the way you had hoped, for me anyway.",Collateral
205,springsunnywinter,Ultra cool crime thriller,10,29 May 2007,It has to be Tom Cruise's best film as far as I've seen them. The film has an amazing story about a contract killer with a hit list in his laptop and is using a taxi driver for his destinations. Casting was great Tom Cruise was the best and Jamie Fox was not really that good but he could of been much better. The atmosphere is terrific which suits the tensive mood for the movie and it seems like that it's really happening. The best scene is when they where in the nightclub and the song Ready Steady Go was on. I've also seen the Indian remake called The Killer that was also good in it's own place and the actor who played the taxi driver was a lot better than Jamie Fox. If there were going to be a sequel Collateral 2 then it would be good idea if Jason Statham were the bad guy. Overall I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I did not really like Jamie Fox otherwise I would of given it a 10 out of 10 if some other good actor was the taxi driver like Collin Farrell.,Collateral

I found it clumsy, ugly and quite amateurish to be honest, it was one of the first things that stroke me with disgust.The other thing was the score, besides there are a few songs I like (Audioslave is one of my favourite bands) it felt out place most of the time, it really didn't add up or matched what I was watching. Poorly done.I'll give it a generous 5, as it has some aspects and scenes I liked and I found it (before I had time to process what I watched) fairly entertaining.",Collateral
207,lotus_chief,Wonderful film! Michael Mann does it again!,9,16 August 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**Collateral is one of the best movies of the year.  Michael Mann takes us on another great ride, as only he can.  The documentary feel always works for me when it's done right, and Mann has a great way of using it without being distracting.  Masterful directing and cinematography, adding an eerie, realist aura to the film; making it that much more enjoyable and intriguing. Mann filmed and showed LA the way Coppola showed Tokyo in Lost In Translation'just letting the scenery speak for itself.  I don't know where he found the locations he used, but they set the mood perfectly.  I caught onto Mann ever since Heat'..there's something about his documentary, in-your-face style that is very intriguing, and I can't help but anticipate every film he directs.The acting was great all around; especially the two main characters, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  Cruise makes a great turn as a villain; more and more he proves that he's versatile and I give him all the respect in the world for taking those types of risks.  Tom Cruise was just wonderful as Vincent, his performance was flawless; from his demeanor to the way he was handling the gun.  Foxx proves to me more and more every day that he's ready to take that next step.he was great in his role as the ill-fated cab driver.  With a recent string of stellar performances, he's moved himself into the realm of elite African-American actors, which is very few as it is. From Any Given Sunday, to Redemption, to Ali, to Collateral, and the upcoming Rayif he keeps this up he'll be a shoe-in for Tom Hanks status; it could be argued that he's there already.  Jada Pinkett-Smith does what she usually does in a supporting role, she came off more mature here.  The only negative I have as far as the acting goes is Mark Ruffalo as the detective; he never convinces me in his roles, and it was extremely hard for me to take him seriously here as a detective.  My only beef with the film, though not a major one at all, is the ending.  I didn't really mind the way it ended; but I wanted Vincent (Tom Cruise) to live.  I'm a person who roots for the bad guy, so I had hoped for Vincent to kill everyone he had to and get off scott-free.  Once I saw that Jada Pinkett was his last target, I knew the ending was going to be Hollywood-fied' and that he was going to die, obviously by Max's hands. Doesn't really hurt the film, but for my personal taste I would've liked to have seen Vincent triumph.  Collateral is a very smart, stylish thriller breathing much needed life into the genre.***1/2 out of **** stars.",Collateral

This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, score and acting. All of the stellar cast deliver superlative performances. However Cruise and Foxx command the screen. They immerse themselves in their characters offering realistic portrayals. The plot revolves around an honest and gentle hard working Los Angeles taxi driver Max whose dream is to start his own island limo service. About to call it a night Max picks up one last fare Vincent who claims to be in the insurance business. Vincent offers Max $600 to make five stops. Unbeknownst to Max, Vincent is a vicious and cunning hitman which becomes abundantly clear quickly. During their stops Max soon learns how brutal Vincent is as he engages in collateral damage in the blink of an eye. Max soon interferes with Vincent's work and then it becomes a matter of saving lives including his own. All the while the duo is being pursued by authorities and Max turns out to be a worthy adversary. The plot is crisp, intelligent, thrilling, action packed, violent, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. One such quote is Vincent's, ""Don't get me concerned. You don't have the trunk space"". This is a captivating, mesmorizing film and one of the very best in it's genre.",Collateral

Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a hit-man, and orders Max to take him to 5 different destinations throughout the night, to carry out his hits.What you may think could run out of steam pretty easily, really keeps the viewer glued to the screen and guessing how Max will get out of the nightmare situation he has found himself plunged into.

211,fredericksmith1952,I don't believe I will ever tire of Michael Mann's perspective on the human race.,10,1 March 2012,"I don't believe I will ever tire of Michael Mann's perspective on the human race. Cruise is the assassin, a cold, relentless killer without remorse, fulfilling a contract as quickly and efficiently as possible. Jada Pinkett Smith is the doer, an assistant federal prosecutor who is focused and dedicated to making the world a safer place by making sure the criminals end up behind bars. Jamie Foxx is an everyman caught up in a situation he cannot control trying to survive. He is a cabbie with dreams of becoming a limo service owner, and like most of us, lacks the ambition to follow it through. The way his life is going, he will end up driving a cab for the rest of his life. The polarized characters in this drama make for more than just a crime story. It is the battle we all face everyday, the battle of our ambitions and goals being quelled by complacency and routine. It is the battle most of us lose, unless we are fortunate enough to find an epiphany that changes our lives. For two hours, Mann escorts us through the battle is a unique and singular perspective that only he can manage, and this film keeps you on the edge of your seat as Max reaches that epiphany and develops into the everyman who can attain a higher plain. Rated R for violence and language, the sheer integrity and power of this film make it collectible as one of Mann's best pieces. The performances are brilliant, the photography and setting is superb, and the film concludes with a resolution that will bring you to a realization of just how meaningful life can be.",Collateral
212,PotassiumMan,Solid film.,9,7 April 2005,"This is Michael Mann's best recent movie. He can still do something that just draws you in and holds your attention throughout. That is what ""Collateral"" does. The movie shoots off the moment Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx link up.As for the principals, Foxx is the one who does best. One wonders why this performance wasn't also nominated for an Oscar. His cab driver, Max's shift from submissiveness to heroism is completely believable. He is every bit the frightened victim of circumstance and the defiant everyman put together.Tom Cruise, although a little bit less convincing, fills the role effectively. His total and utter lack of remorse and human empathy turns Vincent into a monster that the audience only fears and roots against. Except for his incongruous gray hair contrasted with his still fairly-boyish looks, Cruise's work here is totally on the mark.As good as this movie is, ""Heat"" (1995) is even better- and more realistic. That's a movie in which the police are just as smart as the bad guys, and professional criminals are defeated by law enforcement, not by a guy on the street.",Collateral
213,oshram-3,Good film betrayed by weak ending,6,7 August 2004,"Casting Tom Cruise against type isn't the only thing Collateral has going for it, but it's probably the best thing about the movie. Cruise, whom we have known over the last two decades for playing heroes of varied stripes, finally turns in his do-gooder's suit for something of a little darker stripe.Collateral itself is a seedier film than one usually sees Cruise in, steeped in the world of criminal shadiness, drug runners, hired assassins, and the like. It's a place where Cruise should seem ill-at-ease, but his Vincent not only works organically, he's compelling enough that we want to root for him  and he is not the good guy, not by a long shot. Jamie Foxx co-stars as a cabdriver named Max who very simply gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and tries to make the best of his bad situation. While Foxx is also not the first person you would think of for a role of this sort, he inhabits Max's skin very comfortably as well; most of the film is he and Cruise playing off one another, and they do this very well.Director Mann gives us just enough of a story to get by, and that's all you really need. Details would be meaningless in a plot like this, and so exposition is left to the wayside and largely substituted with character development; this pays off through most of the film, and as Max and Vincent get to know one another better, the dramatic ante is upped. A scene where they visit Max's mother in the hospital is particularly well-done, as is one where Max has to pretend he's Vincent in front of a crimelord. The film moves along at a brisk and engaging pace until the ending; there's a horrible plot contrivance, and it deflates the proceedings somewhat. The movie is strong up until that point, but the ending simply asks for too much suspension of disbelief, and ends up betraying the rest of the film.But both Cruise and Foxx turn in strong performances, and the movie's worth going to see if for no other reason than to watch these two fence with one another (they reportedly got along famously on set; I think some of that camaraderie seeps into the picture, despite the fact that the two are adversaries). But Collateral is fairly solid up until the end, and showcases two pretty strong performances. Given the high caliber of other thrillers this summer, Collateral might not be able to hold its own due mostly to its weak ending; but if you have a second run theater near you, it's definitely worth checking out there.",Collateral
214,jrfranklin01,Odd Roles for Both,4,19 March 2005,"This film definitely takes a bit of a turn from previous roles for both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise. Cruise plays a hit man who uses a cabbie's services to complete a list of marks for the evening. The cabbie, played by Fox, is a well-educated man who almost comes across as not fitting the part correctly. I'm not trying to slant cab drivers, but Fox didn't seem convincing, maybe because of his comedic background. Cruise wasn't much better. For a guy that usually plays the hero's role, seeing him act darkly was a first. I will say that his new image (grayish hair, unshaven look) helped him at least look the part. The polished wit and outfit gave him a distinguished presence. But then his philosophy on life, psychology, etc. threw him out of the stereotypical hit-man mix. In the end, I guess they both were so oddly paired for their roles that the director thought the movie could work. But really, how plausible is any film where a contract killer uses a taxi-cab driver as his personal chauffeur for killing people?! The outrageousness of that alone is almost too much, albeit sensationalism is one of the things viewers can't seem to resist. 4/10",Collateral
215,noizyme,an average movie with a sleek push forward,7,12 August 2004,"I just got out of this movie (when I wrote this comment), and I have to say that I think I've seen that kind of movie about a zillion times.  Hollywood still seems to find ways to press the same issue with a high-tensity, big name cast movie featuring a way to make a well-known star (Cruise) pair up with an unlikely co-star (Foxx) and change his personality yet again.  Maybe it's just me, but this is an example of poor creativity.::Spoiler:: On the upside, Cruise's character is somewhat different (even if it utilizes his same-character personality of the cool guy with nothing too big for him) and a snappy, older (?) haircut.  Foxx plays a lowly cabdriver whose love-interest is a target of Cruise's character, thus pushing Foxx to step up to his level of limit-pushing escapism.  But the fact that Michael Mann tried to have you feel bad for Cruise's character in the end was propostorous.The film featuring great music, and the LA nighttime landscapes couldn't have been depicted more accurately or more beautifully.  The quality really pulled this hum-drum story along.  The club scene was alright, but if you know anything about club scenes in movies, you know that no one really knows what they're dancing to or what to do, and that shows.I liked the movie overall, despite the nit-picks.  A good return for Cruise (an audience favorite) and a decent character change for Foxx.",Collateral
216,schroeder-gustavo,Cruise vs. Foxx,9,15 July 2015,"Collateral is pretty much a long, very interesting conversation between two opposite characters. On one side, you have Foxx, who plays a relaxed, nice, friendly but clever taxi driver that is only trying to make a living and save up for later plans. But then you have Cruise, whose character is an ice cold killer, who is ""indifferent"". He shows absolutely no feelings towards killing people. I like the way they develop the characters in the movie and the performances are great.Interestingly, although Cruise is the bad guy, by the end of the movie I found myself wondering, who should I cheer for? Someone is going to die, but I liked both characters so much, I couldn't decide which one should live and who should die. That is a great sign from the movie.There are flaws, in my opinion, as some scenes don't pack the punch I wanted them to, for example: when Foxx goes to a club to talk to Felix, the scene is supposed to be one of the most intense in the film. Not to say that it's not intense, cause it is, but it felt to me like it should have packed a harder punch. Another example was the club shootout, a scene that should have been awesome. It's only good, mainly because it doesn't focus on Cruise like it should, and instead, we get way too many shots of other people in the club.Some things in the dialogue also feel rushed and not as ""clean"" as they should sound. Like when Foxx handcuffs the cop to the car after the crash and tells him like Vincent told him: ""When did this become a negotiation?"" It just feels like some of that dialogue could have been avoided.I liked the ending, I loved that Foxx, although unskilled in the art of manslaughter could kill Cruise and he didn't believe it.Collateral is a great movie and, although it doesn't have the best cinematography at parts and the dialogue feels a bit rushed at times, the movie is still very much worth it.",Collateral
217,Pavel-8,A slick & mature thriller.,8,26 August 2004,"From director Michael Mann comes ""Collateral"", the single night story of a hit-man and a taxi driver, who serves as both hostage and chauffeur. The film is highly reminiscent of ""Heat"", also helmed by Mann. Fortunately Mann learned from some of his earlier mistakes, crafting a tighter, more personal picture. The film is rife with Mann's touches, ranging from hues to cues. Set in urban Los Angeles, the lighting and locations effectively reflect the multi-ethnic night scene, as the entire movie is infused with a blue tint (see: ""Heat"", ""The Insider""), adding to the Mann's usual mellow yet driving feel that aids in distinguishing ""Collateral"" from most cinema. The soundtrack features the fully competent music of James Newton Howard (""Unbreakable""), but the other musical choices are the highlights. Utilizing jazz to classical, as well as the usual dramatic score, the music lounges well in the background, providing a truly appropriate soundtrack to scenes that range from quiet dialogue to brutal action. Through that variety of scenes, ""Collateral"" develops characters and story in a parallel manner rather than opt for the common needlessly breakneck stories that substitute action for plot and character depth. After a well-paced introduction accompanied by classical music, Vincent (Tom Cruise) hops into the taxi of Max (Jaime Foxx). One stop later, as the music kicks it in gear, the game is afoot. The two progress through Vincent's list of terror, and they get to know each other. Instead of defining the characters with an opening sequence or two, then hurling them into a chaotic series of events, ""Collateral"" develops both Vincent and Max to the very last scene. The audience learns about both Vincent and Max as the duo learns about each other, resulting in a compelling, Heat-esque battle of wills between the characters and a viewer's decision about whom to root for.Given the characters' professions, that choice may seem easy, but for at least two reasons, a legitimate dilemma exists. First of all, it's Tom Cruise, here playing an atypical role for him; plus his Vincent is not a traditional baddie. An evil man, yes, but one who convincingly believes his profession is no different than any other; he sincerely thinks he is doing right. As Hitler proved (pardon the extreme comparison), these are the most dangerous type of evil people, because they possess no remorse and no hesitation. In ""Collateral"" such an antihero interacts crisply with Jaimie Foxx's character. As Vincent's foil, Max is far from a normal protagonist, and Foxx plays him unexpectedly well as a day-dreaming, underachieving hack stuck in the same rut for a dozen years. With the character traits of the hero and antagonist switched thusly, the story confuses rooting interests yet engages the mind, dragging a willing audience along for an introspective roller-coaster. In more than one sense, the simple plot brings to mind last year's ""Phone Booth"", in that the morally questionable main characters are largely confined to a small space, and the pic is basically a mano-a-mano experience. But while ""Phone Booth"" had Colin Farrell battling an unseen threat, Mann blatantly presents the opposing forces, whether they be physical or mental obstacles. This is a more difficult conflict to express well, but ""Collateral"" successfully presents the strife, thanks to superb performances from cast and crew. But despite their noblest efforts, a total lack of redeeming character values does fetter the film from fulfilling a greater glory. Over the last twenty minutes, ""Collateral"" unfortunately but unsurprisingly lapses into convention but still serves as a thinking man's thriller. You won't find mindless entertainment like ""S.W.A.T."" here, but something akin to Michael Mann's previous work, in a more compact package.Bottom Line: Very enjoyable, and a good change of pace from summer tripe. A low 8 of 10.",Collateral
218,jmillerdp,Good But Far Fetched!,7,4 May 2013,"Michael Mann does L.A. better than any director. And, so being intrigued by the city as I am, I enjoy his L.A.-set movies. ""Heat,"" of course, is great! He returns with ""Collateral."" The complex and fascinating character interactions of ""Heat"" are here replaced by a fairly routine thriller.It is good, but demands too much suspension of disbelief. There are just WAY too many coincidence here! You are okay with them for a while, but as the film goes on, it does get to be a bit much.Otherwise, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, except with graying hair! Personally, almost whenever I see Tom Cruise, that is who I see. I have a difficult time buying most of his characters. Same goes with some other stars like Ben Affleck or Robert Redford. I do buy Cruise more as a villain than I have John Travolta, someone I also have a tough time buying as the characters he plays.Mann experimented with early digital cinematography here, and I personally didn't care for it. I get the idea of making the film edgier, etc., but that's about it. Luckily, there's still plenty of the film, on film!******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)",Collateral
219,film_riot,Collateral,7,18 September 2007,"Michael Mann is what I would call an urban filmmaker. Here in ""Collateral"" he shows us the nightly Los Angeles so often that I guess he loves this city, even if his crime and drama-filled films let me suspect that he has pretty ambiguous feelings towards it. With ""Collateral"" it's the same as with the great ""Heat"" and ""Miami Vice"", this urban atmosphere of restlessness and very short moments of beauty once again dominates the movie. Here it is combined with a very thrilling story of a hit man, who has to kill five particular people in one night. It's a good film and very cool again, but it didn't work fully for me because of the two main characters. On the one hand we have Max, played by Jamie Foxx. I never really got to believe the emotions and the changes that this man is going through. On the other hand there is Vincent, played by Tom Cruise. Cruise isn't able to play the moments of violent eruption believable.",Collateral
220,skymovies,Mission: Implausible,5,28 September 2004,"Endless overhead tracking shots through neon cityscapes, skewed camera angles, mumbled dialogue and improbable plot developments - this is a thriller that yearns for significance but is ultimately just another exercise in style over substance from Michael Mann. Put another way, it's a handsomely staged disappointment.While Cruise is a believably inscrutable villain and Foxx an acceptable foil, the interesting premise is lost in a sea of improbability and eventually sunk by a hackneyed damsel-in-distress finale. Despite promising more than the usual guns'n'poses take on the genre, Mann's deliberate build-up never really gains momentum. The ridiculous nightclub shootout generates more laughs than excitement, leaving a hole in the movie's credibility that is never patched up. From that point on, the lifting of ideas from the likes of 'The Terminator' and 'Speed' underlines the fact that the plot has, indeed, been totally lost.Collateral reinforces my opinion of Mann as an assured filmmaker whose determination to produce something deep and meaningful seriously hampers his ability to entertain.",Collateral
221,dcobbimdb,Wow was I impressed! Nice action thriller,10,15 December 2004,"I read no reviews and only knew the basic premise of this movie before watching it. But I have to tell you this thing rocked! The more I watched the more I was glued to my seat. I missed it in the theaters and rented it the first night it came out. And I was blown away 10 out of 10 for me, and I rarely give movies a 10.I like Action thrillers anyway, so this was right up my ally. It was directed by the same guy who made Heat, another one I loved, though this movie more reminded me of Training day, in terms of the dark flow of the movie, as well as other elements. It started a bit slower with some character development, kind of easing you into things, then once things start rocking, they just get better and better heading towards a huge climax. Very good flow / pacing, good dialog, acting and character development as well. Very impressive movie overall! Cruise is awesome in his role as the stone cold killer with a list of people to whack. Foxx plays the cab driving underachiever with big dreams but lacks the conviction to make them happen. Both did an excellent job. Jada & Mark play supporting roles and give a good performance as well. The script, dialog, situations and acting are top notch. The action scenes seem very realistic, no special effects needed in this movie as the realism of the situation was effect enough. The story, is simple (a little Hollywood-ish) but good and is brought to life by the acting, the script, and of course the directing I'd definitely watch this movie again and would recommend it to anyone who likes action, suspense, drama, thriller movies. It's not for the faint of heart though as its dark heart pounding and involves quite a few murders. Definitely not for young children",Collateral

You travel night as If we were company! Tom Cruise: your last big role. Enjoy it, old men. You'll never get so profound into a role in the rest of your career. Jamie Foxx, what can I say? You emotional birch! You do have a talent; I really empathized with your situation. Script: Well, you are finely crafted. There are no wasted lines and the action doesn't repeat itself. As I say, this movie makes you feel very comfortable; making you want to walk at night or to enjoy the full moon in the sleeping city.

223,pswanson00,Good Film--spoilers give away story elements.,9,4 April 2005,"I like this film a lot. It's nice to see a movie which requires thought, while also having great suspense and action. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as the coldly professional slayer who has the gift of great personal charm, which he can turn on as necessary. Jamie Foxx gives a preview of his Oscar-winning form, with a spot-on portrayal of a conscientious ordinary guy who is forced to adapt to unimaginable circumstances. He's especially effective when he has to persuade a drug lord that he's a hit man; that's when I knew that his character had opted for survival, no matter what. Collateral is in a class with, but quite different from, The Fugitive. Each is an action film which requires thought, and each one will provide great entertainment to viewers who like such films.",Collateral
224,adrongardner,"Masterpiece? No, but very good.",8,27 December 2005,"Collateral works much like Mann's ""Heat"" but on a much smaller scale, which is both bad and good as ""Heat"" sometimes sprawled a bit too wide for its own good at times. The story of a taxi driver held hostage for a hit-man to do a nightly shift of killing is very inventive and Mann's stylistics make good use of the LA locale.Like ""Heat,"" Collateral works like an episode of Miami Vice with lots of cops and robbers and pastel neon lights. Ambiance is the key here with acting that works for sure. The heavy use of DV has both its ups and downs. The digital texture works when there is enough light on the subject and good white balance correction like the Jazz club hit and the Asian dance club toward the end. Some of the night scenes DO NOT work with an abundance of ISO noise and pixelation. The interlacing of video is obvious and very distracting in one scene in particular, when Cruise trips on the chair in the Law high rise.The pace of the film works for the most part with a few small dry spots. In the end, I thin Collateral works very very well on the typical Michael Mann levels of entertainment. And though I completely disagree calling this film a Masterpiece, as some have suggested, I think Collateral is a very well made and entertaining character drama that in the end lacks a larger dramatic weight felt from Mann's earlier works.",Collateral
225,FilmSnobby,"Slick, empty -- much like the lead actor.",3,8 August 2004,"I knew *Collateral* wouldn't really be good, but I was a big fan of Michael Mann's *Heat*, one of the great crime films of the Nineties. I admit to a sort of fondness for Mann's portentous, slick style, even though such fondness is really against my better critical judgment. *Collateral* does have the typically operatic moments we associate with Mann's work: the slow sweep of the police copters over the throbbing neon of downtown L.A.; the sleazy decadence of your average industrial-beat-thumping nightclub; the macho professionalism of the cops and their drug-lord antagonists (even though the latter resort to telling threatening stories about Mexican Santa Clauses who leave little toy burros on the windowsills of naughty Mexican kids [don't ask -- it ain't worth it]). . . . Occasionally, the picture has that Mann shimmer to it, especially at the end, when a cobalt-blue dawn illuminates an industrial landscape of power-lines and train-tracks.Unfortunately, the movie also has Tom Cruise, with a shimmer of his own: a bad dye-job on his hair. Short and spiky, it looks as if it was dipped in melted chrome and dusted over with blue kohl. They even colored his adolescent beard and bushy eyebrows the same color. What gives? Was this some attempt to give Cruise ""gravitas""? Meanwhile, we're still looking at the 5' 4"" frame and listening to the pre-adam's apple dipthongs. And he's wearing a silver-gray suit that MATCHES the hair. Oh Lord. (And the advertisement atop Jamie Foxx's cab touts ""Bacardi Silver"". Hey, all this color-symbolism stuff is downright Kubrickian! Right?) The point is, we NEVER buy for ONE SECOND that Tom Cruise is a ruthless contract killer . . . or some of us don't, at least. Otherwise respectable film critics are giving Cruise high marks for believability, but please recall that the newspapers for which they work ADVERTISE these films, and dissing Cruise or his movies would definitely characterize a critic as a ""non-team player"".To make matters worse, the script provides Cruise with all kinds of Oscar-bait. In several windy monologues, the hit-man wheedles on about the existentialism of suburban L.A., the merits of Charlie Mingus, the death ratio per-hour from the Rwanda genocide -- you name it. As a member of the paying movie-going public, I don't need to hear my hit-men lecturing me about Rwanda, thanks. Meanwhile, Foxx's response to all this is a sort of what-the-hell're-you-Talking'-about scrunched-up expression, amplified with several ""whatever, man""'s. My sentiments exactly.Let it be said that Foxx out-acts the Big Shot all over the place. We forget that the cabdriver is Jamie Foxx, even as we're constantly reminded that the hit-man is Indisputably Tom Cruise. But the script lets Foxx down, as well, during the scene in which he's chattering his teeth at an evil drug-cartel overlord. One minute he's terrified . . . the next, he's threatening to go all postal on the gun-toting goon standing behind him. Didn't buy it, sorry. I also didn't buy the old low-battery-cell-phone shtik. Quick, call the Cliché Police before that battery runs out!Best scene in the flick is the convergence of hit-man, cabdriver, police, and Asian drug lords at a thumping night-club. Real suspense here, along with realistic gun-play, even though it further cements the Cruise character as a sort of Terminator with a you-can't-touch-this force-field around him. (Maybe it's the silver glow.) The whole scene sort of reminded me of Chaplin's *Modern Times*, that part in which the Tramp's attempt to serve a customer roast duck across a crowded dance-floor becomes an Epic Quest.But Mann has already lost us before that, when he resorts to pulling out the old coyotes-roaming-Pico-Boulevard card. Ah well -- brainless summer fun. Enjoy. 3- or 4-stars out of 10.",Collateral
226,mbrcf,great until the last third,5,29 August 2021,"Once in a while, one of the super-famous actors decide to do something entirely different from what they've been doing for years/decades and in Collateral, we have non other than Tom Cruise, who having been having a quiet heavy roster of action films (especially the Mission Impossible series) is peculiarly dissimilar to what he's done thus far. We, as viewers, see him as a stone cold contract killer named Vincent, wearing a Cary Grant North-by-Northwest suit, dyeing silver-grey hair and even growing a makeshift beard, all in all in a rather unique appearance, riding on a night taxi drove by Max (played by Jamie Foxx) and completing kills for contracts.Max on the other hand, is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job (no offence to cab drivers of course) and is trapped by Vincent being at the wrong place at the wrong time. This relationship between Vincent and Max is the backbone and the essence of this film. Max is pushing himself ouf of his known boundaries in such pushing times and Vincent is shooting Harry-Lime-ian lines left and right to Max in order to justify himself and to tame Max into his will.However, as we go through the last third of the film, things start to volume themselves up a considerable amount and as they do, Vincent starts vanishing and Tom Cruise shows himself more regularly along with the noise and action and Max is no longer an ordinary human being in a wrong place/time, he is a beloved American hero, seeking to prevail against all odds to save lives and teach the bad guys a lesson or two.The film is very engaging and gripping watch up until the last 30 minutes or so, but when the things get out of track, they go rather miserably.",Collateral
227,rcolgan,"""Take Comfort In Knowing You Never Had a Choice""",9,5 August 2015,"You're driving a car. There's a man sitting behind you. He intends to kill 5 people and wants you to drive him to them. What do you do? This concept is the focus of Collateral, putting a normal man in to an impossible situation and following his desperation as he tries to do whatever he can to make it through the night.Whilst this is the film's story, it begins as a movie with a far different tone. To begin with we follow cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) as he carries out his normal night of fares. He picks up a woman named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and they flirt and talk as he drives her on the journey. He talks of his dreams of making his own Limo company and she talks of her stressed life as a Lawyer. It ends with her thanking him and passing a number. This scene is great partly because it works so well on its own, almost like a separate short film. It's a romance that does not feel phoned in at all, but instead develops some genuine chemistry between the pair. More importantly, it's an essential scene in showing us the kind of man Max is in his normal life. He's just a regular guy, who may dream of his limo business but has never had the nerve to act. It's important we see this so we can understand the normal person he is before his life is very suddenly thrown into disarray. This happens when a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) pays Max $600 to drive him for the night and get him to the airport as he hates life in the city and wants to leave as soon as possible. However Max discovers that his passenger is a hit- man and is taken hostage to drive Vincent to 5 targets he needs to kills that night. After this we watch as Max reluctantly drives him wherever he's told, trying to get away from at every possible turn and reduce the death toll in Vincent's path. By all rights the plot is something that you would expect from a typical action movie. But the film is able to elevate it far above the standard action movie formula through the very realistic approach it uses to tackle the story. This is done by constantly grounding the story through Max. He's nothing like your usual John McClane action hero who spouts out one liners and makes light of the situation, but instead a very uncertain and terrorised victim. His attempts to get away from Vincent are often badly thought out and he reacts to murder just as any ordinary person would. Foxx's down to earth performance is definitely the anchor of the film as it ensures that the focus is not on the action, but rather a tense conversation between a sociopathic killer and a man in fear of his life and the lives of those around him. When it comes to who you might picture in the role of a murderer, it's unlikely that Cruise would be the first person to come to mind. However Cruise also does a great job at playing outside his usual roles. Instead of being the cocky likable hero, he's a very detached man who's able to blend into crowds and drift in and out without turning a single head. He's utterly ruthless with no regard for human life and will do anything he needs to get the job done. He doesn't even feel guilt for any of his actions and looks down on others like Max who do feeling it as redundant to feel empathy for people he never even knew. He even disdains the typical life of people in a city like Los Angeles, where people seem to just drift through their lives and never take any real risk in their lives. This story could have all too easily been a run of the mill action movie. But fortunately through both Mann's great direction, a screenplay that knows to put the focus on character over action and great casting, it becomes a truly great thriller.",Collateral
228,marbleann,Jada Picketts Smith character put the kibosh to the movie,6,9 February 2005,"This was a pretty good flick. A typical action Michael Mann movie. I find his movies are very stylish. I never have been a Tom Cruise fan. But being wooden and robotic is what was needed to portray a hope to die cold blooded killer. And wooden and robotic is what he is. I was happy that Jamie Foxx was not portraying some type of comic sidekick which I see in far too many movies where there is a black co star to a superstar white star. Mind you Cruise is not really a good hit-man, look the guy doesn't even have transportation planned ahead of time. And apparently he has done this type of Taxi for Hire Gun for Hire thing the year before because a cop mentions that similar killings happened the year before. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie when we meet Jada Pickett you get the idea she will be a target. She disappears after she gets out of the cab so we know she will return considering she is a US Prosecutor. And there lies my one complaint about This flick. Jada Pickett Smith's character. This is suppose to be a Federal Prosecutor in LA Her first scene in the movie is almost a carbon copy of Holly Hunters Taxi cab scene in Broadcast news.. A woman in control. She is prosecuting serious cases. So when she is working in her office in the middle of the night and someone calls her up, a person who in a short time she seemed to like and YELLS to her that she is going to get killed and get the heck out of the building. All she can say is What are you talking about? And keeps on playing dumb. Until Tom Cruise who was nowhere near here practically gets close enough to kiss her. I am sure any hard boiled prosecutor would of not have been in that office by themselves and they sure would of hauled a** if they get call like that. You see she has to be stupid because if she did get her behind out of there like she was told I guess we would never been treated to the exciting ending. Also I didn't understand why the Peter Berg character was a jerk. I wish the writers would of been more imaginative and not of made a Federal Prosecutor a blithering idiot. Plus I am sure after the cops are seeing all of the people who are attached to this case are getting knocked off they would of gotten in contact with her already and made sure she was in protective custody! I feel it would of been more believable if Jada Pickett's Smith character was in transit and no one knew how to get in contact with her and Tom Cruises character grabbed her then. This movie is not as good as Heat But it is very entertaining. Jamie Foxx has more screen time then Cruise so he really is not a supporting player. Kind of like Denzel Washington having more screen time in Philadelphia But Tom Hanks was considered the lead. .",Collateral

This is the first movie in which Jamie Foxx can actually be considered a great actor and the point at which he turned his career around entirely. And as we all know, Tom Cruise can act pretty well also. But it's not the single performances that make their acting so incredible. It is the on-screen chemistry that they share in their conversations. Vincent is such a complicated character that Max repeatedly tries to get to the core of. Their relationship is so complicated throughout the movie, you start to wonder ""What is Max thinking?"" Each conversation was written so beautifully that it made want to cry in joy.The action in the movie was incredible. It starts off extremely slow, but turns fast paced all at once somewhere near the middle of the movie. A scene in which Vincent takes Max to a bar and they talk about jazz with the owner and Vincent suddenly kills him at the end of the conversation was incredibly well done. The realistic but vicious assassinations as well as a great gunfight scene at a club make Collateral a modern action classic. Overall, Michael Mann did a wonderful job with this film and it is highly enjoyable.

230,jackjack-2,Jamie Foxx only redeeming feature,4,24 February 2005,"The only redeeming feature in this movie is the superb performance of Jamie Foxx. It is the only reason to watch it. Otherwise, it should never have been released. The plot is bizarre and it gets more bizarre as it goes along. It is a predictable plot. Boy meets girl. Boy also meets killer. Boy will survive and meet girl again. The suspense is how will he wind up with the girl and the path the story takes is contrived and unreal. As the movie goes on it makes less sense and less sense.Foxx is nominated as the Best Supporting Actor in this flick but he should have been nominated for the Best Actor for in reality Tom Cruise, who supposedly is the principal actor, supports Foxx. Cruise plays his usual self, a tough cocky guy and as usual he doesn't do a good job. There was always a sort of Tom Cruise in every high school and no one ever liked him. But Cruise is rather small and he is not always convincing as a tough guy and he wasn't convincing in this movie either.For viewers who live in Los Angeles, there were often very familiar scenes although sometimes a viewer familiar with the turf would wonder how the characters got there. There is one scene where they are driving by the Beverly Hills Hotel at night and a coyote walks across the street in front of them. Why they were at that location made no sense, what the coyote had to do with the picture was not clear, and the coyote walked across the street, which coyotes don't do. They run, not walk, when vehicles approach.",Collateral
231,mattrochman,A loner's voyage,8,31 December 2007,"Michael Mann has a fascination with lonely men that is somewhat intriguing. Heat similarly cast the two main characters as loners, one who is as ruthless as he is self-justifying, and the other simply views his current life as vehicle to a utopia.Cruise is often underrated as an actor, but I believe he has a good deal of versatility and genuine acting talent. In this film, he delivers an unusually strong performance as the ruthless hit-man ""Vincent."" Some of the execution he carries out are filmed with enthralling dazzle (especially the nightclub scene and the jazz singer).Jamie Foxx did a fantastic job playing the role of the innocent loner Max and the dialog between him and Vincent was terrific and well acted.A few weak points let the film down though. First of all, the final 20 minutes of the film was extremely unimaginative and predictable. From the identity of the final target to the final grand ""showdown"" it seemed far fetched and reminiscent of silly Hollywood endings we expect from films with a no-name cast and director. Second, the police side of the story was not terribly interesting and a little over-performed.

Not like spoilers or anything, but I tend to know the premise, most of the cast, director etc. So it was kind of nice to just watch a film solely on a recommendation knowing very little about it, and to come out loving it. Tom Cruise plays against type brilliantly here, but it is Jamie Foxx who carries this film. He very much acts as the audience being introduced to this world, and he pulls off the more tense moments perfectly. The visual style is so striking and great to look at, and the action is shot really smoothly. The score is great and the character relationships were surprisingly strong. The fact that this is really just a character piece about Max not grabbing his chances in life makes this more fun to watch, mainly because I found myself really caring for Max's character and wanting him to escape the situation. The ending was really satisfying - I enjoy it when films end on an open-ended note, allowing the audience to fill in what might have happened to the characters. The only major issues is that some of the characters are a bit stupid - the cops had numerous chances to catch Vincent and just didn't for whatever reason. There were also a couple of predictable moments, but overall this is a fantastic film, and one I really, really enjoyed on top of that. Definitely give it a watch.",Collateral

The heart of this film is Jamie Foxx, displaying acting skills far in excess of what I would have credited him with; I'm now even more interested to see his portrayal of Ray Charles.  Tom Cruise is also playing against type, as a nihilistic assassin.  Cruise is also good, although the role offers him little to do other than act like a villainous badass.  Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, and an unrecognizable Mark Ruffalo are all fine in supporting roles.  The movie is clearly Foxx's, however, as the audience identifies primarily with his terrified taxi driver.

A clear example of amazing and realistic action with the help of Mann's fabulous direction, the action scenes are tense and realistic demonstrating great quality and time set to carry them out. Both Cruise and Foxx are exceptional in their roles, however I have to point out that as a villain, Cruise does a fantastic job becoming a very iconic and recognizable character.Collateral is an excellent action movie with a stellar cast and a fantastic direction full of small symbolic messages and realistic action, impossible not to recommend to action lovers.",Collateral

242,Adorable,Great Ride Any Time of Day,8,4 November 2004,"Unique should be the operative concept when describing this movie, although superficially there's very little ambitious about it. An assassin hired by vague mob moguls gets in an LA taxi driven by one of tinseltown's savviest, most well-informed cabbies. The two soon bond overnight, despite the former's penchant for whacking total strangers and the latter's desperate desire to see the sun again. Sounds trite, but you'd be badly mistaken should you opt to refrain from seeing Michael Mann's latest, a project steeped in quality and cachet, if not originality. Its uniqueness stems from a seamless flow of storytelling prowess, unhindered by obstructions that would have easily toppled less intensely-conceived products.First of all, both main actors provide solid appearances. Cruise's obsessively-driven hit-man garners viewer sympathy by being honest, courteous, and downright Terminator-esque professional. His reluctant chauffeur for the night, Max, witnesses Jamie Foxx in his first non-irritating screen part, and allows the actor space to develop. Instead of his pro-forma comical buffoonery, Foxx deploys some serious skill while portraying a genuinely decent person stuck behind the wheel of a Crown Vic while dreaming of another life.Brought together by sheer chance, Vincent the killer and Max traverse Los Angeles in a great homage to the city of angels, paying tribute to its streets and uneasy nights. From assignment to assignment, they get to know each other through hardship and camaraderie, even though Max does, on occasion, err by trying to escape. You can't help but wish he'd stay in the car already and just drive Cruise to wherever death needs to be dealt, for Vincent's smooth demeanor certainly wins him top flight recognition. His acumen can't be argued with, most vividly depicted via frequently dispatching various nocturnal types, from drug dealers through hoodlums, to venerable jazz musicians. Collateral doesn't pull too many punches, incorporating a sizeable number of well-orchestrated bullet festivities and dialogues colorful enough to be believable.All along, we get treated to convincing conversations, a superb soundtrack, and an oddly 70's feel emanating from the film's cool, almost impersonal treatment of an otherwise very human predicament. Several side-plots arrive for good measure, namely a police task force homing in on the aberrant taxi, spearheaded by Detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo), and an ultimately disappointing love interest for Max, done by impressive Jada Pinkett-Smith (who was great in the last two Matrix pictures). While ending-wise Collateral may leave more than a bit to desire, pretty much everything else comes together nicely, doing good justice to a simple but memorable tale in a modestly qualified manner not often seen around hedonistic Hollywood.

244,Harry_Gleeson,Classic Neo-Noir!,8,18 January 2021,"Overall, Collateral is a brilliant Neo-Noir film. Director Michael Mann clearly shows his talents within this genre, as he has with other films, Heat being the main one. I thought the script was well written and that was in turn brought to life with great performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx is one of my favourite actors, you can always expect a great performance pretty much in anything he's in. Same for Cruise. I thought the film dragged in parts, that prevents it from being perfect, but as the title suggests, this a classic Neo-Noir film that everyone should see. Go treat yourself!Quote - ""Since when was any of this negotiable?"" - Vincent and MaxRating - 4/5",Collateral
245,paul sloan,Hot Night In The City,8,7 March 2005,"This movie is just a great roller coaster ride where we go along with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx . Superbly directed by Michael Mann, this is quite a dark tale of one night in the life of cab driver, Foxx, and his very unusual fare, Mr Cruise. The tone of the plot is dark and it does get complicated, especially when the cops become involved but the movie rattles along at great pace. It is nice to see a movie of this type with a big budget and see talented people doing their thing.The plot does have loads of holes in it and Jamie Foxx's glasses do seem silly and pointless but Collateral is none the less for these minor points. Also, in a movie world of sequels and retreads, it is great to come across an original idea that is both well made and entertaining. Recommended .",Collateral
246,pri_e,good but not great,6,18 November 2004,"possible spoilers...I was looking forward to seeing this movie based on the reviews I had heard about it but also from the trailer. However upon watching it I have to say its a good movie but the not the best Tom Cruise movie I've seen. Cruise plays Vincent, a professional killer who picks Max (Jamie Foxx) to drive him to each of his targets unwillingly. Its an interesting storyline to say the least which ties up neatly in the end however I found that it just didn't do what Cruise's ""Minority Report"" did in terms of mystery. I felt sorry for Mark Ruffalo who had a useless role as an undercover cop who is trying to figure out the deal with Vincent himself, his character didn't develop enough and was taken away pretty fast. Jada Pinkett-Smith did a good job in the movie, its good to see her stray away from the tough female roles that she usually plays. I thought it was wrong to shoot this movie using digital camera-work because it looked really bad and made the camera work look really amateur.I gave this movie a 6/10, again its good but not great.",Collateral
247,stevetseitz,"Oozing coolness, Mann maintains focus mostly",7,10 August 2004,"This movie has coolness dripping off it. It is well shot, expertly edited and the performances are good. The film starts slowly introducing only the characters it needs. The movie has very little fat from a narrative point of view. ""Collateral""  builds to a better climax than Mann's earlier L.A. Story ""Heat"". The tension level is established early but the stakes continue to rise. In another director's hands it would quickly become preposterous, but a stable and focused approach keeps the suspension of disbelief at acceptable levels. I think many scenes were shot on HD video. Foxx shows a good range and doesn't overplay his part. Cruise is, well Cruise. It's nice to see him play the bad guy. But he isn't strictly a traditional heavy. In the movie he is a sort of anti-villain, seemingly a devil/angel on the shoulder of Foxx. Similar to DeNiro in ""Heat""You don't really root against him except when it comes to the main conflict between he and the protagonist, Foxx. One of the main characters of this film is Los Angeles, and Mann doesn't skimp on the cheesecloth while showing the city. He must truly love the city of Los Angeles, because through his lens it looks loads better than it really does. I can understand his love of roads, freeways, and the mechanical and stark look of a city at night because I share it.
A modern city is a wonder of the world. It is a testament to the combined wills of millions of people. The way it looks and lives tells us much about it's residents. I think the director and writer capture this important element in ""Collateral"".",Collateral
248,polysicsarebest,Damaged,1,15 August 2004,"The most overrated film of 2004. Yeah, it's oozing with style and potential and is usually pretty interesting... but I hear people saying it's ""genius"". Eh?!...*Spoilers.*The attorney that the cab driver meets right before he meets the bad guy just HAPPENS to be the final target of the bad guy? In a town with about 18 million people? The cop and the bad guy and the taxi driver just HAPPEN to be in the same hospital elevator at the exact same time? The attorney keeps saying, ""What are you saying Max? What? What are you saying?"" to Max when he calls her and warns her she's about to be killed... instead of immediately hauling out of there -- a crappy dramatic scene. After Max shoots Vincent in the office building, why didn't he shoot him again to make sure he was dead? That way, they wouldn't have to run from them. Why doesn't Vincent seem surprised that Max showed up in the office building? Vincent had no idea Max knew her, so you think he would've been shocked to see him. Then, the stupid part with the dead body ""I didn't shoot him, he fell."" Then, the part with the coyote. Just too many horrible scenes. This movie gets a zero out of 10.",Collateral

250,blairgallop7,Collateral= Top notch drama-thriller at it's best,10,23 December 2007,"Collateral is another one of my personal favorites.Directed by Michael Mann,this film would be one of the two best Michael Mann's film alongside Heat. The film stars Tom Cruise in a rare villainous role as a sociopathic hit-man by the name of Vincent who is hired for five hits in a single night to take down witnesses in a case against Felix Reyes-Torrena(Academy Award nominee Javier Bardem) and Jamie Foxx who plays Max Durocher who is a cab driver who accidentally gets caught up in Vincent's path whilst driving him around Los Angeles.This film co-stars Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie Farrell,a prosecutor in the aforementioned case and one of Vincent's target and Mark Ruffalo as Detective Ray Fanning who discovers the string of murders and finds out more clues as to what is happening in the night.This film was also nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actor-Jamie Foxx and Best Film Editing.But I was surprised that Tom Cruise wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award as this was his best role to date and that Jamie Foxx wasn't considered the lead actor as he had more dialogue but Tom Cruise had more actions.Either way,this film will go down as one of my personal favorites.Bravo!",Collateral

This movie was fun, had fascinating side stories. A good time!",Collateral
253,Det_McNulty,"""Collateral"" Is A Human Thriller, A Cold-Toned Noir and A Moralistic Character Study All Rolled Into One",8,23 April 2007,"Director Michael Mann has many trademarks, most notably his use of colours, particularly blue. He also has a knack for making ""bad guys"" deal with their own personal anguish; hypothetically speaking when this is rolled together with the previously mentioned trademark Mann creates a vividly calming and transfixing image of a character's personal struggle. This is just proof that Michael Mann is one of the most innovative directors working in modern American cinema.Max (played by Jamie Foxx) is a somewhat melancholy L.A. cab driver, a kind-hearted man who just wants to make some money and be able to offer his customers a smooth cabbie service. One night he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) who at first strikes the viewer as a mysterious businessman. Yet it quickly becomes apparent that he is actually a professional contract-killer. Max becomes the forced driver for Vincent and Vincent's psychopathic tendencies become more evident and cold-hearted as the film moves on.The film holds some of the finest cinematography modern cinema has to offer, it is so vibrant and vigorous in style that it is impossible to keep you eyes off the screen. The beauty of it is how entrancing it is, blending both illusive misconceptions and realistic character-driven drama. The film is strongly presented by its bold ""digital camera"" affect, creating a believable atmosphere and emphasising the feeling of a drawn-out night. It is also apparent that the film has shades of noir etched onto the surface, creating a convincing vision of the viewer becoming a passenger in the cab. Collateral captures lighting perfectly, ranging from illuminating car headlights to the wide-stretching street lamps. There is such a fantastic amount of range to the camera work, which differentiates between close-contact shots, which focus on the emotions of the characters to overhead shots scraping the sprawling L.A. night. The editing is another strong area of the film. It is extremely slick and cut with razor-sharp elegance, plus the edition of some wonderfully fitting music. There is something very natural about the technical side of Collateral, reinforcing Mann's ""auteur"" ability and perceptive vision of Hollywood's crime genre.The acting is dealt with a great enthusiasm and it is a shame the actors are working with what is a generally uneven script. Yet actors Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise overcome the obstacle by delving inside their characters and both being cast as characters which are unusual to some of their other career choices. Both prove to have strong versatility, dealing with their characters emotions and personality with a simplistic ease and helping to move the film along at a respectable pace. Both actors add a consistent amount of dimension to their roles, helping the film to become a character-study and letting the viewer perceive their own view of the events taking place.When revisiting Collateral I find it truly terrifying to how fast technology is moving in today's world. This may sound strange, but a lot of the technology in Collateral has already advanced leaps and bounds in the case of a few years. It is scary just how quickly our world is moving and how technology is a key part in most of our lives. Ironically, there is a scene in the film whereby Vincent expresses his formality on how short a person's life is. So is this an intentional example of subtext in the film, attempting conveying the speed in which the world goes by? It is questionable when you take into context how Collateral is a film which runs at an exceedingly fast pace due to its consistent level of thrills and capturing how fast time goes under stress. It is a shame that there are some flaws in the narrative, script and acting (from the extra cast members) because they sadly stop the film from gaining a true ""masterpiece"" status.Collateral is Michael Mann on top-form, it is the different ""cop vs. killer"" story, one which goes against the expected formulaic pattern and so succeeds in creating what is a meticulous tour de force in modern film-making. Collateral is a film not to be missed and certainly comes close to being mentioned alongside some of Mann's superlative achievements.",Collateral
254,ryanpersaud-59415,"Solid Action Thriller, set in Grimy LA",7,13 June 2021,"The Good: Cruise, up until this point, was a leading man and all American hero and this film represents him at his coolest (before the wacky Scientology stuff). He's a legitimately good villain: menacing, unstoppable and very fun to watch. Fox is also really good, being the emotional heart of this film, and a guy who's pretty hard not to like. We've all been this guy.Also, I really like how Los Angeles actually feels like a real city, with actual people living there. For a city where seemingly every other Hollywood movie is set, we rarely actually get a sense of LA as anything other than ""neutraland USA.""The Bad : The movie does get a bit cheesy and over sentimental.

255,Sfpsycho415,One of the best movies this year---9/10,9,15 September 2004,"Collateral is one of the best films of 2004. Now i admit, i haven't seen too many this year. But there just wasn't much to see. Collateral is a movie i have been looking forward to for some time because it goes back to the days where a movie can take place in the current times and not feature CGI armies clashing while orchestra music plays. It is about characters, plot twists, and atmosphere. These are the elements that suck you into a movie. And Michael Mann know it. Not to mention he has a great cast to work with. In probably his best work to date, Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man with an itinerary that must be cleared before dawn. I always knew Cruise was a good actor, apparent in movies like Top Gun, Minority Report, and A Few Good Men (in which he was especially good). But i never knew he could pull of an outstanding performance, and yet he does just that in Collateral. Who knew he just had to try being a bad guy for once? He did receive a little help from Jaime Foxx, who plays cab driver Max, Vincent's unwilling hostage. Foxx's equally impressive performance plays off of Cruise's and vice versa. I knew Jaime Foxx could be a great actor when i saw him in Ali, also by Michael Mann.The script is full of great dialogue, (""Don't do anything stupid. You don't have the trunk space"") and plenty of tense situations that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The shootout in the disco, the mugging of Max while tied to the steering wheel, and max trying to pass as a hit-man himself are all classic scenes that i can watch over and over. This is a slickly directed, superbly acted, and nail-bitingly suspenseful film. It's one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. And it's got a Tom Cruise violently killing people.

256,RMS1949,Excellent Film with a ridiculous ending,8,7 April 2020,Loved 99% of the film... One of Tom Cruise's best performance ever. It had a such an intense tight feel throughout and was directed and filmed with great care.. My only complaint and it's a big one was that ridiculous ending. To think that a cabbie who could barely hold the gun would somehow win a shootout barely ten feet away from a professional hitman was pure nonsense. Not to mention it destroyed any chance of Tom recurring that role for future films. It was great for that first watch but knowing the ending I've never watched it a second time.,Collateral

What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers. It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use.

259,whoTheFuqRyou,"5 stops, 5 stars",10,6 August 2004,"Once again, Michael Mann proves what a genius he is with his latest effort 'Collateral' starring Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett-Smith and a cameo from Jason Statham.  The film starts with a slick intro as to what's going on without giving anything away w/ introductions to the three main characters.  Tom Cruise is the anti-hero of the movie, Vincent, a smooth criminal whose line of work requires a straight-to-the-point attitude as well as a 'whatever' type attitude.  Tom Cruise brings the traits neccessary to Vincent - cold and calculating - even his VICTIMS shape out what Vince is all about. Jada Pinkett-Smith, with the little screen time she has, is a pivotal character in the film.  It would seem like she wasn't really drawn out much but as the story goes on, you see that she plays a big part for a role so small.  Jamie Foxx, as Max, damn near almost steals the show from Tom Cruise as an unassuming taxi driver.  The situation he's put in thanks to Vincent is like a blessing in disguise type - Even though he is an accidental accomplice, while he is with Vincent - he learns things about himself he never thought was in him [sp]such as the scene when Vincent insists that Max goes to visit his mother[/sp]....reading some of the comments, I see that some people were able to guess the ending but I honestly didn't try to guess as the movie itself was really unpredictable in between the five stops...though these tow characters are morally conflicted, there is a big connection.  The rest of the supporting cast do their respective jobs but it's the two who were supposed to shine the brightest who really stand out - I remember when Jamie Foxx used to be on in Living Color, and after many years, we get to see how talented he truly is even though I knew he was a good singer as well.  he's truly come a long way to land a role with someone as established as Tom Cruise...Collateral is not to be missed at all10/10",Collateral
260,lovintennis,Good movie except for one small thing,6,3 October 2017,"I would've rated this one a 7 if it hadn't been for the beginning when Max is driving the woman. They argue over which route's the fastest way and he persuades her to trust him. When they get close, she goes, ""Go ahead, say it."" He asks, ""Say what?"" She answers, ""That you were right."" He shouldn't ask that because it's a stupid question, because it's playing dumb. We all know what she means. Later, whether this is realistic or not is debatable: I'm just saying there's no point in the cops ordering Max with Vincent back to the garage immediately as they race off to the emergency call they receive because of COURSE he's not going to follow that order. The climax is stupid because it's too typical that the cell phone dies, and what Joe Schmoe is talking on the street corner in the middle of the night with a low battery? And just because the battery's low doesn't mean the line would break up as it doesn't have anything to do with reception. After Max shoots Vincent in the office, he quickly just grabs the girl and runs away to get away from him instead of sticking around to put him into submission and turn him in. Had he logically done so, the pursuit through the subway would've never happened.",Collateral

262,lopcar1993,One of the best crime thriller's ever,10,24 October 2009,"Action films I'm always hesitant to see due to the fact that they can't balance out the story and the big sweeping action sequences in it.(Transformers and it's sequel comes to mind.) But now I've finally found another film, besides Die Hard, that perfectly balances story, action, and character development to the point of absolute perfection.I first heard of Collateral when it was recommended to me by a friend, seeing as none of my friends have good taste in films I wanted to pass it up. Well I'm now happy to say I'm glad I didn't. It was everything that action films today should be: taunt, suspenseful, extraordinarily smart, well thought out. Need I continue? Michael Mann(Who is the man! no pun intended. ) Crafts an ingenious little machine that creeps along at first very slow and then kicks it into full gear to blow your minds out in the end. It's bold and refreshing and is something amazing to watch unfold on screen as the cat and dog fight between Cruise and Foxx heats up. But none the less this is a brilliant film that is an amazing visual treat for the eyes and the senses.Tom Cruise(who gives another staggering and mind blowing performance.) plays a hit man like you've never seen before, he plays one with a conscience it is something truly amazing and breath taking to watch the way his character works on screen the ruthless way he kills without a seconds hesitation and then out of nowhere show's emotion for one of his kills, it's amazing and something to admire. Jamie Foxx(Who also delivers a fantastic performance here.) plays the cabby who has to drive around Cruise's character while he systematically whacks people. Foxx's performance is crucial and is in many ways, a contrast to Cruise's character and the way they almost become friends in a weird way is another fascinating thing to watch play out on screen. But all in all the two main leads and the rest of the cast hold up sturdy and strong in this brilliant film.Collateral is very complex in the way it portrays the relationship of the two main character's is played out so beautifully. The whole film is beautiful it's an amazing and monumental achievement in film making and is one of Cruise's and Foxx's best films to date. It's great fun to watch and see unfold in front of you and is shocking and heart breaking at the same time. All in all this is one hit you want to be in on.",Collateral
263,Mr_PCM,Cruise control is outfoxxed!,8,28 June 2005,"It is hard to lavish enough praise on the acting on display here from the two main protagonists. Jamie Foxx shows signs of the charisma and ability that made him a cert for the best actor Oscar for Ray. Meanwhile Tom Cruise is a sheer revelation as the psychotic but professional hit-man Vincent.Cabbie Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) expecting just another job. When Vincent offers to double his nightly earnings if he drives him all night he accepts, until Vincent's mission is revealed. What follows is a night of hell for Max, reluctantly driving Vincent from hit to hit, all the while trying to stay alive and do the right thing, two goals which may ultimately be unachievable together. What is most fascinating about Cruise's character though is the sheer indifference he shows towards his victims. He does not hate them, he doesn't even know them, he has just been assigned to kill them and does so with absolutely no remorse. When a body crashes on to his cab, followed by Vincent's re-appearance, Max is shocked by the answer to his accusatory 'you killed him!"" - No, I shot him, the bullets and the fall killed him."" This matter-of-fact approach is indicative of Vincent's professionalism, and adds a really chilling level of apathy to the character.It is certainly refreshing to see Cruise in such a different role, and it is one which he really gets his teeth into, producing a sociopath contract killer, seemingly with no remorse and no redeeming qualities. He pulls it off with a genuinely sinister edge on the character, and the final half hour is particularly impressive from an acting point of view.Jamie Foxx however is certainly by no means acted off the screen. His likable cabbie with relaxed attitude to life (well, until he meets Cruise) shows many of the qualities he used to really bring Ray Charles to life later.The action too is well staged by Michael Mann, in probably his best work since Heat. It is easy to track the action through the relatively simple plot, and the set piece scenes are competently done without being spectacular. A very good above average thriller, but most notable for Cruise's revelation of another string to his acting bow. A superbly acted film.",Collateral

Great action movies seem hard to come by nowadays, with too many directors cutting all the realism to achieve PG-13 ratings. Well, just get one thing straight. This is not done in Collateral. The result? A magnificent, exciting action classic. Michael Mann, the genius behind ""Ali"" and ""Heat"" is in the directors chair for this one, again showing his fabulous gift for action sequences, violence and believable dialogue, making Collateral all the more superb. When the violence comes, it's almost perfect; not too grotesque, yet still gritty. And the action sequences- well, there something else. The shootout scene in the club is easily one of the greatest in years. And what else makes Collateral the movie it is? Well, you could say the acting. Jamie Foxx is excellent; remaining calm and believable throughout, yet leaving a haunting feeling with him as his dilemma unfolds. And Tom Cruise, the nasty assassin, as cool as can be, always there to provide the audience with witty one-liners. All in all, this is one of the greatest action movies in the decade; worth a shot, anyway. Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)",Collateral
265,petit76,climatic thriller,10,12 September 2009,"Dirty, sun baked, sprawled, crowded... LA generally has its soul borne to us in sunsets and palm trees, highways and high-rises. Michael Mann and his creative eye for detail and engrossing storytelling style showed us a different Los Angeles. One of soft lights that spill from their street lamps, blues that mix with whites and mingle with greens. His veteran hand having wrought films such as HEAT and Ali, Mann delivers a beautifully created film, which compels the audience to not just watch and listen, but to be a part of the film, and to truly challenge the characters brought to life on screen.Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a cold contract killer in LA for a single night of hits. Through an interesting course of events, Max (Jamie Foxx), a timid cab driver who lives on dreams never full realized, gets pulled into the whirlwind of murders as the driver for a hired assassin. The majority of the film is just that, Max and Vincent. Cruise drowns himself in the role, training in weapons handling for months beforehand and plays Vincent as a cobra, a natural killer of lightning reflexes and sudden violence. A contrast to Nathan Algren of The Last Samurai, Cruise plays a morally flexible man of questionable scruples quite well, characterizing a dystopian apathy well. Foxx gives a terrific and serious performance as Max, showing well his growth through the film. Also uncharacteristically heavy, the character of Max was a challenge well met by Foxx. The admiration between the two characters is evident only via the actor's incredible performances and without such subtle and silent respect for each other, the characters (and thus the film), would fail.A modern Film Noir, Collateral starts with a smooth beat and never skips until the final notes. Music choice is excellent, flowing into and out of the smooth and extremely choosy camera work. Without interrupting the scene, the music simply adds to the pressure and tension. The first shots of the film set its tempo; a combination of quick shots of characterization, tearing tiny pieces of meaning from a whole, and large, smooth panning shots in filtered digital, lighting in even blues smoothing all of LA's rough edges, present the film immediately as a piece to be taken in. Los Angeles is presented in all of its sprawling, seedy glory as a ponderous, living, breathing and dangerous American Hell in the most beautiful way in years. Stylized artwork in the film results in beautiful scenes of high contrast, the medium gray of Vincent mixing with the blues, blacks and whites of the background and mis en scene to create compelling visuals. The smart dialogue, written by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean), is short, often witty and has a knife fight nature of quick cuts and ripostes. Mann's camera continues to bring the audience into the movie, slipping us into the cab to nearly intrude on the dialogue between Vincent and Max as they explore each other's limits over a series of threats, philosophical discussion and guidance in a setting so tense it nearly quivers.For most of the movie the audience never sees the action, only the Vincent and Max. Their growth is incredible, Mann coaxing amazing performances from his leading men. Masterful use of the camera, well written dialogue and incredible acting take a movie in which nothing happens, no explosions, no thunderous gunshots, no huge arguments or fanfare, and presents it as perhaps the most compelling and intriguing film in recent years.A macabre relationship develops between Vincent and Max which leads into sibling rivalry, relationship and life advice, moral guidance and general discussion of life which is an area generally left to close friends to breach. Poetic scenes involving an understated fight for motherly affection and a question of morality of the hows and whens to kill lead to an intense relationship that seems to bond the two men. In terminus, the two realize their admiration for the contrasting aspects of the other man and the resultant event is a confrontation, a skillfully manufactured climax. The most compelling aspect of the film is not the content but what that content means. As Max and Vincent explore each other and developed, their conversations pose questions and begin to form inquiries in the minds of the audience. Some answers are the easy ones; others are much harder to come to resolution with. There is no right answer to any of them.Never losing momentum, the film inexorably pushes onward through its motions, the audience running after it attentively. The third act of the film comes after a climactic gunfight and seems almost a let down until once again we are at home with Max and Vincent in the cleanest cab in LA. A series of quick twists deliver a more conventional final piece of the film, hurtling toward a final confrontation. It can not be emphasized how different the final part of the film is from the former pieces, nor how important it is to the film in its entirety. An interesting and intense crime drama, Collateral delivers in a way few films have in many years and will leave you walking away from the theater wondering at the significance of the film.",Collateral

Echoes of the Colin Farrell vehicle Phone Booth, as the victim can't get out of his situation and just has to sweat it out.For it to work, however, you need to squirm with a sense of Foxx's shame, humiliation and awkwardness as the charismatic hit-man takes control. You should get a horrible feeling in your loins, the shame of feeling your maleness under threat, a stab of impotence. The thriller Breakdown with Jeff Bridges did this well.But not here. Cruise just doesn't engender that emotion. He doesn't bring that mystery, it's like watching Leo DiCaprio on one of his prestige projects with Scorsese. You're too aware he's trying to be credible. In fairness, I can't think of the right Hollywood actor for this role. Maybe Richard Gere  he has the grey hair for starters, and his best known role involves buying someone for an entire night (Pretty Woman). This could be the dark side of that character, and Gere's done city alienation in American Gigolo. As it stands, Pierce Brosnan could have put in a better turn than Cruise in this role (not necessarily a cheap jibe  check out Pierce in The Matador, later this year, where he's said to excel as a hit-man).Cruise's character is too garrulous  why is he chatting away to Foxx from the start? No hit-man would do that, unless you're talking Pulp Fiction. It would only work if the hit-man is basically a bit mad, unstable or unpredictable, or sadistically enjoys taunting his captive. But you don't never really sense that.MILD SPOILER: And why does Foxx make a run for it with Cruise's case when they visit his ailing mom in hospital? Surely that's when the nervous cabbie would be on his bestest behaviour, with a hit-man in the same room? It would make sense if Foxx had basically flipped out or was having some sort of breakdown due to the pressure. Otherwise, it's hardly a rational thing to do...This could have been a Strangers On A Train type film, and what a shame that Cruise wasn't allowed to have a slightly campy, homoerotic strand to his character  it would give his bonding with Foxx a different dimension. When they resort to the rock soundtrack near the end, it's just an OC type flick to flog the soundtrack. It's a long way from Heat.",Collateral
267,newblu,Peep This Reviews,8,9 July 2017,"One of the best murder for hire films ever. Forget all those ""Mission Impossible"" movies. This is the ultimate Tom Cruise as a bad-ass film that you'll ever see. And this is on top of the list of best Jamie Foxx performances (I would say he's only better in ""Ray""). A great stylish thriller with truly beautiful cinematography.",Collateral
268,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Collateral,8,6 August 2004,"`O' Oscar, Where Art Thou?' is a phrase that Hollywood super-star Tom Cruise has become all too familiar with, especially as of late. Ever since his break out in Risky Business, a film, as good as it may be, is hardly Oscar material, Cruise has made numerous attempts to take home the golden statuette by taking on roles in such high-profile dramas as Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, and Magnolia, only to come up nearly empty handed (he received Best Actor nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia). But his last two films (Minority Report and The Last Samurai), quite possibly the best chances at an Oscar nod in years based on critical as well as public acceptance, failed to produce even a nomination. Does this affect his career, let alone his own self-esteem for his craft? Hardly! Cruise continues to take risks as an actor, which includes performing in a role that doesn't suite his personality: the villain. The story centers on an ordinary man living in the big city just trying to make a decent living as a cab driver until one day he picks up the wrong guy at the wrong time and becomes embroiled in a situation he never could have imagined. For twelve years Max has been a cab driver in the city of Los Angles, a position that he envisioned would only be temporary until he saved up enough money to start his own limo service, one that would be like a `club experience', but some things in life don't always work out the way we envision them. Take for instance, one night Max picks up a man named Vincent, a person who one would describe as well put together, who `hires' him to drive him around to five locations that night for double the amount of money he would normally make in a single night. Max, believing him to be a decent hardworking guy, agrees to the deal only to shockingly discover that his occupant is actually a contract killer sent by a narco-trafficking cartel to eliminate five individuals, both witnesses and prosecutors, involved in a federal grand jury trial set to take place the next day. Though Max tries everything in his capacity, which, at times, can be quite limited, to escape, Vincent forces him at gun-point to drive him around to each location. As the increasingly distressing night drags on, Vincent and Max become more dependent on each other and begin to reveal within themselves aspects of life they never once considered before  aspects that will change the course of their own lives forever. The story for Collateral is not all that complex and, in a sense, remains fairly predictable from beginning to end but the way Michael Mann successfully blends an intoxicating atmosphere with sympathetic characters and brilliantly choreographed action sequences, that feel neither drawn-out nor short-lived, that make it the most fascinating storylines this season.One of the most striking aspects about the film is the way the filmmakers allow a small group of performers to carry the entire feature without missing a beat. Though several background characters are brought in and out throughout the film's two hour time length, they are, in essence, meaningless to the audience as many of the main actions occurring on screen primarily affect the relationship between Vincent and Max, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Tom Cruise, who is better known on the big screen for playing the hero rather then the villain, could have been disastrous had he ended up like most actors who break their usual mold, but he demonstrates that he's just as good, or even better, being bad. The grey-haired, clean-cut Vincent may seem intelligent and even debonairish in certain respects, which makes the character all the more enticing, much in the same way Anthony Hopkins portrayed Hannibal Lecter  a person so interesting and majestic that you can't help but root for him at times, though in your heart you know should be hating his guts. The other reason the character works so well is the way his acts and reacts with the character of Max the cab driver, played by Jamie Foxx. The film starts off with Max as the weak-willed, cautious pawn in the grand master-plan that he can't control, but as time goes on and their conversations become more and more profound, his personality changes in such dramatic fashion that it snaps the audience's moral compass back in line by having them root for the man they should be interested in from the beginning. Overall, Collateral started like any other film and could have ended up the disaster it should have been (based on the clear-cut final sequence it finished with) but its impressive cast, tense atmosphere, brutal violence, and, more importantly, its austere message make this film the sleeper hit of the summer. The ending is not disappointing in the sense that is flat or uninteresting but rather that if one figures out early on that Jada Pinkett-Smith's appearance in the film is more then just a mere cameo (if you caught the appearances on the late-night talk shows, this should be a given to you), the way the film wraps-up isn't all that surprising. But this hardly deters the audience from having an enjoyable experience none the less. The aspect, one that literary wizards will adore, that sets Collateral apart from other thrillers is the Richard III-ish affect it has on the reactions of the audience. Early on, we should be hating Vincent, a man who viciously kills people without any second thought, but the character is ten times more interesting then Max, who comes off as a cautious neat-freak rather then a hero, that we are easily attracted to him and, dare it be said, root for him even though we know deep inside that we should be loathing his actions. Only when the real hero emerges in Max and he finally begins to escape the precarious shell he has kept himself in do we begin to shift our attention to the person that deserves it the most. Collateral's message, one that is hammered further and further into the minds of movie-goers as the story unfolds, that life should be lived to its fullest and one should take advantage of every minute of every day. This may sound simple and even clichéd but once you've seen this film, it's easier to understand and therefore take to heart once you've exit the theater.",Collateral
269,tomb_92,Brutal and tense. A really decent thriller,8,29 October 2010,"I really enjoyed this. It was great to see Tom Cruise in a different role than the usual action hero and I thought he did villainous contract killer rather well. The show was stolen by Jamie Foxx, as always he gave a brilliant performance. I found the premise to be really interesting and different- almost Hitchcockian (man gets into a taxi- he's an assassin). To add to that, the whole film was consistently so tense it really felt like Strangers on a Train or even Rear Window, especially the final showdown. It was a shame how the ""message"" of the film felt a little shoehorned in, in the long monologues of Foxx and Cruise, but they were well delivered. The brutal and tense tone made it a real experience to watch and you really can never predict what is going to happen, or who is going to die, next.",Collateral
270,NateW,Another first rate effort from an underrated master,9,28 December 2004,"Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max. The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clichéd action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride. It's truly one of the year's best.",Collateral
271,Exiled_Universe,"A very mild action movie, very decent!",8,12 August 2019,"Well first off i was supposed to watch this movie a long time from now because its so far down on my list but i recently saw the fever club shootout scene on YouTube thanks to my guy Ex Hit-man and i was like oh hell no i gotta watch this movie today and i also squeezed in the dark knight trilogy so i can re-watch then and admire how good they were and still are. So anyway i saw the trailer as well but it didn't show enough action for me but i didn't care because i was just willing to watch it with my mom and dad just for the fever club shootout and i was waiting for that part to come on at 1 hour and 20 minutes but anyway at the end my dad told me he saw this a long time ago but my mom said she didn't so i don't know to be honest. Anyway after seeing it really wasn't all that bad i mean i did expect it to kinda be like john wick but if it was like john wick i would have saw this a long time ago. So after seeing it there really wasn't any action other than the fever club shootout i mean there were some slight small mild occurrences like a few fight scenes and shooting but other than that nothing. It was like one of these on hit wonder movies and single movies without there ever being a sequel like Harry Brown and Mr and Mrs Smith. It felt kind of off there was too much dialogue in the beginning and basically through most of the rest of the movie. Anyway at the last 30 minutes of the movie it turned into a straight up horror movie and there was chasing and it was nail-biting and i was actually genuinely intrigued about that part and i kinda felt like a lifetime movie and it was a major plot twist, anyway this was a good movie!",Collateral

But I must acknowledge the fact that he has been in some great movies, so I was willing to give Collateral the benefit of the doubt, and watched it without any preconceptions. And after one viewing, I have to ask HOW COOL IS THIS MOVIE? I have to applaud the Cruise for accepting this role! Totally unexpected to see Cruise play Vincent, a 'bad guy'. But he's not really bad, he's just a highly motivated individual focused on completing his task. Which happens to be killing people. Time is of the essence so he decides to 'hire' a cab driver (Jamie Foxx in an excellent performance) who is understandably reluctant to help. Do yourself a favour and watch this film at least once!",Collateral
274,maureen_smith5,A tremendously stylish crime thriller with Cruise on electrifying form as a against type assassin.,10,3 May 2019,"This is another very stylized crime saga from thriller genius Michael Mann(Heat, Public Enemies), that I feel is a pretty big deal IMO.Yes its a utterly superb and gripping thriller from start to finish, but the reason its such a big deal is, is because the usually action lead superstar and normally good guy Tom Cruise goes way against type as a extremely cold hearted assassin who moves from target to target killing without a flinch half the time, this is so odd but very memorable and it works wonders in my opinion. Cruise brings his usual good looks, comical timing, kick ass nature and frenetic energy and moves it up a notch, his Vincent is truly one of the most coolest and lethal hitmen I have ever seen on the big screen, the amount of times he brutally killed his targets(plus others that cross his path)was awesome stuff, plus him stalking them(especially towards the end)was chilling and proves what a quality performer this guy is.He is backed up by Jamie Foxx as poor cab driver Max being forced to drive Cruise's Vincent round LA as the bad guy goes after his targets. Foxx isn't as strong as Cruise, even if their chemistry is brilliant. Whether it is early on with Max first finding out about Vincent's antics, becoming his helper in crime, standing up to him at last and even reluctantly taking Vincent along to the hospital when he has to visit his mother(Cruise putting on the old charm as ever). Foxx is terrific and becomes more heroic as its goes along even if he appears a bit like his Amazing Spiderman 2 villain role Electro at the beginning(goofy and a bit cowardly), a very good foil to Cruise though.The rest of the cast are more just tiny supporting players even if they all are very good. We have the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith as Anne, a lawyer who Max falls for and who comes back into play in the corking finale. We also have a early role for Mark Ruffalo as a cop trying to find Vincent and Max, along with actor/director Peter Berg as his cop partner plus Javier Bardem in a small role as a gangster(shows his future quality in a small appearance)and of course a tiny cameo from future superstar Jason Statham, who delivers a package to Vincent in a airport(playing I think his Transporter character Frank Martin).The movie is very stylish and not only reminds me of Mann's masterpiece Heat, mainly for its LA cityscapes, brutal and loud action scenes, shocks and the cool camera work, but it also reminds me of The Dark Knight , which followed about four years later. The skyscrapers, chases and wide shots as well as the memorable action moments remind me of the iconic comic book classic.The film lulls a tad in the middle, mainly for the hospital visit plus Max in the club with Bardem's gangster and other slower moments drag a bit but the opening scenes especially the first few kills from Vincent are awesome(plus when Vincent guns down the two idiots who stole his briefcase in epic style), and of course the last 40 minutes or so when Jada's Anna reappears and is now on Vincent's hit list, its one of the most thrilling final acts I have seen, as Max really becomes a hero in trying to save his lady love from Vincent's relentless kill appetite(which sees a pitch black sequence in a office block plus a chase sequence before the last stand on a train). Another outstanding scene is in another nightclub which sees a couple of fantastic shoot outs plus Tom in full on Mission Impossible mode as he batters a few cops and gangsters(saving Max's life)and a shock death takes place after(again by Vincent).Probably not in the very top level of Cruise's movies but its arguably his strongest and most menacing role still to date and makes the movie that much better because of it. He is backed up by cowardly then heroic Foxx, who also shows his future action potential. Jada gives one of her finest displays too and Ruffalo, Berg, Bardem and Statham are briefly memorable. Along with some of cinemas most stylized sequences, thrilling action and chases, dark humour, LA at its most visceral(both gorgeous and grim), a outstanding last act and a sad death, even though we really shouldn't care.Michael Mann is the king of the crime saga plus Tom needs more roles like this now and then.",Collateral

It was painful. Poor screenwriting is to blame for that.  The shooting scenes were not at all into the school of realism, but Tom Cruise is great. Too many unreal scenes. It was exciting, but it was also annoying at times. The whole premise is unreal. The person behind me in the theatre said at the end, ""Thank God it's over."" I didn't feel that way, but I was intellectually numb as the credits started rolling. I didn't feel cheated, but I didn't feel great about the experience either. It was both good and bad.

The basic plot of the film finds a cab driver, Max ( Jamie Foxx) who finds himself the hostage of contract killer, Vincent ( Tom Cruise) as he makes his rounds from hit to hit during one night in LA.One of the things that makes this film one of my favorites is the script and its characters. For example, while Vincent is a cool calculating contract killer at the top of his game. Max is a cabbie with big dreams and little to show for it. Vincent embraces force, while Max is the opposite. Vincent has big opinions, Max doesn't.In a way, the character of Vincent is the "" Ghost of Christmas Future."" The acting in the film is top-notch with Cruise at the top of his game. Say what you want about the guy, but he more than delivers in this film.The way he delivers his lines with a sense of subtitle irony is quite brilliant. Foxx is just as good, especially when he begins to change character wise.There are so many awesome scenes from this film, that I can't really pick one to be my favorite. That whole ""Yo, homie. Is that my briefcase?"" scene is just classic. I also love that whole dance club scene where Vincent just goes crazy in close quarter combat. Another one of my favorites is when Vincent throws that chair threw the glass, but then he falls over the chair! The ending is a little bit of a letdown......",Collateral

278,neon47,Good but not great.,6,7 August 2006,"I hate Tom Cruise. I can't stand him for the life of me, nearly everything he's done has done more than just annoy the sh*t out of me, however, after receiving several ""this movie is great"" from friends, I decided to give it a spin. This is one of the first Tom Cruise movies that hasn't made me shut it off early. That doesn't mean that the movie itself is a stellar achievement. If I recall correctly there's a little Michael Mann movie called Heat (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) that was at least 10 times better than this. Collateral takes us through an evening with Jamie Foxx (Max) and Tom Cruise (Vincent) as Cruise makes five hits. Unfortunately, I was able to guess the plot twists which were good but easy to see coming. The action is very intense which put a smile on my face, especially when Cruise executed the guy who stole his brief case. However, when the action isn't on all we see is arguments, threats, and some character development. The way Foxx develops in the movie was to be expected which wasn't bad because I was getting sick of his character. Collateral is worth watching, but if you're thinking about buying wait until it hits the $7 mark.",Collateral
279,moviefan2003va,Fabulous...,9,17 September 2004,"I absolutely loved this movie. This is definitely a star making performance by Jamie Foxx. I had to wait until the end of the summer to see a movie that takes the time to do character study so we can understand our characters. It was well worth the wait. I have always been a big Tom Cruise fan and it was nice to see him trying out the bad guy role. He played the role convincingly and in a way that let you see the complexity of his character. Foxx just blew me away. He has arrived as a serious actor. No more Booty Call movies...or else he'll be selling himself short. **SPOILERS**I like the consistent use of themes in this movie. LA is the perfect city to play out these themes of isolation, fleeting dreams, and loss humanity. One gets the impression Vincent justifies what he does b/c he is disillusioned by the lack of humanity people show any more towards each other. How ironic how his body will be discovered. Tying into an earlier thing he said. Max's umblemished cab is sort of like a cage, a confinement, an excuse for not seeking out his dreams. He has dreams he tucks away in a sun visor that he looks at instead of a mirror where he could actually see himself and detect that he is not getting any younger.Unlike others, I like the ending b/c of the symbolism. Vincent has been challenging Max all night to wake up and get the fires burning inside him. Because of the actions Max takes at the end to save the Prosecutor and the actions he takes against Vincent, one gets the impression he has finally arrived and will act on his dreams. Fantastic movie that is easily one of the best pictures of the year.9/10",Collateral
280,crazyrabbits,There IS beauty in the breakdown...,10,8 January 2006,"Michael Mann's film ""Collateral"" is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything just works, from the acting to the story to the cinematography. Basically, the film is about a hit-man named Vincent (played with restrained fury by Tom Cruise) who hires a taxi driver with plenty of ambition (also played very well by Jamie Foxx) to drive him around to various destinations. What starts out as a simple job soon turns deadly as Max discovers that he must drive Vincent around to kill 5 people involved in a complex court case, and as the night rolls on, he must find a way to save them, AND try to stop Vincent from completing his plan.There are two major things I like about the film. The first is the cinematography. Now, I've never been to Los Angeles, so I certainly can't vouch for the state of the city, but it looks absolutely beautiful in this film. In all it's high-definition glory, we see the contrast between the seedy parts of the city and how it differs from the business districts. We even get to see nighttime shots of L.A. from a helicopter, and it just looks gorgeous. Another thing I really liked about the film is the interplay between Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise in their scenes. What starts out as a simple conversation grows as Vincent and Max analyze each other and find out they really do have a lot in common. They also try to give each moral support and advice, which I thought was quite interesting.Tom Cruise plays the bad guy role to perfection, showing us a killer who is so good at what he does, he barely even feels emotion anymore. Jamie Foxx also does wonders as the timid driver who stands up and asserts his role as a hero. Their conversations and performances really help make the film something special. Mark Ruffalo also does good work as the cop who's trying to figure out more about Vincent, and who tries to save Max at one point (I was surprised he wasn't in the film longer, seeing as how he got killed off so suddenly). The action scenes were also quite thrilling, but the shootout on the train at the end was kind of haphazard (though I will say that Jamie Foxx has EXCELLENT aim). There are also a few plot holes (how both men could be strangely unaffected by a car crash, Vincent's failure to cover his tracks adequately (come on, barging into a hotel room and leaving footprints and a messy crime scene doesn't work]), the laughable conversation between Max and Felix) but these are negligible, and don't distract from the movie in any way. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which features a lot of alternative and rock music that supports the film (the song played by Audioslave during a drive-by of L.A. is one of the most uplifting things I have ever heard). Overall, though, this is one film you can't miss.Bottom Line: Go see this film as soon as you can, and also pick up Mann's other films (The Insider, Heat, and Miami Vice).",Collateral
281,colettesplace,"Controlled film-making, strong performances, yes we can forgive a slightly OTT ending",8,2 January 2005,"Max (Jamie Fox) is a dreamer who's been working as an LA cab driver for the last 12 years. His taxi is his castle. Over the course of one night he meets and connects with prosecuting attorney Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), before being taken hostage by contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise).The latest film from director/producer Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali, Heat), Collateral is a very impressive and intelligent thriller which may be the first feature shot on digital camera to gross more than $100 million at the US box office.Transformed by a shock of salt and pepper-coloured hair, Cruise gives his best performance in years as the Terminator-like Vincent, who remarks ""I'm just doing my job"" as he destroys his targets. While the action is gripping, scriptwriter Stuart Beattie gives us insight into both characters as they draw uneasy lessons from each other. There's also space and silence in the film, evoked by Mann's unconventional depiction of Los Angeles. At one stage, Max's taxi pauses while two coyotes cross the road  the wildness in central LA shadows Vincent's inner savagery. To Max, like the coyotes, Vincent will remain an enigma to the end.Collateral's short time frame heightens tension, but in a less self-conscious way than TV series 24. Numerous closeups and innovative camera angles are used to further the story, rather than distract the viewer. Appropriately, high definition digital photography gives a sometimes grainy and gritty look to the film. Mann chose this medium because its distinct colour palette helped better capture the city at night.In Collateral we see a talented filmmaker in control of his medium. No screen time is wasted on clichéd plot developments or unnecessary characters. Instead the three main actors are given room to display their capabilities, supported by Mark Ruffalo as a narcotics detective, Javier Bardem as a crime boss and the city itself. ****/***** stars.",Collateral

Think anybody will notice?""A nearly flawless fast paced thriller/crime drama, layered with themes of ethical subjectivity and what a man and his dreams mean. Collateral takes you on a night time journey with two completely opposite characters. A Hitman played Brilliantly by Tom Cruise and A modest Taxi driver who lives his life hoping to one day accomplish his dreams played by Jamie Fox. Despite them being complete opposites you can't help but root for both of them as the audience. Collateral has some of the most amazing long sequences of two them just having a conversation about why both of them are the way they are. About what makes a man kill, about what makes a man so unwilling to act and accomplish his dream. (That part is quite easily my favorite part of the film)
There aren't many action scenes but when with the few that are present in the film are raw and adrenaline fueled, with some of the best sound design and gunshot ""sounds"" you can't help but flinch every time a gun is fired.
Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox lead this crime drama and under the surface a story about nihilistic beliefs and the dissection of the human subconsciousness brilliantly. The only gripe i have with the film is the unnecessary vague ending leaving many questions left about Max (not in a good way)

288,tresdodge,"Enjoyable, even if pretty unrealistic",5,7 September 2004,"A few years ago it would have been hard to imagine Tom Cruise playing a bad guy but he has pulled it off twice in Minority Report and now Collateral. However, I agree that Jamie Foxx stole the show as the cab driver and I hope to see him in such excellent roles in the future. Overall it was a pretty exciting movie with great cinematography and editing but I can't help but pick at the unrealistic elements:1. How come there were no witnesses to the first killing. I mean it was in a residential street, a man fell from three floors onto a car, if that happened in my street day or night, people would open their windows etc. There would certainly be no time for the body to be put in the boot and two people to talk loudly as they do here. Maybe all the residents of the street in this movie wear ear plugs and take hardcore sleeping pills!!2. Tom cruise appeared to be invincible as he shot away his foes in the nightclub and the police were pretty ineffectual. In addition, the drug baron instead of being escorted away from danger by his bodyguards, as is surely the norm, was instead left open and unprotected while he watched as his hench men were slaughtered one by one, until Vincent had a pretty easy job of blasting him away.3. Also, many police helicopters appeared to be chasing the taxi after the night club shoot out only to disappear as the car sped up. Surely this is pretty inaccurate that a s***ty, battered old cab can outrun high tech police helicopters!4. The police were'nt sure how many men were in the car and suspected that it was just the cab driver that had gone nuts. But how come with all the technology available, especially with heat sensors in helicopters they never found out that there were two men!5. Also, in the penultimate scene where Vincent is trying to kill the top attorney in her 'top security offices'there was no top security to speak of, just a shot of an archetypal fat looking security guard, lying dead to one side. Surely important buildings such as this have greater security than that. I might be wrong but are nt they weird up to police stations or private security firms in 'real life'. 6. In the same section of the movie, where it is supposed to be 4am we get a shot out of the window where we can see the many lights of cars that comprise a long traffic jam. A huge traffic jam at 4am! has there been an outbreak of a swarm of locusts in the city or did they shoot this film in Winter during rush hour! I know it is only a movie' but these unrealistic elements break the cinematic illusion for me, man!",Collateral

292,Zoopansick,"Good, but got a little off track at the end",7,12 August 2004,"(spoilers herein) I just saw Collateral tonight and thought it was pretty good. I especially liked Tom Cruise doing what he does best (being cool). I thought the story was pretty interesting, even though I kind of guessed what case the witnesses were from and where the film was headed. There is also some good black humor mixed in with the killings that keep things really entertaining. There were definitely some moments that seemed a ""little too convenient"" like the people in the ""elevator"" or the very fact that Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Cruise use the same cab right after each other. Still those are only minor problems. My biggest problem and the thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher rating (gave it a 7, which translates to like ***/**** on my scale), was in fact the ending. Things just got too outlandish for me here. First of all max crashes the cab doing like 80 and Vincent is virtually unharmed (even without his setabelt on) and is able to get up like 30 seconds after the crash and book it down the street. Then when he gets into the office building where his final target is, he stupidly wastes time turning off the buildings power, which IN FACT gives his victim an unnecessary edge. At this point it became obvious how things were going to turn out and that the movie didn't really have the balls to follow through with what it set up in the first hour and a half. I wish they would have had the guts to keep things going as they did earlier and work within the limits for the characters set up. Before the final shoot out Cruise warns Foxx that ""this is what I do for a living"" which if it were true the scared cabby would be dead instead of the professional killer who up until that point should excellent marksmenship. What Cruis should have said is ""this is what happens at the end of 99% of all movies""...the bad guy dies and the good guy gets the girl. Still as an overall experience I found the movie to be entertaining with strong performances all around and having an engaging story.Zoopansick",Collateral
293,Scorching,Strong performces in a good thriller,7,5 August 2004,"Maybe some spoilers!Collateral is the latest film from Michael Mann and is the story of a LA cab driver Max who dreams of owning his own limo service. It starts like any other night moving people around in his cab. Things however take a drastic change when he is offered by Vincent to ferry him around for his 'business' and to visit his 'friends'. What happens next is a roller coaster ride as Max tries to get away.Well this is probably one of the summer movies that I wanted see once I found out of the summer movie line-up. Plus the fact that it was to be released in the latter part of the summer really helped build up the anticipation for this film.When I found out that Tom Cruise was to play the 'bad guy', I was excited to see Cruise play the bad guy since I loved his performance in Interview With the Vampire. Hey you don't see him play a bad guy that often so I was interested how he was going to do here. He did a pretty convincing job as a bad guy. Very menacing especially with his great dialog and movements. I would hate to run into this guy in if he were a real person.As for the casting of Jaime Foxx as the 'good guy', I wasn't that pleased at first. Hey it's not like he did a good job with Bait. Plus I have a hard time digesting the fact that this guy who is known more for his comedy can do an action film. Pretty much like Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines. Well Foxx did a good job considering that I wasn't really expecting a lot from him. At times he even outshone Cruise, who like I said did a great job.Michael Mann did a great job with directing. I found the close shots, which really dominated the film rather refreshing. To the point that sometimes you feel you are standing next to the characters in the film. I wasn't too convinced with the screenplay though and I feel some of the characters were placed in to the movie so as to fill the star power of the film. To the point that the movie can go on even without these characters.Well what looks like the last major summer movie of the year turned into a fulfilling experience accented by great performances by the two lead actors.",Collateral
294,thomasmitilis1995,"YOU KILLED HIM. NO I SHOT HIM, THE BULLETS AND THE FALL KILLED HIM...",8,18 June 2020,"PROS:
~Jamie Foxx is Max, a cab driver that dreams creating a limo company and escaping to tropical islands. However, he postpones constantly these plans because of his insecurities and as a result he is stuck to the unmaginative life of the daily routine spending most of his time inside a cab. In other words, he is defined by his failures and not his dreams.
~Tom Cruise is the villain this time and this change is welcome and refreshing. He is Vincent, a contract killer that deals everything with professionalism. He demonstrates apathy when he kills his targets showing that there is a distinction between the brutality of his job and his calm character. The gray suit and the gray hair highlight exactly his disconnection from the rest of the world.
~The conversations inside the cab are very interesting and help to understand better the characters. The two main characters don't become friends but gain a deep understanding of each other as the night goes on. Vincent believes that there is no solidarity in the world and critisizes Max for not taking risks in his life (by starting a new job or talking to the girl). He is actually the voice of Max acting as a small step to fulfil his purposes. The coyote wandering alone in the streets symbolizes the attachment of Max to an environment he doesn't desire and the lack of his evolution.
~The visuals are astonishing and Michael Mann makes the setting of Los Angeles feel like a live character. The big paintings on the walls, the tunnels, the deserted highways and the alleys are viewed after midnight and the panoramic shots illustrate a city that sleeps. The music choices depict perfectly the urban nature of L.A. However, Mann also demonstates masterful work in the action scenes (the club scene and the one in the train are fantastically directed), not forgetting to shock us at the same time (with the body falling from a building).
~Apart from the two main characters, the rest of the cast is solid too. Jada Pinkett Smith has small screen time but the film makes you care for her by showing her vulnerabilities (her anxiety before a big case). Javier Bardem makes a surprising cameo as the cartel leader and his pretentious monologue about trust is fun to watch. Mark Rufallo as the cop shows his acting chops in a movie of his early career.CONS:
~The film depends on some conveniences. For example, it is almost impossible for the same taxi driver to meet a hitman and the person who this hitman wants to kill at the same night. Furthermore, Cruise's character gets away easily after a car crash and the helicopters that tracked the taxi cab are suddenly disappeared.",Collateral
295,puttputtk,"great cast, great film",9,17 December 2010,"Collateral (2004) Collateral has a great and captivating story line along with some of the best work by the cast and crew. A hit-man kidnaps a cab driver and makes him drive him around town to make his hits. It seems like a relatively easy plot but somehow it's quite original.The thing that makes this film work so well is the cast and crew. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are both at their best. Jamie Foxx was nominated for plenty of awards for his role and I think he really deserved that. His performance is only rivaled by his performance in Ray. Tom Cruise didn't get that much praise for his role but it is personally my favorite performance of his, very intense and real.Besides the acting you also get, in my opinion, Michael Mann's best directing as well. It might not be his best film but I think the directing stands out more than any other. But what I liked even more than the directing and the acting is the cinematography. It's very dark very similar to The Godfather but even darker, almost like the whole film was done in the shadows, its fantastic.The film is two hours long and I think that was perfect, it never really draws out or anything, it stays tense and interesting the whole time. My only complaint about the film is the ending. I like the actual ending but the minutes leading up to the final scene seems a little to ridiculous to a point. It doesn't ruin the film, if anything it just makes you say ""yeah right"" ******Spoiler****** Tom Cruise is chasing Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith through a building, though he's quite a ways behind them and can't see where they go he guesses which way they go and what train they go on. He thinks about which way to go at every turn but is still confident he made the right choice every time and stays ready. I guess it is possible but I don't think it would happen. again it doesn't ruin the film, its just a small complaint.****End Spoilers***** I think most people will enjoy this film, especially fans of Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Michael Mann, or just action films in general.9/10",Collateral

Max doesn't really want to but Vincent pushes him to do so. This movie was very well acted by the stars Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. I really enjoyed this movie, it was action packed and well made from director Michael Mann. Mann made a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You wouldn't want to leave the theater or turn off your DVD player. Your eyes will be glued to the screen. I guarantee it. You will enjoy the performance that Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx deliver.

When both men meet each other, their lives are no longer the same on that particular night as they have to survive a game of cat and mouse while law enforcement officers and a dangerous drug cartel are tracking them. Vincent is doing all the killings and Max has to drive him all over L.A. without resisting him as he's the hostage.

298,palmiro,What keep this movie from being something special: the Hollywood plot line,7,27 March 2005,"Despite all of the fine acting, the wonderful cinematography, the special lighting effects, etc. this film does not rise to greatness. And once again it's because it cannot bring itself to go beyond standard Hollywood plot lines. The potential was there: when the LA cop played by Mark Ruffalo is killed, for a moment we're left wondering if ""Max"" will be able to prove himself innocent of all the murders. Have no fear, he rescues the DA qua love interest (she can now testify that Max is not the killer) and (predictably) kills the professional killer in a shootout despite his amateur status. Here's an alternative, ""Improved Ending"" (keeping with the spirit of film noir): female DA is killed, Vincent is killed or disappears such that he cannot be linked to the murders, Max is arrested by the clueless FBI and as he's taken into custody you get a dissolve to the postcard and his ""dream"" island.

299,segratz,Overrated,3,12 August 2004,"This is a long, drawn out film. It has several directional flaws and although Michael Mann is a Hollywood favorite, I thought his directing here was uninspired. Tom Cruise tries to be the tough guy hit man and wears a thick gray hair piece to try to make his part more believable - it doesn't work. All I saw was Tom Cruise attempting to be a badass with supposed kung fu and superior gun firing moves - the Bourne Supremacy does the super strong man much better. The only highlight is Jamie Foxx as the 'hero' - a cabdriver with big dreams. The director makes sure he is carefully characterized and developed - too much so for my taste. Everything is so spelled out and attempts at being 'artistic' fail for me. I do NOT recommend this movie, although most of the guys I have talked to loved it. So maybe that is more of what it is - a masculine movie.",Collateral

I noticed that Mann lets us get to know ""Vincent"" the hit-man a little bit...then makes it plain that there is nothing there to get to know. This is a guy who will buy you a drink, and then blow your brains out.

303,shattenjager777,1/2 character drama + 1/2 action film = Engaging but messy film,6,21 August 2005,"""Collateral"" isn't a bad film by any means, but it's a somewhat unfocused, messy film and that holds back a terribly interesting concept and some very good acting, keeping the film only a decent one. The opening of the film is very slow and drawn out, showing us that our hero (and make no mistake about it, Foxx is the star and hero) is a clean freak cab driver and something of a dreamer. However, despite the character development involved, this is perhaps the worst part of the film because it has little to do with the coming plot and it's extremely slow--several passages like this will follow, interrupting an interesting film that has some thrilling action bits as well as one fascinating character (Vincent, the contract killer, played by Tom Cruise) and a wonderful character arc for its protagonist as he, despite his fear of the other man, is affected positively by him.The acting, needless to say, is excellent. Jamie Foxx has quickly become one of the most respected young actors in Hollywood and this film shows why, and it also reminds us of the talent Tom Cruise has--able to be cunning, frightening, professional, and above all charismatic. Many have forgotten that Cruise's first film role was an evil, crazed young military student in ""Taps,"" but here we can again see how his unmatched charisma can be so effective in a ""bad guy"" role. To get back to Foxx, he has a difficult, varying role and manages to play every emotion from absolute fear to rage to annoyance perfectly.Michael Mann's direction is strong, always keeping the focus where it needs to be--on the wonderful characters being acted so well--and keeps the entire film attractive. He also does a wonderful job of not going out of his way to draw our attention to small details that we do need to notice but still allowing us to see them. It's something like watching a stage play in that it's up to the viewer to pay attention and see these effects, which I always enjoy and which gives the film rewatchability (I think I may just have invented that word, but hopeful everyone can discern its intended meaning) on par with just about any film.Overall, ""Collateral"" is a somewhat unfocused film that could have been absolutely fascinating and despite the mess still contains excellent acting and wonderful direction. It's certainly worth a watch but it's still a flawed screenplay that needed some quick reworking to make it work and let's face it--a bad screenplay can't make a good film.",Collateral
304,katydid4819,Cruise and Foxx,8,24 October 2004,"Tom Cruise is superman as far as the American public is concerned. He is the typical everyman and that is why we love him so. He has the quality that everyone craves and he radiates the this-could-be-you-vibe like no other celebrity. In Collateral, he is the villain. Though still clothed in the everyman gray, his intentions and his heart are no longer as relatable. But yet, it's Tom Cruise, and everything he does seems to be relatable. Perhaps that's why he was the perfect choice for the anti-hero in this Michael Mann film. Jamie Foxx is a nobody to the American public. But he's on his way up. Besides having a highly buzzed film, Ray, coming out this winter, he is playing the counter part to Tom Cruise. And he's acting Cruise off the screen!!!! He's subtle and natural and plays against Cruise's intensity like no other. Together they make an excellent on-screen couple with Cruise being showy and upfront and Foxx being low-key and passive. They are, together, one person. Sometimes it takes two people to be one and here is the perfect example. They complete each other. Collateral is built on its script. Much of the film rests on the banter between Foxx and Cruise as they ride around LA in Foxx's taxi. Cruise has a few 'errands' to run and he's hired Foxx for the night. At first hesitant, Foxx eventually accepts. The plot truly is secondary and serves merely to give the actors something to talk about. The city of LA plays itself and is lit with the colorful orbs you see in the ad with Cruise. They, like the city, appear almost to be a character of their own. They are in every scene and are the only actual witnesses to the night. No one else gets to see the relationship between these two halves of a man as they assume their position as a single person in the ending scenes.Michael Mann's direction is superb. It pays attention to the details yet allows the broader aspects speak for themselves. He has composed a film of fast paced moments and small, slow conversations, each part holding its own in the big picture. There is something here that is not to be missed.****/*****",Collateral
305,kingbad,Wasted effort,6,21 August 2004,"OK, so I'm buying Jamie Foxx as a repressed, compulsive cabbie. I can even sorta buy Jada Pinckett-Smith as a federal prosecutor with a thing for repressed, compulsive cabbies. But then you throw in Tom Cruise as Vincent, the World's Shortest Contract Killer, and it's just way too much to believe. Director Michael Mann gives Cruise some leftover Don Johnson stubble from his Miami Vice days, and Bill Clinton's hair, but beyond that it's still just ""Risky Top Days of the Last Cocktail"" with a gun. Besides choosing Mini-Me as the villain, this movie also has some problems with believability- after all, what kind of hitman is so concerned about leaving witnesses, yet kills just about everybody around in as public a place as possible? What kind of crime boss would bother killing the prosecuting attorney, when there are dozens more in the same office ready to take over? And what kind of cabbie drives a fare all over town, but never turns on the meter? On the plus side, Jamie Foxx simutaneously conveys both abject fear and annoyance with the miniature sociopath who threatens his life while nagging him about his professional and romantic failures. The cinematography is wonderful, showing nighttime L.A. to its best advantage. Unfortunately, Tom Cruise is simply too short to be scary, and his Tony Robbins-meets-Sammy the Bull routine wears thin too fast.",Collateral

307,Sharkey360,Tom Cruise + Michael Mann= GREAT FILM! One of 2004's best!,9,6 August 2004,"I entered the theater having huge expectations with Collateral. Not only does it have superstar Tom Cruise (M:I-2, Last Samurai, Minority Report) but it also has director Michael Mann (one of the BEST directors around) whose credits included Heat and Ali.And after spending over two hours watching, I must say that Collateral is one great movie!Tom Cruise is hit-man Vincent. Already very experienced in his underworld duties, Vincent is the hit-man who really knows what to do, what to anticipate and motivate people. Heck, Vincent even has humanity him especially when he actually helped Max (Jamie Fox) out of trouble.True to hit-man fashion, Cruise delivered GREAT moves with his fists, kicks and guns. Having seen him use guns in John Woo's M:I-2, Cruise played with the guns very differently and realistically in this movie. Performance wise, Vincent is greatly played by Cruise with such elements of being a hit-man and a human being. I wish Cruise good luck to winning his first ever acting Oscar.Jamie Fox plays Max, the taxi driver who works hard for his living. His bad luck started when he met Vincent and everything changed for the worst. Max is very human in the sense that he gets torn apart between aiding Vincent, interacting with his mom and even helping a young woman he met only hours ago. Jamie Fox deserves big credit for his role and I can't think of anyone else playing Max effectively.Director Michael Mann is back to what he does best with the police/criminal/assassin genre of films. Like Heat and Manhunter, the lead characters are actually very lonely guys (Vincent Hanna and Neal M anyone?), there's also a huge shootout (Collateral's shootout is shorter but solid enough compared to Heat's bank heist), guns galore, people getting killed, lots of talk, etc. Not only did Mann do what he does best, his film has very good editing, lively camera angles, and best of all he delivered the plot and characters to life. Thanks to Mann, Collateral is very convincing and such a story can actually happen in real life.Conclusion: Collateral is one of 2004's BEST FILMS! Whether you go for Cruise, Mann, Fox, action, drama, suspense and all others kind of stuff, Collateral has something to entertain and inform any kind of moviegoer.This movie is a MUST SEE! I rate it a 9 out of 10!Now for the future of Collateral: DVD! Could hardly wait!",Collateral
308,eht5y,Very underrated; Possibly Cruise's Best,8,22 June 2005,"'Collateral' is probably the coolest, most stylish and intelligent crime thriller of the new millennium. Again, Michael Mann has directed an established star--Tom Cruise, as the sociopathic hit man, Vincent--to what might be his best performance ever, at least in an action film, and has taken a relatively obscure and unaccomplished actor--Jamie Foxx, as mild-mannered cabbie Max--and helped transform him into a major star. And, again, Mann has done so in the kind of film that straddles genres and reminds audiences that it is possible both to entertain and to provoke thought about serious themes.The story is deceptively simple: Max (Foxx) is a hard-working cabbie in L.A. with a pipe-dream of opening up a limousine business called 'Island Limos.' Mann and writer Stuart Beattie employ subtle touches to characterize the contemplative Max: he keeps his cab meticulously clean; he keeps a postcard of an Island paradise above the cab's sun-visor so that he can 'go on vacation' when dealing with traffic or obnoxious customers; in the film's rising action, Max picks up a beautiful attorney (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and proves his decency by convincing her to let him follow a time-saving shortcut, creating an unlikely romantic spark and earning himself an unexpected proposition from a woman even Max would consider out of his league.But Max's fate takes a perilous twist when he picks up Vincent (Cruise), a somewhat ostentatious and brusque character who offers Max six hundred dollars to ferry him to five different stops over the course of the evening to conduct 'business' before dropping him off at LAX in the early morning hours. Max is reluctant, but Vincent won't take 'no' for an answer, and so Max agrees, discovering shortly and shockingly what Vincent's 'business' actually is: he is a contract killer, in town for one night to eliminate five witnesses against members of a Mexican and Colombian drug cartel currently facing federal charges for murder and narco-trafficking. With his secret revealed, Vincent forces Max to continue their hellish journey, and the two carry on a philosophical battle of wits, with the brash, cynical Vincent challenging the virtuous and timid Max with a jaded, merciless view of human frailty as they speed towards a confrontation with an unlikely destiny.For all of his fame, Tom Cruise too rarely finds the right vehicles for his scrappy, athletic and intense performing style, and Vincent may be the one role that allows him the opportunity to do so many of the things audiences have come to love him for. Mann styles Vincent in a smart, '50s-style gray suit with a matching gray brush-cut and five o'clock shadow that signal both his maverick sensibility and his precise, disciplined approach to the business of murder. He philosophizes about the nature of life and death, offers biting criticism of the inhumanity of man to man epitomized by Los Angeles, America's most modern and superficial metropolis, and taunts Max for his naiveté and ineffectual lifestyle. When Vincent goes to work, Cruise stalks the screen like a lion let loose in the urban jungle, striking down his prey with an efficiency that is as beautiful as it is heartless and terrifying. Cruise fits the role as well as he fits in the finely tailored gray suit, so that the audience remains ambivalent about Vincent, who becomes a sort of Satanic hero over the course of the film.Jamie Foxx has been endlessly applauded for his performance in the title role of the recent Ray Charles bio-pic, but his Max should not be overlooked as a finely-wrought performance, full of subtle tics of reality and quiet reactions to Vincent's violence and perverse moral philosophy. Though Cruise is clearly the star of the film, Max is really its hero, an average Joe thrown into an incredibly frightening and unlikely scenario who manages to work through his fear and passivity to match wits with Vincent.Most of the film takes place in and around the cab, but this scene is hardly limiting, as it affords Mann the opportunity to exploit the beauty of Los Angeles at night, using aerial shots and sweeping vistas of the city, accompanied by a typically excellent soundtrack featuring superb electronic music as well as soul, jazz, and Mexican narcocorrida pop from the likes of Richie Havens, Miles Davis, and Bandidos de Amor.Mann wisely pulls away from the cab on occasion to fill in the back-story, using LA detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Weidner (Peter Berg) to unravel the connection between Vincent's victims. Spanish actor Javier Bardem (a two-time Oscar nominee for best actor for 'Before Night Falls'[2000] and 'The Sea Inside'[2004]) dominates the screen in a brief appearance as Felix, the drug cartel's top man in L.A. Jada Pinkett-Smith is as lovely as always in a role that reappears in a crucial plot twist towards the end of the film.But the show belongs to Cruise's Vincent and Mann's Los Angeles, true visions of the American Sublime. The film is so perfectly suited to their talents that it's hard to believe that it wasn't written for them (Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Edward Norton were all offered the role of Vincent before Cruise, and Scorsese, Spielberg, and Spike Lee all turned down the director's chair before Mann accepted). 'Collateral' is easily among the best action thrillers in recent memory, and despite a few possible plot holes in the form of highly unlikely coincidences, it is persuasively realistic, fabulously entertaining, and thought provoking to boot. Crazy or not, Tom Cruise is as commanding a screen presence as ever, and this partnership with Michael Mann might be his best work.",Collateral
309,axsmashcrushallthree,Flawed but memorable,7,14 October 2006,"Despite the overall high rating, a lot of people here have relegated this movie to the killing floor. I must admit that I agree with most of their points. However, I came out on the other side of the equation.Let's start with the bad points. The film's integrity is just plain killed by sheer disbelief and unfortunately, it takes ""Collateral"" out of the great movie category. Early on, we have Jada Pinkett's attorney hitting on the cab driver, which is absolutely silly, though the connection is tied together later. The premise of Cruise (doing hits of another kind) riding around in a cab with a cab driver hostage could have been great, but it's carried out in such an over-the-top manner that it strains the limits of credulity. In general, it's the film's attempt to integrate subtle character development with the over-the-top body count that weakens the overall structure and causes it to devolve at times into total dumbness.But, these points aside, let's talk about the good aspects of the film. This is an interesting take on the old film noir style using indirect angle shots, shadows, and blurred lighting to create an effect similar to ""Night and the City"" by Jules Dassin. The soundtrack is a brilliant melange of grooves. Tom Cruise's performance is quite good, as is Javier Bardem in a brief spot. The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is arresting and accelerates to a compelling conclusion.To me, the question is ultimately - ""how did it play?"" I found myself thinking about the movie for some time after its conclusion, and it's that indelible impression that's worth a 7/10.",Collateral
310,macktan894,Best opening sequence of the year,10,20 August 2006,"Aspiring screenwriters should scrutinize the first 30 minutes of this film, a perfect Hollywood Act 1 if there ever was one. Everything important about the characters and the coming action is set up here. Note the discussion between Annie and Max re Darrow and contrast it with Max and Cruise's discussion of Darwin. Max criticizes Cruise for killing strangers, but Cruise shuts him up by pointing out Rwanda and Max's lack of indignancy over those deaths. Cruise rails against LA and prophesies his own death on the MTA by recounting the person who died on the train and looped around the route 6 times before anyone recognized the guy was dead. Cruise easily defeats Max's pompousness and fake superiority by seducing him with money, quickly bringing the man down to his level. When that body falls on his cab, the music changes, the roles are clarified, and we are into Act 2.This is such a perfect Hollywoood formula and crafted with the finesse of a real pro. Everything about the coming story is in those first 30 minutes--genius.",Collateral

Considering the genre by itself is sort of burnt out, finding such a fine film as this one is, at the less, a very nice surprise. Director Michael Mann has done a very neat job and I will seriously consider watching anything he makes in the future. Tom Cruise is also excellent, which makes me wonder if he's really a great actor which makes him so famous, or if he so famous that one way or the other he gets involved only in fine films (and I guess this line of reasoning is food for thought not only for filmography, but for almost every aspect of life as well) All in all, a must see. I give it 8/10.",Collateral
312,OllieZ,Fantastic thriller from Mann.,9,19 January 2005,"Being a fan of the Mann, I naturally was very excited for Collateral. Thankfully it turned out to be one of his best films - even on the second, third and even fourth viewing.Straight from the start, Mann shows us his bruised L.A backdrop we are so used to in his films. Jaime Foxx as cabbie Max meets Vincent,played by Cruise. Vincent takes Max hostage, as Max takes Vincent from hit to hit - and Max must find a way out of this mess before it's too late.Collateral is not the crime epic like Heat, instead it opts for a more relentless pace, and cranks up the thrills to eleven. Cruise control as usual - he is absolutely charged as hit man Vincent. Foxx is very believable and just as good as Cruise as Max. Ruffalo and Smith are also good as supporting roles - which makes for a very entertaining film.The story is good - and like any Michael Mann film, there has to be action. And there is. Lots. The nightclub scene is fantastic. The cinematography is electrifying, the tension racked up so high you'll feel like you're in there too. I would personally say that Collateral's nightclub scene is better than Heat's famous run and gun L.A highway scene. Now we have three great action scenes from Mann's films; Collateral, Heat and Last of the Mohicans.The whole mood of the film draws me in every time. It is actually quite a melancholy film, and the ending which people criticised as a cop out, bathos in the film - I disagree. I think the ending fits in well with the mood, and is quite poetic.Collateral was one of my favourite films of the year, alongside the Aviator and The Incredibles. If you are up for a highly polished thriller, buy this now - the only problem is that it wasn't long enough! 9/10 - Fantastic.",Collateral
313,Jakethemuss,Stylish and serious,8,2 December 2005,"This is a Michael Mann movie, and I must say it is in the same league as his others. It tells the story of Max (Jamie Foxx), a depressed cab driver with dreams of running a limo business. One night he picks up and unusual customer, Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent asks Max to stick with him through the night as he has multiple stops to make, he even offers him a substantial sum of money in return for Max's efforts.What Max doesn't know is that these aren't just ordinary stops. Max is soon wishing he hadn't picked Vincent up as things turn tricky.The film is shot in a similar style to ""Heat""; Lots of nice suits, clever use of lighting, no-nonsense action scenes and well developed character inter-action. Particularly between the cool calculating Vincent and the nervous Max. Camera-work is used to brilliant effect as well, it ranges from high up shots of the brightly lit city to close up facial shots, all accompanied to appropriate music.",Collateral
314,masonmorgan-92917,A stylish and well acted thriller,8,18 December 2016,"Michael Mann's Collateral is not a widely discussed film by any means, but I truly think it should be. Collateral excellently mixes dramatic aspects with thrilling sequences of action, all involving well-acted and developed characters that we can really attach to. Sadly, Collateral falters when our claustrophobic game of ""Simon says"" opens up and a lot of the tense intimacy is lost. The acting in Collateral generates a large amount of personality within the film as we gain attached to vulnerable, yet gutsy, Foxx and the brilliantly professional Cruise. The extremely uneasy relationship that these two characters share gives the entire film a sense of urgency as well as a touch of humanity. This being Tom Cruise's first major villainous role, he absolutely kills it. The grey-haired hit-man in which he so elegantly portrays is surprisingly likable. Cruise brings such charisma to a seemingly black and white character, making him easy to like even when he's dropping people left and right. Foxx's performance also compliments Cruise's performance perfectly as we witness his transformation from the film's victim to the film's hero. His actions are believable start-to-finish as many little screenplay details contribute to the character's relatablility. Sadly, supporting characters, such as the agents on Cruise's tail, are not nearly as interesting. While they are decently acted, they aren't really given much to do or say within the story. It is indeed a waste of good Ruffalo. The story, while simple, feels refreshingly original as the film mixes tense action sequences with intriguing moments of character study. There is always a feeling of tension and intimacy, especially the scenes in which Cruise and Foxx share the cab. Their relationship is not completely friendly, but there is almost a sense of mutual respect between them as they learn more about each other's outlooks on life and their place in the world. The dialogue they share in which they question each other's philosophies is excellently written and sometimes even beautifully encapsulating. It is in the last half-hour where the biggest flaw with Collateral is realized. In the final 30 minutes of the film, the claustrophobic and brilliantly intimate cab atmosphere is left behind and the film's flow suffers greatly because of this. Once these two characters are separated and allowed the entire city to continue their feud, Collateral slows considerably as we lose a lot of the tension that was constantly building up for the entire movie. It continues to be well acted throughout, but it is noticeably slower paced and not nearly as gripping. After this point, the film slowly starts to lose momentum up until the surprisingly satisfying conclusion. If only Mann found a way to make this final act of the film more involving and as gripping as the rest of Collateral. Despite the flaws, Collateral is still an excellently acted and endlessly entertaining dramatic thriller. The stylistic and colorful shots of Los Angeles mix brilliantly with the constant taut tension shared between our main characters. Collateral is almost constantly invigorating as it never seems to slow until the final half hour where it sadly takes a steep dive in quality. This can be forgiven though as the film in it's entirety more than makes up for the slow final act. Constantly involving and charismatic, Collateral takes us on a ride that neither I, nor Max, would've expected.",Collateral

317,stu9003,A stylish thriller with a great script,8,15 September 2004,"Collateral features a great script, fine direction and top notch acting. Collateral has a very similar feel to some of Michael Mann's previous films, most notably Heat. Like Heat, Collateral is a crime thriller set in Los Angeles and, like Heat, the movie is stylish, both in terms of how the characters dress and also in terms of the hip musical selections.Collateral is about an LA cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) who picks up a fare named Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent recruits Max to drive him around to 5 different locations in order to close some real estate deals, but as Max soon finds out, Vincent is really a professional assassin and the men Max is driving Vincent around to see, are actually people Vincent has been hired to kill.This is a very smart and stylish action thriller. I features great action scenes and some very tense moments. It also features great dialogue as an unlikely relationship starts to form between Max and Vincent. Their ongoing dialogue is smart, funny and fascinating. You almost get the impression they could almost become friends in another time as The movie does have its weaknesses. You have to suspend disbelief somewhat as one of the biggest coincidences you can possibly imagine turns into a major plot point and this leads into the last 20 minutes which are more conventional and formulaic (i.e. not as good) than the rest of the movie.Overall, Collateral is an excellent movie. With a better ending, it could have been a classic but, as it is, it's still pretty damn good. 8/10",Collateral

But one fateful night, Max has one cab fare that he would never expect named Vincent (Tom Cruise). He's a smooth, charismatic fellow who is sharply dressed and apparently wealthy, offering Max an excellent tip if he'll bring him to five stops throughout Los Angeles. But fate intervenes and Max soon finds out that Vincent isn't a businessman, but a contract hit-man making his rounds. As the night progresses, Max finds himself under the microscope of a coldblooded killer. Meanwhile, the police and FBI are onto Max's cab while the two ultimately play a psychological cat and mouse game, that will lead to an inevitable climax neither would anticipate.Cruise and Foxx played their roles very well, the film was also violent and very exhilarating, especially the taxi cab barrel roll flip, and the night club fight.Collateral is one to check out, you won't be disappointed.Collateral gets 10 stars.",Collateral

He offers him several hundred dollars to be his driver to four other stops, Max hesitantly accepts.Max is setting in his cab when suddenly a body lands on his roof. Vincent immediately comes down and they put the cab in the back of the taxi after he reveals himself to be a contract killer, sent to LA to kill five people in one night. He holds Max hostage and forces him to drive him to his other four ""stops"". The entire time, Max is trying to find a way to save the other targets. In between the hits, Vincent and Max connect and have a lot of character development. There is also an LAPD detective named Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) on their trail.Collateral is probably the best Michael Mann-directed movie I've seen. He's directed several of my other favorite movies like Heat (1995), Manhunter (1986) and Public Enemies (2009). Collateral is just an intense movie experience.Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are actors I am not a big fan of. The performances in this movie surprised me. Tom Cruise is awesome as Vincent (very rare kind of role for him) and Jamie Foxx is probably even better. I honestly always thought Cruise was a terrible actor. Mark Ruffalo was also very good, he is a very underrated actor.Collateral was also filmed in High Definition. The cinematography is awesome, it has a really dark look to it. I loved it.The whole movie is intense. You fear for Max's life and also begin to like Vincent. You're not sure who you're rooting for.

321,Tecun_Uman,"So much style, so little substance",3,14 July 2006,"To me, this movie captured the essence of Miami Vice much more than Mann's actual Miami Vice movie. This movie has the look, the colors, the characters, etc. Anybody that remembers back to the good old days of Miami Vice, remembers that the bulk of each episode was centered around driving around the city at night and looking cool in clubs. Well, this movie is centered around those two things as well. I have to admit, it looks so cool. HOWEVER, the story is very weak and to say the ending is a stretch is the understatement of all-time. In fact, I would dare say that the ending was ridiculous. Cruise and Foxx do their absolute best with what is written for them and in most Michael Mann films that would be enough. However, Michael Mann usually writes his own films, this one he did not. The result is obvious and quite inferior in comparison to other Mann products, such as Heat. I think anything over 7 given to this movie is a real stretch. However, the cool look of the film keeps me from going under 6. It is just sad that Mann felt the need to make a money grab with this film and that is what Collateral is. It is a stylish, oversimplified story with major star power to draw people in. Mann used to be about style with a lot more substance. I liked the old Mann better.",Collateral
322,j_graves68,"""Hey homie...Is that my briefcase?""",7,19 January 2006,"The best of thrillers so far in the beginning of this 21st century. Both leads Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx put in all their moxie into these roles and the result are velvet-smooth performances. Director Michael Mann elected to use high-definition for this because hi-def picks up the lights in the L.A. cityscape at night and provides a crisp, contrasting image (which it does the polar opposite to with daytime photography). The dialogue is taut and loose, and NEVER boring. Even when Vincent (Cruise) points out to Max (Foxx) that ""driving a cab for 12 years isn't temporary"" when Max explains his dream to him about opening up his own limousine service, he illustrates that point to where the audience would agree and would be unable to fully hate him.The premise is simple, although not realistic. But because it sounds/seems so outrageous, I could actually see someone in Vincent's position resorting to this technique temporarily, though. Vincent is a hired gun who needs to dispatch 5 material witnesses to a federal drug trial in one night. One out of the five works for the U.S. Attourney General's office (Jada Pinkett-Smith). Foxx is a cab driver who has her for his fare just before meeting up with Cruise, and is unaware that she's on his hit-list. Cruise uses public transportation as a ruse to complete his mission rather than having to worry about getaway car-descriptions, license plate numbers, etc. After the first hit, Max wants out (Vincent has bribed him already to help him ""close some deals"") even though he has no choice but to play ball for his life. He uses his charisma to get them to point A to points B, C, D, and so on. After Foxx impulsively hucks over Cruise's briefcase full of files/ data/money, Cruise has Foxx take them to a seedy nightclub in East L.A. to retrieve what was lost through a computer chip. Felix (played by an unrecognizable Javier Bardeem and dons a gray suit and white shirt just like Cruise does) is furious, and has Foxx (whom he thinks is Vincent) followed by his goons. It's a chase from that point on and Cruise never seems to lose it until towards the end by reassuring himself as he screams to Foxx that he does this kind of thing for a living.This would of received a higher rating from me had they allowed Tom Cruise's character to live. Seriously. Like he gets away with it, and Max starts his limo company and there's a moral in their amorality. There is a lot of philosophy to it in regards to dreams and ambition, and points of view about death and murder. So an ending like that would be, to me, quite fitting. But it was still well-done, and you know that Jamie Foxx's character walks away from this at the end with just a little more purpose and urgency in his ambition.I can even see him playing Morgan Freeman's ""Shawshank Redemption"" quote over in his head: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying...""",Collateral
323,shamsee,It takes a Genius to make movie this BAD.,1,22 December 2004,"The Badness of this movie can not be described in the 1000 word limit imposed by IMDb so I would only describe some of the obvious blunders.How many young hot US attorneys take cabs to work? Then hand out their business card to the cab driver after a brief conversation? That is the opening seen of this movie.If you are a professional hit-man, are you going to take a Cab driver hostage and make him drive you around and kill five people in high profile case including the US attorney and then hope that JUST LIKE one previous time in nearby city, the detectives would conclude that a Cab driver with impeccable history just lost his mind? That is the PREMISE of this movie.If you want the detectives to conclude that Cab driver indeed lost his mind, are you going to sit in a restaurant with the Cab driver and with the owner of the restaurant that you are going to kill and expose yourself to all the employees of that restaurant? Do you think a detective following up on the case would ask the waitresses, whether the Cab driver was sitting alone by himself? The 'Hitman' in this movie feels he is invisible and hundreds of the people around him are not able to see him.If you are driving around town with a Dead Body in your trunk, are you going to stick with the same cab on which you threw a dead body and SMASHED its windshield? Is this the way to NOT draw attention to yourself?Right after the third Hit, Cruise comes out and kills two more people in the alley.Two people that Cruise shot in the alley who tried to rob his hostage, the Cab driver, actually started out as four people. However, even though there were loud gunshots, two of the four did not bother to check on their friends.As a matter of fact, just before that, hundreds of people were passing through alley perpendicular to where the Cab was parked, and even though they could hear the car horn, they couldn't hear the gunshots, leaving Cruise and Fox to have a nice humorous conversation in peace.The Conversation: Apparently Cabbie's Mom was raising a ruckus by calling his company, and his Boss was trying to reach him to tell him to call her at the hospital where she is at.This is the same Boss, who Cruise (Hitman) and Fox (Cab Driver) told only a few minutes earlier that ""they would shove a giant Yellow Cab up his...."" if he demands that Fox pay for the damage to the Cab. Cruise actually pretends to be a US attorney passenger and threatens to prosecute the Boss for extorting Cab driver.If your EMPLOYEE cursed you in absolutely insulting manner, are you going to convey a message from their Mom to them a few minutes later? Then RIGHT AFTER the conversation, Cruise and Fox head to the hospital to visit Fox's Mom. However, even before Cruise and Fox arrive at the hospital, the CORPSES of the 3 victims have ALREADY arrived at the SAME HOSPITAL, and the detective who is searching for them, shares an elevator with them.Congratulations to LAPD for their efficiency in cleaning up Crime Scenes!If you are a FBI agent or a LAPD detective and you have your suspect under surveillance and the CAB that you are looking for, in which you believe the assassin working for your suspect is going around and killing your witnesses, that Cab is parked at side of the building, what would you do? If you think the Cabbie is the Killer, and he meets your suspect, and you know that he is heading to next witness, what will you do? Would you try to take down the killer right at the building which you have under surveillance? Most likely.Not in this movie.Here the entire LAPD and FBI get into a caravan and head to the club where witness is supposed to be. Apparently they don't want to take out the killer at relatively empty spot on the side of the building, instead they prefer to shoot the killer in middle of a Night Club where hundreds of people are dancing. Since both sides (Cruise/Fox & FBI/LAPD) started out from same spot, they arrive at the club at same time!Finally, if you are a hit-man and you leave your hostage for dead in a car wreck, and you are about to shoot the US attorney and your former hostage shows up with a gun pointed at you, are you going to ignore him? Even if you thought the guy was a total loser, the fact that he still walked out of the same car wreck as you and got to the same place as you and has a gun pointed at you, are you still going to ignore him? Cruise does and gets shot in the face, but doesn't die.Chases the Cabbie and the US attorney in a train, and as he is about to get to them, he YELLS and warns them of his approach and thus promptly gets shot. Is this how professional killers approach ARMED victims who are anticipating them?Last Blunder: Fox kills Cruise and then he and the girl walk off the train and he immediately takes his coat off and puts it on her.This after they have been running for miles, jumping trains, crashing through glasses, and have been shot at repeatedly. How cold do you think the girl was at that point? How cold does it get in LA anyway? It takes a genius like Michael Mann to make a movie this bad.",Collateral
324,yawn-2,"What are movies for, anyway?",8,26 January 2005,"When I was younger, I had a fairly intellectual approach to the movies. French new wave, the human condition reflected through the auteur, total rejection of virtually all Hollywood films, etc. Now...well, if the two hours goes by without my attention slipping back to whatever dumb problem my life is centered on at the moment, I have to call it a good movie. This is now the bottom line, whether it's something deep or something trivial: if the writer and director can convince my brain to focus on his entirely artificial space/time for the length of the film, he's done me a HUGE favor.By that standard, ""Collateral"" is a 10/10 movie.Now...if my younger self were to see this, he'd probably point out a LOT of problems. Some reviewers actually called this ""realistic"" - clearly these are people whose concept of ""reality"" comes from seeing too many movies. The only ""realism"" in this comes from Michael Mann's obsessive interest in firearms; he is the only director I know of that always gets guns and gunplay absolutely dead on perfect, and I say this as someone who taught cops to shoot for a living.But the people and circumstances that lead to all those rounds being expended live in a total movie fantasy world, where logic is absent and lethal pressure turns ordinary guys into heroes, instead of crushing them into dust, as most often happens in the real world. This is pure escapism, stylish and gritty but in no way connected to anything that might actually happen anywhere at any time.But really - isn't that the whole point?",Collateral

Has he made a connection with Max,or does he just want to prevent attention being drawn to their activities? One wonders what would have happened had Ramone not fallen out the window at the beginning.Jamie Foxx gives a breakout performance as Max, the man in the wrong place at the wrong time, and with this role he graduates from lightweight comedies to more serious substantial productions.Jada Pinkett Smith is as beautiful and sexy as always and I'm sure there are many men very envious of Will Smith.This is a brilliant film, not to be missed.",Collateral
327,DaveDiggler,A Coyote and a Shepherd,7,11 August 2008,"Michael Mann's, ""Collateral,"" is similar in many ways to his crime classic, ""Heat."" ""Heat"" is a much better film overall because of the way Mann handles his two leads. Pacino and De Niro play the cop versus the bad guy. That's a great character study of a protagonist and an antagonist. He sets both men on opposite sides of the law and shows how similar they are and how different they are, and one wonders if their up bringing influenced their career paths. They both look and act as if they could switch places and be great at each others jobs. Mann keeps the two titans separated for the majority of the film with only two scenes shared together. ""Collateral"" brings these two guys, one good and one bad, together from the get- go. This is the driving force of the film and this is a necessity, but it also brings in several plot devices, coincidences, and moments were you might find yourself baffled by some of the reckless or stupid decisions made. Some audiences members will be tested to look past those moments for the moments of suspense, thrills and symbolism. Mann always does a great job of getting exceptional performances from multiple actors in his films and here is no different. Tom Cruise gives a nomination worthy performance. Mark Ruffalo gives the best performance of his less-than-stellar career. Javier Bardem has one scene and he hits it out of the park. Jamie Foxx is a personal favorite of Mann's, but he was miscast for this role. He was average in this role, and in order to make him look the part, they stuck some nerdy glasses on his face, and poof... he's a cab driver. Didn't quite work. He has his moments, but when he's on screen, Tom Cruise is on screen; Javier Bardem is on screen, and those two just hit their performances out of the park and he becomes a body taking up space. Cruise is excellent and surprisingly intense. Michael Mann seems to make films with great dialogue, but its the moments where he goes in close and uses extended shots of his actors eyes as they witness something powerful. Mann will set a scene in the quite or with growing background music, and let the actors emotions pour through their eyes and not a word will be said. The moment in ""Collateral"" comes when two coyotes run across the street. Vincent (Cruise) just gets done telling Max (Foxx) how his father died and how he would be beat him after he got drunk. This scene signifies Vincent's loneliness and the coyotes that travel in pairs hunt for other beings. Vincent is the coyote and he's looking for a partner to hunt to with. Since he has no one, he uses cab driver's. He attempts to connect with Max and profess his ideals on life, which changes Max' outlook on life. This is the changing moment of the film. This scene will lead to Max' change. He will then become the shepherd.Even though Mann uses plot devices and relies on coincidences, its the moments of symbolism and suspense and the thrilling nature of man hunting man that spark some moments that will make you think, or put you on the edge of your seat. Mann does an incredible job of building suspense. He does a great job of developing his characters. ""Collateral"" offers up some humor; some great acting; a great thriller, and a great lead performance. This is a flawed film and relies on things that can throw reality out of the window, which lessens Mann's direction, but his film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's an exceptional film that gets better upon repeat viewings.",Collateral
328,zacdawac,Surprisingly good film (until the pointless last twenty minutes):,6,11 June 2005,"There might be one or two spoilers on the way, so be warned.Gripping until the near end, with intelligent dialogue and engaging characters. However, for this film to end up on what has become a standard movie finale subway, trying to break the record for most broken panes of glass in a three minute period, seemed totally contrived and ridiculous.The initial dynamic between Jada and Jamie is beautifully done, as is the early character interaction between Jamie and Tom. However, once you start following the action, it's hard to forget that there was a federal prosecutor in the cab, and hard not to figure out exactly what the climax is going to be. It's also pretty hard not to surmise that Tom didn't decide to take a break in the middle of his work day because he has a compulsion to listen to jazz. When the musician sits down at the table, it's a pretty clear that he's not getting up.However, predictability and contrivances aside, the film still captures your attention, and keeps it until the last twenty minutes.Oh and the caliber of acting in Tom Cruise's death scene is unlike anything seen on celluloid since the villains fell in the Batman two reel serials from the forties, or since the Indians went down in the pre-stardom John Wayne Grad B-Westerns.

329,RandomTask-AP,This Dark Thriller Gleams,8,15 August 2004,"(trailer-level spoilers)Hitchcock was once quoted to say that he hated movie scenes in cars because they were purely transitional. You get in the car in one scene and then you get out in the next  nothing significant happens in the car. Times have changed, and car scenes have become as much a set as any school, bedroom or office. `Collateral' presents itself as a taut thriller about a terrible night when a great deal happens in a Los Angeles taxi. Under Michael Mann's strong direction, this film thrives and succeeds on the psychological claustrophobia of Hitchcock's cinematic pet peeve. A mostly unspoken opening introduces us to Vincent (a scruffy and white-haired Tom Cruise) and a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx).  As he enters LAX, Vincent bumps into another business traveler (Jason Statham) and they subtly exchange briefcases. Max does crossword puzzles as he waits for his cab to be freed up from the guy driving the day shift. We see Max dodge the pitfalls of taxi work before he picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and some potentially romantic heat smolders between them during the cross-town fare. Vincent has been doing some work of his own downtown and enters Max's cab after Annie has departed. Typical cabby-rider chatter starts between them until Vincent offers Max $600 to be his driver for the rest of the evening. Unfortunately for Max, he accepts the deal just before being presented with grizzly evidence that Vincent's real-estate persona is his cover story as a hit man for hire. Vincent is in LA for a night of 5 contract murders and now has Max (as driver, witness and unwilling accomplice) locked to his side. Vincent is experienced and ruthless, but in territory he does not know or like. Max is witty and observant, but resigned in his routines. The pair moves through the LA night and pull at each other for control as things become increasingly complicated.
The acting of `Collateral' is one of the best special effects of the summer. The unknowns of the film are all top-notch, and any lesser-known familiar faces are given star treatment on camera. Jada Pinkett Smith brings the whole world of a high-powered attorney with her in her brief time on the screen. Tom Cruise is the biggest name here, but he's not just riding a star vehicle. He's breaking type for the benefit of his experience as well as ours, and he slinks right into the shoes of his hit man. `Vincent' is scary because he is constantly considering what he does and evaluating the world round him. Cruise lets us see all of that subtly glancing here and there at `Max' and others he encounters during the night. He doesn't just kick in a door and kill for pleasure of macho fury; he does it because it's what he's good at. What humanity he has makes him all the more lethal because it keeps him unassuming. Jamie Foxx turns in a performance that has an easy sincerity to it. Once pulled into the territory of assassin's accomplice, he is struggling to first wrench himself free, and second to gain any sort of control back. Foxx's performance is one of an ordinary man with quickly elevating panic and then gradually rising desperation, and it is a struggle performed with knowing and not one stutter, hesitation or yell is out of place. (Combined with the biopic `Ray' coming this fall, it'll probably lift Foxx permanently out of the comedy stereotype and on the Hollywood top list, ala Tom Hanks's emergence in the early 1990's.) After their second visit to a night club, these two have a confrontation of words about their perceptions of each others' lives that crackles with the same fierce sincerity of the coffee shop scene between Robert DiNero's thief and Al Pacino's cop in Mann's own `Heat'. The plot is tight, and to give more detail of the deadly evening away would ruin the enjoyment of this intelligent mano-a-mano contest. Director Michael Mann is expert with crime stories, and he brings the necessary visual edge to Stuart Beattie's script. They aren't afraid to play it straight with the situations they drop their characters into. When questions come up, like the taxi dispatcher calling Max to chew him out, Vincent hops on the radio and actually helps Max win some respect on the job  in service of keeping the dispatcher out of their hair. Mann's typical skill with setting the camera is here, too. The guy clearly has a visual love affair with nightime LA. Every light by the airport gleams and the beauty of the city is captured in reflection of the underbelly of a black police helicopter. He doesn't get back to the consistent criminal perfection of `Heat', but he is making everyone put their best out there. His camera is constantly on tight close-ups, yet is not afraid of making an image deliberately grainy or dropping the majority of the picture out of focus to achieve emotional emphasis.There is a great deal to praise here. Some have criticized the climax as cliched, and there are some plot elements in the final act that are familiar. It would have been interesting to see an even more thematically-driven ending. However, the film has built so much momentum by that point that they are forgivable and thrilling because of the excellent direction and performances. It is, after all, a thriller, and it succeeds greatly where many films this year have failed.8 out of 10",Collateral
330,houndtang75,Shere Hite,1,25 April 2005,"I don't often post reviews on here but having seen the ludicrously high ratings this film has been getting I felt I had to lower the average a bit. The shame of it is that Collateral actually started quite well, for the first 45 minutes or so it was quite intriguing, with some amusingly black comic moments. Then it just went berserk, with each scene more implausible than the last. Cruise turns into an unkillable Terminator-type figure and the mild mannered cab driver fools gangsters into thinking he's a hit-man and then becomes an all-action hero. Sorry, but this was tosh. Michael Mann must be one of the most over-rated directors and Tom Cruise adds yet another blockbuster turkey to his increasingly long list - Days of Thunder, Far and Away, Minority Report, Mission Impossible I and II - has he ever actually made a decent film? Collateral certainly isn't it I'm afraid.",Collateral
331,sjwest,"Big Lights, Bright City. SPOILER",8,24 October 2004,"Neither is prolific, but the creation of a movie that will grace DVD rental stores down the years is a one of time, effort and respect. Collateral is indeed a movie that transcends the norm and epitomises the work of these two moviemakers.Besides Vincent and Max, there is a third character consciously created by Mann. This is of course the city of Los Angeles. The evidence of this is within the opening scenes where we glide gracefully above the city soaking in the vibrant life of the city as if it were a living organism. The silky ambiance has an undercurrent of a city coursing with life and an unquestionable hint of danger. Then we meet up with Max - a true part of the city. What better way to reveal the character of the city than through the eyes a taxi cab driver. It is they who see every corner of the city and meet its people from every walk of life. They are an innate part of the city, a direct tap into its lifeblood.Another scene designed for the character of the city is where Vincent and Max are drawn in by the mystical image of a wolf crossing the road in front of their cab. The danger of the city reveals itself. It is the true predator and master of its domain. Although the city does not overwhelm the lead characters, this scene shows what strength the city has and can bewilder and excite the others. This is indeed within the fabric of the story, but one cannot help but notice that Mann has put his own personal experience and impression of the city that captures his imagination.The city is further revealed when we are taken to a seedy suburb, a jazz nightclub, a discotheque and finally an upmarket apartment block. The diversity of LA is exposed and gives our characters numerous settings with different obstacles and characters. All this with a character who is the very fabric of the city  Max, and one that hates the city  Vincent. The richness and diversity of the characters thus mirroring the city. The more they interact the more we learn about the city. The character interaction between Vincent and Max is reminiscent of the characters of the 80's movie 'The Hitcher'. There is a strange connection between the two which is noticeable in the final scene where Max seems moved by Vincent's most feared death. The differences between the characters seem to lock them together on their perilous journey and which will ultimately result in the demise of one of them. The casting is not too dissimilar to the type of thing that Martin Scorsese would do. He is a master of conflicting images and messages. Here we have the two lead characters played by actors who would be synonymous with vastly different characters. Tom Cruise is usually the hero and more often than not capitalises on his looks. Vincent is, however, the villain who wears a non  descript wardrobe and is wash born grey. Completely atypical, thus a new challenge for Cruise. Jamie Fox is a natural typecast for a comedic character, but here he is a mundane, unimposing, melt into the background kind of guy. Sometimes this type of casting, especially for the main star can be a mistake. However, here it is perfect for the story as it accentuates the essence of the city which is one of beauty and danger, not all what it seems and what we know. It also commits the actors to concentrate on their acting as they are outside their comfort zone and under the microscope. Their performances as a consequence are virtually flawless. In fact, their unnatural circumstances became their natural acting circumstances. We normally expect Cruise to deliver, no matter what the character and thus the unknown factor was Max. He was even more under the spotlight and he delivered. Jamie Fox has now made his mark.The supporting cast were all good, the most noticeable of which was Jade Pinkett  Smith. She is the last target of Vincent's and her apartment block is the setting for the climatic scenes. It is her character that brings Max out of his own self  preservation instinct and drives him to take on Vincent at his own game. The frailty of Pinkett - Smith adds to the danger and gives Vincent the edge. This creates a greater obstacle for our hero this providing greater tension for the audience. High profile movies with high profile personalities always invite a wide variety of opinions. This is a natural consequence of expectation. The main problem area seemed to be the extent of exaggeration of some scenes. This is of course true. The suspension of disbelief is stretched a bit, especially in the final shoot  out scene and the fact that Vincent sticks with Max despite the obvious risk to himself. Also Vincent seems to have no fear of exposure in public as he executes his targets in full view. For me, it was not too distracting and did not adversely affect the story. After all, we do not go to the movies to see ordinary people in ordinary situations. The characters we wish to see are larger than life and transcend our normal limitations. There is a line to this, but I believe Mann flirted with this line, but did not cross it.A scene that raised the movie was the nightclub scene. Here we are mesmerised by a series of fleeting images of wild gunfire and multiple targets and villains. We have the cops, the target and the gang out to nail Vincent if the job turned sour. In between all this is the crowded and the swirling lights, glass and smoke. It created a chaotic, sporadic scene where the outcome for the lead characters seemed to be out of bounds. The pace was raised and the stakes were higher. Our characters were now riding a crest and never faltered from here.When Max first meets Vincent, he openly proclaims his dislike for the city and particularly notes the apathy and the loss of identity within its walls. He had heard a story where someone died on a train and was not noticed for several blocks. In the end Vincent dies alone on the train as it carries on along its route. The villain had met with a worthy end. It was the death he most feared in the city he most hated.Not intended to be one of the blockbusters of the year, it is nevertheless one of the strongest movies of the year. There is obvious attention to detail here, particularly with the casting and the scenic views of the city. The audience is suitably drawn into the world of LA with superb acting and artful directing. Mann does not get carried away with the portrayal of the city and blends it in with the characters providing a tense background for the action. It is deservedly highly rated and should leave the audience feeling that were entertained.",Collateral

Perfectly believable as a crime flick and even better as a character study this film entertains in many different ways. Worth a look or two.Tom Cruise (TOP GUN) is pitch perfect as an over the top assassin but the real spotlight shines on Jamie Foxx (ANY GIVEN Sunday) who not only steals the movie but carves deeper the notch in his acting belt showing his talent as a believable everyday guy. While a lot of the film is emotionally driven and the action in this film is limited but rapid fire and brutal, I really enjoyed the pacing and never once felt a moment when the movie slowed or stalled out. It had perpetual motion until the last moments.

336,billyfish,"In a world of billions, who really cares? Good point.",4,20 October 2005,"Tom Cruise as the soulless professional killer asks who cares if any particular person dies -- one might ask the same question about this story. I'll admit that for a slam-bang action movie it was shot well and the physical effects did not defy the laws of physics as Hollywood is so fond of doing. Of course, the story line defies all laws of probability, and as such is so typically Hollywood that you could set your watch to the ending if you're appropriately cynical (as I became, eventually).When Cruise tells cabbie Foxx to pull around the back of the building to the alley, of course the body that ""accidentally"" hurtles out of the window exactly above where the cab is parked lands smack dab on the cab. Compared to the rest of the story, this colossal coincidence seems perfectly routine, if not expected. Never mind that the meek and mild-mannered cab driver masquerades successfully as a professional killer to a gang of killers, a cop who is looking for him ends up in the same elevator with him later on, and lo and behold, Cruise's final victim ends up being a pretty lawyer whom Foxx had ferried across town just hours before (and also never mind that the beautiful and driven lawyer gives a disheveled Foxx her card and tells him to call her). All of this crap could only happen in a Hollywood movie. I was embarrassed for the writers, but they not only are unashamed, but proud of this kind of garbage! If you want to lose yourself in an action movie that has less intelligent conversation or story development than a Spongebob episode, watch on!

338,donlhumphries,How not to be a hit-man,5,19 October 2004,"About all this film has going for it, is the cinematography. The story is confusing and open ended; the dialogue mumbled; but who cares anyway. At one early stage, it seemed we were going to have a black comedy about a bumbling serial killer who had problem disposing of his corpses, but that opportunity was lost.The basic flaw in the whole saga is: no experienced contract killer (six years in the job?) would think of using a taxi to do his work; or, certainly not the same taxi, much less chat to the driver. He wouldn't leave incriminating evidence on the back seat, nor have the vehicle parked directly outside the crime scene.As to who the killer, Vincent, is killing and why, is not explained. It seems he might be hired by one gang to bump off key figures in another. The cops come into the picture, yet fade out again. They are virtually irrelevant to the supposed ""bonding"" between killer Vince, and taxi-driver, Max, which seems to be the main theme.Still, professional critics will rave over this movie, and it will go on to win awards, and make a fortune. Tom Cruise sits stony-faced in the back of the cab most of the time; reminding us of Val Kilmer in Spartan, and Matt Damon in The Bourne Supremacy - the ruthless operative, hired to do a job, who gets on with it.Yes, this is the way to make a successful movie. Let everyone think it's highly sophisticated; the critics are only too willing to climb on the bandwagon (just as they did in panning Catwoman). All you need is: a couple of good actors, some extras, a few expendable vehicles, and a city. Bang, bang, you're dead, does the rest. 5/10",Collateral
339,Brawl_666,Dazzling....,8,24 October 2007,"Tom Cruise used to be so cool, even despite his overt narcissism. I think the last good role he did was in 'A Few Good Men'. Its been a downhill ride ever since, and it took Michael Mann to get a somewhat credible performance out of the guy. This film portrays Cruise as a ruthless , nihilistic and ultra-violent sociopath (wonder if Nicole Kidman wrote the script) who spews bullets and philosophy with equal ease. Cruise does somehow manages to ditch behind his usual confidence-lacking arrogance. In fact , he doesn't look OR feel like the annoying superstar we've known for years. There are moments where a chill will run down the spine of even the most jaded viewer. The assassin Vincent with his icy composure, forward momentum and cold, understated humor is one of the most genuinely frightening screen fiends we've seen in years, and even more astonishing is Cruise who inhabits the role with seeming ease. Vincent the assassin represents the end product of several ages of psychological evolution : the script presents him as an almost cyborg-like killer who does what he feels is necessary, seemingly without emotion, but we also see that Vincent is obviously highly self-motivated. He is in perfect control of his senses and intellect, he keeps his own counsel, and he is perfectly aware of how his ugly past has molded his present state of mind. In short, this is not a serial killer or an adrenaline junkie out for thrills ; such people are propelled mainly by an inner emptiness and a lack of awareness of their own motives. Whereas Vincent is highly self-aware and psychologically astute, and he is no stranger to the ambiguities of life. He is a career criminal, just like Neil McCauley (De Niro) in Heat. He does what he does because it is all he knows how to do, and because it pays well. He is a murderer for hire.I don't know what made Mann choose the Thomson Viper digital camera for this film, but it simply works wonders. Because digital cameras are currently better suited for low lighting, there is not much artificial lighting, since the whole thing takes place at night. And the result is that for two hours, you are transported away, not to movieland, but to the sprawling urban landscapes of LA. This is distinctly NOT the LA of Heat - a dusty oil canvas - but a nocturnal, otherworldly LA where there are seemingly no bounds between mind and reality. The city seems to reflect the characters' minds, and the characters themselves portray a city on the brink of unconscious chaos. Violence lurking behind every false facade. No other film that I've seen seems to be so real AND dreamlike both at once.Michael Mann's greatest talent is precisely as a PHOTOGRAPHER. This film doesn't have a realistic story (for one thing, Mann makes Cruise seem a lot smarter than he actually is), but he shoots it so well that it creates a believable illusion of reality. Collateral is not a film whose brilliance you notice on a first, or perhaps even a second viewing. Its not jammed with wall-to-wall action. It doesn't have frenzied camera movements or gimmicky '24'-style editing to compensate for a clueless screenplay. And to tell the truth completely, Collateral lacks even a competent story. But what Michael Mann has always been great at is conveying the FEELING, the sensation of being right there, of knowing those people in front of you. You will instantly recognize the characters played by Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith. You see a window open into the lives of these individuals.",Collateral

Unfortunately, Michael Mann's style is so distinctive that it's virtually impossible to avoid comparing the movie to Heat, which was clearly the better of the two.One of the film's best aspects is Mann's sweeping use of Los Angeles as his canvas, as it was in Heat. And the action is almost as good as the action in the earlier LA thriller.The acting was pretty good. Cruise, Foxx and Pinkett turned out decent performances, but how can they possibly compare to DeNiro, Pacino and Portman? The film's main weak point were the characters. They simply weren't as intense or as believable as those in Heat. Vincent was a pretty well-conceived character. Max wasn't. Max's sudden transformations from chilled-out playa to fretting bystander to steely stand-in for a hit man just didn't seem believable. That's the fault of the directors or writers, not of Foxx. In any one moment, he seemed more or less in character. But how in the world did he suddenly strap on the cochones during the sit-down with Felix? C'mon! Fanning really could've benefited from a lot more development. Since Max's heroism seemed to come out of nowhere, it would've been nice to see at least one hero-villain dynamic with some more complexity. For all of Fanning's pouting to his police partners, he didn't make any sort of headway with them. And for all his running around, he didn't do much to bring down Vincent. Mann should've either developed Fanning or left him out altogether.And then there were several small details that irked me. When did Max's sub sandwich suddenly disappear from the front seat so Vincent could sit down there without getting it all over the seat of his pants? And what the heck was going on when Vincent died?

The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror. People and places he's long since forgotten, until tonight. He picks up a man asking him to take him from spot to spot all night, offering him a large sum of money. The man's name is Vincent.Vincent is a contract killer. When an offshore nacre-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived, and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. Through the night, Vincent forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined.In ""Collateral"", Tom Cruise gives his most daring, taut and quite simply put, his greatest performance yet. Playing hit man Vincent, this is the first time Cruise has been a legit bad guy. (Well, maybe Interview With The Vampire). A truly think he should give more performances as a bad guy much more often.Jamie Foxx plays cab driver Max, not having the greatest life. Heck, his favorite vacation spot is a picture of an island. Foxx also gives his greatest role yet. I don't think I'll get much of an argument there. I get the feeling one of these two will get a big award or something because of this movie.Micheal Mann shows us once again that he is the man. This is his best film to date, other than ""Heat"". I get the feeling I'm watching Heat when I saw Collateral. And I get the feeling I'm watching Collateral when I'm watching Heat.

With some parts being very very suspense, and other parts being done right hilarious. Not in a comedy sort of way, if you know what I mean. There are also a lot of unexpected twists in the movie. In some films twist can be a bad thing, but in Collateral.Seriously I believe the Academy Awards will recognize Collateral in some sort of way. Well if they are smart they will.

Spike Lee talks on the Bamboozled DVD about using comic (black) actors in dramatic roles because he believes they're capable of more (and probably because he hopes to redeem the buffoonish portrayal of blacks in film) and he was right; he just had the wrong guy.Wayans never managed to rise above the level of preprogrammed comic persona, whereas Foxx, despite my initial skepticism on the first viewing, does a fantastic job at slowly progressing his character through a sometimes-ludicrous series of transformations and epiphanies, mostly revolving around how he both reacts against and is molded by Tom Cruise's villain character (and Cruise-as-villain seems rather prescient now that people have turned against him; today, Foxx might well have gotten the top-billing he deserved).I've read criticisms about the plot in spite of the style, but honestly, I'm not bothered by any of it, not even the ending that I've seen criticized the most frequently. What I love about this movie is that it's a mainstream film that beats most art films at their own game. It doesn't actually have to be so polarized. Imagine that.",Collateral
351,jhall_moviereviews,Manns best movie imo. An absolute classic.,10,26 March 2021,The best preformces from Cruise and Fox they absolutely killed thier roles. Direction by the man himself Micheal Mann is nothing short of epic. This movie also has a very high rate of rewatchability as I seen it when it first came out and loved it as much as I watched it again today for free on IMDb TV. Highly recommend you check this film out if you haven't yet it's an absolute classic action thriller!!! They don't make them like this anymore.,Collateral
352,mikeburdick,"The lights are on, but nobody's home",5,5 August 2021,"I'm so glad subscription TV came along to give Hollywood a well-deserved kick in the arse. 'Collateral' is a product of an era when the film industry was in its death throes, cynically pumping out lame comic superhero flicks and burning tens of millions on big-name superstars in a futile attempt to get butts in seats.'Collateral' is all together par for the course, but if we're being honest, beyond the slick cinematography you'd expect from Michael Mann and a surprising performance from Jamie Foxx, there's not much going on upstairs in this film.The characters are unconvincing and unsympathetic, with backstories meant to generate sympathy, but actually make you like them less. The plot is so full of holes, one after the other, including the main premise, it's like a block of Swiss cheese you could drive a cab through. The dialogue is fraudulent and often sounds like the writer is aping Tarantino, with detailed rambling stories that seem out of place in the situation.At the end of the day, it's yet another script trying desperately to put a unique twist on the Hollywood action film without ever once considering telling a real human story, beyond checking off the 'hero's journey' plot points they learned in class. Ultimately, an utterly banal and nihilistic exercise.",Collateral
353,aigoalies,A typical crime movie,7,8 October 2020,This movie is the typical crime movie: bad guy who thinks he's cool and life is going well gets on a path of crime where he makes mistakes and goes down a rabbit hole of more crime until he ends up losing in the end. The acting is good and the story is thrilling but at no point did it stand out above other crime movies. 7/10,Collateral
354,Im-SoRRy-ITS-TakEN,It started off good but ended up just being OK.,5,18 June 2021,"When i first started ""Collateral"", there seemed to be something special about it, while the plot is simple, the characters made up for it. Judging from the beginning scene, i would not of minded if this had been a romance / comedy film, the way they showed the interactions and portrayed characters intelligently, felt real. While also adding in some nice comedy - After watching a murder, it took a toll on the main and actually messed with his train of thought, it didn't just wear off immediately but kept haunting him throughout the film.A few things i found to be over-dramatic. At the club during the shooting, the civilians seem to be legit just running in circles around the club, screaming the entire time. In actuality the place would have been cleared pretty quick and not have stayed packed for the whole shootout, there was not many gunshots so the screaming would have been minimal and not sound like they are the ones getting murdered. It's also funny how they were flashing their guns the whole time, even took someone hostage as he moved through the crowd and nobody seems to care, yet on shot later and everyone is screaming like little girls while running in circles.I found the last forty-five minutes of the film to be lacking. The ending seemed random and forced, it basically went like this - A pointless reckless suicidal move that lead to fighting a professional hit-man, where he somehow ends up winning, only to get the girl they showed for five minutes during the prelude. I feel this ending could have been made into something unique based on how the film went previously, instead we got this.My rating gradually decreased as the film went on but it was still an enjoyable watch, the ending is was a real letdown.",Collateral
355,vicdragon19-1,dazzling and mesmerizing....,10,14 May 2007,"I knew this film had tom cruise as a bad guy - kind of like a weird idea, but everyone, in particular cruise, gives startling performances. Collateral takes one ordinary night for a taxi man (Foxx), who leads a pretty dull life full of unconfidence, into one that defines life and all expectations beyond human instincts. Cruise, who plays a confident, emotionless hit-man, takes Max (Foxx)hostage in order to make five stops to kill witnesses in an upcoming trial. BOth characters get an insight into their 'opposites', and how they both function in this strange, crazy unpredictable world.Collateral, also poses some great scenery, with the city shown at night, when darkness takes over and nothing is what it seems. Both the characters of Vincent and Max are very likable characters in a sense, even though Vincent is a villain, you feel sorry for his upbringing and inability to connect emotionally. When Max confronts him about this in one of their philosophical convos, Vincnet replies 'of all the taxi cab drivers, I had to have Dr something.' or something like that.The atmosphere you get from the film is a feeling of anticipation and excitement, as you see these characters develop in a bad situation. Max ultimately becomes the man he has aimed to be because of Vincent, leading him to change his perspective.The only flaw in the film is that Max's life has been ruined by Vincent. He's exposure to crime syndicates and underworld leaders, in my opinion, will lead to his life being on the run. Even when he manages to rescue one of Vincent's potential victims, whom he met at the start of the film - Annie, their lives will be in fear and phonological trauma. I don't know about other viewers, but I really wanted to know what happened after the film's ending - what did they do? where did they go? did they stay together? these questions are up to the imagination of the viewer.A breathtaking film, which is strengthened by very powerful performances, and a realistic look of the film, capturing those moments that seem rare to all of us but could happen to anyone, at anytime.",Collateral

I must confess I have a soft spot for film noir type of movies, and although I hesitate to name this movie a film noir, I think it has much of that in it.We have a sort of a femme fatale (Annie), a cynical dark mood, with accompanying tag lines, the cast are basically losers (Vincent and Max)more or less fighting for survival. A slow decline of moral. It is all in here.At some moments the movie is amazing silent. The action takes places from evening to dawn with some of the evening/night/morning silences actually played out.

358,alexdelliott,Intelligent drama and Cruise's best film,9,23 April 2013,"Having seen this film about 6 times and holding it in my top 10 films of all time, I was so surprised to learn that not many people have seen this film. Most people love 'Heat' whereas 'Collateral', a film with the same director in the same style, went by rather unnoticed. So I'm just going to say watch this film as it has something there for most film lovers.You shouldn't go into it with too many details, just that Tom Cruise breaks his usual role and plays a cold, calculating killer named Vincent who happens to step into a cab of a pathetic yet optimistic, kind hearted driver named Max (Jamie Foxx). The film shows the events of one night as our two completely opposite characters are thrown together by chance. I won't say more for fear of spoilers but the story is fantastic right up until the ending which did become a little predictable though it was carried out very well.For those that like slow moving character dramas, this film has plenty of that with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Tom Cruise is a great actor but he is excellent in his role as Vincent, playing such a cool character and really making me feel like that is who he actually is. He should do similar roles more often rather than always playing the hero. Jamie Foxx shows some of the best character development in film and his role here put him on the map for me. For those who love action films there is certainly some very well directed action from the man who brought us that spectacular heist scene in 'Heat'. It isn't on such a huge scale as 'Heat' but it isn't meant to be either. This is a slow moving character film but the action sequences will not disappoint action fans, most notably the chaotic club scene which was carried out so well.I'll say again that this film is so good that I am so disappointed that so few people have actually seen it. If you're a fan of 'Heat', or suspense films, or character driven dramas then see this film and I hope you enjoy every moment of it.",Collateral
359,cribyn44,An Incoherent Mess,1,19 March 2007,"I am quite taken aback by the number of ""rave"" comments on this film that have been posted on IMDb.Admittedly only having seen it on television, my opinions on the film would have been even worse had I paid good money to see it in a cinema. I found the whole enterprise an incoherent and empty - and flashy, i.e. typical Michael Mann - mess, compounded by the extreme difficulty of desperately trying to understand what all the characters were actually speaking, let alone trying to make heads or tails of any supposed but lacking clear story-line.The whole point of literature, the cinema, the theatre, is to tell a story in a comprehensible manner. That usually means providing the reader/viewer with an account or a drama that has a beginning, a middle, and an end so that they may be provided with a clear understanding of what the account/drama/story is all about.This film failed, miserably, in that basic element. Not once could the viewer obtain the least degree of understanding of what the real ""story"" was supposed to be about. Periodically, the name ""Felix"" was bandied about, and at the end you just about hear it in connection with the lady attorney and the case she was prosecuting. But then, what? Was any of that made clear at the beginning of the film, and indeed the connection between ""Felix"" and the detective who investigated the death of ""Ramon""? Certainly not, which meant that throughout the viewer had to guess what was going on, a task made worse by the incomprehensibility of the soundtrack dialogue, a too depressing and common feature of much of modern-day American cinema.Given all this, the viewer is left with the impression that the director's real purpose - rather than to tell a comprehensible story - was simply to present a series of flashy images as though he was shooting a television commercial.And as to Jamie Foxx actually being nominated for an Oscar - what a joke! I thought his performance throughout was embarrassing in the extreme - amateurish and bad.A poor show all round.",Collateral

362,beatnick49,A good urban thriller,9,4 February 2005,"This movie works on many levels, with it's production and cast, resulting in a darn good movie.I saw this movie with a friend and acquaintance in the city. Before hand we had dinner in a kebab fast food store. It was a dark night, patrons came and went, stayed when we left etc. The view from the store was of the cinema, video game arcades, and other fast food stores, various city inhabitants, and various traffic (including annoying car life) It reminded me of a uni course I'd done, and look back on fondly.It was quite appropriate, considering this movie. It is a brilliant urban thriller. Tom Cruise plays Vincent with calm, cool, and coldness, and he does it well. He's also very convincing with grey hair. Jamie Foxx plays Max, from mild mannered, to fearful, to resorting to basic survival instinct, convincingly. Both their performances are good and Foxx has certainly earned, and is deserving of, his starring role in ""Ray"" in my view.The camera work is good, and the style is effective,getting up close with the events in the cab. And the feel of urbania is good, with the camera work, and surroundings, the lights, buildings, and traffic. The storyline flows well (nothing too complicated), and coupled with the camera, and the feel for urbania and cast. It is a-political, and fun in the thriller and visual treat sense. The emphasis is not on the violence but on the thrills, ""what happens next?"" is the question. This movie certainly had me engaged, I didn't realise how long it went for, and for that matter I didn't really care, I loved every minute of it. It actually made me think of my uni course. Urbania is unpredictable and will throw all sorts at you can be your best friend and give you wealth and fun, or it can be an enemy and give you danger. I would't say this is a social commentary on city life, but it certainly thrust me into the midst of urbania's personality. I guess all urban inhabitants are warriors, we put up with a lot with the aim of achieving and maintaining, whatever it is we're looking for.This is $11 and about two hours well spent, and a nine out of ten well earned.

To me, the pacing of this movie was fantastic and some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed. I'm thinking here of the action-packed scene in the nightclub full of people. You've got to give the character of Vincent one thing: He was tenacious and committed to giving his employer full value for his dollar.Jamie Foxx as the cabbie was fun to watch, and the character, Max, was definitely enterprising.

Insummation, this was a good tale of two very different people having to put up with each other, even when guns are drawn. Jada Pinkett Smith tied the movie together, and also played the role well.

We relate to Jamie Foxx's character Max, he's just an everyday American keeping his nose out of trouble with a 9 to 5 job, a jerk of a boss and aspirations that he still has dreams of but ultimately take a backseat when real life comes knocking. Cruise is introduced as a professional, calculated hit-man and as soon as he is introduced into the story we take a turn into a high stakes, thrilling plot that follows Tom Cruise - playing Vincent and Max through the mesmerizing Los Angeles setting as Vincent forces Max to escort him to his next handful of hits.Eventually, Mark Ruffalo is welcomed into the story as Detective Fanning, which works exquisitely as a supporting character as he portrays a wise, level headed detective who drives the story forward with smart, intuitive actions and believable, and compelling character motivations.Overall, Collateral works as a riveting, action thriller and there is very little negative things to say about the story as a whole.

368,fha-2,"A summertime implausible action film with wit, brains, style, and character.",8,8 August 2004,"In this half crime thriller and half surprisingly comical buddy pix, Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" smashes full-bore through LA in one night of murder and mayhem.  Tom Cruise stars as Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who picks Jamie Foxx s cab as his vehicle for the night to slaughter five would-be witnesses scheduled to testify in an upcoming Drug King Pin's trial.  The highly talented Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans) brings to the screen one tight-fisted, yet highly implausible crime thriller that delivers generous doses of high-end action amidst compelling character moments.  Foxx plays an aimless, yet intelligent and kind-hearted, young cab driver named Max.  Max becomes increasingly anxious as the bodies begin piling up, while the police are just beginning to pick up the crime's scent.Plot wise, the story is highly unlikely and implausible, yet Mann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie manage to elevate the material beyond simplistic gimmickry.  Vincent promises Max 700 dollars to be his wheelman while he dispatches his victims one-by-one.  It does not take a genius to figure out that Max is most likely doomed once Vincent's dirty little mission is accomplished.  This is the backbone of the tension and terror that runs throughout the film.  Although it has a formulaic finale involving a lot of running through deserted office buildings and streets, a subway train, and some really bad shooting of a supposed expert hitman.Mechanically, the film seems to have been shot mostly on digital video, yet maintaining a starkly striking style.  Collateral is fascinating to watch, notwithstanding the killings and far-fetched gunplay.  Cruise seems to be really relishing his Bad Guy role that you cannot seem to resist watching his every move.  He is quietly evil, yet he is infinitely fascinating and peculiarly likable.  Collateral is not exactly profound or even a novel crime story.  However, it is remarkably satisfying and thrilling.It is great to see an action fantasy so mature and refined during this summer's goofy spectacles and mindless dramas.  This is a fun and good-looking movie, with a strangely haunting and original concept.  It has the cast to pull it off and a talented director doing his part to carry the theme to an electrifying new level.",Collateral
369,lockwood-10,A different role for Tom Cruise,9,7 August 2006,"I felt that this movie was a much better movie putting Mr.Cruise in the villains role for a change. This is an intense psychological thriller plotting good against evil. I feel one of the issues which never arose throughout the entire movie was the race factor. Never was this mentioned as this movie pits two minds against one another. I feel Mr. Mann did a good job with his looks (gray hair/cold indifferent attitude) matching that of Los Angeles with it's anything goes attitude. Jaime Foxx shines as a man who must finally come to terms with stopping this evil going on around him. So, in a sense, the factor of morals surfaces and it draws to a definitive resolution. I feel Mr Cruise does profess some feelings all of us share but crosses the boundaries with methodical 'task completion' indicating his character's prior service (military) training. My son (Nathan Connor) enjoyed this but wondered at a couple of the flaws but found the movie overall action filled to watch. I will just say to watch it and enjoy.",Collateral
370,Sneaky_Pete_XXVII,"#1 Summer flick of '04, perhaps even #1 film of '04",8,17 August 2004,"Rarely do I make any comments on here anymore, but this is one movie I MUST comment about...  ""Collateral"" is such a good film, and for a number of different reasons. This is one of the few movies of the turn of the century where I can truly say that absolutely everything is perfect (perfect is a good term that I fail to OFTEN).   Take the acting for example. I've always wondered about Tom Cruise. I thought that he was a mild actor (post-""Collateral""). I thought that he had HUGE talent, but failed to show it in his movies, and therefore he could do more with his characters. But ""Collateral"" (with the exception of ""Jerry Maguire""), has got to be THE best acting I've seen from Tom Cruise. Sure, ""Minority Report"" and ""The Last Samurai"" were descent, but the talent hasn't come through until now. And this doesn't apply to only to Tom Cruise...Jada Pinkett Smith and Jamie Foxx, make a remarkable performance. And personally, I think that Foxx is the one that steals this show. This, like Cruise, IS his best performance to date.  Another thing that caught my eye was the cinematography. I thought I read in ""American Cinematographer"", or somewhere else that Michael Mann decided to use High Definition for this film. Perhaps, I'm jaded; but I think I could tell the difference, and I seemed to like it. Plus, I noticed quite a lot of close-ups...Interesting, yet effective.  I've always been a big fan of scores; and ""Collateral"" doesn't fail to bring a great sound to this film. Esspecially how they brought back Elliot Goldenthal's theme from ""Heat"" after hit #3.  And finally the direction...Perhaps I'm bias because I seem to enjoy his previous work; but in my mind, Michael Mann can't seem to fail. His direction is supreme, and it brings a fresh style to the table. I think as Mann continues to do more and more films, people are starting to get an understanding of what a ""Mann"" style film. Much like the unique style's of directors like Burton, Tarantino, and Gilliam-Mann is coming to his peak in which his style, talent, and capability will give birth to a legacy that will live on throughout film history.   And to confirm that that will happen, ""Collateral"" is projected proof.",Collateral

372,superscal23,Excellent for a Big Studio Film,9,23 December 2004,"Most big budget ""thrillers"" with a big name director and big name stars are very average movies. The number of two and a half star movies I've seen in the last few years is remarkable. Collateral is much better than that, but it's still not without flaws.The movie starts out with Jamie Foxx as Max. He appears to be a hard working, blue collar nice guy who takes his job as a cab driver seriously. We learn early on that he knows exactly how many minutes it will take to get from one location to the next. 7 minutes? he is asked...not 8, not 6? When he's right, Max says he just got lucky and made the lights.His first passenger is Jada Pinkett Smith in her least annoying role to date. They hit it off, making a bet over the best way to get across town. Over the 17 minute drive, we learn that Max has a dream of owning a limo company for the stars, while Annie (Smith) is a high powered lawyer who admits that she still gets nervous before a big case. She gets out of the cab and provides her business card, not knowing that it will save her life.Max picks up his next passenger, Vincent played by Tom Cruise. If you saw the trailer, or if you can see Cruise's hair, you know that he is the bad guy. He offers Max $600 to take him around to five different locations because he has work to do at all five. $600 seems like a small amount for a man of Vincent's stature, but I guess it's good enough for an L.A. cabbie.It turns out that Vincent is a contracted killer whose job for the night is to kill five people. Who they are has little bearing on the movie. This would have been a great reveal had it not been spoiled by the trailers. Anyway, Cruise's first kill goes awry and Max is forced into being part of the action. Instead of just driving Vincent to each location without knowing his business, Max must find a way to keep himself, and others, alive.Collateral garnered a lot of critical acclaim because it supposedly had meaningful dialogue to complement the action. For once, the critics were right. Vincent and Max converse over the meaning of life, the meaning of killing, and general rights and wrongs in society. We learn that Max has been driving the cab for 12 years, even though he tells everyone, including his mom, that the job is temporary. We learn that Vincent is not your typical killer who is just out to do the job. He's conflicted about his role in society, about what society is, and he wonders if anybody will miss him when he's gone.The movie runs into problems when it realizes that this story has to lead somewhere. The first hour is brilliant as we meet the characters, learn who they are, and we get some great cinematography of L.A. However, once Max tries to get away and throws all of Vincent's material onto the freeway, the movie started to lose me. It seems that Vincent would have had a more negative reaction if Max wasn't the lead character in the movie. I also didn't like the fact that the ""feds"" get involved and we have the stereotypical clashes between local cops and feds.Then of course, Vincent, the feds, and the LAPD all show up at the same location at the same time. Guns blaze, and about 20 people are murdered in a 2 minute span. I didn't think this scene in the club really fit with the rest of the film. It's like the filmmakers were told there wasn't enough gunplay, and they made this scene bigger and better to have more violence and bloodshed.The climax of the movie occurs strangely, as the two leads walk away from a high speed car accident unharmed, but the film recovers for the final showdown. It turns out that Annie is the fifth victim, and the reasoning for this is not as far fetched as it may appear. So, it's up to Max to save the day. The ending is well played and tries to make a grand statement. I bought it, but I can see how people could have trouble with it.Collateral is filled with plot holes and unanswered questions. However, the performances of Cruise, Foxx, and Smith are wonderful.

Though it may not have been worthy of 2 Oscar nominations, it was entertaining and painted a dark picture of L.A. Tom cruise has improved so much as an actor that he can play seemingly any character nowadyays. Bravo, Mr. Cruise! Also, Jamie foxx has established himself as a very good actor as well and he plays the ambitious cab driver thrust into a difficult situation quite well. Cruise portrays the hit-man perfect, and there are some generally touching scenes throughout this movie. The thing about Collateral that stops it from being a great movie is the character build over the plot. In great movies, these 2 are equally divided and told in a brilliant way. Also, this movie would have been much better with a film-noir or independent feel to it, instead of just trying the ordinary built on acting. Overall though, this is a good flick and has some good things going for it. 7/10",Collateral

375,Deveousdevil,Absolute stunning piece of work.,10,3 September 2008,"This movie, in short is excellent if not perfect. It's been a while since Hollywood has brought out an exciting thriller/suspense/crime drama. Most movies are either all blood and unrealistic action, or have boring nonsensical plots. This movie had everything. Interesting, debatable dialog that on and off would make you agree and disagree with both the harsh views and the more ideal views. Although the acting is generally good (Foxx surprisingly didn't suck and was actually rather enjoyable) it was Cruise who made this movie. He is truly incredible here. He has so many good facial expressions, angry reactions, depressed reactions, everything, all in this one character. Although this is of course aided by a fantastic script and story, Cruise truly gave life to the script. Not one unnecessary sentence or even word is said throughout the movie. Everything has some meaning at the point it is said. The dialog is interesting, realistic, and more importantly appealing to listen to. Some scenes you won't even think about the firefights or action scenes coming up because you'll be so absorbed in the dialog.The action scenes in this movie are also, very good. They are really suspenseful and constantly leave you guessing as to what next and how it will happen. This movie is similar to ""Inside Man"" (another classic) in terms of dialog and action. Both parts are interesting. Personally I enjoyed every minute of this movie and did not want to stop watching for a moment. It is intense, cool, smart, and has very purposeful dialog. Highly recommended to anyone who has taste in movies.",Collateral

It is wonderful to watch a character stay flawless throughout an entire film and not be OTT with Hollywood FX etc. The dialogue between Vincent and Max is brilliant and the tug of hate they exchange brings out some chilling truths.I love the way this movie has been filmed. It almost shows you the dark side of LA as well as the dark side of life.The soundtrack cruises through the film beautifully. It is well timed at crucial scenes and when the film is done, you just want to buy the soundtrack to listen to.Everyone that I have recommended this film to have been well pleased.

Good action movies place the viewer in a seemingly real-word scenario to which they can relate a bit more convincingly and can even make us feel all too interconnected and even paranoid. I'm thinking of the recent films that use the oft-used formula, albeit a somewhat tiring one, of espionage in the modern area, some of which (Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation) do a better job than others (Jason Bourne).Then there are the rare action thrillers that place us in a setting we recognize, yet make us feel so very alone and trivial as human beings. Collateral fits this description. Tom Cruise, who plays the nihilistically charming hit-man Vincent, and Jamie Foxx, who plays the pathetically jaded cab driver Max, both knock their performances out of the park.Mark Ruffalo makes an appearance as a trustworthy LA beat detective, only to show you where those qualities lead you and reinforces how meaningless and random life can be. Paradoxically, by the end, Max's character does a 180 and challenges Vince's proposition of people being merely ""lost in space,"" that even if we don't know ""the guy in the trunk,"" sometimes growth can develop from even the deaths of seemingly corrupt individuals, or society as a whole.With an excellent soundtrack to boot, any action movie buff would be happy to be resigned to mere collateral for a couple of hours, if only to see that this film is one of the most unique in the increasingly insignificant pantheon of films within the genre. 4 out of 4 stars.",Collateral

This movie is so close to being one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen so far. Everything about this movie is great like the acting, directing, story, writing, and the dialogue between these men. One thing that I did not like about this movie is the ending. The ending just didn't feel right because there were some holes that needed to filled and your just begging for more. This movie made a turning point in Tom Cruises career which made him a great actor. Also this proved that Jamie Foxx can play any role you give him.

The same goes for Tom Cruise who once again gets snubbed and overshadowed by Jamie Foxx, who did earn some well deserved marks as well.""Collateral"" revolves around an ambitious and insightful everyday taxi driver (Foxx) who's life is held at bay my a professional killer (Cruise) in order to help Cruise complete his missions. The movie contains nothing but pure acting, directing, screen writing and most of all, intensity, making this an enjoyable and worthwhile movie. The most interesting part of the film is seeing the strange relationship between Cruise's character and Foxx's, as they parade about LA in the middle of the night ""taking care of business."" Cruise's character is a professional assassin that doesn't think twice about whacking anybody regardless of personality, but yet is still bound my everyday and outdated morals. Which explains his respect for Foxx's character, who displays a deep regard for life and the people around him, constructing a well balanced plot filled with irony. In fact, Cruise lets Foxx get away with snide remarks and disobedience which he has ended lives for less, and protects him from outside dangers yet Foxx's life is technically dispensable.Foxx's performance is amazing (earning him ANOTHER nomination for an Oscar) as he finds the right niche to play this stressed out cab-by, but still manages to remain in control of everything. Unfortunately for Tom Cruise, he's too good looking or too Blockbuster I guess to get any sort of satisfaction any run The Academy (again.) He even went to great lengths of dyeing his hair gray, to hide his image that often graces the cover of GQ. His acting was dead on, with no signs of over-acting which is more than often displayed in over-powering villain roles.This is a great film, which contains some great dialog and a pretty original plot. The acting is superb, with Jada Pinkett-Smith filling in the holes with her limited but quality spots. For some reason, Cruise and the film itself were hardly recognized.

I can't see how anyone could really like this movie. It doesn't leave you with anything but a bunch of loose ends and unfulfilled dreams. Highly NOT recommended. Not even a good rental.

382,XFLRWF,`Collateral' made back with interest,8,7 August 2004,"Philosophical yet cold like an assassin's bullet is the stimulating combination that comprises Michael Mann's latest film, `Collateral'.  The movie is not merely a shootem up thriller but is also provocative in its endeavor to define the value of humanity.  The thought-provoking screenplay is combined with brilliant camera direction and a gifted cast.  These collective talents draw in the audience to allow them to experience every sense and emotion from the characters.  `Collateral' is not only entertaining eye-candy but also presents audiences with a new perspective on the value of human life.For 12 long years, Max (Jamie Foxx) has been driving taxis all over Los Angeles.  During those 12 years, Max dreams of a new life where he runs his own exciting limousine company with a high list clientele.  His dream is interrupted after picking up his newest customer: a hitman named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who has his own terms on the value of human life.  Vincent forces Max to take him to his targets for evening or else lose his own life in the process.  Caught in a no-win situation, Max must decide which is more valuable: his life or the lives Vincent will cancel out?
Michael Mann's direction does not miss a beat in drawing in the audience to Max's dilemma and is key to bringing about Vincent's ideology.  Mann skillfully captures Max's fear and desperation to save the targets from Vincent that the audience almost feels they are in each setting.  The audience can clearly see each expression and each shot fired.  They will feel the coldness that emits from Vincent and the fear of each victim. Mann's citywide shots of Los Angeles also put into perspective Vincent's view on humanity: in a city with such an immense population, would anyone really miss a five people?Stuart Beattie pens a screenplay that is humorous and thought provoking. Despite being characters from different spectrums, the `Pirates of the Caribbean' co-writer creates great chemistry with an `everyman' hero and a villain who is colder than the other side of the pillow.  Max is the run-of-the-mill working class Joe who dreams of a better life.  He knows what he wants but has difficulty reaching that goal.  It is the mixture of Vincent's mercilessness attitude that Max is given the incentive to stop making excuses and make something of himself.  Vincent, however, sees humans as just objects over-populating the world.  If he should get rid of a few, who would miss them?  It is Vincent's way of thinking that is the essential message of the film and lets the audience ponder the importance of human existence.Foxx and Cruise both play characters that are opposite from the roles audiences are usually accustomed to seeing them.  Foxx is not his usual silly self and it is a change that he plays quite well.  Foxx's portrayal of Max is a character audiences can readily connect with.  His best renderings come from capturing the working class dreamer's emotions and feelings.  Foxx brings out Max's desires, fears, and self doubts that all people have experienced in their lifetime that it is almost as if they were watching their best friend on the screen.  Max is not a superhero or a daring police officer and yet Foxx brings out the heroism in the character.  Audiences will cheer for Max not only because he is human but also because he can be super-human.  Cruise also switches gears from hero to ice cold villain.  As Vincent, Cruise plays a hitman who is both heartless and deep thinking. Cruise's portrayal of Vincent is just a man doing his job.  He doesn't see any right or wrong to killing people; it is just a way to make a living. Cruise's philosophical feature of the character are explained in this manner: if there are over a billion people in the world you don't know, what is the difference to getting rid of a few of them?  Cruise carries out this attitude so well that fans would almost believe he truly felt this way. Despite being the villain, Cruise can still emit self-confidence and a cool attitude in the character that fills up each scene.What makes `Collateral' great is that it is not a single-themed movie.  One the one hand, it is an action movie with gun battles and fights expertly caught by Michael Mann's direction.  There is also the underlying message brought out by Stuart Beattie's screenplay that looks at the value and importance of human life.  Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise both pull off wonderful performances by tackling new challenges.  Theatergoers will not regret watching this film and their expectations will be paid in full.
Grade: A- Starring: Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx",Collateral
383,the_crock,not so cruisy,8,3 August 2005,"This movie had three great things going for it. A very clever script that was full of suspense, black humour, and very well written dialogue. The direction, which was smart, visually interesting and very well paced. And thirdly Jamie Foxx, who in this movie actually becomes a nerdy taxi driver. The three things that this movie is constantly fighting is Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise.Its not even that he is that bad, he is just Tom Cruise, and he can't be anyone else, he is less an actor, than just himself in different hair styles and costumes. He lacks the versatility of an actor like Jamie Foxx. Cruise can't help but be himself all the time, and that is really annoying, especially because I enjoyed every other aspect of this film.Without Tom Cruise in this movie, it probably was worth 4/5 out of 5, with him in it I'll give it 3/5 out of 5. What the hell ill give it 4. I can't hold it against Stuart Beattie (who is an Aussie), Michael Mann and Jamie Foxx, they were all top class.",Collateral
384,Moonhawk1975,"A tense, exciting and fateful night in L.A.",10,8 April 2005,"I was extremely surprised by this movie. Even with the talent involved behind the cameras and on the screen, I had my doubts that this would be a very good movie. I was expecting either a dull talky focusing on two people in a cab or a generic action movie. Instead, we get an exciting action thriller centered on two opposites sharing a cab one night in Los Angeles.Jamie Foxx is perfect as Max, a cab driver with dreams of opening his own limousine company. He picks up the lovely Jada Pinkett Smith and the two flirt as he drives her where she needs to go. This scene is wonderful; an expert example of two great actors and a wonderful director at work. After such a brief encounter, I would have normally found the attraction of a successful attorney (Smith) to a cabdriver implausible; here it works. As Max sits starry-eyed in his cab, another passenger gets in. It's Vincent (Tom Cruise), who we soon learn is an assassin who forces the reluctant Max to drive him to each of the hits he has been hired to complete in one night.It's at this point that the movie turns into a tense nail-biter. We know at any time Vincent can grow weary of Max, dispose of him and carry out his assignment alone. We wonder if Max will snap and do something rash to get himself out of his dire situation. We put ourselves in his place, knowing we would probably react the same way: wanting to do somethinganythingbut leery of failing and, consequently, dying.There are three things that make this film the success it is. First, is the wonderful screenplay by Stuart Beattie. Every line of dialogue, situation and action is expertly written and believable. But, even a good script can fail in the hands of inept actors. That does not happen here. Foxx is brilliant in his role, exactly as an everyman would seem. Smith has the least showy and smallest role of the three leads, but is superb. She pulls off the flirty part in the beginning and the tough/vulnerable part later in the movie with perfect ease. Cruise is a capable villain and successfully pulls of being menacing. His only problem is his celebrity; if you are unable to shed your expectations of him as the good guy hero, you will most likely have problems believing in him as the assassin. I bought his performance as a bad guy.Finally, the credit for the films success lies with the director, Michael Mann. Even a movie with a great script and wonderful performances will not be as good without a talented hand to rein it all in. Mann is one of the best directors working today and this excellence is on display here. The movie is beautifully shot, with captivating camera work and skillful editing. This is a tense and enjoyable thriller.",Collateral
385,dosanjh1,A tight thriller,6,15 September 2004,"I think Tom Cruise is a good actor. Let this sink in for a while. Has he had a truly bad performance? Sure he's a little wooden and he relies on his smile a bit too much. We must remember that he was quality in Magnolia, Interview With A Vampire, Mission Impossable and Rain Man.Collatoral is another movie in which Tom shows us a few more strings to his fiddle. He plays an Ice Cold hit-man, 10 steps ahead of the game and a brain that literally calculates odds.Jamie Fox is brilliant; the leads connect very well; but don't spark as well as other couples in buddy movies.Cinematography is striking, the course the film takes is pacy and unpredictable. My main beef with the film is that it lacks an emotional core. We are not told a great deal about the characters and as a consequence, i couldn't care less about the finale of the film.Anybody else think of Terminator at the end of the movie?",Collateral
386,rumfoord,"A dark, penetrating film",10,19 November 2004,"Collateral has its share of flaws. The beginning is too choreographed, there are several superfluous characters that the camera spends excessive time with (cops), and finally, the plot has some annoyingly predictable elements.This is, however, a magnificent film.Tom Cruise is a stylish but experienced hit-man who clearly spends his off days listening to improvised jazz, sipping scotch, and reading Nietzsche. He's a calculating man of will, suffering from a rather pronounced case of anti-social disorder. What he's not, is a caricature. Jamie Fox is a cab driver, and for the purposes of this film, Cruise's foil. He is an ordinary person with ambitions, but insufficient will to realize them. His fanatical capacity to predict trip times and devotion to efficiency suggest a stagnant, almost autistic approach to life.These are terrific characters to start with, but where the film really excels is in its treatment of them. Despite immense odds, it manages to maintain a Hemingway'esque level of objectivity in a more pronounced fashion than 'Heat'. In so doing, it keeps us interested not only in who will ultimately 'win', or how stylishly he does so, but also (and more importantly) in how the characters exist in each moment.9/10",Collateral
387,godamndevil1977,I can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!,7,21 September 2005,"Collateral is a nice enough film. If it was an indie film, it'd of had a different ending for sure. But who cares, Tom Cruise chooses a good part, and his dynamic, dry & hardened characters make good entertainment. It's nice to see him play immorale roles, maybe next time he could choose a less driven character, like a slacker for instance.My only gripe is, I thought the cab driver was a little cliché, I think in the city of Angels most cabbies would've taken the money and shut up, instead of whining.The film carries subtle truths of man's worth to the world, why we're here? How insignificant we really are, easy come easy go, you get the feeling the writer or director is driving this home to the viewer as Vincent does with Max, I thought that was a nice addition to the film.Some pretty camera work, it gives a good feel of Los Angeles and the vast jungle it is.I enjoyed it.~Paul Browne",Collateral
388,gmaileatsyourlunch,Entertaining but brain dead,5,12 May 2021,"Collateral is like a daydream from when I was a teenager, bored out of my mind working at a minimum wage job and imagining some crazy adventure would be thrust upon me. In that fantasy, I'd suddenly become the pivotal reluctant hero, save the girl, defeat the bad guys, and so on. And that would be perfectly fine for this film if it didn't take itself so seriously or the writing wasn't so lazy. It almost can't make up its mind whether it wants to be an over-the-top John Wick-style thrill ride, or a dark, gritty and meditative action drama like Heat. It ends up somewhere in the middle, accomplishing neither.There's zero reason for Tom Cruise, a hitman-for-hire, to drag the kicking-and-screaming cab driver Jamie Foxx, along for a night of hits against drug cartel enemies in Los Angeles. Their pairing is lazy and convenient and exists solely because there wouldn't be a movie otherwise. And that's how most of the film runs: one event after another that sort of beggars belief and is solely there because if any of the many available logical outs were taken, the film would end unceremoniously. Jamie Foxx has plenty of chances to turn the tables on Cruise, escape or contact the police, but he doesn't. Not for any good reasons the film offers, but simply so these two can go one-on-one in the finale.There's an entire subplot with Mark Ruffalo as a police detective chasing down the duo. His character is uninteresting, as is the procedural foot work to track Cruise and Foxx. And then he's gone from the movie with no connection to the finale. You almost wonder why they bothered with his character at all. I guess cause cops chase bad guys. And to fill the running time.Overall, this is a far sillier, less intelligent, and more cliche-ridden affair than Michael Mann is capable of and what you might be hoping for. If you can turn your brain down to a low simmer, it's possible to enjoy the ride, but overall I really can't recommend it.",Collateral

'Oh my God, I can't believe that lawyer from the beginning was the sixth hit! Oh my God, I hope no one gets killed!' Yeah right. Everything about the last twenty minutes of this was cheap.

Also, Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise have excellent on-screen chemistry together; their performances seem inspired. Nonetheless, when everything's all said and done you're left with a bad taste in your mouth and in your mind you're saying to yourself...my intelligence has been insulted...why should I think of this movie as anything more than 'Speed'. The basic premise of the story seems as if it was given to Mann after calling a 1-800 #...seriously, just read the IMDb.COM synopsis: A cab driver finds himself the hostage of an engaging contract killer as he makes his rounds from hit to hit during one night in LA. He must find a way to save both himself and one last victim. Pretty self-explanatory. I mean, come on, have you never heard of throwing a couple curveballs here and there, Michael Mann. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the lawyer from the beginning turns out to be the sixth hit...cheap, cheap cheap, fake, fake, fake.

Michael Mann really knows how to direct an overly impressive action film like this.It is a great reflection on life and what it means to be alive, the message and the impact that the film makes on the viewer are made in subtle ways and executed in a way that really makes you think. It is such a great and well done moment and what happens from there is one of the best moments in the history of American cinema. The interaction between the two characters is what makes Collateral shine. They never look like they're enemies, but they never look like allies either. Vincent uses the taxi driver and vice versa, the end could only be that, and vice versa.Speaking of Vincent (Tom Cruise's character) is a really good performance, which transports to the screen the whole soul of a crazy psychotic character. You may not agree with your ideas, but woe to you if you try to prove otherwise. Who cares? Collateral has a great rhythm. For a film that takes place almost entirely in a taxi, the action scenes, the moments when the two get out of the car, Mann incorporated all this well and made it rain. It is an exciting story, well built with charismatic characters and a first-rate direction. Little do they know what real excitement is about those who never watched this film, it is an overdose of everything, when we really see the action scenes.In the end, Collateral is one of the best films ever made. It is a very breathtaking experience, and full of specialty. It is very difficult to watch and not to be abducted by this well-crafted atmosphere of a hunt in Los Angeles, and to be bound by this imperfect relationship.My corollary would be a 9.0.

Foxx is terrific in his role as a hapless cabbie; he conveys a sense of quiet desperation as he is figuring out how to cope with the predicament he's in.

The basic plot revolves around Foxx as a cabbie who catches a stroke of bad luck by acquiring Cruise as a passenger. Cruise turns out to be a hit-man who is picking people off as his temporary employer sees fit. A wild ride through LA's nightlife gives way for a journey of self-realization for Foxx (whom dreams of his own limo company and tropical islands). The slick script and sophistication of the plot and character development always keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

395,mjcfoxx,Collateral,7,16 July 2013,"Collateral is Stuart Beattie's ticket into Hollywood. Originally called 'The Last Domino' and heavily rewritten by both Frank Darabont and Michael Mann, it asks the questions: ""So what happens if you're a cab driver and a sociopath gets into the car?"" So it goes. The sociopath is played by Tom Cruise and it's a part that he's essentially made for. The guy has the capacity to be both utterly charming and utterly cold at the same time and I think he's probably managed to frighten quite a few people in his life. Jamie Foxx is the cabdriver, and what makes his performance so riveting is his capacity to be down on himself while aspiring higher, to be humbled and humbling, and essentially be a lot like probably you and me. It's the dichotomy between these two convergent personalities that make this film work. The actual storyline, while interesting, is at a loss towards the final third of the film, when it devolves into shoot-em-up bang-bang and the cab driver becomes something other than what his character's been the entire film.

This film is a Definite Oscar contender for this year. Micheal Mann's films have not always been good EG: ALI but this one also proves he can DIRECT. I loved every scene in this movie, every shot, all the acting and, all of the special effects. The photography stands out soo far in this movie ( UNBELIEVABLE ). \ Its violence with style and genius, not just pure terror and no plot. This film has it all......I advise to go see this masterpiece....... Paul...................",Collateral

The entire story is cliché and I liked the hit-man with a heart of gold character a lot better Jean Reno played it in The Professional. I can't take Jamie Foxx seriously as a leading man. I know this is a Hollywood movie and not real life but when is a hot, lawyer ever going to give her phone number to a cab driver? This movie was a disappointing combination of predictability and unbelievability.If you want to see the hit-man with conscious go see The Professional. If you want well don Noir go watch one of the classics like The Killers, Criss Cross or Kiss Me Deadly",Collateral
398,warren-johnstone,Tom Cruise as a bad guy is appealing but Collateral is a dud!,3,18 October 2004,"Tom Cruise plays Vince, a hit man who gets into Max's (Jamie Foxx) taxi and intends to use the taxi as transport between the five assassinations he is about to undertake. However once Max's realized what he is involved in he is a reluctant accomplice.While the idea of Tom Cruise playing a bad guy was appealing, I was completely disappointed by his performance and the movie itself. I've decided that I'm over Tom Cruise and I won't bother to see another of his movies - he doesn't add anything of value. In addition, there were far too many scenes where nothing happened and some of the camera work was shaky and out of focus. And it that wasn't enough, there were several moments where events were too coincidental to be plausible, including Cruise's bullet-proof character. I give 'Collateral' 3/10.",Collateral
399,rosaishere,Tom Cruise should be a villain more often!,7,20 May 2005,"This film is directed by the legendary Michael Mann, and Heat being one of my favourite films I decided to see this.I was not disappointed. The story sounds a bit plain and boring, but once you sit down and watch it the time will just fly by.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a simple Cab Driver just trying to get by in life. Vincent (Tom Cruise) is the Hit-man, and he has one night to make five stops. Fate brings these two together, and Vincent relies on Max to take him everywhere around the city.The violence in this movie is beautifully timed with nothing over the top. The gun effects in some places almost look real, and this is also tied in with a very unique style of filming and some beautiful aerial shots of L.A.My credit to Tom cruise, he is a far superior bad guy. The menacing glances he gives during the film will long live into your nightmares. Watch and enjoy, for this simple tale is not as simple as it looks.10/10",Collateral
400,almosalami,This is a great thriller that gets better and better as it progresses,8,10 July 2015,"This is a pretty great thriller that gets better and better as it progresses until it reaches this ultimate level of you being immersed into it.The best thing about this film is its awesome tension filled thriller moments. Something that really added to these scenes was that they were things that you didn't really see before or things that you didn't expect or things that you kinda expected to happen and then when it happens you're like ""holy !@#$"". And the reason there are scenes like that is because they really explored very well the things that could happen if you were Max and stuck in his situation, and I really love that about this film and is my favorite part of it. And from me to you, one of the scenes has got to be my one of my favorite scenes in action movie history, and it involves Tom Cruise's character Vincent and two thugs who stole his suitcase. Now that was amazing.Another one of the great things about this film is its dialogue and discussions between the characters. Action movies usually have trouble with the transitions between action scenes, and end up putting some irrelevant filler scenes to attempt to fill the gap and it never really works well. This film had dialogue, and it is done really well, and personally, I absolutely love it when movies have great dialogue. And what I mean by that is dialogue that when you listen to it, it makes you reflect back on your life and your actions and leaves you pondering on for a while. And when the dialogue isn't that, it's developing the characters in a way that makes you attached to them, and makes you understand them, and makes them all the more believable.I have to appreciate this film's cinematography and editing, not that it was absolutely stunning or special, but in it that there were so many moments where they could've easily gone for shaky cam or quick-cut blind cover-up editing, but it wasn't like that, and they did it well, and that is very refreshing. There were just one or two moments were I wish they'd done wider shots, but really, that's just me and my inner amateur talking and won't apply to everyone.The performances of Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise were really good. Jamie Fox really works as this regular guy cab driver. And Tom Cruise - I didn't see him as the usual hero Tom Cruise, but instead, as this ""badass sociopath"" that Vincent is. I saw the character instead of the actor, which is always a great compliment for an actor playing a role. Then there's Mark Ruffalo's character. He was definitely useful in adding tension to certain scenes and added to the plot, but I felt like they either should have went all the way with his character, or toned him down more, because there are certain scenes that seemed a bit unnecessary because they weren't really relevant to the two main characters.However, I'm definitely gonna say that there were some problems with the movie's execution. In the beginning, there's this piano music in the background and it accomplishes nothing but getting you feeling sleepy and distracting you from the great dialogue. I think it should've been completely silent and you just heard the voices of the characters. There are also times in the film where they attempt to transition between one scene and another with some song and views of the city, but they really feel out of place, and I wonder why they didn't just get straight to the point and skip the transition. I'm guessing this was done in order to cool down the audience after an intense sequence, but that's already done well with the good dialogue and the transitions just cool you down too much.And there were two scenes that I felt could've been done a bit better, although it's probably nitpicking from me at this point. ..................SPOILER ALERT!!!...................... The scene when the police officers pull over Max and Vincent in the taxi was very interesting, but I felt that it ended kind of anti-climactically. Like I was thinking Vincent might've actually killed the police officers by something Max messed up in his improvisation and that would've been crazy good. The second scene was the ending, and though this is a really small thing, I wished that Max also died with Vincent. I feel like it would've been more impactful and realistic, given that Vincent shot through his entire set of bullets from the pistol - I'm not saying all of them should've hit, cuz he did get shot, but at least one or two. But anyways, other than that, the ending was really good and it actually touched me Vincent's last words................. SPOILER DONE .......................Overall, really great film and I'd definitely recommend you watch it.",Collateral

403,nicktusk-95591,Way better than a 7.5!,10,27 January 2019,This movie is highly underrated. It is a short quick story. The movie collateral self title says it all. It's a story about a thrill ride on a one night adventure. This movie came out in 2004 . It's hard to believe based on the quality of this picture it's been that long ago. Tom cruises performance was impeccable. He plays a super ex KGB assasin of some sort trained to kill who Jamie foxes character accidentally picks him up in his cab while driving the night shift. Jada Pickett Smith is also in this movie who plays the woman district attorney. In a nutshell a series of events happen in the course of one night. Michael Mann is the dietcetor and I highly recommend you watch 'Heat' or 'Miami Vice' before hand so to understand his directing style before watching this film. The music is also very good and it's a thrill to watch to say the least . Definitely my favorite Tom Cruise movie seriously. I'm not a huge Cruise fan anyhow maybe Top Gun or born on the Fourth of July. Jamie Fox is also a favored actor of mine. Jada is good as well very hot in this movie . Typical Michael Mann co stars for sub plots . A must see !,Collateral

405,Alwood,"""THE TERMINATOR"" REDUX",5,30 July 2004,"Another big summer movie disappointment, loaded with talent behind and in front of the camera, a big budget, and all the ingredients of what should produce a good film, but winds up being hopelessly mediocre. If anything, this is so derivative of the original ""TERMINATOR,"" that all originality goes out the window from the first few frames on. Tom Cruise, while you're great playing all-American types like Jerry Maguire, or conflicted all-Americans like your character in ""MINORITY REPORT,"" you simply aren't an edgy badass! This film, and ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" prove that in spades. While ""COLLATERAL"" has a couple tense, exciting scenes (particularly the shootout in the Koreatown nightclub) courtesy of director Michael Mann, one of our finest filmmakers, the film is overall very predictable, with uninteresting, cardboard characters. The attempts at fleshing out said characters during Cruise and Jamie Foxx's conversations in the cab seem forced at best. Fine actors like Mark Ruffalo and Bruce McGill are wasted in throwaway supporting roles. Overall, a real letdown. I expect more from a top flight director like Michael Mann, who usually shoots for the top. This one just made me feel like everyone was aiming for the middle. 5/10",Collateral

409,Kate_Dammit_Run,"Great Movie, but needs better ending",9,28 September 2005,"I think Collateral is a fantastic movie. Jamie Foxx deserved the Oscar for this and Tom Cruise deserved a nomination for one of his best roles, and one of the few villains who he has played. Michael Manns beautiful style makes this a gorgeous picture to watch as we get a tour around street level LA, far from the Hollywood Hills and tourist attractions. Foxx's is likable and naive as the ordinary guy swept up into events beyond his control. Tom Cruise is fantastic as the slick likable Vincent (he played another likable Vincent twenty years ago in Color of Money) a perceptive hit-man. Cruise is like the Terminator in the actions scenes, an unstoppable killing machine who never loses his professional detachment. At one point, when Foxx questions him why he is killing people Vincent admits that he doesn't know, or care. He was just hired to do a job. Vincent is a terrific character, a great example of the banality of evil. What makes him so endearing and horrifying at the same time is that he is not some monster. He is witty and polite, and stops at one point to take in a jazz concert. At one point he tells Foxx a chilling story about his troubled childhood and how he murdered his abusive father. THen he laughs and admits he made it up. He had an ordinary childhood and his parents are still alive. He is not a hit-man because of some childhood trauma but just because life happened to open up that path for him. For most of this film Mann does a great job of frustrating our expectations about how a Hollywood film should go. The potential heroics are constantly foiled, Vincent almost never slips up. My only complaint is that the film abandons this paradigm at the end. Perhaps feeling the need to have a happy ending Mann allows Foxx in the last fifteen minutes to change from the everyman he has been throughout the film into an action hero. It would have been much more in keeping with the tone of the film to have Vincent simply finish his job, leaving our expectations of a heroic ending frustrated.",Collateral
410,willkthewpboy,Dismissed this as a generic action thriller on my first watch; boy was I wrong,10,25 August 2021,"The first time I watched this was on edibles, so I guess my only defense for underrating this movie at first was that I was baked out of my head. However after watching this with a clear head on the second viewing, my mind was blown.This is one of a few movies that profoundly affected me, and yet I can't quite put my finger on why it did so. So I'll focus on what I know this movie did well for sure. This movie was among the best acting Cruise has accomplished his entire career, along with the last samurai and minority report. He plays one of the most relatable villains I've seen in movies; he's just another guy that's been screwed over too many times and no longer believes there is good in people.The superb acting from both Cruise and Foxx makes their crazy situation entirely believable. Once you finish the movie, take a step back and look at the plot and dialogue, there is no way you can deny that this is a crazy good story.There are more than a few double entendres that I missed on my first viewing that really made the story come together. I also loved the gun fights in this.Another interesting thing I found about this movie is that it keeps driving in the fact that Cruise's character has been alone pretty much his entire life. It even drives home the point in one scene when a lone wolf is shown, obviously representing Vincent. Looking at the movie from his point of view, one improbable series of events leading to another eventually makes him care about someone, Max.It was unlikely the guy he killed would land exactly on Max's cab, and it was also unlikely Max visited his mother in the hospital every night. This lead to Vincent being forced to become familiar with his mom in order to keep law enforcement off their tail. Eventually, it shows that he comes to actually care about Max; he saves him in the nightclub despite having no actual logistical reason to do so. He even gives Max a lot of chances after getting shot by him. It was clear he didn't want to kill him when he was screaming out Max's name over and over, even going as far as warning him before the final shootout that he has done this all his life and that Max isn't likely to come out on top. This vastly contrasts to the rest of his victims whom he simply just hunted down. I realize now when Vincent first started shooting back at Max and Annie in the building, he wasn't aiming at Max; just his target.The movie makes you think, didn't Vincent actually have a really good reason to be alone all his life? Because the moment he started caring about someone and let his emotions affect his actions even just a little, he got betrayed and killed. On top of this, the reason he got killed was not only because he saved Max, but because Max found out he was going to kill a woman that Max himself cared about. There was no way he could've known about this. Vincent was dead as soon as it showed he let his guard down around Max. If he treated Max the exact same way as the rest of his victims, he would've lived.In the end, it shows Vincent does not regret saving Max and being killed; he does this by ending his story with a nihilistic quote from before. No one will notice his dead body on the train for 6 hours. Just like no one cares about his abusive childhood, and no one will notice if he spends the rest of his life alone. I know what childhood abuse feels like; after all the pain and suffering, at the end all you feel is betrayal, and anger at your stupidity for trusting family. And opening up to someone is the same as inviting the possibility of betrayal and getting screwed over once again. But if you think about it, Max is probably the one person that knew more about Vincent than anyone else in his life. From Vincent's point of view, no one even came close to knowing him before Max, and that's why he saved him and let his actions be affected by his feelings.Vincent isn't made out to be a dumb character. He understands the situation he put Max in, and knows that Max is likely to betray him the first chance he can. However he still comes to care for and even trust Max to an extent; even when it invites the possibility of betrayal and his job being screwed over. But is that outcome really that much worse than spending the rest of your life unnoticed by anyone? As the characters say, if it all doesn't matter anyway, why not?",Collateral
411,UltramarineX,Tom Cruise as a bad guy? Hell yeah!,8,16 August 2004,"**Warning:  Spoilers ahead**This movie surprised me.  I mean it REALLY surprised me.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  Collateral shows Tom Cruise in what I believe is his first `bad guy' role and Jamie Foxx in one of his few non-comedy roles. But with its tight writing and direction, and great performances by all actors involved, Collateral is without a doubt one of the best movies of this summer, and the surprise sleeper hit of the year. 
The story of Collateral revolves around an assassin named Vincent (played by Cruise) who commandeers a taxi operated by Max (played by Foxx).  Vincent forces Max at gunpoint to assist him in assassinating five individuals on his hit list.  However, this seemingly simple premise belies an incredibly strong story.  If you want non-stop balls-to-walls action, and/or have no patience for movies that `have a lot of talking' then look somewhere else. While there are several scenes of gunplay, the core of this movie deals with the interaction between Vincent and Max.It is true that, like in most movies, Collateral's most interesting character is the villain.  Cruise's portrayal of the character is amazing. As Vincent, Cruise delivers his lines with such ease and confidence, that it's more than worthy of Oscar consideration.  Vincent is a person who his incredibly calm considering the profession that he's in.  He is also extremely resourceful, as shown when he pretends to be a lawyer telling off Max's boss when he (the boss) wants to take any damages done to the taxi out of Max's paycheck.  Vincent also always has something sarcastic (and often funny) say to Max when he begins to criticize what Vincent has done.  After Vincent kills of the first person on his list, Max asks why he would kill his victim after only just meeting him.  To that, Vincent replies, `What? I should only kill people after I get to know them?'.  Vincent then asks Max whether he heard about Rwanda.  He goes on to tell Max thousands of people died yet `Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Whales, Greenpeace, or something? No. I off one fat Angelino and you throw a hissy fit.'  Max himself is also an interesting character, and is surprisingly well-played by Jamie Foxx.  He tells people who get in his cab about his intentions to own a limo service and drive around famous people, yet at the same time he projects a sense that this is more of a dream than a real plan, and you feel sorry for him.  His character is also one that continuously changes throughout the movie.  After the first killing, Max gets scared and has no idea how to deal with Vincent.  But as soon as he sees an opening, Max jumps on the opportunity to destroy Vincent's suitcase with his work inside.  And when Max has to confront a powerful drug lord while posing as Vincent, he has to force himself to become as cool and collected as Vincent himself.An interesting thing to note about this movie is, just like Michael Man's other movie Heat, Collateral likes to use a lot of the wide shots of the background.  In Heat this was used to good effect to give that movie a more `epic' experience.  In Collateral, this wide shot technique is used to give the viewer to stronger `feel' for the city of Los Angeles, as a bustling, busy, and warm (in terms of temperature) metropolis.If Cruise and Foxx continue to make performances like that in Collateral, I wouldn't be surprised if one day they get an academy award.  Hell it's entirely possible for them to get nominated for their roles in this movie. With so many special effect blockbusters out there this summer, Collateral bucks the trend by providing a movie that focuses on strong characters and dialogue, and a few unexpected twists, rather than relying on huge explosions.  Collateral is one of the MUST SEE movies of this summer, so don't deprive yourself by not checking it out.I give Collateral a rock-solid 8 out of 10!",Collateral
412,Fong_Chun_Kin,Tom the Bad Guy,8,23 February 2005,"For once, Tom Cruise isn't the good guy. I was beginning to get sick of his typecast American Hero role in every movie, perhaps apart from the dismal Vanilla Sky. Then came the role of Vincent, a hit-man who is ruthless and relentless, yet at times displaying streaks of compassion and empathy towards his hired taxi driver, played by Jamie Foxx.Sometimes you have got to 'pity' Tom Cruise. Year after year, he's hoping to get a shot at the elusive Oscar, ever since he got nominated for Jerry Maguire. Last year's majestic The Last Samurai saw his hopes of landing an Oscar nod take a blow as he was completely overshadowed by Ken Watanabe, who deservedly landed himself a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom. Similarly this year sees Cruise taking on an uncharacteristically villainous character in Collateral in hope of fulfilling his wishes, and yet again he gets trumped by the more impressive 'supporting' performance of Jamie Foxx (strange, considering 'supporting actor' Foxx takes up more screen time than Cruise). God, he must really hate Foxx... not one but two acting noms in a year. At the end of the day, what Cruise has are just his 20 million bucks paycheck per movie to console himself with. Poor guy eh? I didn't find Foxx's role particularly memorable, so it is a surprise that he was nominated and will be a shock if he does get the gold for this show. The movie though, is masterfully handled throughout by Michael Mann, who in my opinion, deserves an Oscar nom more than Foxx for this film. A tight story, great action scenes, steady pacing and excellent chemistry between the two leads are all characteristics of this entertaining thriller. Even the much criticised ending, which I found was not that lame and unbelievable, fails to make this overall an enjoyable movie experience.Who should watch: Anyone who doesn't believe that Tom Cruise can actually act 'evil' Who shouldn't watch: Taxi drivers who do night shifts Rating: 7.7",Collateral
413,edblask04,Fun movie (possible spoilers),8,10 August 2004,This was a fun movie even if you sometimes expect the Miami Vice music theme to show up at some point along with Don Johnson. There were some co-incidences that seem quite over the top except though with this movie competing against the Village it is kind of hard to criticize Collateral for showing too many co-incidences when they abound in the Village. Mr. Cruise does an excellent job at depicting a realistic contract killer. The same with just about all the other actors in this movie. You could market this movie as a documentary as it seems far less poised and manipulated than any of Michael Moore's various pseudo documentaries. The other aspects of the movie make it quickly look like a Mann product. You can tell who made this movie about as quickly as you can tell who made a White Castle burger by picking it up and biting into it. It is Mann all the way which if you like his work is just what you asked for when buying your ticket.This movies deserves at least eight stars out of ten.,Collateral
414,Marco_AGJ,Masterpiece! - Absolutely brilliant thriller!,10,12 December 2006,"OK guys, what we have here is not just one of the best suspense, thriller films, not quite one of the best 2004 movies, but indeed one of the best movies ever made! The greatness of this movie can't be described in words, you gotta see it. The film focuses on Vincent and Max, Vincent is a hit-man hired to take some witnesses down, and Max is a taxi driver, Vincent hires Max for the whole night to do his job - of course the taxi driver doesn't know what kind of job yet - and get to the airport fast enough, but you know, things happens...Most of the movie the action is set inside the cab, with conversations between max and Vincent, they talk about life, experiences, universe, you get to see both points of view, and then you realize that their relationship gets deeper, it's not just a sociopath and his collateral inside a cab preparing for the slaughter, there's jokes, hangouts, and even parent visits, while Vincent prefers to think that as his job, Max condemns it.The atmosphere created is outstanding, 95% of the movie happens at night, just the beginning that doesn't, and with it they really got to make the best of a metropolitan city night, and along with the excellent atmosphere created, the soundtrack contribute to set the perfect mood, simply amazing! The acting is stunning, I always liked Tom Cruise's job, but with this he made nothing less than the best acting of his whole career, we can say the same for Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith was just great and Mark Ruffalo did a fantastic job as well! And acting turns out to be not much of a problem when the plot is asmagnificent as this is, just pure original and nicely thought-out storyline!

415,dwpeak,A Cinematic Masterpiece,10,24 December 2006,"Michael Mann is quite possibly the greatest American filmmaker alive today. I have seen all but two of his movies, and there is only one I would not want to see; ""The Keep."" Everything from ""Thief,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Heat,"" ""The Insider,"" ""Ali,"" and the highly underrated ""Miami Vice,"" Michael Mann has proved himself over and over again to be a very smart and very real filmmaker.In his 2004 film ""Collateral"" he takes his game to a whole new level. Tom Cruise, a very good actor, (But one who needs to sort out some personal problems) takes the role of ""Vincent."" In the beginning of the film we have no idea who he is. Steel gray suit and beard. The shades. What is this movie about? Jamie Foxx plays cab driver ""Max,"" a man with high hopes, but one who does not have the the will to act on them. Considering the plot is out in the open, there's no point in calling it a spoiler; Vincent is a hit man. He's ruthless, cold- hearted, and wickedly funny at times. Tonight he has a job. He needs a ride. That, of course, happens to be Max. This movie is about conversation. It is about two men, completely different from each other, and how they realize that they are the only two that understand each other. When you read about the plot, some will think it to be an action movie; a shoot- 'em up. Do not be mistaken. This film is talk. Talking about life, missed opportunities, and what's to come. If you do not handle films with a lot of dialogue in them, this is not for you. I also believe it is some of the best-written dialogue on film. Great writing by Stuart Beattie, Frank Darabont, and Michael Mann (yes, three people were involved in the dialogue. Frank Darabont wrote a revised draft, and Michael Mann made numerous revisions, including several lines of the movie). I believe that of all screenplays, this one could beat most any. Terrific directing also helps this movie. Just looking at the movie, you know this director was born with a gift. Michael Mann makes this movie in such a way, that it wouldn't have been as good with another one in the pilot's seat. I don't care what you think about Tom Cruise. This is his best performance, and if you don't think he can act 'bad' or 'evil,' I'd remain quiet and wait until you see the movie. A very, very convincing performance. I like many others, believe he was snubbed out of a best actor nomination in '04. Jamie Foxx, who was nominated, delivers a wonderful, solid performance as the cabbie Max. It is secondary only to his performance in ""Ray."" Other great performances come from Barry Shabaka Henley, Mark Ruffalo, Bruce McGill, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Many complain about the ending of this film. I have a question: how was he supposed to end it? It was very well directed and suspenseful, simply mixing elements to the film that had not yet been present. It was a great finish, and especially the last lines of this movie make you feel something you never thought you would; sadness. Wait and see for yourself. I now own the DVD, and must say this film is a tradition. Two other members of my immediate family own it as well. There's nothing not to like; graceful cinematography, superb acting, masterful directing, and a wonderful film. Worth every minute of your time to see. Among the very best of Michael Mann. Among the very best of our time.",Collateral

Why would a hit man choose a cabbie to drive him around? Why would this be interesting? But, I had similar thoughts before seeing ""The Insider"" - why would a movie about a corporate whistle blower be interesting. Now, ""The Insider"", along with ""Heat"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", and ""Manhunter"" are some of my favorite movies.After seeing Collateral, I surprisingly really didn't have a problem with the issue of why a hit-man would have a cabbie drive him around from hit to hit. But, it didn't live up to other Michael Mann movies that I love. It seemed like a long version of an RHD episode.If you want an entertaining movie, this will suffice.

417,WoodrowTruesmith,"All right, what was Vincent's game-plan again?",6,25 January 2006,"Spoiler alert: Vincent's plan to avoid prosecution is to take a cab to each of five targets' homes and kill them all in one night, then kill the cabbie, making it look like the suicide of a crazed spree-killer instead of the work of a professional hit-man. Apparently, from what cop Fanning says, he has done this at least once before.So this means...1) Vincent feels sure no one will question the idea of a ""spree killer"" who happens to kill the prosecutor and four of her witnesses in a major gangster's trial.2) Once the plan goes south and Max witnesses the first murder, Vincent thinks Max is dumb enough to help him commit four more murders, on the promise that Vincent won't kill him.3) Vincent will not kill Max and find a dumber, or at least more cooperative cabbie, even after Max throws away the addresses of his targets.4) Vincent will send Max into a nightclub unsupervised, to get a copy of his targets' addresses from a major gangster who will kill both Max and Vincent (or at least, destroy Vincent's professional reputation) if he suspects Max is not the real hit-man.5) Vincent will spend all night chatting, in public, with various victims, their acquaintances and employees, witnesses, Max's dispatcher...and will even insist on going to the hospital to visit Max's mom. Because later, all these witnesses will assume it was Max who wigged out and killed everyone associated with this trial, and not his loquacious, silver-haired passenger.Now, this all makes sense...if Vincent is having a mental breakdown.Or am I thinking of ""The Matador""?",Collateral

Sadly this film will be overlooked at all the award ceremonies despite it clearly being the best film of 2004.I never used to be a fan of Tom Cruise but recently he has won me over with great films like Mission Impossible, Minority report and The Last Samurai. He truly is one the coolest dudes in Hollywood, next to Don Cheadle of course who was robbed at the Oscars!",Collateral
419,RageQuitLeigh,The acting elevates this one,8,5 April 2021,"Collateral is a throughly engrossing and well paced thriller with exceptional acting performances.The premise of the movie follows Jamie Foxx's Max, a cab driver with long standing dreams of owning his own limousine company. On this night he picks up a customer called Vincent played by Tom Cruise who offers to rent out his driving services for the whole night and pay him over the odds. Turns out that Vincent is a hitman and Max will be under duress driving him from hit to hit.What makes this movie good and above similarly positioned movies, which is simple in concept and execution, is the high calibre of the acting performances. Straight off the bat, the casting is exceptional, Jada Pinkettt Smith, Mark Ruffalo and Javier Barden supplement the leading stars with excellent performances. But the truth is that it is Tom Cruise's performance as a contract hitman that steals the show taking care of business providing just enough authority to keep Max in check. What they did with Cruise visually also plays with you and definitely adds a layer that wouldn't be there if he turned up fresh faced as usual.Michael Mann's direction is slick and well paced and whilst the action is sporadic the interest never drops for a second. Set exclusively at night the movie is dark, but the shots are always clear and well chosen giving it an excellent atmosphere enhanced by the superb soundtrack.All in all this is a well paced thriller that is worth watching, possibly more than once.",Collateral
420,dabrygo,"""Make the best of it, improvise, adapt to the environment...""",9,22 February 2021,"Max (Foxx) drives a cab to fund his dream of starting a limousine company. One eventful night, he hits it off with one fare, a lawyer named Annie (Pinkett Smith), and picks up another enigmatic fare named Vincent (Cruise). Because Vincent has several stops he wants to make, he offers to pay Max more if Max will remain his driver for the rest of the night. But perhaps, rather than the other way around, it's Vincent who takes Max on the ride of his life....I was excited to see this one from the trailers but since it came out before I could see R-rated movies, it took me a while to finally see it. It was worth the wait! It's got plenty of action but I would call it more of a thriller. And one of my favorite ones at that!Its character development is particularly strong. Cruise plays Vincent with a nice blend of live-for-the-day spontaneity yet at the same time sang-froid and indifference. His dynamic and (sometimes philosophical) conversations with Foxx's slave-to-the-routine cabbie, who transforms over the course of the film into a man who takes control of his own life, are particularly mesmerizing to watch. (I don't always notice this sort of thing but I have also always liked Cruise's look in this one; kind of a Perfect Tommy from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984) thing going on there.) The performances from all, but especially Cruise and Foxx, are very authentic, like watching real people.One thing that sticks out to me of the Michael Mann films I've seen -- and I want to check all his films out soon -- is the memorable opposing characters; here, the reckless and nonchalant Vincent versus the careful and caring Max. A major part of Vincent's philosophy is the anonymity the indifference resulting from the crowdedness of L.A., the film's setting, affords him. As an interesting contrast, even though the film's key characters are sharply in focus, in some scenes people seem to blend into the background, as if they were more part of the environment or scenery than being characters themselves. On a related note, the excellent soundtrack also complements the immersive story well, distinct enough to make one aware that it's there but not so much as to draw attention away from the story.The story's plot is also compelling and easy to follow: Vincent needs Max to help him make 5 stops. Unexpected things happen so they deviate slightly from the plan -- or, as Vincent might say, they improvise. The climactic final stop is especially thrilling to watch!",Collateral
421,bartverberne16,great Cruise Controlled taxi ride!!,9,14 October 2004,"""Collateral"" is about a taxi driver (Foxx) who is on the wrong place and the wrong time when a hit-man (Cruise) uses him to escort him to the targets of the night. The way in which Mann has developed this plot is outstanding. The soundtrack, the scenario, the characters....it is all worked out very well. For example, the disco scene where Cruise attempts to kill a certain target. It is incredible how Mann combined chaos with a smooth and cool conclusion. You should really see this for yourself, because the subtlety of the cinema is hard to explain. The transition to the next scene is very impressive. Here Mann's qualities are seriously tested, since he alters from ""action packed image telling tainted film"" to ""philosophically tainted dialogue controlled film"", if you know what I mean. This conversion is done very smoothly; you hardly even notice the change of focus you have to apply. I picked out these scenes in particular because I think it represents the a-class style of this film at its best. It is a great work of cinema that you should check out yourself.Furthermore, I'd like to say something about the actors performances. The casting is truly great, I believe the contribution of the actors to the ""final package"" is very important. They provide the finishing touch, so to speak. For example Tom Cruise. In this film, he manages to work with facial expressions that are very convincing. I dare even to compare it with Jack Nicholson who has done excellent performances using this style of acting. Maybe Tom cruise he has even done one of the best jobs so far in his career. Moreover, Foxx does a great job as well. Especially when you consider this to be his most complex character enrolled so far. His earlier roles where rather superficial compared to this one and, as it comes clear, he is able to ascend to a higher level. 9/10",Collateral
422,BrightVibes,Cruise is the Perfect Bad Guy,10,13 September 2004,"really enjoyed Collateral. Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all ""bad people"" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says. Tom Cruise plays this evil character with a lot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil. Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him. I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie. His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.",Collateral

Films like Lord of the Rings and The Matrix where guaranteed to be huge hits but Collateral is a minimalist film which rides on acting, direction and technical brilliance, some of which are absent in the ""Blockbuster"" films.The cast and crew are pure class and they collaborated perfectly to make a dynamic and electrifying film like none before it. Although it begins as a classy and well organized thriller it quickly transforms into a hectic, relentless action film. Themes and symbols are abundant throughout but none more obvious than the Good (Foxx) versus Evil (Cruise). Jamie Foxx, who is nervous and unsure of himself symbolizes good, moral citizens of urban society and Tom Cruise is cool, calculated and symbolic of immorality, as well as the underworld and murderous occupations.A classic. Tom Cruises best performance ever.",Collateral
424,nchaudha19,Michael Mann shows us how it's done,10,12 June 2005,"Riveting. Go see it. Look for a scene-stealing performance from Javier Bardem. Bardem easily holds his own against a surprisingly strong Jamie Foxx.I'm an aspiring screenwriter. As such, I see a million movies. Most of them are terrible. I don't hate Hollywood movies as much as it sounds like I do, I just hate bad movies.I want movies that draw me in intellectually and emotionally. I want to be riveted for 100 minutes and then I want to be paid off. I demand a tremendous amount from my movie-viewing (this is due to the pathetic state of my own life, but we won't get into that right now). I expect to be sucked IN to the world of the movie and not be allowed to think or feel anything else until I am released 100 minutes later.That's what Collateral did for me. Cliché-free. Vincent is a bad guy but you don't hate him. In fact, he is quite sympathetic even though he is a serial killer. You feel for him. In his own way, he is not a bad man. Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor, but he has impressed me in Minority Report and now in this film. Here you get the feeling that Vincent went astray a very long time ago, and part of him knows it. And he desperately has tried to find a meaningful existence. In his own mind, he has justified the killings. He is a walking contradiction, a tortured soul. When he died at the end, I was moved to tears. And believe me, I'm no pushover.Jamie Foxx was a very, very pleasant surprise. This movie came out before Ray, so he wasn't on the radar yet. But here, he just plain owns his character. Not much else to say, except that he breathes life into the film. He draws you in and holds you there.The idea is deceptively simple. A hit man making his rounds one evening. But underneath the hood is a struggle for a meaningful existence. And brilliantly executed. I guarantee you will not see a whole bunch of stuff coming. If you REALLY did see it coming, drive to Hollywood because you're a better screenwriter than I am and you can earn a ton of $$$.And style. Most directors we think of as ""good"" or even ""great"" directors, are just directors who know how to pick good material and can get good actors. I can count on one hand the number of directors I think actually have a truly unique visual signature: Scorsese and DePalma top the list. Kubrick is at the top of the list too. And Mann is at the top of the list. They're all tied for 1st, OK? I don't put Tim Burton on the list. Nor Coppola, Woody Allen, not even Welles. These guys are very good directors. But they do not possess a unique visual signature. You watch this picture and you know Mann directed it.I think that's about it. This is how movies are supposed to be done, not moronic efforts like Vin Diesel crap or Colin Ferrell crap or Tarantino crap.""Adapt, Darwin, i Ching, all that sh*t. Roll with it.""",Collateral
425,Famas_GunSlinger,Tom Cruise's best performance,9,16 February 2019,"I always think it must be fun for hero type actors to play villains every once and while. Tom Cruise sure does have fun with the role. From the moment he enters the cab with Jamie Fox the movie becomes an excellent philosphical thriller. The conversations the main characters have about life, death, and moral ambiguity are some of the best I've ever seen. Not to mention and incredibly realistic portrayal of Los Angeles. It doesn't show the glamour, or the hot sun, it shows the night life, full of crime, a coyote, and some pretty messed up neighborhoods. Performances are stellar, the few action scenes it has are also amazing. You can tell Tom Cruise was trained and trained well. My only gripe with the film and the reason it doesn't have a 10 is the ending. But watch it for yourself and see what you think. I for one love the atmosphere of the film and contrast of everyday night life with a hitman in the back of your cab.",Collateral
426,facorread,Captivated by the story and the photography,9,6 July 2011,"This is an impressive movie that took some risks and succeeded with them. In the technical aspect, the digital photography gave me a strange feeling of being part of the movie, a feeling that I don't get with 3D, IMAX or other formats.The story is very complete, no plot holes in it, but it has many subtle points that may be missed; the viewer has to pay attention to every detail. The problem is that these details build a house of cards in the minds of the audience: one missed point and the whole plot losses all sense, to the point of being ridiculous.The other problem of the movie is that although the end is very poetic and well done, with great photography and acting, it feels a bit empty; there is no police or FBI to take over from there. The ending could have been improved with just 20 seconds of footage of the authorities asking questions in a crime scene.In conclusion, this movie is great but it requires effort from the audience to be properly understood. Watch it if you like to think.",Collateral
427,Speedy_Lube,"Strong concept, overly complex execution.",8,16 March 2005,"Upon hearing about the plot of this film I was very excited to see it. Having now finally rented it I understand the general consensus that it is quite disappointing. The overall concept is clever and the two main characters are easily the strong point of the film. The plot revolves around a cab driver who discovers that a passenger is making stops to commit murder for hire. He tries to find a way out of the situation. Concurrently, it seems Michael Mann tirelessly sought ways out of the basic premise in the interest of creating a less boring movie. In the end he sacrifices the purity of the film.At the core is the conflict of two characters that represent extreme philosophical viewpoints, Vincent the ultimate pessimist, Max the optimist. Somewhere along the way, Mann gets lost in the whodunnit, the police procedural, and the action gunfight showdown that have noting to do with the original brilliant idea.To his credit, as a result we see some humor and much needed, very clever dialog from Vincent and Max in various scenes. But the rest of the cast provides very little that we truly need. I will go so far as to say that Mann's goal when creating this picture should have been to commit to removing any scene where Vincent nor Max is present.Nevertheless, the conflict between the main characters triumphs in the end, to the point where you will even feel a bit of favoritism for Vincent just before Max steps up in what should have been the final scene (but unfortunately isn't).",Collateral
428,klauskind,"not the best Mann, but still a man to watch",6,30 August 2004,"I agree with all those reviews that pan Collateral's script, there's simply nothing in it that you haven't seen before and that you didn't expect. Worse still, you expected it crisper, taut. It's hard to find enough tension going on between Vincent and Max because there's no interplay between Vincent and Max, there's Vincent playing with Max, poor Max is taking it up the derrière most of the time.How Max can manage such docility is hard to get, because Vincent, after all, is a pro but not a brute, he's a gentleman round the edges, which ends up marring the whole thing. Neither fish nor meat. The actors are good, though and although Mann doesn't seem particularly concerned with improving the script's underdevelopment he's got enough talent in him to make it a watchable and occasionally warm thriller. And there's LA... Never been there but the mann sure looks at her with a lover's eye but does he trust his woman?",Collateral

Of course, Tom plays the bad guy--and he dies in the end.This really shows how good of an actor Tom is.He's really good at playing a bad guy. The reason I don't give it a ten--he dies.

431,bob.gladish,so-so Michael Mann,7,29 December 2004,"I was a little disappointed in ""Collateral"". I don't think it should be on anyone's ""top ten"" list for '04. Maybe I'm finally tiring of this gender, maybe I'm finally immune to these over-the-top, super-violent movies. It was not plausible from the get-go, and the story took about an hour-and-a-half before I finally became immersed in it's drama. Tom Cruise was impeccable as the cold-blooded killer, and Jamie Foxx did well, but so what....the story was just not inventive enough. Mark Ruffalo continues to amaze me with his chameleon-like screen presence. He's so different from movie-to-movie; I stare in bewilderment, realizing it's the same guy. He's as hot as anyone in Hollywood right now. But alas, in this one, he just isn't given a chance to develop the character, though the role as the only smart cop on the chase begs for a more defining presence written into it.When compared to an earlier L.A-based drama ""Heat"", Michael Mann comes up short. ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""The Insider"" were considerably better Mann movies, as well. Better luck next time.footnote: I liked Denzel Washington's ""Man on Fire"" a lot better (another over-the-top violence flick), though I doubt it got better reviews.

Vincent's job is to take care of five witnesses and after the fourth one, Max decides to fight back and the race for the life of Vincent's final target begins.This movie blew me away immediately I rested my eyes on it. The direction, acting and screen writing is beyond imagination. Exceptional directing can easily be seen from the detailed filming locations and backgrounds which are explained more than accurately on the ""special features"" -DVD.I had never actually noticed Tom Cruise's extreme acting abilities before ""Collateral"". Cruise gives the character Vincent a soul which could not have been given by any other actor (playing a bad guy was a brilliant way to show Tom's more serious side and his dedication to what he does) and same as Jamie's character Max. What could be more brilliant than putting a philosophic, and slightly psychotic contract killer and a shy, vulnerable citizen in the same taxi cab having a conversation about life, death and everything between them?""Collateral"" is nothing like all other shoot-everything-up -movies. In Collateral there is philosophy, there is irony, there are exceptional characters and there is acting and direction which are the soul of the movie that should be in so many other films. Tom Cruise showed us what he is able to do when necessary and therefore I move him to my ""top 10 of actors"" -list, which already includes for example Christian Bale from ""American Psycho"", Al Pacino from ""Scarface"" and Johnny Depp from ""Edward Scissorhands"". 9 out of 10 stars.",Collateral
433,intothebluegreatness,"""Yo homie, is that my briefcase?""",10,15 May 2008,"Collateral is a nearly flawless, action, fast paced thriller with superb acting. It is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.The acting by the film's 2 stars, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is absolutely masterful. These 2 already phenomenal actors displayed an even higher notch of excellence in Collateral. Acting-wise, this is definitely one of the most indescribably amazing movies ever.The script is very simple, and could have been easily taken way too far, however, Michael Mann makes sure that the story is not overdone, and delivers a solid beginning, middle, and fabulous ending.I know I've already gone over the acting once, but Tom Cruise definitely deserves even more recognition. He plays a professional hit-man just the way it should be played, and more. A hit-man isn't like Rambo, a hit-man doesn't have 5 machine guns strapped to his back and over 50,000 rounds of ammunition. No, Tom Cruise displays a purely flawless performance about what a hit-man really is. A hit-man is supposed to be gentleman-like, and they are supposed to act as if they are going about their daily lives, even before a hit. Many people believe that Tom Cruise's character in the movie was mentally ill because of the way he seemed calm one minute and killed people the next, however he was doing nothing more than his job. It is almost like in a football game, if you are originally a nice person, and you step on the field, you become a killer. Tom Cruise, when doing his job, is a killer. When he is not, he is nothing more than a normal man. This is how great of a performance he delivered.Collateral opens up with a punch, and never lets up.

Make no mistake, I know Michael Mann is awesome and I knew the cast was good, but I wasn't expecting this film to be such a treat! Some things I noticed from the trailer that appeared to be possible strikes against proved very well used. This film knows exactly what to do with hand held digital cinematography.The story is a simple one. An LA cab driver who's letting life pass him by picks up the wrong fare. Cruise forces Foxx to take him around the city all night to perform various murders. The cops think Foxx is the murderer, but one detective doesn't buy it. The set up could have lead to a drab, standard action picture. A creative, naturalistic treatment results in a highly immersive, very enjoyable film. This film takes you to Los Angeles with complete texture- it's as if you're really there. The soundtrack is also awesome. The performances from the two leads are fantastic. All in all it is a thrilling and realistic film.And I wasn't joking when I said it's the best. No other film I've seen this year (and I've seen quite a few) can quite measure up to this one.

436,Triniman,refreshing thriller - Cruise and Foxx are excellent,8,6 August 2004,"4/5The premise sounds pretty dull, doesn't it? Tom Cruise plays a hit man who coerces a cab driver to drive him around LA to knock off five people. Jamie Foxx portrays the reluctant cab driver. Director Michael Mann proves that a compelling drama doesn't require an excess in plot, car chases or violence or humour. Much of the film takes place in the cab with Cruise and Foxx exchanging philosphies of life, goals and dreams. Foxx, a cabbie for 12 years, wants to save up to open a limo service. Cruise is more enigmatic about his past, but instead is a relentless, cold-blooded assassin. Still, he's not one-dimensional at all.Cruise is excellent as the laser-focused killer with taste. Witness the scene in the jazz club to see how good his taste in music is. He's not cocky like the mastermind bad guy in the first Die Hard, but he is cool confident and obviously emotionally detached from his victims. He doesn't care who they are since he's just doing his job. He also doesn't flash the million-dollar Cruise movie star smile.Jamie Foxx also performs well as the uncomfortable cabbie counterpoint to the Cruise character. He's just your average joe hoping to get ahead in life but obviously taking a long time to get there, just like most people.What's refreshing about this film is that it doesn't scatter the character development over too many players. The lack of comedic lines also reinforces the grittiness of the script. Michael Mann has produced a mostly believable thriller, that makes the competition look like cartoons for adults. Sure, there are stretches in the storyline but so long as you're prepared to gloss over them, this is a fine film. Collateral is also much better than Cruise's last film, the pretentiously bloated The Last Samurai. Anyone looking for a non-stop action film or a ""Lethal Weapon""-type film should look elsewhere.Review by Triniman.",Collateral

440,bldsimple2,Wow...,10,8 August 2004,"When was the last time you witnessed a scene of film violence that came off the screen as being so ""real"" it almost turned your stomach? I've seen them all and the closest I ever came was Johnny Depp's ""killing the cook"" scene in Once Upon A Time In Mexico.That doesn't even begin to hold a candle to one all-too-short sequence in the middle of Michael Mann's masterpiece ""Collateral.""Oh, sure, in my opinion ""Heat"" is a superior film, but when you have the combined forces of Pacino and DeNiro in your arsenal, how could you go wrong? No, ""Collateral"" nips closely at their heel's. Jaime Foxx and Tom Cruise put on a masterful two man show the commands your attention. You don't want to miss what Cruise's next trick will be...and what Foxx will have to do stay alive in the process.The plot is simple: Foxx is a cab driver who randomly picks up a fare (Cruise) who turns out to be a hitman cleaning up witnesses in a high profile drug trial. Although reluctant at first, even without the knowledge of the killings, Foxx decides to take on the all-night chauffeur job as a way to make a little extra cash. He quickly realizes he has made a mistake that could possibly kill him.Cruise's character is masterfully written. He's sly when he needs to be, violent and down-right mean when pushed and has a plan for everything. He knows exactly what the endgame of this night is going to be, even when obstacles are thrown at him...except for one.Coming from someone who spent the better part of 1986-97 hating the bulk of Cruise's work, ANY praise I can heap on this guy is going to be genuine. Sure, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise but his silver hair and confident delivery help us to forget the ""Jerry Maguires"" he's been in the past. In one explosively violent scene Cruise kills two street hoods who try to steal his briefcase containing all the information on his jobs. Without looking, Cruise administers a coup de gras shot on one of them with casual abandon. Never has Cruise looked more vicious than in that exact second.True praise however should be reserved for Jaime Foxx. This guy exploded on the dramatic scene in Oliver Stone's could-have-been-brilliant ""Any Given Sunday"" and then perfected his abilities in Michael Mann's biopic ""Ali."" If the trailers for this year's ""Ray"", the Ray Charles biopic, are any indication of what's to come, we could be smelling dual Oscar Nominations for this guy. Foxx comes across as a young Samuel L. Jackson/Denzel Washington all rolled into one. He captures the true power of what an actor must do...react. Unfortunately for his character, that's all he can do...with one exception. Foxx's hesitation is the perfect Yin to Cruise confidant Yang. Their interactions are flawless. Watch the scene where Cruise forces Foxx to tell his boss off over the cab radio. It's never under the penalty of death...just one imposing his will over another. The power of peer pressure.And where's my praise for Michael Mann? Right here: Shooting his beloved L.A. in Digital Video? Brilliant. His casting of Jada Pinkett Smith (an actress I hate) as the lawyer whom Foxx develops a desire for? Outstanding (first movie I have liked her in). His unorthodox framing methods that defy the norm for cinematography? True to form. His usual stock of supporting characters? Exceptional (Peter Berg was an interesting surprise).But it all comes back to that moment. That one single solitary second of neo-reality filmmaking that made my stomach churn. The moment, like Johnny Depp's executing the cook, where digital video actually makes cinema murder leap off the screen like a snuff film. Be ready for it, it might stop your heart.",Collateral

I am quite a big fan of his films but no other actor could ever have pulled this role off.I was lucky to be in such a welcome crowd in the cinema I watched this film in. I think everybody thoroughly enjoyed the film. There were many occasions where the whole cinema were in hysterics from some of the funnier comments made in the film. This definitely made the film easier to watch, especially as the cinema was packed being it an advanced preview.The whole story was structured cleverly and everything was put together in all the right places.

442,rchadwi@hotmail.com,I know it's way too late to comment but...,2,12 April 2005,"Just in case anyone is tempted to rent the DVD and spend 2 hours watching this inexplicably highly-acclaimed movie? Do yourself a favor and rent ""Heat"" again! I like Michael Mann movies...I heard a lot of good buzz about this one. None of the buzz is warranted. I think critics get all agog whenever a comedian does a serious role or something, or maybe Foxx is just riding a wave, but in any case everything about this movie is disappointing. Disappointing, boring, implausible - these are deserving terms for this movie. It's not ""junk"", it's just...everything I just said.First, the acting is NOT that great. The single scene where Foxx has to re-retrieve the memory chip is notably good. Besides that there's no material here for an actor to display his/her chops. The very PREMISE falls so many times - the cabbie not simply running off from the start, the ending that is SO GIVEN AWAY by Foxx's first fare, the cops not arresting/detaining the two upon being stopped after the first hit, the fact that Cruise's character doesn't simply kill Foxx off once the latter destroys his entire briefcase. All insanely unbelievable.But...assuming that you can ""suspend disbelief"" for all of this, just to wait for the payoff ending? Nothing! Cruise's character is this remarkably efficient assassin throughout - deadly accuracy, ability to focus on his target in chaos (the club scene near the end) - all that goes down the tubes as he guns for the last victim (Foxx's initial fare). I mean, one chick in an otherwise empty building ELUDES him?!?! WTF! And then in the very end, Cruise gets a heart, or loses heart, or..something! And he spouts that cheesy line from the beginning of the film and....expires. Doesn't even die, just expires.And the viewer looks at his watch and realizes two hours have passed with nothing to show for it. Not even worth water-cooler talk.",Collateral
443,Illogic,Surprisingly good,7,28 December 2005,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I don't think of Tom Cruise as an action movie kind of guy, even though he's been in films like Days of Thunder and that fighter pilot movie. When I saw he was in this film I was expecting it to suck. However, Cruise pulled off a very sophisticated and cold hit-man character, at least for the first half of the film. Jamie Foxx also did well as the nervous cab driver who becomes Cruise's unwitting accomplice. It's great to see that Foxx can do more than comedy. Foxx gives, in my opinion, a great dramatic performance in this movie.Unfortunately, by about three quarters of the way through the movie, the characters start to, well, change. Cruise's character in particular loses much of the cool that was so appealing. What we are left with by the end of the movie is a clichéd good guy / bad guy chase scene. But don't let this deter you from seeing the movie.Last, the cinematography in this movie is beautiful. Everything takes place at night and most of the movie is outside, with the main characters in the cab. I found the movie to be visually stunning.This isn't an edge of your seat thriller. You won't be biting your nails wondering what is going to happen next. But it is a lot of fun.",Collateral
444,AutoXFan22,Very good movie,9,12 March 2005,"Without going into too much detail, this movie kept me guessing all the way. Lots of twists and turns I didn't expect.I still can't quite take Tom Cruise seriously as a hit-man, but I'll learn to accept it eventually, because he did a pretty darn good job of playing the ultimate cold-blooded ****. I don't know what it is, but he just plays a role like this so naturally, it's almost scary. I guess it's a testament to his skill as a actor.Jamie Foxx, though I don't like him in general, did a decent job as a flustered cab driver trying to make it through his night in one piece. In a way, I think Foxx is the perfect compliment to an anti-hero like Vincent the hit-man.Anyway, real good movie, very well made.",Collateral

Then comes fare #2 for the night.That's when the action starts.I loved the concepts, and how it was shot.Unfortunately, it does not maintain your interest as the film goes on. Had they left out the 4th witness, and there the long drawn out club shooting spree scene, it would have been OK.All in all it's a film worth seeing, but not one for the collection.",Collateral
446,wxid,Stylish yet largely predictable and uninvolving.,6,9 November 2004,"Collateral deals in the dark and violent world of Vincent (Cruise) a hit man out to remove a handful of key people from this life, and Max (Foxx) as the unlucky cab driver brought into this world by a collection of bad luck and unlikely coincidences.Opening with a teasing sequence involving Vincent at the airport, Collateral's subtlety ends with this slightly ambiguous scene and the questions it poses about Vincent's intentions. After this, Collateral presents a distinctly blunt plot blunted further with needless exposition.We are first presented with Max as he picks up customer Annie (Smith). This evolves into a half-hearted scene intended to build some form of connection between the two, in order to have this connection serve as a plot turn point later in the movie. However, whilst Foxx does an admirable job as the well-meaning, genuinely nice cab driver, Annie simply falls insignificantly into the background. Later in the movie, when Vincent's scheme ultimately comes to involve her, Annie remains a blank and unengaging character. Smith gives little in her performance, but to be fair there is little in Annie for her to work with, and the character is really disposable.Collateral is really about Vincent and Max. Everyone else is incidental, and in many cases superfluous.Max discovers Vincent's profession early on. It's rather hard to miss as a body falls from the fourth floor window onto his cab and Vincent calmly responds to Max's incredulous query with a dismissive 'I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him'. The body is stuffed into the taxi's boot  an out of character action for Vincent designed purely to create not one but two extremely contrived scenes later on. At this point Max is held as both hostage and driver while Vincent passes through LA on his quest to kill four more victims. Vincent and Max develop a curious relationship, with Max becoming surprisingly open at times and Vincent offering stark commentary about Max, about people, and about the universe. Collateral is about the differences between the two  on the one hand we have Max's good beardedness, lack of genuine ambition, and earnestness, while on the other we have Vincent's brutal, amoral, nihilism. During the course of the movie Max develops somewhat, and at one point in particular you can see the change occur.Foxx does a surprisingly good turn as the naive and frightened Max, with characterisation that almost makes you believe the changes that happen. Cruise too gives Vincent a suitably brutal portrayal and becomes a decent villain.There is a parallel, but lesser, plot involving the inevitable police and federal investigations but really this serves only to add unnecessary exposition to what we can clearly see with our own eyes. The involvement of some shallow, ineffectual, police figures does little to enliven the movie and in truth they are all but ignored.What Collateral really has going for it is style. This is perhaps not surprising given that director Michael Mann is of course famous for 80s style icon Miami Vice. Here he makes wonderful use of night-time LA, framing shots which simply ooze style and character. Both the wide vistas of streetlight lit LA, and the narrow focused shots of signs and lights evoke a strong sense of place. A highlight is certainly the climactic hunt in a darkened office, but again this is due to the flair of the shot, and to a lesser extent to Cruise's Vincent, rather than anything much else.Where Collateral fails is in the story and, to a lesser extent, in the secondary characters. Everyone other than Max and Vincent are really props, not people. They are set items used to push along the plot in predictable and expected ways. There is no development within any of them  though given the minimal screen time for any beyond the two principals this is hardly surprising. As a result they come across as flat and dull. We are perhaps not truly intended to care about Annie (Smith) and her fate, but rather Max and his. The problem with this approach is that we know what the fate of both of them will be from the moment that Annie climbs into Max's cab.Collateral has significant style. It offers spectacle and an occasional glimpse at excellence but mostly falls flat under a predictable plot which sags under the weight of the contrivances put in place to make it work. For Mann's next movie one can only hope that there is someone to help bolster the style with some real substance.6.5/10",Collateral
447,thespian57,snoozer of a plot and lousy acting leave thriller flat,2,30 December 2005,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Tom Cruise makes a sloppy hit man and the movie ends literally because he runs out of bullets. First off, no hit man in his right mind would use the same vehicle time after time. Do ya think that would put the cops and feds hip to him? well duh!!! Then he screws up his whole shtick by dumping a body on top of the van then putting it in a trunk! for crying out loud is this laurel and Hardy or what?In another plot hole, Cruise obviously offs his target with a silencer but then takes out two thugs with a gun loud enough for us to hear cop cars coming blocks away!!! Come on ! use the silencer for crying out loud.. Then the car crash! No one could have walked out of that crash without at least a broken bone but both of them act like it was a walk in the park! And who heard of four unarmed cops chasing a killer in a crowded disco? Cruise takes all four of them out of course with the same gun he's used since the beginning of the movie.In another scene in the hospital he sets his briefcase down half a room away, conveniently next to Foxx who then bolts with it! Of course Cruise has the stuff he needs on a palm pilot...we knew that but what we didn't know is why he needed the case in the first place!Yes this comment contains many spoilers but only about as many as this terrible film has plot holes.... sorry about that",Collateral

The writing, direction, and acting are all top notch. This is one of Tom Cruise's best performances. It ranks right there with ""Rain Man"", ""Minority Report"", and ""The Last Samurai"" as his most accomplished works. For Jamie Foxx this is easily his best film. I have not yet seen him in ""Ray.""

451,dreed444,very disappointing,2,20 February 2005,"This film held my attention for about 20 minutes, then it was one absurdity after another; one convenient plot manipulation after another that caused me to lose any semblance of interest. First: no cabbie would have such total independence from the dispatcher - we hear from the dispatcher twice - the first time he gets chewed out by Cruise (yeah, like THAT is going to happen) and the second time to relay that Foxx's mother called. Absurd. Anyone that's been in a cab, much less DRIVEN one, would know that you just don't drive around L.A. all night without checking in or there would be hell to pay not to mention cops looking for you. Cabbies get robbed and/or killed all the time, their disappearance would not go undetected. Second: the body left in the trunk - did Cruise just sort of space out that teeny piece of evidence? Third: good thing a neutron bomb hit L.A. that night so there was no traffic hardly anywhere. Uh huh. It's so helpful that targets in dark, noisy clubs sit where there is bright white light on them so they can be seen clearly not to mention the ease with which our main characters get away in the midst of the (eventual) chaos as the club empties out; the coyotes/wolves crossing the street, the subsequent awful musical interlude, the pseudo-psychological banter between killer and driver were enough to make me roll my eyes. ...And the list just goes on and on. This is not an adult thriller unless you're on meds that dull the senses. This is a mess of a film in spite of the acting being good -- the writing is just sloppy. There is nothing here that Hitchcock would appreciate, as some would assert. Hitchcock had plot conveniences and ""coincidences"" that would seem implausible, but in the hands of a Master, they were pulled off...not here, though. This is a good example of American cinema: ""people don't want anything serious to think about, they just want to be entertained for a couple of hours"". Rent this if you must, but for me, it is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.",Collateral
452,jjohnson2400,Can I rewrite this please?,5,9 October 2012,"OK, I generally liked this movie, at least I wanted to like this movie but it was really difficult to look past some of the more ludicrous plot points.I mean if your goal is to be stupid and make sure you die, you'd pretty much do what this guy did throughout the whole movie. This is one of those movies where your constantly left asking: ""Why did you do that? No one would do that.""I realize it doesn't make much of a movie for someone to figure out immediately how to get out of this contrived situation but still, the writers could have at least tried to create something a bit more compelling.Also, the prosecutor for the case was on his hit list who happened to take the same cab as the hit-man does, within minutes of each other. Setting aside the absurd level of coincidence that would take, why would they want to kill the prosecutor? They're not witnesses. I'm sure they'll find another prosecutor!Watched this movie last night and my mind has a few more observations/issues with this movie:1. Immaculate Discovery - as is pretty much required in this genre/level of writing for this movie, the bad guy miraculously and immediately knows exactly where the main POWER cables for the entire building are and is able to chop through it with a convenient axe.2. Good thing that modern buildings aren't supplied with back up power generation or something...3. Off the grid - Also convenient that this is the ONE large building in LA that is entirely off the grid so that a complete power loss event wouldn't trigger a call to, you know, the POLICE of Fire Department or something.4. The Lone Ranger - OK so she's prosecuting this HUGE case and four of HER witnesses just got murdered. No one of the many federal agents working on HER case think to call her and maybe send some, you know, protection for her!5. The Lone Ranger - Part II - I know the government has limited budget. How convenient that she's the only prosecutor working on this case. She's only trying to bring down a major cartel. I'm sure the government sends only one lawyer to work the case.6. The lonely employee - what a bummer that major business buildings have only one employee working at them in the evening! Especially ones where prosecutors working on sensitive cases involving the drug cartels work! And this one employee gets killed so I guess no one can, you know, call the police or something. Too convenient for the bad guy!Well, there's lots more fun in store too but don't want to spoil it or nothing!",Collateral

It would be nice to see him take on more roles where he's not the squeaky clean guy.I think other than Born On The Fourth of July, this is Tom at his best. There were moments in the film, when he didn't speak a word, but his facial expressions said it all. The scene in the Jazz club was one of the most intense moments in the film. Jamie Foxx has come along way since ""In Living Colour."" Foxx was excellent. This by far was one of the best movies of 2004",Collateral
455,spock-billy-spike,Surprisingly The Worst Movie I've Seen In A While,6,19 March 2015,"Where do I start with this mess. I wasn't impressed by Foxx's performance at all, and Jada Smith's minor character was one dimensional. Cruise did relatively well, but failed to bring any sort of humanity to his character, some better writing would have helped. The music was terrible, the 'dramatic' scenes in the taxi driving through the city at night looked straight out of a music video. The plot was okay in theory, but was a mess of coincidences the more you watch. How two of the main characters in the movie, (who also didn't know each other before), rode Max's taxi DIRECTLY AFTER EACH OTHER amazes me. Women also don't give their cards to random taxi drivers, and i could talk for hours about Cruises aim (good for the targets, sh*t at the final scene because the screen writers wanted it). The directing was mediocre, expected shots at expected times, it was all the coincidences that really angered me. The entire movie is one huge coincidence and it doesn't play out well, the ending was expected and cliché and save your time to watch something decent (American History X, There Will Be Blood, for gods sake even Mission Impossible because at least that franchise knows its ridiculous)",Collateral
456,dan_delago,Acting at its Finest,10,12 March 2005,"Now let's talk about a great character-driven movie. Jamie Foxx's performance of Max the cab driver is a fine performance. What makes it so compelling is that you really are rooting for this guy. You want him to succeed.On the other hand, there is Tom Cruise as Vincent. He plays a psychopath. It is a clean performance. It is pure acting genius. He performs this acting job like a surgeon performing a heart operation. That is all I am going to say because I do not want to give away what he does in the film. This is one of the true joys of the film. The fact that Tom Cruise doesn't get to play the bad guy that often. It must be fun to play the bad guy in a film.Jada Pinkett Smith should get honorable mention too. She plays a key role in the film but she is so good and subtle it's easy to overlook her fine performance. She is also easy on the eyes and as Marth Stewart always says, ""That's a good thing!"" Another overlooked actor in the film is Mark Ruffalo who plays a detective. He is destined to become one of our best character actors in film. His range is incredible and scary. This guy can handle just about anything put on his plate.Finally, Michael Mann is one of our best directors when it comes to action movies. Without his vision, this movie would not have the suspense that makes it so brilliant. I also want to point out the setting in the film. Most of the film is shot on location in Downtown LA. If you have ever been to downtown LA, you will see a sharp contrast between affluence and decadence in the way the city is laid out. Mann shows us the flash of LA and as well as the gritty underbelly. There is a scene at a night club that is amazing because the music is pulsating to the beat just like the characters are pulsating in the scene.

Max and Vincent, played to perfection by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, are main characters, opponents and complementary opposites all at the same time. The film makes the unusual but effective decision of having the two opponents in the same spot for most of the film (inside Max's taxi), and this closeness prepares the ground for the exchanges between Max and Vincent, both actually noticing their problems this way and teaching each other (however, only one of them really learns). Despite its great atmosphere and impressive shootout scenes, Collateral is really about bad choices and missed chances. It's the story of two people with very different lives and morals who are dissatisfied deep down with what their choices resulted for them, and are looking for a way out whether under the guise of avoidance or adaptation.

460,selfedluke,"Great directing, unlimited plot holes and average story",7,29 July 2020,"There are a few gems that stood out to me in this movie

-The brutal realism of the ally-way shootout scene
-The coyote street crossing moment for it's insanely moving direction by Mann
-A couple of Cruise/Fox's conversations about work and life
The pacing/momentum of the middle actIt's too bad though that this is one of the most unbelievable, annoying, and downright weird plots I've seen in a thriller. A professional hitman woudl roll his eyes at nearly everything Cruise does in this movie besides his cool professionalism in terms of personality.Usually you have to suspend your belief a bit in movies, but the amount of times your expected to do so in what is supposedly a bleak/realist thriller is insulting. Plot holes aside, the ending act (last thirty minutes) becomes very boring as the story veers off into a incredibly unbeleivable good-guy gets bad guy moment and saves the girl.

461,benihana83,Great movie and great performances,9,19 April 2005,"Michael Mann has been making epic action films for years, yet he has never really gotten his due as a director. While his latest endeavor, Collateral, didn't break the mold, it was certainly one of the crowning works of the year. Tom Cruise stars as Vincent, a contract killer making his rounds one fateful night in Los Angeles. When he offers a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) $600 to drive him around for the night, things take a turn for the worst.Collateral has one of the most original action screenplays in recent memory. Much of the movie is contained within the cab and the scenes outside of it are stylish and packed with emotion. Cruise delivers a strong performance out of his usual character as the silver-haired assassin. Months of training with gun-slinging definitely paid off for Cruise in terms of realism, especially during the club and alleyway scenes. There's never a point in this movie where you feel like you're watching Tom Cruise. It's always ""Vincent"" on the screen, and sometimes that's a hard thing for actors to pull off.Foxx gives his second stellar performance of the year as Max, a shy, ineffectual cabbie with dreams of something more. While he earned most of his acclaim for a stunningly accurate portrayal of Ray Charles in the biopic Ray, he deserves just as much credit for his role here. Foxx really put in his background work, as evidenced by his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The nomination for Foxx was deserved, even though this was a starring role. It's obvious the Academy wanted to give him two nominations for his great work this year, so they categorized his performance in Collateral as ""supporting,"" which often happens with successful movies. For example, Kate Winslet, nominated for her starring performance this year in Eternal Sunshine, was also a contender for a Best Supporting Actress role in Finding Neverland, even though she was the film's lead actress.While the lead actors do give great performances in Collateral, the real star is Mann, who should have been recognized this year for his directorial work. Mann has a knack for finding that special angle in every place he films, be it Los Angeles or Africa. The shots of L.A. are brilliant and the pace and editing are magnificent. It is Mann's attention to detail that really makes this picture amazing. He specializes in giving his actors background information on feelings, emotions and past events not necessarily evident to the viewer. This makes every tiny detail and facial expression relevant and affecting. The audience always feels like there's something more going on in each character's head.Mann has directed almost 20 films, but his only Oscar nomination for directing thus far has been for 1999's The Insider. Some of his best overlooked works were 1995's Heat, starring Al Pacino and Robert Deniro and 2001's Ali, starring Will Smith, Foxx and Jon Voight.",Collateral

It looks as though a different and much worse director took over. In the end the movie is preety bad mainly because it is too stupid and cheesy. All this is coming from a guy who liked Kill Bill, Heat, Pulp Fiction, so don't think I don't like tough guy's movies.

463,lathesius,"In one word, stunning.",9,19 September 2004,"Ever since i saw the trailer for this film i have been waiting eagerly for its release, and it was no disappointment because Collateral is a film that grabs you right from its well written opening to its climatic ending.Tom Cruise plays Vincent, an greying, emotionless hit-man who arrives in LA to carry out five hits in one night. He meets up with cab driver max, a guy who dreams of ditching his mundane taxi job that he claims is just a stop gap (he's been doing it 12 years) to open up a limo service catering for the rich and famous. All goes well first off. Vincent tells Max that if he drives him around to his five stops he will pay good. Max is none the wiser until he takes Vincent unknowingly to his first hit. As he is parked in the alley waiting for him the dead guy falls out of the window and lands on Max's car, forcing Vincent to tell Max what he is and that if he doesn't do as he says he will kill him. This then takes us on one hell of a roller-coaster ride through the city of LA, as Max tries to figure out a way of getting out of a no win situation.Michael Mann chose the very wise decision of shooting his film on digital Video and it benefits from it. Somehow we capture the essence of the night better this way, whereas film wouldn't have had the same effect. We almost want to be creatures of the night while watching this film because it is so attractive. Michale Mann clearly loves the architecture of LA because he shows the city in all its neon lit glory, carefully placing a camera on the side of the taxi which gives us a beautiful view of the cityscape. It makes a change to see the actual city's Downtown rather than its outskirts.Cruise and Foxx's performances are second to none. Cruise's character is such an empty void but in a good way. At times his eyes seem to pierce your very soul and almost makes you shudder. In other hit men films the audiences either love him or hate him, yet in this film you don't know what to think. One one hand you say OK this man is a killer and feels nothing for his victims. He is completely emotionless. Yet at times you feel sorry for his character. You get the impression that he has no life and that he is a lonely man who has always known he will die a lonely man. He is driven by his work but not in a psychotic way. He is a man who gets things done no matter what the cost. Foxx's character is the same. He captures us with his knowledge and charisma. There is one scene where he chats up Jada Pinkett Smith who plays a lawyer. yet when she gives him her card he is obviously surprised and doesn't know what to do. He can talk the talk but he can't walk the walk, until he squares up to Vincent.The action moves along at a nice pace and the gun fight scenes work extremely well. But for once this is an action film that doesn't rely on countless gun battles and over the top stunts to keep us entertained. Just the banter that goes on between Man and Vincent keeps us glued to the screen. But when the fight scenes occur you are not disappointed, especially the nightclub shootout in which Vincent has to take out a target surrounded by bouncers and armed guards, not to mention the FBI.For those who love their film noirs and dark gritty movies this is a must. It is well directed, extremely well written and the cast also pull their weight throughout.

I usually dislike Tom Cruis' movies just because I think Tom Cruis is a bad actor. I had never even heard of Jamie Fox! Besides...with an exception of Die Hard I'm not much of an Action movie fan. So let's just say my expectations were really low. So I started watching this film and the more i watched it, the more i started to love it. I was pleasantly surprised! Even Tom Cruis had fine acting moments...but the star for me was Jamie Fox. What a performance! I hope he wins an Oscar either for this or for Ray because this was definitely his year!!! I thought this movie was very cleverly made, the script was witty and powerful. Performances were wonderful (I was actually scared of Tom Cruis!)... It was a great film and i look forward to seeing it. Maybe next time i won't be so jet-lagged! :)",Collateral
466,Johnny-Sack,A Contempory Classic,9,3 January 2005,"What looks like a very pretentious piece of studio action rubbish is actually one of the few films of the last five years that I personally would hold up as a classic. Of course it is easy to see how some could disagree but I feel some will agree. This was one of the best of last years mixed bag of offerings and is a truly impressive piece of work. With Tom Cruise using more than his boyish good looks and snow white smile to create a character he plays a killer with a subtle sense of relish and manages to create a very threatening character. Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett provide good work too but the real star of this film is Michael Mann. Mann is a great film stylist and this is arguably his most stylised effort yet. Using advanced DV he creates a visually arresting portrayal of his beloved LA and gives the scene's a raw quality that would, perhaps, not been as effective on film. The scene in the club where his use of action becomes very rough and gritty is superb and extremely enjoyable to view, especially on the big screen. There is also a strong independent style of film-making in the mood and design of this movie and that along with two stars being excellently cast against type (if you will) only further prove that this is a devilishly gritty and gripping portrayal of contempory LA. And one if not THE best film of last year.",Collateral
467,Schaumann_1,Did Tom just shoot that guy in cold blood?,7,16 November 2004,"I have to say as a first comment, that I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but this is maybe the turning point! Collateral is a movie born out of its environment, the night shoots of the city is absolutely stunning a Michael Mann trademark! The night in Los Angeles almost gets a myth-logic appearance. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx both plays roles that are not common to their repertoire. Cruise is fantastic as the hit-man Vincent, he plays it with such ruthlessness and authority, so hats of for Cruise. Jamie Foxx as the dedicated cabby Max is also a very strong character, Foxx shows that hes not only the loudmouth homeboy, but also a person with an debt in character that really won me over. all in all there's not much to say:7/10",Collateral
468,escctrlshift,Foxx vs. Cruise,9,12 June 2021,"Rarely are protagonist and antagonist so well cast, and also so well-scripted and directed as in this Michael Mann masterpiece. The action is taut, almost understated, never quite gratuitous although the accident sequence is a bit of a stretch in that regard. Cruise wields his character with chilling intensity, exuding almost a superhuman level of control. Unwitting hero Foxx chips away at him, cluelessly and then relentlessly. The soundtrack is first-rate, a host of well-selected, edgy tunes to savor. Climactic night club scene is maybe the very best of its kind ever filmed.",Collateral
469,werdnaoslek,My thoughts on Michael Mann's great film,9,22 June 2016,"Collateral is a movie from twelve years ago by Michael Mann and a great script by Stuart Beattie. It stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx and showcases LA like a painting.Collateral is a crime-drama/thriller about a cab driver named Max (played by Jamie Foxx) who is seasoned with his directional skills in LA territory. An unsuspecting Max has a hit-man named Vincent (played by Tom Cruise) in the back of his cab, paying Max a large sum of money to ensure that he takes him to five different locations and waits for him. Once Max learns that Vincent is a hit-man, Vincent takes him as a hostage and threatens to kill him if he does not drive him to all his stops, or in reality, all five of Vincent's targets. This movie had a few thrilling moments, but in between these is some really well-constructed dialogue. The screenplay is great, and I love the relationship between Max and Vincent. Most of the movie is them trying to make conversation in the taxi, usually by ridiculing each other for missed opportunities or no regard for consequences of actions. There is a lot of great character building in these scenes in the cab, where we learn more about these two men while they try to figure each other out at the same time. I also really liked to see Tom Cruise as the bad guy, after all being in heroic roles for the majority of his career.Michael Mann makes this film look absolutely gorgeous, with stunning shots of the LA skyline, and somehow essentially recreates LA to look extremely colorful and pretty. There was a lot of nice colors in this movie, like pale greens and washy blues. What impressed me with Collateral was how the film slowly winds up tension between these 2 characters. With each conversation they have, they start to resent each other more and more, and the final act of this movie was extremely well handled. The ending to this movie was perfect, and the resolution made sense. That being said, I didn't have that many problems with the movie, but one thing I would have liked to see would be the really good action scenes or intense moments spread throughout the movie more. The last thirty minutes of this movie are extremely fast paced, but they should have had more of these incredibly good scenes.The pacing in this movie is done well, they still could have added a few more action scenes to keep the audience interested. The dialogue in this movie is really smart, so the movie never dulls or feels boring. This movie was wild and unpredictable, and it had a genius concept for a movie.+ Great Character building - These intense moments could be more spread + Gorgeous setting and camera-work + Some well directed intense moments + Character interaction and dialogue really well written 9/10",Collateral
470,Nightscream,"Excellent thriller. Cruise, Foxx and Mann are at the top of their game.",8,6 August 2004,"This was a really entertaining movie.  Cruise excels at creating afrightening, intimidating killer, probably his first clear-cut villainousrole since `Taps'.  Jamie Foxx, in an interview I saw before seeingthis film last night, talked about how he was asked to `take it downa notch' so to speak, in order to play a simple, humble cab driver,and seeing the film proves he did that just well.  (As a side note, Isaw the trailer for `Ray' in front of `The Manchurian Candidate',which I went to after `Collateral', and just from the trailer, Foxx'sperformance looks like it might be an Oscar contender.)  MichaelMann's direction rises to its usual adroit level, and this was hisbest thriller since `Heat', full of close-up shots of characters andlingering shots that cause the heart to pump.  Stuart Beattie'sscript wisely creates that thriller that, not content with mere emptyaction, gets under the skin of its characters, using their lives andtheir weaknesses to create a rapport with the audience, evokingboth sympathy and tension.This was a great film.  I recommend it.",Collateral
471,MissMovieLuver88,a too long and disappointing film,9,9 February 2005,"The film starts off with Jada Pinkett-Smith's character meeting Jamie Foxx's character in his cab. I felt the beginning ruined the whole entire film for me; it was a pointless,dragged out scene that was too boring for me! What later followed was Tom Cruise,playing an unconvincing hit-man which was too OTT. Compared with the previous film i watched(The Bourne Supremacy) it hadn't lived up to my expectations of it at all!I can't understand why it was so long and why Jamie Foxx has been nominated for an Oscar???! He,along with Tom Cruise were both portraying their characters in a very unconvincing manner-Foxx was to much of a wimp, for me....I go on for agesOverall,a very disappointing film***/*****",Collateral
472,barrygermansky,The Best Action Film Of The Year,8,5 September 2004,"I'll be honest, before I actually saw this film, I thought it was going to be a mediocre action flick, but boy was I wrong! The acting in this movie is above average and the story is pretty good, even though the movie leaves some important questions unanswered. Director Michael Mann keeps the action moving along at a riveting pace and sticks in a funny line once in a while to brighten up the atmosphere.The plot concerns a hit-man (Tom Cruise) who picks a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to transport him to his next kills. We never do know exactly why Tom is killing all of these people, but we are lead on to believe that the victims are witnesses for an important trial. The best scene in the movie is when Tom throws a dead man's body on top of Jamie Foxx's taxi, it really surprises you and it will make you jump.This movie is Michael Mann's best action film yet, and it is far better than Manhunter. By no means is Collateral a mediocre action film, although by reading some of the other reviews, you might be inclined to think that. If you are going to see only one movie this summer, it should be Collateral.",Collateral
473,Borszczuk,Why you should watch this movie? I got no clue either.,3,21 March 2005,"I must admit it was my first time I trusted IMDb's user ratings and I badly loose. The movie rated 6 and up (and Collateral is now above 7) usually were at least good or semi-entertaining. Unfortunately, Collateral is neither good nor entertaining. The plot brings nothing new - mostly all the 'tricks' have been shown before. The idea bad guy vs. 'trapped' good guy is as boring as foreseeable plot of the movie (and seeing Jada in the very first scenes you know she'll be back as nobody hires a star to play for a minute). You don't have to be too bright to know how the story ends, who kills who, who's the last one and finally who wins. The main characters didn't make me carry they fate at all. No unexpected story twists. Nothing. Oops, no. I lied. We got something - vast amount of simply stupid situations - big shooting here - nobody can hit the target. big shooting - nobody hears - nobody calls the cops. Guy gets a bullet, lies unconscious. Next scene he runs as nothing has happened.I rated this move with 3 starts, as there have to be movies that deserve less, even this one is just a pure waste of time. I was very disappointed and bored and was glad seeing final credits scroller. The movie brings you simply nothing. It's B class movie at least, so it's a pity they forgot to put some Monster Spiders or kung-fu or naked chicks - it would justify high rating this movie earned here.",Collateral
474,snottyscotty150,"I am a cool guy, with a job I contracted to do.",8,19 May 2007,"Thats exactly what this film is, that one line sums it up. This is the only truly good film Micheal Mann film out there.From the trailers you can see that it's got two of the biggest names in films to this date, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, these two people in this film are what make it, and the story is so simple but yet such a ride. Micheal uses the same camera which he used to film Miami Vice but after watching and this you can tell that this is the better film.It's not too bad on the running time side either with only 110 minutes or so making it an easy film to watch. Still the film starts off in an airport with two men exchanging brief cases and this is what most of the film is around what is contained within that, in the next seen we meet Max an average cab driver who is played by the excellent Jamie Foxx, now as the tag of the film suggests it starts like any other night.After 15 minutes of not much happening the film suddenly moves into a world of it's own, as Max drops off a woman, who hes clearly pulled, by the name of Annie who is played by Jada Pinkett Smith (one of the only decent people in the Matrix sequels) still after dropping her off he meets Vincent who is played by Tom Cruise who just happens to be a contract killer who has to make several stops and a get away...who just happens to be Max.There are loads of excellent moments in the film when Jammie and Tom have some really good lines off each other, also some of the scenes in which Tom does go into his own and typical action hero he does it as amazing as always, such as the scene when he has to get back his brief case from some ""homies"".There is enough to keep you watching it and the ending is truly amazing, at some points however you do get abit ""x y z"" about the directing but nothing too bad and not as bad as in Manns next film Miami Vice which looked as if it was filmed for an A level media project. But the style of which he uses for this film works such as the shots in the car from PoV and the shots he uses of the fox...it just shows a whole other side to LA.However there is nothing really bad about this film it is after all what it was meant to be a high action thriller, there are some typical shoots in places but some really excellent ones such as the nightclub scene which Mann tried to copy at the opening of Miami but failed on so many levels its unreal.If you want to see a truly good film this this probably isn't for you since it's not the best but if you do however want to watch a film with a simple story and which has simple characters and is set mostly in a cab then this film is for you.",Collateral
475,bluestylus,"Cruise has stellar performance - everyone else, *Z*ero...",10,2 August 2005,"Tom Cruise delivers another stellar performance in Collateral. Unfortunately, he's the sole actor who sells the tickets. Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith are *horrible* actors -- especially the latter. The beginning of the movie crawls to a start. It's a snooze fest until Cruise enters the story line as the wild coyote-eyed assassin. Granted, the above-the-city cinematography is stunning, but the edits leave us dangling above the lights for far too long, boring the viewing audience. The dialogue between Cruise and Foxx for the most part is good, but the exchange between Foxx and Smith is torturous & tedious. The second shining performance is Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel. Too bad his part was so short... Folks, you had your money on the wrong pony -- I'd have hired a million Smiths to one Henley. The man is the complete package and wanting for nothing. The worst part of this film is the sub-story, or ""love"" story. I tried to be patient, but ended up skipping most of it. Please, don't insult your audience, directors! Who would believe Smith could hire a taxi, become seduced by the driver far enough to offer her card (she's a prosecutor, for crying out loud), and then she ends up being the last target of the assassin in the same cab, who Foxx rescues. Even trying to play the ""destiny"" card flops, it's just too ridiculous. And what an X through the credibility of strong female characters in movie-land. Is this the 70s or what? Definitely not a 2004 plot line with such a lame spin. To cap it, the movie's ending was as boring and stupid as its beginning. This garbage ending has only one gem - that's the Cruise line maxing out on the subway (note: teleology works here). Otherwise, the whole story is a royal tosser.",Collateral

It hurts man's intelligence! And reason for Tom Cruise's behavior: he had poor childhood, he grow up in foster homes!? So mediocre! And he is so alienated and wary about it that Jamie Foxx in the end really feels sorry for him. I didn't expect this from Michael Man, although ""Ali"" is a weak movie and ""Insider"" is overrated. But ""Manhunter"" and ""Last of the Mohicans"" were great films, and ""Heat"" is also very very good piece of work. That's long and short of it, I mean of ""Collateral"".",Collateral
478,ganrush2,Starts good - Ends bad,5,29 December 2004,"Heard a few good comments about this movie. Decided to rent it. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx keep it interesting for quite some time. Somewhat believable dialogue and good direction abound. About three quarters of the way through, it goes right to the toilet. I thought I'd share a few scenes that ruin the entire film.The Fever dance club scene. At least 30 cops or bodyguards, armed to the teeth are in this place. Tom Cruise's character begins shooting people on a (by this time) half empty dance floor and not ONE of these guys can get a shot at him.Foxx's character crashes his cab doing at least 60 mph, rolling the vehicle. They crawl out, with only a few scratches and end up running down the street.Downtown Los Angeles. The streets are EMPTY in every direction as far as you can see. I don't care if it takes place at 4 A.M. This isn't Portland, Maine.. it's LA. I'm guessing there'd be quite a few cars and people around.On the 16th floor of the building. Foxx saves the lawyer from Cruise, the two take the elevator down. Cruise goes for the stairway. Cruise manages to make it down 16 flights of stairs maybe 5 seconds after the elevator arrives.Sorry, one of the worst finishes I have ever seen in a movie. Cruise and Foxx's decent (not great) acting is the only thing that saves this movie's ending from ruining the entire thing.",Collateral
479,samfran94,Tom Cruise with grey hair? - It works!,8,3 May 2013,"Always been a fan of Michael Mann's movies (Heat, Ali etc) so thought 'Collateral' would be a good watch for me. I wasn't disappointed.I really enjoyed the movie it works as both an action movie, and a psychological thriller in my opinion with plenty of suspense, plot twists, high speed car chases and one awesome nightclub shootout.The film follows Max (Jamie Foxx) a humble cab driver as he makes his rounds in LA only to pick up the mysterious passenger Vincent (Tom Cruise). Eager to start his own business and in need of the cash Max reluctantly accepts Vincent's offer to drive him around town for the night so he can 'close a few deals'. But Max quickly learns that these 'deals' are not all they seem and neither is Vincent, and the film becomes a race against time as Max tries to correct his mistakes and save lives he has put in jeopardy including his own!Really good cast for this film, supporters including Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg and Marc Ruffalo, playing a detective connecting the dots and realising there's something unusual about this case. Tom Cruise does well in a rare role as the villain, and has good on screen chemistry with Foxx which is vital considering most of the move revolves just around the two of them sitting in the cab.With some brilliant shots of downtown LA, high octane action sequences, tense encounters and a solid script; I would recommend 'Collateral' to anyone who likes movies that are unpredictable, exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat.Only downside in my opinion is that the dialogue can be a little shifty or mumbled making the movie a little hard to follow on occasions, but apart from that a really great watch!P.S. If you've seen the movie, can you believe they originally wanted Adam Sandler to play the role of Max? Me neither.",Collateral
480,racedowling,Just Annoying,5,13 March 2005,"Warning. SPOILERS! Come on folks, an 8? I'm willing to suspend some disbelief with an action film, but the plot just totally strained credulity. The film is just a grade B thriller/crime drama with better than average production values. There really isn't much to it besides the plot, so one would think that it would have a few unexpected twists and turns, but NOOO, the plot just plays out like a hackneyed crime novel. Their one attempt at theme where Vincent tells Max that he's never going to get his dream was the rather sophomoric. No S**T? That was obvious for anyone with an IQ over 80 ten minutes into the film. It was like the writers had to strain to be obvious and then to be absolutely sure you got it, they had to also tell you!The icing on the cake for this film was the awful ending where Annie (a FEDERAL PROSECUTOR) leaves the scene of a crime. Does she try to notify the BART police, or the station master or even prop open the door of the train to keep the train from moving? NO! She and Max just walk away and allow the now deceased Vincent to ride on to the next station. SHEESH! And how about that federal building? Does anyone really believe that federal buildings are so carelessly guarded? Just try getting into one some day. They always have a team of federal police on hand to prevent that very thing from happening. This was worse than another Tom Cruise film ""Mission Impossible"" where they easily got into CIA headquarters by posing as firemen. What a joke! I give it a 5 because it was worth the 5 bucks for OnDemand, but I'd be rather disappointed if I'd Spent $20 to see it at a theater.",Collateral
481,ajb073,"Stunning, Skillful and Chilling",9,1 February 2005,"COLLATERAL exceeded my expectations on many fronts. The filming techniques used by directer MICHAEL MANN were enough alone to intrigue me. MANN's unique camera angles, movement, lighting, music, and sound establish the unifying chilling tone existent throughout the film.Before viewing COLLATERAL, I was aware that it had been deemed ""Oscar material"" (which doesn't say much, considering the quality of the vast majority films released this year). I also approached COLLATERAL with the assumption that JAMIE FOXX's cabbie character's sole function would be to serve as an excuse for TOM CRUISE's character to attract the attention and praise from the movie through overdone action sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to find strong performances from both CRUISE and FOXX in a stunning, stylistic and skillfully executed film. JAMIE FOXX takes the role of a soft cabbie, who lies to his mother about his success in life, and is afraid to women for their numbers after intimate conversations in his cab. However as COLLATERAL progresses, FOXX's cabbie grows stronger and develops confidence and self trust.CRUISE is Vincent; the ultra-cool stylistic hit man. He wears the shades, the suit, and the hair. He offers a chilling performance as he transforms Max's (JAMIE FOXX) life, and everyone he so-professionally executes along the way. The dialogue between CRUISE and FOXX is innovative and boasts some memorable and comic lines.With that said COLLATERAL is a well above average thriller, with an interesting plot, characters, and some well done action and chase sequences. COLLATERAL is a good bet, well worth its 9/10.",Collateral

Collateral has the spark of amazing actors who have done great in there process, but in the end the movie becomes unmeaningful. Some people might disagree with me and say that the action in the movie was good and enough to amaze people, but in my opinion it was a movie which starts off good and ends horribly without completing all our expectations.

Cruise portrays Vincent (the hit-man) perfectly as a dark mysterious man and Foxxs Max is portrayed perfectly as a man who is kept in the unknown and is very concerned for his own well being and, later on, a lawyers. The film itself is brilliant. The directing was obviously top notch. I've never really gotten into crime thrillers but this I'll make an exception for this film. Recommend for crime/thriller fans.

As we move through the evening with Vincent dispatching bodies around LA,being driven by Max,an unlucky cab driver, played compassionately by Jamie Foxx, this thriller becomes annoying as the plot holes get exposed. Why would the skilled Vincent continue to ride around in a cab with a dented roof and smashed windshield (already stopped once by cops because of the defects,)with cars and helicoptors on his tail? Max has almost unlimited opportunities to escape or warn the police but takes none of them. Indeed even in the final subway scene with shots abounding and passengers agape,nary a cop or even a siren appears at the various stops.Putting aside the incredible coincidence of Max separately picking up the killer and one of his intended victims during his shift in a city with a fair number taxicabs on the streets, can anyone not foresee who the 5th and last victim is to be? In sum, a potentially clever plot but too many unrealistic lapses reduces this film to just a bloody night in LA.",Collateral
485,hall10000,MANN of the moment.,9,17 September 2004,"MICHAEL MANN is not the prolific type a la TAKESHI MIKE but when he strikes he leaves a mark, is not the stories neither the characters is the style that pours from every single frame of his movies that makes him one of the most respected filmmakers alive. Three of the best movies of the nineties are gangsters related, to chose between them would be as difficult as choosing between REVOLVER, the WHITE album or ABBEY ROAD, so different so unique, I will always go for the dark horse that is HEAT anyway because of the strange sense of being presented something that is real. COLLATERAL is the story of Max (FOX) a dreamer trapped in a cab that is going to have the ride of his life when Vincent (CRUISE) steps in with an offer he can't refuse, 600 dollars, 5 stops, one night. This tale has it's flaws as did the third act on HEAT but those are forgiven when the picture is taken as a whole, the eternal struggle between story VS rhythm. One of the right moves of the movie is the casting against the type, we get the comedian playing the straight man and Mr fantastic goes in the shoes of the hit man making everyone but the police sympathetic towards the audience. CRUISE pulls it off majestically shooting bullets and one liners like there is no tomorrow, the silk grey suit with hairstyle to match didn't hurt either and he ain't no punk, articulated, cultured and has a point, sometimes one too many. The best description of Vincent comes from CRUISE talking about himself ""I never act in terms of what people will think"" that is embrace by his character and made a philosophy of life. Is not the first time that MANN's makes us like the bad guy, in fact he has made it usual themes, from McCauley in HEAT to Hannibal Lecter in MANHUNTER, whose BRIAN COX portrait is consider to this very day the best by many, we fight our own devils to discern what is right from wrong. The cast hides a couple of surprises, the bad , the roadrunner chasing the coyote is MARK RUFFALO, closer to a Mickey mouse impersonation whose face reads I got wood all over, the good, JAVIER BARDEM enters the movie frightened as the Hollywood outsider but finishes on top his five minutes of glory and the ugly... PETER BERG. STUART BEATTIE, the writer, considered ROBERT DE NIRO for the part of the TAXI DRIVER but that idea was dropped early on because he was considered too old for the role or maybe is just because he would have blown CRUISE out of the water ""you talking to me"". MANN shifted the story from NY to LA, where night-clubs are guarded by men with guns and bullet proof vests and nobody knows anybody, asking for help will get you in more troubles you can handle... bringing us the ""funniest"" and most satisfying scene of the film, the saddest is jazz scored. Shoot almost entirely on digital, LA night looks great giving great expectations to the format. Now to confuse you all I'll reveal that COLLATERAL ends where HEAT starts and begins where the other ends, deja vu... I Ching, whatever man we got a roll with it. My movie of the year.*****",Collateral

This movie fires on all cylinders even with a momentum to build towards the end. It's visually appealing to watch, the story is simple but solid, and the acting is superb. I've noticed when the movie is rewatched there's always more details I find myself appreciating and I can see why this has become almost a cult classic. It's truly a hidden gem for those who have forgotten or haven't seen it.The nightclub scene will always be my favorite part of the movie and the soundtrack was perfect for it.I highly recommend watching this movie and giving it a chance!

Foxx especially makes a quantum leap from In Living Colour to this sensational performance. Cruse also was hardly recognized as he made a huge departure from anything he has done before. The character development was well thought out. Cruse pulls off ashizo character that shifts effortlessly back and forth. The scene with the Jazz musician was most fascinating. Foxx has his own character development elevated due solely to Vincent getting him to realize nothing can be put off in the short time we call life.",Collateral
488,villanwilson87,A Quiet Masterpiece,10,17 October 2007,"Another Michael Mann picture, another masterpiece. After watching this film and if you are a Michael Mann fan particularly, you will love this film. This film is related to Mann's previous and best masterpiece 'Heat'. In this film, you have two actors who basically meet at the wrong place, wrong time, and are then in the film together throughout. The acting is second to none due to both of the leading actors and that's typical Michael Mann, because he never picks a wrong screening pair in any of his films, just look at The Insider, Heat, Miami Vice, Manhunter.I would like to add mainly in this comment about the performance from Tom Cruise who was nothing more than 'outstanding' and personally his best film, no-one would have predicted him to pull off a bad guy role because his acting roles have been mainly good guys. But Tom Cruise in his role excels because its a completely different role for something that he wanted to challenge and be known as a versatile actor, and should have deserved an Oscar nomination. Cruise is simply cool with the shades and suit that he wears in the film and the way he picks off his victims, and also frightening towards the end of the film which when you watch would never predict from Tom Cruise.Lets not forget that without Jamie Fox in this film Tom Cruise wouldn't have pulled it off because he is also excellent as he plays a typical good guy character trying to stop Cruise at all costs and this is why he deserves his Oscar nomination. The chemistry between the pair is excellent throughout the film when they either argue to each other are in normal conversation, its like watching two guys who are actually friends. This is what you don't see in Heat, you had two of the greatest actors of all time with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, they were both only in two sequences in the film and although both sequences are hair-raising you wanted more, and this is what you see in Collateral.The cinematography and camera work is excellent, the scenery and score as always from Mann breathtaking and which i adored just as much in Heat. The action sequences are so realistic, clever and breathtaking its as though you are actually watching something real. The gun's that are used in this film, Heat and Miami vice are the same and what makes it sound like a 'Beirut' attack with the sound effects used. This is what makes Michael Mann such a well accomplished director of his generation and is up their with the likes of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron.Towards the end of the film, the final sequence is so similar to what was in Heat between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro because it turns into a cat and mouse chase sequence and deciding on who's faith lies between the characters of Vincent and Max, and it actually makes you sympathise with Vincent's role as he is trying to do his job but actually has a human connection, like it was for Neil McCauley's character in Heat. And when the film ends its actually quite a mixed emotional moment.This is why it is such a great film and deserves to be a ten out of ten classic!",Collateral
489,tim_sf3,the cinematography is the best part of the film,4,24 July 2005,"sorry Michael Mann. I loved Heat beyond words and still think it's one of the 3 best films in motion picture history.Collateral is basically about an unbelievable character (played by Tom Cruise whose acting abilities are in dire need of help) who, for some reason out of the blue, hijacks a cabbie and makes him drive around Los Angeles.That's about it. Just as I was about to turn it off, because it was going nowhere, the movie devolved into some story involving some predictable thugs who had some part in the film.Basically it turns out that Cruise really is some badass who forms some kind of ""bond"" with Foxx. Problem is, Cruise is not scary. In the scenes when he is trying to be bad, I laughed.Anyway I'm not gonna waste any more time on how bad this film is.I will say the cinematography is the best part of the film. The urban landscape is spectacular, rivaling and sometimes beating Heat.",Collateral
490,cinesiteforever,how to be a good taxi driver.,8,5 December 2004,"The new film of Michael Mann is another good film. The cast is solid and the photography of Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron is the best. Tom Cruise is fascinating like Vincent, the bad guy in the movie but Jamie Foxx wins the acting fight in a great performance. The music in this film is good in each scene and the script takes the right way except in two or three small things. A special mention to Javier Bardem (unbelievable in Alejandro Amenábar's film ""The Sea Inside"")who plays Felix in a little roll, and Barry Shabaka Henley who lead's the best sequence of the film which takes place in a jazz pub. Finally, i think this picture is in the same level that ""Heat"" but ""The Insider"" stills the best Mann's piece of art.",Collateral

Vincent, you are really definitely a bad guy. But, Tom Cruise was so amazing played Vincent. At the second time, he played antagonist character (before that, on Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Chronicle. It was a great movie too, 1 of my favorite). He always looks good on antagonist character. And of course, Michael Mann didn't showed the good looking side of Cruise. So, people watch this movie because of the story, not because of Cruise. Applause for Jamie, he can played serious character. Even if sometimes he showed his funny character. But this movie had a not really good on editing. I saw some bloopers when I watched it. But it's OK, doesn't matter. People will not feel sorry for watch this movie.",Collateral

I tried on two different days.It's just horrible. It feels like a very cheap B-movie with horrible acting. The camera is bad, the acting is bad, the voices are bad and so often hard to understand that I had to watch it with subtitles on.The story is bland and full of holes, but in my eyes that's probably the best on the movie.It feels very very cheap made. I have no idea how much the budget was, but I'm pretty sure 90% of it went into hiring Tom Cruise.There are many B-movies that are much better than this one. Only watch if you're really desperate.",Collateral
493,h1tm4n_,Kind of OVERRATED,5,5 November 2004,"As I look at the rating of this movie I must say that Collateral is overrated. Maybe you American people only get into the spirit of things if you see guns and people getting shot. This is what the movie is about.As I went into the cinema I had the choice between Aliens VS Predator and Collateral and a lot more which I did not want to see.What I did not like about the movie was that it is only shot in LA. All you see is this city and the clubs and so. Moreover all you get to see is people dying.I also hated the ending. As Tom Cruise gets into the building. Why is he heading down to turn off the main power supply, instead of going two floors higher in the 16th and killing his last victim. Moreover he than keeps searching the woman in the dark. This was so stupid!And the so clichéd ending. As somebody dies. He or she does not say such cool things as Tom did - just to remember as at the beginning and make us rethink the entire movie.When I watched a movie I always keep on thinking what the writer wanted to tell us. Did he wrote the script just to entertain us or did he really want us to think about something. The message I got from Collateral is, if you would blame something very important, life could be more complicated. Say that Tom's first victim did not fell out of that window. Would he have any trouble during the movie? No!I give Collateral a 4.3 out of 10.Collateral is nothing special, however the music is very nice and over average for sure.",Collateral
494,ansh_mody456,A perfect nightout for the audience.,7,9 August 2018,"Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller. Jamie Foxx has very well supported the movie as an actor. Tom Cruise on other side has nailed it as a character of an assassin (Hitman). It's all about an incident took place one night, runoffs, pickups, and action. After a shoot out against Vincent, Max and Annie (another character) run off in the dawn of the new day. {3.5/5}",Collateral

So, I already knew that what is gonna happens. I ruined sucha beautiful movie by watching Indian Remake.",Collateral
497,Equalizer90-1,Cruise control,9,4 November 2005,"I always believed the best Michael Mann thriller was 'Heat' but Collateral gave it a run for its money. Collateral is a terrific film. The all-star cast of Heat may have been absent but it's 'on the edge of your seat' stuff. Tom Cruise plays a contract killer called Vincent that has been assigned five hits in one night. Unknown to an LA cabby called Max (Jamie Foxx) he will soon realise of Vincent's intentions and be forced to drive him around the city whilst Vincent finishes the job. Things don't run too smoothly for Vincent as Max decides to disrupt the work of the smooth talking assassin as much as possible. Collateral is filmed in the beautiful backdrop of late night Los Angeles and the slow methodical style of Mann really eases you into the film. Impressive camera work captures the landscape of the city with dark skies illuminated by the natural glow of the streets and buildings below.The film relies on the dialogue between Cruise and Foxx as most of it takes place between the two characters in the cab. As you're watching the film Vincent and Max debate the moral issues of the killing of other human beings and deep soul searching takes place. Michael Mann cleverly creates the argument to support Vincent's view of his work and how human life is really insignificant. At certain points you are drawn into actually almost agreeing with Vincent and his outlook on life. As the film goes on and the two characters trade verbal blows you almost get the sense that the pair really need each other to review their current paths in life. Max attacks Vincent's state of mind and views on taking lives and Vincent retaliates by questioning Max and his so called dream of running a limousine company. My favourite scenes in the film were Max having to meet up with Felix pretending to be Vincent and the shoot-out in the club 'Fever'. Collateral is supported by a superb soundtrack and fits the mood of the film perfectly. As the film reaches its thrilling finale Max and Vincent will face off against each other but only one man will be left standing.Collateral is an adrenalin pumping, action packed couple of hours that won't leave you disappointed. 'Think anybody will notice?'",Collateral
498,madpenguin41,"Flawed, but rewarding.",7,18 August 2004,"""Collateral"" is basically a strong movie.  The action sizzles, particularly in a wild showdown scene in a dance club.  The acting among the film's two leads is top-notch, and the dialogue is thoughtful, original, and often thought-provoking.  Why then, was there just a hint of disappointment lurking in my head while watching it?One issue might be that the other Mann-directed films I've seen are near perfect, particularly ""Heat"".  Yeah, speaking of ""Heat"", ""Collateral"" has very much the same feel as that masterwork (Cops and criminals in L.A., lots or aerial shots, villains who demand the audience's respect).  Yet ""Heat"" was a film that completely blew a hole in the wall engulfing the field of cops-and-robbers crime movies.  ""Collateral"", on the other hand, feels a bit more resigned to its genre.  No matter though, as suspense/thrillers go, this is among the best.Why, you ask?  For one thing, the story is good.  While the action propels the film, the focus of the story is basically on cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) and how the traumatic experience which hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) puts him through impacts his character.  In addition to the good storytelling and well-drawn characters, the film is full of interesting ideas.  While I wouldn't call ""Collateral"" a philosophical film, questions posed by Vincent arouse striking issues about mankind.  How, he asks, can seeing one criminal die traumatize a person, while watching thousands of innocent people die on the news every day have no impact?  Constant provocation of this sort is thrown at Max, and even as he is abused by this man, there's no denying that his life is bettered greatly by the experience and from simply being around Vincent.  Basically, this film will appease anyone looking for a thrill and a lot of intense action.  However, for thoughtful souls who are much more turned on by ideas than actions, this film's deeper level will serve well.Which is why, I guess, the ending is such a letdown.  Throughout, this film manages to entertain while being thought-provoking, then suddenly, the climax begins and all the ideas and issues raised are given a back seat to a big finish barely distinguishable from countless other action/suspense movies.  What really gets irritating is the endless lineup of implausible occurrences thrown at the viewer in such a short time.  How a bullet can be shot straight into the side of someone's head, yet only graze his ear is a mystery I don't think I'll ever solve.  Nor will I solve the mystery of why subway chase scenes are so popular.  Anyhow, it's a shame to stick an otherwise quite good film with such a lame ending.  Honestly, going for 'big' really wasn't the way to end this movie.  Even with all the fantastic, gripping action scenes, the film's best moments are the conversations held between characters in Max's cab.  These scenes are the heart of the film. Staying true to that heart and letting the film quietly wind down would have been so much more effective. Score: 7/10",Collateral
499,s13racer,I know what thiis movie needed,8,26 December 2004,"OK, I've watched the movie, read the reviews on here, thought about it for a day and it finally hit me. Mann's vision, directing, Tom cruise and Jamie Fox's acting were all flawless. The characters were all developed very well, not to mention the relationship that these two developed. What I think would of have made the movie better is if Tom Cruises's character's (Vincent) ethics laid closer to that line where we would consider him either a good guy or a bad guy. For example, many of us were able to sleep after watching this movie knowing that he was basically a bad guy, he killed innocent bystanders (the cool cop, the security guard at the end, bystanders, etc.) so we were more easily able to simply put him in the bad-guys bracket. I'm not sure if everyone is familiar with the Punisher, but he's basically the same thing, except that the majority of us would consider his ethics to be justified (he's after the bad guys but would not shoot innocent bystanders). I think the philosophical conversations between the two would of had a stronger impact if we it wasn't that simple to decide if we agreed with Tom Cruises's character. For example, if he brought up the question to Max: what does he think about being able to kill three bad guys at the cost of killing one innocent bystander? Would he consider that to be a worthy cause??? Now THIS would of have mad me pick my noodles for weeks...",Collateral
500,simon-thome2,Gray Cruise in an ingeniously presented atmosphere!,7,6 November 2004,"A throughout thrilling movie with a revolutionary plot and persuasive actors. In my opinion a brilliant Tom Cruise far away from his former roles. Including the fact that he had a perfectly matching partner in Jamie Fox who is apparently the best taxi driver in L.A. I guess Cruise enjoyed the ride in his cab more than he did. For a long time ""Collateral"" was a movie which was capable to grip me completely. Especially I loved the scene when Vincent pretended to be Max lawyer and warned Max boss that he better not pull this shit again. No more words about this awesome movie just watch it and enjoy it. Witty and thrilling a must see in every case even if you dislike Cruise what is rather unlikely. Additionally I absolutely recommend to listen to the soundtrack, smooth sounds and loud songs, great combination. 9/10",Collateral
501,noam-reisner,Mann's stylish tour de force is highly recommended,9,3 January 2006,"Michael Mann has been developing his style for a while now with films like Heat, The Insider, and Ali, but whereas previous Mann films always had major flaws in them, Collateral stands out as a cut above the rest. Cinematically, it is nearly flawless. The cinematography, editing, cool metallic lighting, and terrific score (always a given in a Mann film) complement a solid, gripping script. Without giving away too much of the plot, Collateral is an outstanding study of urban alienation, loneliness, and what connects people who live parallel and yet separate lives, all beautifully wrapped up in a gripping action-thriller format. Foxx and Cruise feed off one another very well and the chemistry between them lifts the film even when the script stumbles into the occasional cliché or becomes too theatrical. On one occasion there is a rather lame attempt to get one of the criminal types in the film to deliver a Tarrantino-like monologue which is rather tiresome (only Tarrantino can write Tarrantino), and Jada Pinkett Smith's acting is flat as a pancake. There are also one or two really nagging continuity problems in the film, but then which film doesn't? On the whole these minor problems are negligible in the great scheme of things. 9/10 for this tour de force from one time video-clip director Michael Mann. Go see the film and get the superb soundtrack.",Collateral

The movie has its dumb spots too such as the cops pulling him over because of a broken window and he says he hit a deer. I don't think a deer is going to jump onto the top of the car if you hit it and the front of your car isn't damaged.

507,krazieandwickedal,"Great film, but nowhere near Heat",9,31 May 2009,"It started just like any other night. A simple cab driver just making his rounds on another hot L.A. night when he unknowingly picks up a hit-man and against his own will, takes part in the killings of 4 people. Michael Mann is a genius when it comes to crime movies. In fact, I don't think he ever made a crime movies that wasn't enjoyable (Miami Vice wasn't great, but still enjoyable) and Michael Mann is also known for having two brilliant actors face off in his films. In Heat, we had Robert De Niro and Al Pacino face off. Nine years later, we get to watch Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise face off in this crime epic Collateral. Jamie Foxx plays Max. A cab driver working the night scene in L.A. who dreams of leaving his cab job to open his own limo business. The night starts out fine, he meets a woman, the night is peaceful and quiet. That's when Vincent (Cruise), a self proclaimed real estate agent in town to meet with five people, close a deal, and leave L.A. in the morning. He hires Max to drive him around town over the course of the whole night. Little does he know, that Vincent is actually a hired assassin sent in town to kill 5 people who have a key role in the prosecution of a criminal. When Max learns of this, Vincent forces Max to drive him around town and become an accomplice to all these killings. Over the course of this night, the two opposites attract and find a mutual bond as they both discover a newer meaning to life in the midst of this chaos. It is a terrific film. A brilliant story, brilliant acting from everyone and a grand meaning to life behind the simple story of murder and fear. Michael Mann's image is gripping. We can sense the fear with Jamie Foxx that he has for his life in the most gripping scenes. We can sense the insanity and adrenaline from Tom Cruise during the intense gunfight scenes. It is simply a great film with all these three people coming together to make a crime saga delight. But there are two flaws that take away the extra kick to get this movie from 9 to 10. One, the movie drags on. There'll be multiple scenes in a role where nothing is happening and we have to watch Foxx and Cruise talk about the simplest of things. While these scenes add to the development of the two characters and are very vital to make the movie what it is, they can also get boring and at sometimes, really dull. They are fantastic nevertheless, but they should've added something more to it, maybe a little bit more of an intense scene in between these scenes of nothingness. Not necessarily action, but heart-pumping at the very least could've been nice. And two, the train scene at the end was a little too Carlito's Way for me. While it didn't seem like a direct rip-off, you could sense that Carlito's Way was in the air while this scene happened. Other than those two elements, this movie is fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who love the crime films, like me. While this Michael Mann, great actor face off, crime saga film is brilliant, it's nowhere near Heat. It doesn't progress as well and it's a little dull. But still fantastic. I give it a 9 out of 10.",Collateral
508,Mesina02,Good stuff,9,17 August 2021,Collateral is an amazing thriller. The plot along with its story work effortlessly as the film gradually creates an unnerving tension. It essentially tells the story of a man who doesn't really do anything in his life getting caught in a situation that forces him to push himself beyond his limits.The way these characters (Max & Vincent) go back and forth and asking the question of who's right and who's wrong is a great approach on how to make a dynamic like this work. Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise's acting are really good in this film and I've never quite seen Cruise pull a villainous type role and he fully embraces this character and made him unforgettable.Collateral solidifies itself as a great thriller due to its amazing performances and outstanding story.,Collateral

Anybody know whats up with Jason Statham in the beginning of this movie for only 10 seconds? Haha, I thought that was hilarious. Why would he play a part so little in this movie. But if he did have a big part in this movie, I'd give it a 10. Statham is by far my most favorite actor. But seeing as he doesn't have a part in this movie other than ""random civilian"" (for like 10 seconds, if that) why is he even in it, It must be some kind of blooper, like they did it for fun or something.Well other than that subject, it's good to see Tom Cruise as a bad guy. That's a change, and if Jamie Foxx would just lose the glasses, but, its a really good movie, great storyline, would of gave it an 8 or 8.5 if it had a better ending (i don't know, I just didn't like it), but yeah, i definitely recommend this movie to basically anyone for any reason with any preferences (unless that anyone is a young teenager or little kid). see it",Collateral
510,actorman_us,Taut thriller led by Cruise's excellent work.,8,7 January 2005,"For the better part of his career, Tom Cruise has played the All-American good guy. Gleaming eyed and bushy tailed, Cruise has played the roll of the hero in many films and is certainly the richer for it.Something happened along the way, though. Cruise wanted to be considered a legitimate actor, rather than merely a ""movie star."" Therefore, we've seen him go against type, successfully (MAGNOLIA), and not so much (THE LAST SAMURAI). It's as if Cruise is the neglected kid in the back of the classroom who knows all of the answers but is never called upon, and therefore will go to desperate ends for attention. ""Oh, Oh!! Pick me!!! Pick me!!!"" For me, Cruise hit it this time. His character in COLLATERAL is a menacing study in coldness. It is a thoroughly believable depiction of an utterly ruthless hit-man. It seems, finally, Cruise is actually BAD, rather than merely acting bad. He disdains his usual tricks in favor of a simple and very real performance.Let us not forget Jamie Foxx. His character's transformation into a hero is rendered all the more effective by how wonderfully Foxx captures his character's initial impotence and bewilderment. It's a wonderfully effective, energetic, and yet very subtle performance.Special kudos to Michael Mann. He has a very interesting eye when it comes to capturing the city of Los Angeles on film. His vision of L.A. in this film is one of unease and uncertainty, hardly the usual glitz and glamor treatment. This work is always compelling to the eye and paced to keep the action moving ever forward. Each scene has its own logic, contributing to the overall whole. This is first rate film-making.",Collateral
511,SausagePourVous,"Cruise,Ruffalo and Foxx shine in a tense,philosophical thriller. But it redefines suspension of disbelief and the third act prevents true greatness.",9,2 October 2012,"7,8,7,7,8...this is yet another time I wish the rating system had more options. But we can't always get what we want. Like Collateral ending up a film that is more then the sum of its parts,a film that delivers an end-result that lives up to its ongoing promise of a classic and make you feel content and blown away when the credits roll. Collateral in the end becomes slightly schizophren,going from intellectual,tense and intriguing to chase-action,script out the window.But it's never a bad film and for so long,it's a brilliant,hypnotizing film. Cruise manages to portray his nihilistic,cold assassin,a man who lacks depth cause it seems he wants to(though humanity shines through when he lets his guard down)....with depth. It's hard to explain and even trickier for an actor to pull off. Vincents grey suit and whole persona is on paper DeNiros McCauley in Heat,yet he creates something unreplicable. His best along with Magnolia.A man with very little soul but who's a doer,a man of action takes Foxx's cabdriver hostage,a man with heart and a soul but a dreamer who lies to himself to get through the day without even knowing it with plans that remain just that. Polar opposites. Vincent see through Maxx facade but doesn't bully him,sort of respects the working man. It takes a bit longer for Maxx to both get the balls to speak out and see Vincent for what he truly is but he gets there. Good and evil debate,rationalize and share their very different views on life,there's a verbal and moral battle going on,a fight with words,culminating in both men calling the other out,holding up a mirror of the other mans twisted perception of himself. Vincent isn't the kind of villain that will pistol-whip you if you say something he doesn't want to hear,no matter how harsh or true. He will defend his point of view and make Max confron his own selfdelusions and hypocrisy. The dialog between the two men is excellent written,Beattie does so much right for so long and the actors deliver. Foxx makes Max likable,we feel for him,how long can he let his fear get other people killed? He has to maintain an artificial cool for his safety at the same time as we see his increasing anger and frustration. Still,Oscarnom? Hmm... Critics want to call L.A the third lead and though the city is as Vincent and Crash says""sprawly and disconnected,no one knows anyone."",it is a place Mann likes to root his crime sagas in,it's a soulless,cold city and makes it a unlikely but fascinating location for faiths to intertwine as they do here....still the third lead,minor one though and not from start to finish is played by Mark Ruffalo. His det. Ray Fanning is everything Harrelson failed to be in No Country for old men,without him it's a different film. It would get a bit claustrophobic in that cab for 2hrs,so the (Badass)introduction and subplot involving hope for Max is very welcome.While not his best role,it might be his best performance. Gone is the shy rom-com guy or lovable loser we're used to. With swagger,facial hair,earring,backslick hairdo and mannerisms of a confident man,clothes look pimp,he Becomes Fanning. The eyes are restless,gears in his head grinding,a man of intuition and conscience. Sure,it helps that his partner and the F.B.I are borderline-retarded but he still comes across as a street-smart,respectable cop and as the bodies pile up,he's the one who sees a pattern. Vincent's a wolf,so is Fanning,he's got the scent and can't ignore it. His obsession for the truth puts him in harms way. The cop""with the crazy theory on his own"" is a cliché-role but always a leading one,here it fits the story. We identify with him since he is the voice of reason...steals the flick,barely.Jada Pinkett-Smith is an attorney we see briefly(It's almost a cameo) and we know we will see her again. From her chat with Max,we get that she is a workaholic and like the three men,a creature of the night. Four professionals who all are great at what they do and all will collide and paths will cross...and credibility will take a beating.You see Annie get into Max's cab. Then Vincent gets into his cab. Fanning goes to see his snitch shortly after snitch has been payed a visit. Cop and baddie manages to end up in the same elevator. And that's just the beginning. Fates intertwine,really?In the end,it is a tale with so many(Just one or two too many) unrealistic coincidences that Manns digital camera that gives it its realistic feeling make that effect slightly backfires.The tension rises and after a very exciting but somewhat preposterous scene where an important player disappears from the story,unfortunately a lot or most of the scripts depth and ambiguity goes with him. Critics,you,me,we all agree the plot and film was more intriguing when it focused on the dynamic between Cruise and Foxx,with a plot in constant,unpredictable development. Mann knows action,its not a dull moment but he goes overboard and the superassassin both becomes too super and too incompetent for no good reason except...we're""supposed"" to want this. Compared to what came before,I didn't and suggest all fans of suspense to see this once,enjoy it and savor the memory of it. It has a,lot of great moments(wolfs,man),great acting(Javier Bardem and Irma P.Hall put in good support),awesome editing and good music...it's just that it was headed towards a masterpiece.

Jean Reno (Leon the professional) was a tough one and even Denzel Washington (Man on Fire) was really tough and well trained. Cruise character could never decide between nice guy and mean bad guy. To much talking, to much meaningful looks...I am truly disappointed by this one. And then the strange coincidence in the end...I could not believe that...and that was, when the movie became a complete waste of time for me.",Collateral

515,babiedol12,Collateral: Best Movie of 2004!,10,20 December 2004,"More than anything, this film is stylish--from camera shots to sound, to costuming and acting, it's a movie with a brain, and maybe even a heartbeat. The actors hit their marks--Foxx as a man who wants more than a job as a cab driver, Vincent as cool-headed cleaner--and with a winning subplot following the sleuthing attempts of an L.A. detective, the film goes up a notch in wisdom. Most if not all the elements come together, and it makes for a satisfying experience, on the dramatic and aesthetic scales.The beautifully-shot LA is a dark, dangerous, compelling place - tinged with every hue of grey and blue, matching the prowling presence of its star. Cruise, hair flecked grey, is obviously meant to be wolfish, but his character is perhaps closest to a Great White Shark: killing is nothing personal, it's just what he does.Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years. The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When an offshore narco-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. Through the night, Vincent forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined.Overall: 10/10",Collateral
516,jvydelingum,The Ultimate Backseat Driver,8,4 October 2004,"Clean-freak Max (Foxx) is an LA taxi driver dreaming of a better life. Safely enclosed within the comfort zone of his cab, he pays regular visits to his hospital-bound mother, and can rattle off ETAs like Rainman counting cards. Smooth-talking Vincent (Cruise) is in town for one night, with five stops to make. Max agrees to provide the ride, but soon discovers that his passenger is a hit-man.'Collateral' works because of the strength of the performances of the two leads. As a silver-fox assassin in a grey suit, Cruise as Vincent shows little of the perma-grinning all-American hero type we are so accustomed to seeing him do. At times, he does strut around like 'The Terminator', but he brings a human element to a role that could, in lesser hands, have become a cumbersome cliché. (The jazz club scene especially, is a reminder of just how good an actor he is.)But it is Foxx who truly shines as Max. His portrayal of an everyman trapped in an ever-worsening situation is genuine and brilliantly underplayed. Foxx lays claim for A-list billing in his own right, with a performance which balances heartfelt bravery and vulnerability on a knife edge. For my money, it's worthy of an Oscar.Credit must also go to Michael Mann's portrayal of melancholic night-time Los Angeles. Brooding skylines and gloomy lighting helps accentuate 'Collateral's palpable moments of suspense.The interactions between Max and Vincent are where the movie really comes alive. The characterisation owing much to Stuart Beattie's script, which proves there is justifiable room for humour in slick thrillers.'Collateral's a stylish, yet fun action movie that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll. 8/10.",Collateral

While watching the action, if you're one of the few ""movie buffs"", who cares less about the details, you'll probably enjoy Foxx's acting skills, shown on your screen.This is definitely an ordinary action film, which has nothing new to surprise, or thrill you.

This movie sucks you in and makes you want to watch more. It really was nice to see Tom and Jamie in a movie, both being great actors and are great in these roles. Tom Cruise, to me, made the movie great because this was such a different role for him and he nailed it. Jamie was great too but how will he top Ray?

This is the best performance of his career so far.  I'm sure we'll be seeing many great things from him in the future.As with every Michael Mann film he seems to have the ability to project the characters thoughts from the screen to the audience with music, atmosphere, and without a word of dialogue.

521,livinitup2589,Collateral goes farther than the conventional thriller.,8,8 April 2006,"It's great to see an action thriller that has more to it than shootouts and chase scenes. There's seldom an action movie that has a story to tell aside from what it takes to set up the plot and amp up the suspense. Luckily, there's Michael Mann's movies to look forward to. His action films overachieve to the point that, after we see his name attached to the title, we expect a drama instead of a thriller. So it's no surprise that Collateral pushes far away from the action genre and becomes a character driven drama.The story revolves around two men. Max, an aspiring cab driver finishing his shift and ready to go home, and Vincent, a mysterious assassin who becomes Max's last fare of the night. At first glance, the premise of an assassin going around killing targets before the night's over sounds like the kind of mindless thriller normally released in the summer. That's exactly what Collateral could of been, but because of Mann's expert direction and the performances of his two leads, it comes off as a deep study of two different men instead of a two dimensional thriller.As Vincent, Tom Cruise gives one of those against-type performances that makes you wish he played the villain more often. He makes Vincent more than just a cold-hearted killer with a gun. There are scenes that suggest his regret for pulling the trigger and we can sense that he kills out of necessity rather than enjoyment. Mann is the best when it comes to presenting characters whose lives are overtaken by their professions. Cruise gives an intense and concentrated performance.Foxx is equally convincing as the subdued and passive Max. Along with Cruise, he plays against his usual kind of character dropping his comedic side and revealing that he can play dramatic scenes with intensity.The movie spends a lot of time in Max's cab. In these scenes, Max and Vincent are never presented as straight forward good and bad. Both men have flaws and neither can really be called hero and villain. Normally in action thrillers, we know exactly who to call good and bad, but if we got to know the two sides we'd find that both of them are basically the same. Collateral is the first thriller in a long time to consider such a true to life aspect and use it to create such real characters.Collateral is why Michael Mann is one of my favorite filmmakers. He's not interested in just giving us shootouts and chase scenes. He wants to make sure that the people doing the shooting and the chasing are worth caring about. With Collateral, he gives us a thriller that doesn't just thrill because of what the characters do, it thrills because of who the characters are.",Collateral

but there is just somethings wrong in this movie.
First: Cruise is not fit for a villain. Don't get me wrong, he is amazing actor, and acted it perfectly, but this ""Vincent"" just isn't him. A darker persona like Tim Roth or Sean Penn would've been much better.
2. Same for Jamie Foxx - just the wrong actor. Glasses and manic character don't fit his body and face.
3. Too many coincidences all the time to make the plot believable. To many even for a movie

523,alanholl,HEAT (comparing notes),8,10 August 2004,"In 1994 PULP FICTION made viewers root for and laugh with the bad guys, characters Tarantino had already stylized. In the same year, HEAT cast off the jokes and its ""bad guys"" turned out to be real people who maybe weren't so bad after all. HEAT introduced audiences to the professional criminal in a way that unconventionally rendered the character with some regard. When De Niro took his last breaths in HEAT's final frames, we actually felt a tinge of loss.HEAT-lovers such as myself anticipated COLLATERAL not only as `the new Mann film,' but as an elaboration of HEAT's signature character  which could only be done with that film's architect.COLLATERAL is the inevitable follow-up to HEAT, its vehicle being the expertly-collected professional criminal. Anyone who has seen both films will realize from the opening images in COLLATERAL that Cruise's character is a direct carry-over from HEAT.The important thing for any fan of the director to realize is that since Mann did not write or produce it (enough to be credited, anyway) this is not truly ""A Michael Mann Film."" While it likely would have been better had it been ""A Michael Mann Film"", COLLATERAL is still a great picture. Stuart Beattie's screenplay passes the test; the music, though somewhat over-used, is well-chosen. Unfortunately, the casting for the lead roles backfired.Cruise and Foxx are top-notch, but their personas as actors may be undermining the intended character depictions. Watch COLLATERAL in theatre and you'll understand.Cruise has always been a good guy and Foxx has always been a funnyman. When general audiences are watching COLLATERAL, they are seeing a good guy play a bad guy and a funnyman play a cab driver.Hence people laughing at Foxx's lines - even if they're weren't supposed to be funny. And the TRAINING DAY-esque appeal of the good guy playing the bad guy.HEAT's initial selling point was the onscreen pairing of De Niro and Pacino. But regardless of their marketing power, both actors couldn't have been better for the roles. What resulted were two of the most convincing characters in film.In HEAT, we're watching Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna. In COLLATERAL, we're watching Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.",Collateral

Jamie Foxx played a dumb cab driver, nothing memorable. Will Smith's wife appeared in like five minutes of the movie. As I have previously stated, there was NO suspense or plot twists. Only watch if you are a die-hard fan of Tom Cruise in action roles.I give this movie one star out of ten because you can't give it zero. In summary, a waste of time.",Collateral
525,mike_76,an artsy action movie,9,6 March 2005,"This truly is an artsy action movie, and that is not an oxymoron. When Michael Mann makes movies, his vision is something so much more vivid and complete than other directions. The amount of location scouting and imagination that Mann puts into this movie is readily evident. This movie is not an action that is concerned with flashy action sequences or big explosions. In fact, there is maybe a total of 15 minutes of action sequences in this movie. These were very technical action sequences but not in the traditional way. Tom Cruise spent three months with a former British SAS specialist to make sure that his combat techniques were truly those of a coldblooded hit-man. Most noteworthy to me is not the characters in this movie, although they were very well developed and Cruise and Foxx both deserve Oscars. Also, I don't believe the plot was a central point of this film. What was central was the feeling and atmosphere of this film. The aura of L.A. at night and the beautifully haunting imagery. The scene with the wolves walking across the road about sums it up, that scene was pure poetry. What other kind of action movie offers this type of emotional quality. You really feel the vibe of the city. All of the work Mann put into picking locations really does pay off. This film reminds me so very much of Blade Runner. The same city and the same type of plot. Both those details are trivial. The salient similarities are in the directive style. In Blade Runner, Ridley Scott really focused on creating a futuristic L.A. with a distinctive atmosphere. For a movie made in the 80's, the visual FX are truly amazing. There is such emotional appeal in every aspect of the futuristic L.A.The similarity between the two movies is this. Think of any run of the mill action movie. When a movie like, say, ""Bad Boys"" is in transition from on scene to another, they really try and cut down the excess that is between the action sequences and the humorous scenes. BUT, in both Blade Runner and Collateral, the transitions are really the focus in a way. The driving around the city in both movies is where the vibe is really felt. In each, when the film takes you around L.A. (either the modern day L.A. in collateral, or futuristic L.A. in Blade Runner), you feel almost euphoric. It is a very serene and almost haunting type of atmosphere with such striking imagery. The end result is this: A wonderfully crafted action movie with utmost artistic merit.",Collateral

527,OppressedWriter,Mann's stunning exercise in subversive genre film-making.,9,7 August 2004,"I've never been a huge defender of Michael Mann's work: Miami Vice, Thief, Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Insider, Ali. While I found his direction and resume impressive nothing particularly floored me: the distinct attribute, feel, and atmosphere that compels you to watch a film. Heat, while overlong, had moments where these elements came together and that's why I consider it Mann's strongest work. When he does the crime genre HE does the crime genre. So, it wasn't too wild that I expected strong genre cinema from 'Collateral'. I mean it had the pedigree, the concept, and it was in the dimly lit, nocturnal, neo-noir genre -- Yeah, I love noir.The high water premise involves a hit man, played deliciously against type by Tom Cruise, coming into L.A. for a late night job. The thing is he needs to take care of several marks in one single night and decides to conscript a cabbie, don't hate but Jamie Foxx is great, to drive him around on his hits. Now while this sounds like a ridiculous premise Mann, Foxx, Cruise, and their talented screenwriter Stuart Beattie concoct a series of thrilling events laden with a delicious streak of dark humor. The dark humor is a blessing since most of the film takes place inside the cab as Cruise's Vincent and Foxx's Max duke it out verbally. Vincent's vacant statements about life offer glimpses into his mind and Max's everyday affability makes his inability to grasp Vincent's actions more tangible. Let's just say they both snap, crackle, and pop keeping the audience glued to the screen.There is also a string of great supporting performances aside from the two leads. The supporting cast including Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Irma P. Hall, Bruce McGill, Javier Bardem, and Peter Berg. Having the unusually strong supporting cast allows the film to get by with little characterization as these actors provide enough depth in the short screen times they inhabit. Some might complain about this set up, but honestly the films real drive is the love/hate relationship between Max and Vincent. It's what keeps the blood flowing because it evokes a vicarious notion of 'what would I do?'Mann, where is the MAN!? Oh, don't worry he's here. Without his visual eye for breaking down scenes to minute details and strength at creating a deliberate pace this film would crumble under its premise. Mann using digital for the first time showcases that in the hands of a master its not what you use, but what you do. His lack of digital effects, explosions, and all that other new wave action bullshit is surprisingly refreshing. What Mann does is focus on his 80's vibe and creates a new sort of retro cool. A prime example of this is the club sequence. A simple, yet highly effective action scene scored via the locations diagetic music. The chaos with quick bursts of action provided by the energetic Cruise are as exciting as a hundred explosions if not more.The whole film, which was shot at night, creates a twilight zone, existential, eerie vibe that helps it glide over some convenient plot points. The concept of cosmic connection, stars aligning, and fate meshes well with the atmosphere. Mann's visual flair particularly stands out in the scenes overlooking the city. The digital allows him to bring out the sharp lights creating an otherworldly vibe. The view is sublime and gives the city a life beyond Max and Vincent. They might be killing people, but in a city of six million people they're just specks. Unlike typical summer fare 'Collateral' is a character driven drama under the guise of Hollywood genre thriller. It's Mann on overdrive (Rave scene, the building sequence) and my favorite flick off his impressive and eclectic resume. I don't typically look forward to his films, but after the super cool experience I had with 'Collateral' that has changed. The way all of the disparate moods connected at end left me feeling like I've been on a ride of my own. This is subversive genre making at its best. A round of applause for everyone involved in making one of the most cool and effective thrillers in ages. 'Collateral' is worthy of your collateral.",Collateral
528,MorgothsReach,Two Terrific Performances in an Enthralling Thriller,8,30 May 2011,"There is a terrific scene in Michael Mann's 'Collateral' where Tom Cruise's Vincent and a coyote stare at one another under the glow of a deserted Los Angeles street. The profoundness of the scene is in many ways an example of how Mann manages to raise his crime thrillers above the standard fare of his peers. For 'Collateral' like one of Mann's earlier pictures 'Heat' is not simply a great action film but also a subtle and intricate character study of two opposing individuals who nevertheless share a mutual understanding. In 'Collateral' however this relationship is not as playful as the Pacino/De Niro one that dominates the plot of 'Heat' as Tom Cruise takes Jamie Foxx's cab driver Max hostage over the course of a single night. It is a tough job attempting to surpass 'Heat' but Mann manages it by simply focusing on two lead characters whose actors put in affecting and human performances. Whereas 'Heat' perhaps suffered from too many digressions by examining in detail the lives of its secondary characters, 'Collateral' stays with Vincent and Max throughout its duration only sometimes switching to Mark Ruffalo's Detective Fanning. In what is essentially a tale of two lonely individuals, 'Collateral' sees Fate land a hit-man, Vincent, into the cab of Max, a man whose optimism about the future is going to be put to the test. From this first meeting spirals a catalogue of mind games, contract killings and insightful conversations as the put upon Max tries to escape the clutches of the ruthless Vincent. Foxx delivers a performance full of empathy as the cab driver who has to come to terms with being a hostage in his own taxi and then deal with the small matter of staying alive. He portrays a man whose meek personality is galvanised into a raging catharsis after continual denigration by Vincent. Cruise likewise excels in a performance that portrays a very human assassin. Not emotionally vacant, Vincent clearly delights in his profession challenging one of his victims to gamble his life on a question related to the man's passion. This hit-man is not someone manufactured by some shady government organisation but one that has flaws like any human. In one scene Vincent delights in humiliating Max in front of his mother leading to Max throwing his briefcase over a bridge. The relationship between Max and Vincent is a key aspect of 'Collateral' which is epitomised in the coyote scene, mentioned at the beginning of the review. As Max slows down the cab to avoid hitting the animal, it and Vincent stare at one other, into each others' souls. No words are spoken; only a meditative silence during and after the moment. What follows is a powerful moment of self-reflection on Vincent's part where he assesses his life and how it resembles the coyote's: a life as a predator, not living a normal life but continually wandering. As Max moves the car onwards Vincent stares blankly ahead of him, both men separated from one another physically and metaphorically by the glass behind the driver's seat. It is such scenes of resonance that give 'Collateral' its emotional core; however the film also boasts several impressive set pieces including the shootout at a Korean nightclub where one of Vincent's targets are located. The scene itself is brilliantly choreographed with the police, FBI, mobsters, Vincent and Max involved in a frenetic showdown that perfectly illustrates Mann's versatility in shooting action sequences. Cruise also displays his physical suitability for the role as a lethal Vincent takes out everyone in his path on the way to completing his mission. It is one of the standout scenes of a film that already boasts two terrific lead performances, a great soundtrack and direction by Mann that displays the beauty of the city. As the train at the end of the film departs into the distance with dawn approaching it is hard to believe that the events have taken place over a single night.",Collateral
529,DjangoLeone,Intensely Powerful (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),9,6 August 2004,"I've been intrigued for awhile about hit men. It takes a certain type of person to kill someone for money and then go on and kill more people for more money. Movies about hit men are some of my personal favorites. There are two types of hit men in movies. The first is the kind who has fallen into the job by factors out of their control and they become saddened by the carnage after time and want to quit. The other is the crazy sociopath type that actually takes pleasure in the killings. The movie Collateral takes it in a slightly different direction. The story is simple: a hapless taxi driver played by Jamie Foxx happens to pick up a hit-man played by Tom Cruise. This hit-man, Vincent, is surely in the second group but at times we see tinges of group one in him. For all his insanity, there's always a sense that Vincent is deeper than even he might know. But that doesn't stop him from doing his job. He drags Max, the cab driver, into his world of murder for hire and the two form an unlikely partnership. At every step of the way, Max tries to get out and get help but Vincent is always right on his heels. The tension builds until the film reaches it's climax, which I'll admit, had me at the edge of my seat. One of the better hit-man movies.Not as action packed as The Killer or even The Professional, but Tom Cruise does play one of the scariest hit men in recent films. A solid grade A movie.",Collateral
530,bruxellesblog,"Wilder, Aldrich, Chandler and Hitchcock would love it! (Spillane probably owns it on DVD).",10,31 March 2005,"SPOILIERS****Just finished watching Collateral on DVD, WOW! Mann does it again. I wanted to see this when it came out, but didn't get a chance. This was unfortunate, as it must have been stunning on the big screen.Mann succeeds, in much the same way as he did with Heat, of capturing the essence of Los Angeles on film and using it as a palate to shape his drama. Not only is it a stunningly beautiful and striking film, the imagery creates an almost liquid background to propel the story  truly gorgeous cinematography. Vincent is one of the most tautly drawn characters in years, and Cruise is masterful in his portrayal of the nihilist hit man. Watch Cruise shift from ardent admirer of Miles Davis to steely killer in a fraction of a second playing off Barry Shabaka Henley (Daniel), who is all of his equal in a truly moving moment of film making. It is amazing to see this same transformation occur later in the film, this time executed by actor Jamie Foxx, who displays ability on a par with Cruise's. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical upon hearing that Foxx had won the Oscar for his work in Ray, having not seen the film. No longer! I am a total believer. His is certainly a talent well above that used in ""Booty Call"".Where other directors have tried to capture the energy of film noir by regurgitating a 50's pastiche, Mann captures the spirit of such classics as Double Indemnity or Strangers on a Train and places them in a modern context in enthralling fashion. While many here will consider Heat to be Mann's magnum opus, I found Collateral a far more compelling ride (high praise I know), as Cruise's character Vincent and the interplay with Foxx (Max), provide a far greater level of character development.Oh, and regarding the ending. Max figured out he would die if he didn't kill Vincent first, even before he saw the lawyer's portfolio in Vincent's dossier. That is why he crashed the car intentionally  he was finally, for the first time in his life, in control. Nobody was going to stop him, not even Vincent. While it does, admittedly, tie up a lot of loose ends 'nicely', it also makes sense.It is a brilliant film. I'm off to buy it now!",Collateral

But how can a basic premise of a film from a pulp style script be so invigorating and intense. This is achieved by it being raised up with the tork of Michael Mann. It seems to be you can't underestimate the guy who pretty much reinvented the crime narrative even when he went away for two semi-political/social conscious films like ALI and THE INSIDER. All that is achieved here is done by the method taken to tell the story.The plot is a cab driver Max,Jamie Fox, is forced at gunpoint to be the escort for a professional killer Vincint, Tom Cruise. It is such a simple tag line that you spin your head around from that tag with the suspicion that it sounds so simple it could be easily screwed up. It isn't. It is elevated to a height that we rarely see in a genre film. A thriller where the would be innocent man is forced against his will to do bad things. But it's given quite a spark. Just like the kind of spark that Christopher Nolan gave to the revenge film when he made MEMENTO.The presence of existentialism is what drives this home. We have Max, a man lulled by the rhythms of everyday routine, and Vincent, who somewhere lost his heart or was never given one. In this particular evening that the story covers they gain consciousness that the world around them demands something of them. They even start to understand that all along the world has been expecting things and tonight is the time to pay up. Freedom of choice is now more important than every when it comes to taking a life and saving a life. Consequence is promised around every L.A. concrete street corner.Mann makes this film continuing his ongoing theme which is that his men are always searching to find their identities through their professions. In just about every case the men have to go beyond the guidelines of their jobs to make their life altering decisions.I could be looking too hard into this. You could say that this is a film with conversation between good vs. evil, but Mann doesn't make it that easy. It is evident in Vincents look and attire. It is no coincidence that he is dressed in Grey and wears both a Grey beard and Grey head of hair. He is the Grey area, with both good and evil bleeding in. Just like Russell Crowe in THE INSIDER, or De Niro in HEAT, and William Petersen in MANHUNTER. We both agree and disagree with all of these characters. This constant bickering makes me want to watch again and again.Some have complained about the cat and mouse type chase of the third act of this film. There should be no argument with this. It is, again, consistent with Mann's theme of Cat and Mouse. Just like Graham the FBI agent vs. the Red Dragon in Manhunter, or the cop Pacino vs. the thief De Niro in Heat, Crowe's scientist vs. the Tabacco Industry in THE INSIDER. All Mann has done is keep Max and Vincent bottled up in the taxi cab for nearly 2/3 of the film and then let them go, which is the only natural progression of the story.The last great character in the film is Los Angeles. I don't think anyone else can film it like Michael Mann. It breathes, it pulsates-one could argue it is the driving force that makes Max and Vincent collide.Michael Mann has added to his collage of strong character study, with demanding visuals and unending arguments. Bravo.",Collateral
533,irvingchris,Unexpected detours from the traffic of cliche,9,15 August 2004,"Expect the unexpected from ""Collateral,"" Michael Mann's latest thriller that has an unconventional buddy-film formula between two very unlikely leads playing excellent characters.  Tom Cruise is probably too pretty-boy for most to consider him capable of pulling off a role like this.  Jamie Foxx is probably looked upon as too comedic to get a genuine dramatic reaction -- but both of them have pulled it off.Go see Collateral.  It's an entirely original film that creates a plot from it's characters, not from standard hitman/reluctant hero cliches.  Michael Mann directs the story in such a way that gives the night a seamlessness that's inescapable.Highly recommended.",Collateral

In watching the trailers for this movie I decided I wanted to see it but expected it to be the usual mediocre production as everything else this summer (with the exception of Spiderman 2) and I was caught quite a bit off guard by the outcome. The cinematography, scripting, and soundtrack were perfect. The acting was spectacular, I would even say that this could be a personal best for Cruise and Fox. This film is a diamond in the rough. All the films this summer seem to be running together into one big ball of crap and with everybody doing the same old thing this original idea really shines out. I would not be surprised to see these performances awarded at next years big ceremonies. If you only see one movie this summer go see Collateral.",Collateral
535,hall1138,What a ride!,8,8 August 2004,"The film Collateral opens with a silver haired Tom Cruise, walking silently through an airport. The opening is creepy in its own way, and it sets up the movie perfectly. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a character who is going to make five stops with a taxi cab to murder five people. Of course, things go wrong and the plot is very intense and complicated, however it is very easy to follow this movie. Jamie Foxx does an excellent job as Max, the cab driver who takes Vincent (Cruise) to each of his stops. Max (Foxx) throughout the movie is overwhelmed and he can't believe he is driving around a killer. Jamie Foxx proves he can act, and the two actors have great chemistry in the film.
Collateral is not a laugh out loud film, but it does have some funny lines and there is irony in it. Cruise only smiles once in the film but that proves that Cruise can do an excellent job at really acting as this killer. I'm not saying Cruise has been given easy roles in the past, but this role is different. This character is much more complex and brutal.
Director Michael Mann did an excellent job. He is no novice for action films, for he directed Heat. His helicopter shots of Los Angeles are amazing at night. He makes the city seem more desolate and less crowded. Collateral focus' mainly on the story, and it doesn't stop, yet it's hard not to notice how L.A. is captured on film. It is definitely a ""popcorn"" movie so go see it. Collateral is not any action film, and it's story wraps you up. The ending is particularly interesting. If you want to see Tom Cruise take on a mystical character, and Jamie Foxx pull off what may be the role of his lifetime, go see it.

Also, both Cruise and Foxx were great, especially Cruise, who has made one of the coolest badguy of all time.

Or are you just giving lip service to some higher ideal, deluding yourself thinking ""someday, maybe,"" but ""not right now?"" What excuses are you giving yourself? To be clear, this is primarily an action movie centering around a professional hit-man and his targets. You don't have to entertain these questions to enjoy it.Yet not since Fight Club's scene in which Brad Pitt holds a gun to that store clerk's head & warns him he'll be dead if he doesn't pursue his dreams, has a movie had the balls to ask -- ""Are you on the same page with yourself?"" Again, you don't have to identify with the guy who has the sh**ty job & has a dream to start his own business but never acts on it to appreciate this movie. It stands on it's own as tense, well-acted assassin flick.But it's rare in that it asks much more of you than to just root for the underdog hero. It gives you pause to reflect.Granted, addressing the sobering reality that you might in fact be living out an existence that is but a mere shadow of what sort of life you really could be living -- that's not easy to come to terms with. It's much easier to stay plugged in to whatever Matrix you may be living in.Yet I like challenging movies like this. Along w/ Groundhog Day, Remains of the Day, & Shawshank Redemption, this is among my favorite ""wake-up call"" how-am-I- living-my-life movies.

At the airport, Max tries to refuse Max's offer of an all-night rental, but Max, saving money, can't refuse the cash.At this moment, the tension mounts as Max is put in a situation that wasn't ever in his life plan: the accomplice to an assassin.Foxx plays the role beautifully in a mix of tenderness and naiveté that turns into self-defining bravado.Cruise, on the other hand, is cold and menacing, his only function in life to manipulate and kill.There are a few weaknesses in the plot, emphasized by the lack of development in side characters, including Annie and Fanning (a solid Mark Ruffalo).",Collateral

541,movieblitz,Less is more from Tom Cruise,9,29 September 2005,I really enjoyed this film. Not really a big fan of Tom Cruise but in this film he proved the old adage of less is more. His acting was minimal as was his body movements. He was truly the bad guy in this film. I was very sceptical about Cruise as a hit-man but he pulls it off with aplomb and i'm sure anyone looking to hire an assassin would want like Vincent (Cruise). I like many people who have seen this film wished there could be a sequel but there obviously cannot. A prequel in which we learn about Vincent and how he came to be so cold and ruthless could work though. Jamie Foxx was OK but I feel he has been pigeon holed as some kind of new Denzel Washington which is a shame because he can act. I say this because I feel the Oscar for Ray was more for sentiment towards Ray Charles than Foxx's portrayal. Because of Cruise's economic portrayal of Vincent there wasn't really much for Foxx to do - minimal interaction on a physical level until the end etc. All in all a very good film that proves Cruise if good and this coming from someone who only saw Cruise as Maverick from Top Gun. Well done.,Collateral
542,cfazzari,"Good Movie, Typical Bad Hollywood Ending",8,24 June 2005,"If you haven't seen this movie, then STOP NOW....Spoilers ahead. Let me start off by saying the first half of the movie is taut and suspenseful and is pretty good adult escapism. Not a lot of BS and plenty of atmosphere. Tom Cruise is a very good actor and so is Jamie Foxx. I don't know that either will ever be Robert DeNiro or Denzell Washington, but they both make it look easy to act in a major film. Jada Picket Smith can act too, however she was helped by a limited role in the movie. My complaint about her is the same complaint I have about the movie. In the first half of the movie she plays a serious D.A. focused on her job. In the second half she becomes Olive Oyl. The second half of the movie starts to strain credibility and at the end, it's almost like Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny, shooting at each other but never hitting anything.....The ending of the movie is the worst of Hollywod babble...OK let's see...Tom Cruise is chasing Foxx and Smith at a subway stop, and he jumps on the back of a moving subway train, manages to grab on, and simply opens the back door of the last car to get in. Anyone who has ever been on a train knows that door is always locked...otherwise people would be falling out of the back of a train every day. Moving on - now we have two guys that get on a subway train at 5:00 AM (mostly empty - again not very likely) and they start blasting away at each other. No one appears to be racing off this train when it stops, and since the motorman is enclosed right next to Jamie Foxx, he may even earn himself a bullet or two from Tom Cruise during the shootout. If there is a conductor he doesn't notice or hear anything either. There are no cops around (even though they were hot on the trail 20 minutes earlier), no sirens, nothing...Does it make sense to ANYONE that after a 20 or 30-shot shootout, a dead body is left on the train, and the train just closes it's doors and goes on to the next stop? Who writes this crap??? How stupid are we supposed to be to believe this could really happen?? There are so many continuity and logic problems with this movie It would take an hour just to write it all up. If you're just interested in escapism, or if you're under the age of 18, you're more likely to just take the movie at face value and enjoy it. As for me, I'd just like to sit with the writers and the director and ask them if they are REALLY pleased with this thing...",Collateral
543,joepetrizzi,"Pretty, but flawed",5,26 June 2005,"The film itself was very nice, that is, the excellent photography and setting. The plot was fairly ridiculous, and not just the concept of a hit-man requiring a taxi driver to tote him around all night while he murders people. The movie is full of characters that come and go, the dialogue is fancy but unimportant, even the main duo of Cruise and Foxx are pretty but totally shallow.If you like movies as art, you may derive some pleasure from the dark LA imagery, etc. but for the rest of us out to be entertained for 2 hours, this movie fails. In particular, the last 20-40 minutes take the ridiculous factor to 11. Characters do things they normally would not do, see things normal people would not see, and survive things normal humans would not survive. Prepare to suspend disbelief.I was so disinterested by the end of the movie - Cruise's character says something which I didn't hear that well and I didn't even care. I like a lot of Mann's films but this was a bad movie. Oh, and a pet peeve - this movie was (until the end) pretty dark and stylish - but calling this film noir? Stop.",Collateral

I don't necessarily think Tom Cruise is a great actor, hes a good actor, but I've never seen a movie of his that I haven't enjoyed. He has a talent of picking movies and scripts that are excellent, with the exception of Top Gun and that car film ;). My only criticism is I doubt very much an assassin would wear a light grey suit and sunglasses at night, particularly inside a hospital. It certainly isn't subtle, but I overlooked that because the movie carries you along. It is a very cruisy and emotive movie. Really didn't enjoy Mark Rufalo's character. Just didn't fit in and didn't seem necessary.I loved that there weren't car chases and things blowing up which is the usual Hollywood cover-up for no plot and bad scripts, and it had a psychological undercurrent. I loved the coyote part of the movie. The look in their eyes, the displacement of the coyote and displacement of those two characters in their own city etc. Its nice to see a movie where everything isn't spelled out. I loved the line, about the train and the body on the train, and ""do you think anyone will notice""The humanity of the film is very poignant. Tom Cruise' character as the assassin had many aspects.

It is not a feel good movie but a black film that raised questions and operated on different levels,9,18 September 2004,"I am surprised at its UK rating as 12A does not reflect the language, violence or blackness of the film.What level is it operating on? What is it trying to achieve?You could see it in different waysIs it a psychological thriller? Not quiteIs it a post modernist nihilistic violent film? In some ways yes Perhaps this is most accurate summary to me.Is it a good versus bad film? In some ways. But not really as it fails on this in some ways. It is putting over some other ideas as well.Do you identify with the cabbie or with Cruise? Both have their strong features. Cruise to me is the anti hero. Some would want to be him carrying out his vicious work in focused way.Or the cabbie who is the kind of good guy caught up in all the mayhem. In the end he breaks out and overcomes. not really convincing to me.Is it a mirror to our world in which human life is so cheap? Yes this does come out in some of the dialogs between Cruise and cabbie.Is it about money as source of strength? Or love of money as root of evil? More the first though clearly money motivate to cruel vicious acts.Dramatically there are some strong stomach churning times as well.The relationship builds between Cruise and cabbie - and yet it is about hate and death.We see Cruise gun down bad guy and good guy anyone who gets in his way. It is his living to kill. What a sad picture.The plot does work in that I spotted the ending from the start and yet this helps and makes it have some sense to a senseless set of acts. Cruel and vicious more than senseless. Is this what Western civilization comes to? Mindless killing or rather killing in vicious way for money and to protect gang chiefs? Both in some ways. I guess Cruise would argue it is not mindless but collateral in carrying out his mission. Human life is very very cheap in this film and that is very disturbing.A touch of humour when Tom Cruise sends in cabbie as himself to see big bad guy. After going past several security levels the bad guy says to the cabbie ""you're not as tall as I expected"" - surely a play on Cruise's own lack of height.Did it engage me?Yes and no - in some ways horror does not appeal to me and I did not expect such a horror film. Yet the suspense works well at some points but not through the whole film. At the end few sequences it is powerful and on edge of seat stuff.At other points I was able to be detached in a way that not possible recently while watching and in the Bourne supremacy film. Why? Not sure. I thought the plot kept changing its mind about what sort of film it was and Cruise's playing was also confusing to me. perhaps deliberately.I would not recommend you to see it as it leaves quite a black feeling. I thought the large audience went out feeling pretty sick and down. Not a feel good movie. Not one to uplift and want to take action in a positive way.

Tom Cruise (Victor) is a shadow figure hit man who gets into the cab of Jamie Foxx (Max) and takes Max on a journey down the dark side of Los Angeles, drug deals, unfortunate witnesses, damaged childhoods, and {insert the next cliché}. Along the way we have gestures toward character development including a visit to the hospital to visit Max's mother during which it is Victor who undertakes the appropriate filial duties, lest the viewer have little sympathy towards a cold-blooded assassin. But the whole thing devolves into chase scenes, shootings, and strained moments of false profundity. Cruise's character would have to be interesting to pull this off and it's just not.Cruise's performance is much as you would expect since you've seen it before.

No. But what you will see is a genuinely enjoyable thriller that will constantly have you guessing, wondering, asking questions, and REALLY wishing Tom Cruise didn't have to be the bad guy all the way through to the end.I highly recommend this film to both people who are and are not fans of Tom Cruise, and it's a great film both for ""veterans"" of the Thriller genre and for newcomers alike",Collateral
548,Comedian215,Michael Mann's best film to date 9/10,9,17 August 2004,"Collateral was in my mind the most entertaining and realistic action film of 2004 so far. The acting, script, cinematography, direction, all top notch. Not only was this the best action film of 2004, I think that this was overall Michael Mann's best film, and that he perfectly executed the use of whatever he had.I enjoyed very much how the camera moved accordingly to what was goingthrough the eyes and minds of the characters in certain scenes. For instance, in the scene of Vincent's first hit, Max jumps out of his taxi, and he is breathing heavily, his heart is pounding, and he is having a hard time focusing. While this is going on, the camera is unsteady and shaky, and the sounds that have beenadded in are of Max's heavy breath. Another instance is of when the cops enter the night club, under the belief that Max, is Vincent.The sound editing was very, very well done, it was possibly the best incinematic history, and deserves an Oscar. Every single gunshot soundsrealistic, every single sound of breaking glass sounds realistic, and every bone or flesh break sounds realistic.In conclusion, i would just like to add that in addiction to this film being, in my opinion Mann's best, I would also say that this film is an early contender for best picture at the Oscar's because of its entertaining, intense, realistic and original story. This film is more entertaining than The Insider, more intense and realistic than Heat, and certainly Mann's best!Collateral: 9/10",Collateral

Foxx plays a very good role of someone that has no choice(do or die) role which had a solid outcome of a hero. I wanted to see Foxx in a serious situation and he pulled it off considering the most movies have been funny. This movie all in all is one that moves kinda slow and picks up good as it goes. I give it 6 out of 10 due to the situations had background music when it did not need it. The music was pumped up after the action was over.

Reading the backside of the DVD and remembering those things I heard about the film I wasn't immediately interested. Though a friend of mine wanted to see it, so we hired it. It seemed a good choice in the end.The way this movie was filmed is interesting and resembles much to what we expect to see when watching a video-clip. The quick alternation of scenes and camera-angles will carry the viewer immediately into the world of the main-characters: L.A. by midnight. This is the successful aspect of the movie. And, which is already made clear by a lot of board-people and commentators on the IMDb website, the actors are pretty good as well.But then there's the plot and the story as such, which are, compared to the level of the filming and the acting, amazingly non-committal. Some scenes are therefore pretty bad (in my view is the night-club scene where one of Tom Cruise's victims hides out one of the worst scenes and definitely the lowest ebb of the entire movie). Now what I'm trying to figure out is: did Mann want to make a picture of the night and it's violence... or did he want to make an action movie and did it accidentally became the ode to the night it has become.

Looking forward to seeing it again. Lovely gripping stuff and a wonderful complex character in Vincent. From the start to the end I was completely captivated and I only felt let down by the ending, but you cannot have it all. Perhaps when it does come out on DVD we can have an alternative ending option were Max gets popped too. Thats the one that I will always finish on. Michael Mann has definitely not let you down with this effort.",Collateral

Cruise was really great as a villain, which is a nice change but a little awkward seeing him play the bad guy -- both cruel and compassionate at the same time. Foxx is just a great actor, in this film, his was nominated for Best Support Actor but did not win. Foxx won Best Actor Oscar award for a totally different movie --Ray, a mistake comment made by the reviewer from Lockport, NY.A nice fact: Is only the second male in history to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies. The first male to do so was Al Pacino.Now that put Foxx in the spotlight, not only nominated for 2 in the same year, he won Best Actor Oscar for Ray. Foxx was so engrossed in his role, he BECAME Ray Charles, he blur the line between great acting and reality. I hope the guy from Lockport, NY can watch the movie Ray and then comment on whether Foxx should win Oscar or not. I have no doubt he would agree with me.",Collateral

Michael Mann's choice of camera use is one thing that stands out in the movie. The colors make the scenes nice to look at.Another thing is Foxx's acting. He's really good at they way he keeps his character quiet and reserved, but during his meeting with Felix, he shows a different side of himself. The first time I saw it, I honestly wasn't impressed.

He really must be wondering what he's gotta do, he spent 4 months preparing for this role, and not even a nomination. And I'm no fan of his real life beliefs and antics either. Jamie Foxx is very strong also.The dialogue is superb, quotable and memorable. The plot drives forward at a satisfying pace. There is a particularly memorable scene in a jazz club when a single a question from Cruise changes everything. Really I cannot fault this movie, and it is among the best I have ever seen. Although it's a pity they couldn't have got Foxx up on stage with the Jazz band.....",Collateral
564,twlarge,A great action thriller. but ...,7,9 July 2008,"To get them out of the way first, Cruise and Foxx are both as good as I've seen them. The script is a bit flaky. The girl was obviously dragged in at a late stage of the writing conferences, when they were running out of plot resolution options. Also, suspension of incredulity set in for me in the nightclub scene, when Vincent evades everyone and everything and manages to drag Max out of the back door despite the combined opposition of the the LAPD and about 2000 boppers, but what the hell, in a Mann movie you have to keep the action moving, don't you? Which brings me to the direction itself. Wow! Mann is the best around at managing and tweaking the pace - just when you expect him to slow down, he speeds up; just when you expect him to speed up down the road he's on, he takes a diversion and slams on the brakes - masterly! A minor criticism - the dialogue is often drowned out by the music, which is a shame as 'buddy movies' like this tend to rely on the conversations between the two male buddies.",Collateral
565,conradultimate,Probably Toms best performance,10,22 November 2006,I think Collateral is tom cruises best film he did so far.Or maybe not but he makes a really believable bad guy and i think its quite funny the fact that he looks probably 20-25 years older than he is with that grey hair. He plays as Vincent and the film and is forcing a taxi driver to drive where he wants so he can kill a thew people The taxi drivers name is Max played by Jamie Foxx and is pushed to the limits in this movie. This film is sometimes confusing and sometimes simple with all the things going on at the same time. Most of the film takes place at night which makes the film seem its moving at real time. Los Angeli's never looked more grittier and more realistic. A very intelligent-action adult thriller worth watching. My favourite scene is the train scene at the end which just makes the film more gripping and exciting.Both actors Tom Cruise and Jamie fox have good chemistry and especially on screen. In the film first they are enemy's then as the film goes on they become worst enemy's. When you see the film you will see how they got to that stage. I recommend you go see this film as song as possible because you will regret it if you don't.,Collateral

568,QueenxBee,10 out of 10 (MAJOR SPOILERS),10,17 September 2004,I loved this film simply because I love Tom Cruise he rarely does a bad film that I have seen.The acting was great and so was the action in the club and the music the only tiny bit that I thought was a little slow was when Max was pretending to be Vincent and Felix was explaining to him.The action during in the nightclub I thought was well done with all the people running away and you see Vincent save Max's life and he gives Max a look which sort of says that he thinks of Max as a friend and once he has done his job he just casually walks out of the club and goes and gets Max to carry on with the other jobs.I think I maybe one of the few people or the only one person who felt sorry for the Jazz guy and just the look of Vincent's face when he watches his briefcase being hit by a lorry. When Max starts driving really fast the look on Vincent's face seems as though he is generally scared of what could happen to him. Some parts of the film were quite funny the scenes with Max's mother in the hospital the main bit being with the flowers. The other scene that I like was the fact that Vincent was always pointing out to Max that he didn't throw the fat guy out of the window - he fell.Some people are saying they did not liked how the film ended but if you listen to what Vincent has been telling Max about the man on the train then the ending will be better - and maybe make you feel a little but sorry for Vincent even though he is the bad guy. It did for me anyway.10 out of 10 no question.,Collateral

However, I found many similarities with heat, which in general is a very good thing looking how good Heat is. I will not spoil anything for anybody (I hope the Heat comparaison isn't a spoiler) but I can tell you that the movie is extremely well directed and acted. Cruise does a superbe job, he is convincing, shows little expression (which is what was needed for his role in my mind). Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good at his role, and the whole comedic aspect of him never showed (which is good, since it was not matching his role). The shooting of the movie is very well done, the motions are very well done, with enough diversity in the technics to keep the movie interesting (unlike Bourne Supremacy, which is also good but plagued by shooting problems).Overall, I think it was without a doubt the best fiction film I've seen all summer, getting out of the theater, I was already wondering how long it would take for the DVD to come out :) 9/10!!!",Collateral

You can see him change through out the movie, and the moment of transformation is quiet profound.

That being said I was witnessed to one of the best films of I've ever seen. The beginning could be described as slow but it really does set the scene for a fast, adrenaline rushed, frantic series of events. The moment Vincent enter Max's taxi we know this is where the film really gets going. From then on it's Cruise control as Tom gives one the best performances of his career, it's easy to forget it's Tom with the grey hair and suit. Not forgetting Jamie Foxx as well who is brilliant as Max.The messages of the film are largely portrayed through Vincent and how the him and Max co-exist within the situation.The film bares similarities with Heat especially the way it shows Los Angeles from all kinds of different views backed up by a brilliant soundtrack.The only slight disappointment was the ending but even that was directed brilliantly. I mean I would have like to have seen Vincent get away with it but I think it was an ethically right ending.I'm gonna give this film 9/10 and I'm gonna say it's equal to Mann's best project ""Heat.""

573,Pegasuspizza,El Ciudad de Los Coyotes,9,28 March 2005,"Twenty years ago, Ridley Scott brought us his vision of the Los Angeles of the 21st Century,""Blade Runner"". The gleaming Ultra High Tech of the future juxtaposed with the decay and poverty of the teeming ethnic stew masses.Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" is a similar vision of a megalopolis where as hit man Tom Cruise muses, whats one life amidst the 17 million plus souls of Los Angeles? Evidently not much given the body count that accumulates as Cruise and his hostage Cabbie, Jamie Fox traverse the Los Angeles of today. From the booming Latino nightclub to the Asian high tech disco in Korea town, to the African American Jazz Club in the Crenshaw district of L.A., Mann is taking the viewer on a journey that few ever leave their falsely safe enclaves in L.A. to see or experience. L.A. is more of a Balkanized city than an ethnic melting pot. Different parallel worlds of culture and experience.As in the earlier ""Blade Runner"" the collision of past, present and future on the streets of Los Angeles is exhilarating, frightening, and disorienting, as it seems to always be eroding ones spirit and sense of self. Anomie brought to explosive levels, with predictable results.Mann one ups Scott in a sequence that only someone that has grown up in certain parts of L.A. would appreciate. After fleeing the carnage wrought at a futuristic disco, Cruise and Fox speechlessly and with amazement and bewilderment on their faces, witness a denizen of the last Ice Age cross their path in the early Pr-dawn hours. A coyote brazenly trots across the street in front of their Taxi. Its pretty clear on the message. The coyote is saying, ""You and your ways are passing through, I've always been here and always will here, I'm the true survivor not you.""The issue of time is continually referenced, especially in regards to the schedule that Cruise is adhering to in his mission. Time is also discussed as in how long it takes to get from place to place on L.A.s crowded thoroughfares. Human impatience over mere minutes.Cruise tells Fox a story of the deceased person who rode unnoticed for days on the Metro line. Forshadowing the films finale where Cruise the human coyote rides off into eternity. The coyotes both real and metaphorical, prowl and wait, for they are immune to the dictates of time.",Collateral

Granted he is much better than he was in his early days, however, a man of his status, pay and notoriety, should provide more substance.The movie without providing any spoilers, was drab, it moved along with the grace and fervor of an 87 year old with a hip replacement and arthritis. The plot was exceptionally unexceptional, and provided little meat. I found myself waiting desperately for this to be over, or at least hoping for a good ""wrap up"" at the end.The one saving grace was the acting of Jamie Foxx. He certainly has come a long way since the Wayne Brother days.He actually made me believe that he was just the OCD cab driver pitching a dream.

577,GreenHammer,Smart movie that strangely becomes dumb at the end...,8,6 June 2005,"From the very start you get sucked into Collateral, Michael Mann's impressive character study disguised as a thriller. Jamie Foxx grabs your attention from the start and never lets go. Just when you think the movie is guaranteed ****, the ending rears it's ugly head.Lets not jump right into my gripes on the movie though, and talk about whats good. First of all Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx both put up memorable performances, that rank near the top of their careers (then again putting this up with Foxx's other work, sans Ray, isn't saying much). Cruise literally looks like electricity with his spiked grey hair and beard. Foxx turns in a great performance running the gamut of the emotions. Jada Pinkett Smith is also good in a small understated roll.Mann's direction is, to no surprise, terrific. Los Angeles becomes a third lead character thanks to his direction. Somehow Mann is always lost in the discussion of great directors and I just don't get it. When has he missed lately? OK I said i would gripe so i will. First of all, why even try to ""disguise"" the fact that Cruise is a bad guy when its shouted out in every trailer and commercial? It's not that big of a deal, but it still comes off kinda strange. Secondly, the movie loses some logic towards the end. Cruise's character becomes too cartoonish and almost reminded me of something you'd see in an 80's horror movie. Lastly, there is a, for lack of a better word, awkward gunfight between Cruise and Foxx that doesn't really hit the mark.Bottom Line - Deep characters, good action, some touching scenes (the jazz hall scene is terrific) and a clunky ending earns a ***1/2/****.",Collateral

579,alinstroming,"A great must-watch thriller, that will make you think more than you thought",9,6 August 2017,"I watched this movie out of curiosity to see, what kind of a movie this was. And I was not disappointed.Collateral is one of the most best thrillers/dramas I've ever watched. In fact, Collateral is one of the most best movies in my book. Now, I'll just list some of the things and aspects that made this movie marvelous: Composition: Rarely does a movie have a compelling or post-pounding soundtrack, that sends you chills down your spines. But James Newton Howard's ost provides suspense and dread. Antonio Pinto's ending theme is actually one of the things that I remember about this movie. It's a soundtrack you just have to hear an experience.Cinematography: Filming is something I don't usually drag on to, but since this movie had an exceptionally great cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron. There are multiple static shots and especially the scenes inside the cab are well made to keep it interesting. As I said, this is something that hardly ever interests me, but it blew me away in this instance.Acting: One thing that Collateral also succeeds in is the acting. The phenomenal performances are done by Jamie Foxx, who later on earned a well-earned Oscar and Tom Cruise, who plays a different character in this movie than usually. Tom's characters are usually the same, which has become into something of a habit in Cruise's career. However, here he plays a cool guy in disguise as a cold sociopathic killer. The chemistry between Foxx and Cruise is well done and presented in a way that could even happen in reality. That is what makes Foxx's performance, particularly spectacular. This is not to say that Tom couldn't'tve earned an Oscar, because well, he could've.Plot: Something as out of the ordinary as this, the story manages to stay original and engaging at the same time. There are many movies, where the idea is present and fresh, but nothing is done with it. Here, coupled with the cinematography, Mann manages to keep the audience guessing and biting their fingernails. Throughout the movie, the characters are set into dangerous situations, which require quick thinking and awareness. The suspense is real and the inevitable consequences are left for surprises, that lurk in every scene.Final words: I enjoyed this movie, love it and I'm kinda a sad as to how underrated it is compared to some of the older classics. The only things that made it not so great were the few clichés and whatnot, but every movie has it's mistakes. Its only 13 years old, but gold nonetheless. I warmly recommend this movie to anyone, who has a thirst for thrillers, Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx. I give it 9/10: Astounding.",Collateral

There is an interesting cameo at the start by Jason Statham and I kept expecting him to turn up again in the movie but he never does. James Foxx is really good as the cab driver but it is Tom Cruise he steals the show with his portrayal of the hired hit-man. He does though make it look really cool to be a hit-man and has a certain style in carrying out his hits! Okay the film has its flaws and the plot is a bit silly at time but its a great movie. The ending though does seem like a bit of a rip off from the first Terminator film but is well executed.

Foxx plays the reluctant accomplice to perfection. Cruise puts on one of his best performances ever. Don't miss it!My only real complaint is that the dialogue is occasionally difficult to understand, at least on the DVD version. The tone of the audio is slightly muddy. I watched it with 3 others in a dedicated home theater with a high-end audio system and we had to rewind the film a couple of times to understand what was said.

583,jimmiewing,"Starts very promisingly, degenerates into mediocrity.",5,21 August 2004,"I think the reason COLLATERAL has been so over-rated by critics and audiences is the fact that the studio wisely slipped it into the summer film slate, when we're more accustomed to seeing big-budget, effects-driven event films. COLLATERAL is definitely a character-driven film, and for the first two thirds, is fairly thoughtful and well-made. The digital cinematography and pick-up locations lend an authenticity to the story of a hit-man and his cab driver. The performances are truthful, and the screenplay allows us time to get to know the characters of Vincent and Max, the proverbial cat and mouse. The third act of the film, however, degenerates into typical Hollywood gunplay. The mental chess match becomes a tired physical shoving match, and Jada Pinkett Smith's character re-appears for a wildly improbable plot twist that all but loses the film its credibility.",Collateral
584,coolbluesound,"Excellent movie, here is why (AND why NOT for some folks)",7,14 September 2004,"I'll try to keep this W/O spoilers... so here we go:Collateral is an excellent movie, by far the most glamorous movie event of the season, and delivers exactly what it promises if you know what to expect before you walk into the theater.First let me tell you that you wouldn't like this movie (hence a lot of the negative reviews here) if you:a. are a Tarantino-style sarcastic action fan b. think mood-setting scenes with visuals and music and without dialogue are unnecessary and would rather have heart-pumping non-stop action and head ached-inducing never ending dialogue c. are one of those people that look for realism in every tiny bit of the plot, and are easily turned off by coincidences and symbolismIf you fall into any of these categories above, skip this one. If you're willing to experiment and see something different... read on.Collateral has an amazing concept, but we all know it because we have seen the trailer. Besides that the script brings us some very clever and in-depth characters and lots of dialogue about life and work and people that you can actually take something out of. The script at many points fails the viewer who is desperately in need of realism but character development and actor performance is so good that you can easily ignore and even enjoy the surrealism as you get lost in the engaging characters and their dramatic motivations and passion for what they do.But the movie really shines with amazing cinematography and daring experimentation by Michael Mann. The man, who has mastered the thrill of a gunfight, does not fail to combine (yet again) stunning visuals and chillingly realistic sound to deliver to you the feeling closest to being in the proximity of an actual gunfire exchange without risking your life in one.He also uses a digital (HD) camera, throughout most of the movie, hand-held at key points to put the audience right there next to the characters. This combined with clever use of shutter speeds and lighting creates this really amazing capture of motion and the LA night scape that you cannot find in any other movie made at the time of this comment.So if you are willing to take the ride with Mann in his experimentation to create a completely new experience of the night and its players, this movie is definitely far worth your money and time.The audiophile out there will also enjoy a soundtrack with a huge spectrum (from Jazz to Techno..) and the bass-breaking dance track by Oakenfold will definitely fill the hearts of the trance/dance audience with some sweet musical satisfaction.Enjoy..",Collateral

586,tillaard,Very gripping and terrifying story. The build of tension is very good and reaches very high levels. Recommended,8,24 November 2004,"Collateral is a very powerful movie. You feel very connected to the main character Max, and you can really feel for the horror and disgust he is experiencing throughout the story. The story starts one late L.A.-afternoon and ends early next morning. Therefor almost the entire photography consists of night- and inhouse shots with very little light. Photography is very good with well worked out viewpoints, out-of-focus-shots and camera movement which increase tension and involvement. There are no dull moments in this movie. Max' character is very real. He is a nice guy but has his own flaws and shortcomings which make him very believable. One of the great things about the movie is to witness how Max's initial fear and being-completely-out-of-control gradually changes into anger and initiative. At the end of the movie I feel that Mann made Max a bigger man then he need have done, but still you can identify yourself with him. The dialogue between Max and Vincent (Cruise) is also not middle-of-the-road. Although Vincent's attitude is very two-dimensional: he is hit-man with little or no compassion or remorse, the conversations in the cab with Max still have some depth in them. Vincent develops some respect for Max as a result of their conversations. When you go see this movie you will feel yourself imersed very quickly and really feel the tension Max feels. The movie also shows a very violent, dark and sinister side of big-city life which can become very alienating.",Collateral

Its director has spent a great deal of interview time discussing his attempts to make an intelligent action movie. I'll give him credit in that the movie begins as such. There are plenty of great comments for this film going into detail about these aspects.However, with about half an hour left, the movie loses all intelligence. It goes from being an interesting movie to a brainless one, with the plot following the typical, predictable mindless rail of every similar movie from the 80s.Suddenly the characters become invincible and survive what would kill or maim anyone else. Suddenly the moons align and impossible, implausible coincidences dominate the movie. Suddenly closing your eyes and firing blindly becomes the best way to fire a weapon.Such a shame. The movie had a chance to be quite good, but it becomes by-the-numbers, and takes its audience for granted. The movie assumes that once you've committed 70 minutes to it you no longer have a brain. It tries to pull the wool over the eyes of its audience, insults their intelligence, and treats them like sheep.Worth watching, but I wouldn't recommend finishing it unless you like to be treated as a child.",Collateral
588,mario-dalimonte,One Question,7,12 June 2005,"This is a very good film, with lots of strong performances. Both Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise do a fine job, and they have a terrific on-screen chemistry. I do have one question: why is it that Jamie Foxx was regarded as a SUPPORTING ACTOR in all the award nominations the film received? He is clearly the protagonist in the film, as it is HIS story that we are being told. The range of emotions demanded by his role is greater than any of the other roles in the film. Besides that, he has more screen time than Tom Cruise. There is barely a frame of film without Mr. Foxx. So how does that add up to a supporting performance? Whom is he supporting?",Collateral

590,garymason-99267,Tom Cruises Best Film,10,5 October 2015,"Actually not only Tom Cruises best film but also Michael Mann's. Yes, I'm including Heat in that! The set up is simplicity itself. A Hit man( Cruise)coerces a meek cab driver( Foxx) to ferry him around L.A as he terminates a list of targets over the course of 1 night. As premises goes it's deliciously efficient but hardly mind blowing. The brilliance of the film is taking this somewhat generic starting point and adding a level of nuance and characterisation lacking in the vast majority of genre thrillers.Jamie Foxx was nominated for an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of a man discovering his balls as his circumstances go from bad to worse. It's Tom Cruise however( playing against type) who truly creates a classic character in Vincent- a psychopath who is both chilling and likable. Tom Cruise may be the worlds biggest movie star but it is easy to forget( and ignore) what a great character actor he can be on the rare occasion he is able to shed his hero image. His career may have produced more iconic roles but for my money this is his most interesting.Another element that also helps differentiate Collateral from the genre crowd is the cinematography. While most film makers try as hard as possible to use digital to replicate the film look, Michael Mann boldly goes in completely the opposite direction. Digital is proudly made to look digital-giving the film a hyper real( and unique) aesthetic it would otherwise lack.I debated whether I should rate this film a 10 out of 10 because it is does have noticeable flaws( although what film doesn't when you look hard enough). As a myriad of other reviewers have pointed out, the 3rd act feels rather predictable and by the numbers in comparison to the inventive excellence of the first 75 minutes or so. None the less, while the ending may not hold any surprises, crucially it is still satisfying and does not derail( unlike so many movies with that begin with such promise)what has come before. In fact, upon my second viewing, what initially felt like plot contrivance suddenly felt thematically elegant and exactly as it should be.A great, tense thriller. Watch it!",Collateral
591,TheRich,"A brilliant idea, a good performance, but Tom Cruise?!",6,22 January 2006,"This is a great movie, very gripping, and the team-up of Foxx and Cruise was a good one. Max, a cabbie with broken dreams picks up a hit-man with five targets. One night will change both of their lives. That's our storyline.But the story is weak for this movie. As the ""hit-man of the finest quality"", you'd expect a better cast. Tom Cruise?! Come on, this guy's never been a ""baddie"" in many films and it shouldn't have been used here. I'd actually have rathered Brad Pitt, George Clooney, or an actor that looks cunning, smart, and aggressive. Sadly, Tom Cruise lacks the latter.I mean, the reason why I'm saying the story is weak is this: When the body of the first hit lands on Max's (foxx) cab, Vincent (tom Cruise) tells him simply he's a hit-man. I mean come on people, where's the mystery surrounding it? By this, I mean, why couldn't they have kept it hidden from Max until say, hit number three?But with those negativities disregarded, I shall now point out the positives within this movie. It's a very gripping one with some gorgeous scenes (a lit up LA always looks good in the movies, come on, admit it!) Foxx plays his role perfectly. His looks of confusion, fear, and nerve show brilliantly and it really looks real. Cruise, well, let's just say there could have been a much better actor.",Collateral
592,johnroen,"If Made Thirty Years Ago, Today a Classic",9,30 July 2004,"Last night it occurred to me that Mike Hodges 'Get Carter' would never have been made today. Although I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is essentially the same film, it would not be a classic Brit-noir as it stands now.Collateral, if made thirty years ago in Italy with a nothing distribution someone today would unearth this film and proclaim its genius straight to the Criterion Collection.But let's look at the film. Cruise is reminiscent of Val Kilmer's 'Spartan' as he robotically navigates a jungle in which he has always remained king beast. With his gray hair, suit, and scruff, he is not Tom Cruise. Until he smiles. Until he grinds his teeth, flexes, and stares menacingly at a 45 degree angle to the camera. Its standard issue Cruise. But is that bad? Do I discredit the film because its Hollywood? Cruise, because he's the biggest, most bankable film star in history? Perhaps.Jamie Foxx is the real treat. I look forward to 'Ray' very much, in the hopes that he can dethrone Din-zil as the African American dramatist.Michael Mann, as always, very gentle in his direction. Very broad. The David Lean of modern action, if you'll forgive the inherently silly phrasing. I will say he is the only man who can make Los Angeles look like an exciting place to be.Some will gripe about the ending. Some will laugh when things aren't funny.Watch this film in an uncrowded theater. Avoid the hot-dog eating nacho-loving cell-phone ringing tarts that populate Friday night showings. But do go see it as its a strong, different piece of genre.Or you can save your $12 for the next global-pending doom-disaster film. No pun intended.",Collateral
593,Nalbiy,Felt great script,7,4 January 2021,"I didn't start watching this movie expecting to see something different from usual when we see Tom Cruise in the cover with the gun. And that means another thriller with a happy ending. And so it is. But not all at once!
Plot: Jamie Foxx plays Max, a taxi driver who dreams of fulfilling his dream one day: to open a park of entertainment limousines for VIPs, and like all taxi drivers Max works temporarily and has been temporarily working for 16 years. Vincent (Tom Cruise), a professional killer who travels around the world performing tasks, gets in a taxi with Max. This time he has a big task, to kill 5 witnesses of one high-profile case, and he must complete this in one night and fly from LA in the morning. Everything would be fine if he had not got Max involved in this business.
However, it all started well, good dialogues, good actors, constant music reminds the style of the Safedi brothers, excellent camera work.
Everything looked very realistic until the middle of the film. I thought the movie had a great script and I would enjoy the rest of the movie. But then, for no reason at all, Max takes Vincent's suitcase where the names of the witnesses are and runs away. Here I already have no words. So they weren't when Vincent caught up with him and did not kill him when he threw the suitcase in the middle of the highway, why not kill this taxi driver and hire another? I don't know, so do Max, and asks him the same question, but Vincent refers to the fact that he worked with him and does not want to part with him. Here, as it were, the viewer is presented that the hired killer has some kind of sympathy for Max, But what's wrong with this taxi driver? He is a simple guy who has at least some kind of dream but nothing special. But Vincent is babysitting him for the entire movie.
And if only Max hadn't had the courage ahead of ""time"" (I'm about Django). He seemed to be replaced. How did he start to boldly threaten the Latin bandits? He was the taxi driver who was afraid of the gun at the beginning of the movie! Where did it all go? Why did he suddenly commit a crime - to take the gun away from the cop - in order to run to save the girl he gave a lift at the beginning of the film - who happened to be on the witness list! What?
The film is neither simple nor smooth. But it's not bad movie. 7.",Collateral

Nice cameo by Javier Bardem, but his presence if pretty much wasted. The problem is the heavy handed directing and typical Hollywood boorish script. A reasonable person can pretty much predict the outcome within the first half hour of the film. The ending left me less than satisfied and laughing at the lack of ingenuity. I think Michael Mann has found his calling with Transformers.",Collateral
595,redalert99,What about Heat?,9,8 August 2004,"I just read a ton of the messages in these forums and no one is making the really obvious connection to the movie Heat. Not only was it also directed by Michael Mann, but the plot was similar. Vincent is the name of one of the main characters in Heat as well as Collateral. Tom Cruise nearly played the same character that Robert DeNiro did in Heat. He had on an almost identical suit.Both movies are about 2 men who together form one complete person. In this movie it's even more explicit, as Max literally pretends to be Vincent and copies things that he says. Somehow, cathartically, through learning about Vincent, Max learns how to be himself. The end was an homage to Heat. Several other scenes were as well. This movie barely even makes sense outside of that context. It seems to be part II of a series of ""LA crime sagas"".",Collateral

Following review is only my opinion.If you're into a good taste and someone who likes to watch high quality- intelligent movies from every point of view, then please don't.The two main stars are carrying this movie giving their best to make it as intense and entertaining as possible, but that's it.I totally agree that movies are not supposed to be realistic, but in my eyes there's a l certain logical line not to be crossed.The level of un-realism and non logical nonsense of this film is ridiculous, the camera is between basic and bad work.In the beginning it feels promising, but gets ruined by poorly edited shoot- out action scenes, meaningless killing and such a ´´movie like´´- clicheé behavior from all actors, that the kind of opening -mystery- atmosphere suffers more and more until it gets completely ruined about the half in.It just became so boring and frustrating to watch.It´s one of those 2000´s movies who just didn't age well.Summary : actors are carrying it, but definitely not worthy to watch at all.I would give it 4 or 5 stars , but the script just turned so chaotic , absurd and disastrous, that I have to stay at 3.",Collateral
598,stewate4,OK if you ignore gaping plot holes,7,28 February 2005,"Rather contrived thriller. The most obvious difficulty is why a supposedly professional contract killer would go to the trouble of taking the cab driver hostage in the first place. Why not simply hire a car, change cabs between jobs, or try to do a better job of hiding what you were up to in the first place? As it is, Vincent (Tom Cruise) as the killer ends up with a very reluctant companion who he must know would try to foul things up for him. The only reason is to keep the two characters of the cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) and the killer together, which might make sense as a way of creating dramatic situations but stretches believability. However, if you can get past that, the very clichéd ending and numerous other plot holes, it's not too bad. I'll give it a 7/10 for sheer entertainment.",Collateral
599,ryhoyarbie,Best Movie I've seen this year so far,10,7 August 2004,"I went into this movie on opening day not knowing how it would turn out. I had read the good reviews Collateral was getting but good reviews don't necessarily mean that the movie will be good. However, I had to agree with the critics because this was one of the best movies of the year if not the best this year as of August 2004. Having said that, the movie itself is about Tom Cruise as a hitman who has to kill several people during the night and in order to do that, he gets into a taxi cab drven by Jamie Fox, who at the beginning doesn't know what Cruise does but goes along after being given money for compensation. After the first stop, Fox ""finds"" out what Cruise does and wants to get away from him, but Fox is forced to drive Cruise all around Los Angeles but eventually gets enough confidence to turn on him only to figure out that Cruise's last victim on the list is the woman named Annie, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, Fox dropped off before he picked up Cruise. Fox has to find away to stop Cruise and rescue Jada before Cruise completes his job.
Well acted movie that is edgy and very dark. I'm not a big fan of Cruise but he was great as the villian, while Fox did a great job as being the cab driver who was in way over his head while driving Cruise around. The direction from Micheal Mann is also excellent. 4 out of 4 stars.",Collateral

This movie hasn't impressed although ""Kane & Lynch"" has borrowed one scene from it which was more exciting to play than watch it. This is not the best movie by Tom Cruise or Jamie Fox for sure. The whole idea was quite good, but, on the other hand, the good guy has won and the bad guy has lost. Surprisingly, a well-trained killer with a full clip gets owned by a guy who doesn't even know how to lock and load the pistol properly. I've really seen better. The movie would be real if there was some drama, but there only was some effort to make look it that way which was not even close. A traditional ""Hollywood ending"" with some chase, a few ""pops"", finally, female and male main characters are still alive and very happy together. Crap in other words... Imagine if you were a cab driver: one night a guy like Tom Cruise rams the 9mm gun into your head saying: ""Drive or die, punk!""

Adds up to a pretty picture but the supposedly ""deep"" dialogue can't make up for yet another hit-man picture. Watching this film made me long for the days of the Insider or Heat when the relationships meant something. Here there are too many clichés- the goodhearted cabdriver, the philosophical hit-man, the cop that figures it all out. Perhaps it would be more interesting if it wasn't in LA- Mann's LA where everything is slick and people dance in unison in a club. Meanwhile there's lots of driving around in the cab and occasional gunfights where a machine-like Cruise becomes the Terminator.",Collateral
603,honeybush30,I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was!,7,5 August 2004,"I saw 'Collateral' tonight & I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was entertaining, tightly-wound thriller with several unforeseen twists. There were some highly funny moments where I & other audience members laughed. This isn't a comedy by any means, more like humor breaking up a tense situation or laughing because a character has personality traits or a favorite saying that's funny.Tom Cruise did his usual solid performance, but Jamie Foxx just hit it right out of the park. He is very talented with a great acting range. I now look forward to seeing the Ray Charles biopic he is starring in soon. The rest of the cast did very well, especially Javier Bardem (bad guy Felix) and Barry 'Shabaka' Henry (jazz musician Danny). The only poor performances, IMHO, were Bruce McGill playing a by-the-book-case-taking-over FBI agent and Peter Berg as the flashy detective who can't be bothered by details that don't add up. They are both usually good performers.The relationship between Max (Foxx) & Vincent (Cruise) is cerebral & intense. In the inside of the cab, you watch as Vincent spins his web, and Max is compelled (for a variety of different reasons) to do what he asks. In one of the key moments of the film, there is a big confrontation between the two, and I thought, 'It's too early for the big showdown.' That's when the movie 'kicked it up a notch.' I had read on some sites that the music was too loud & the camera work was too busy, but I found both enjoyable. The movie was shot in a frenetic style that did make me a little motion-sick once or twice!I definitely recommend this movie!",Collateral

I think Stuart Beattie did an exceptionally poor job with the script. Some much of the dialogue is unnatural and out of place. I was actually quite surprised to find out after screening the film that Foxx was nominated for an Oscar. I certainly think his performance was good considering what he was working with in the script. The writing took the characters and kept them too contained. The relationship between Vincent and Max was too comfortable. Collateral could have benefited from more tension between the two characters. The film is a near spectacle to observe. The lighting is executed in an unprecedented form with the ELD panels that were placed inside the taxi. I did admire the use of the Los Angeles backdrop, but at the end of the film I felt a noticeable lack of cohesion and unity.

Tom Cruise's (Vincent) dialogue was so charismatic it will leave audiences rooting for the bad guy.  The character Vincent is a socio-path, who's erratic but fascinating philosophies pave wave for his justified views on death and destruction.  This movie in a way parodies Tom Cruise's scientologist beliefs.     Don't forget Jamie Fox.  His character, Max adds a hilarious insecure sensibility on every issue.  The intensity is always in the red and the action is sensational.  Who would have thought the collaboration between these two actors would be so functional.  I hope Tom Cruise will finally get his shot at an Oscar come March.  If you have a chance to see this in theaters take it, but be cautioned of its violence and abstract morale.",Collateral
607,whitecarrot2001,A complete waste of your time,2,4 December 2004,"This movie is a contrivance from the word go that doesn't even try to end up at a destination of any meaning.Two hours spent with Tom Cruise the psychopathic hit man of immeasurable skill who is killed in the end by his freaked out cab driver with no skill and no balls. This flick barely stays together through the first half, the setup and killing of the jazz trumpeter in his club after hours being sketchy at best, but then the movie takes a dive after the FBI catches on as the bodies pile up, and Cruise then goes into a Chinese disco in Los Angeles to take out his fourth victim (an informant against Mexican drug dealers it would seem). There is no one on this planet who could lucidly explain even half of what transpires inside the club as Cruise shoves his way through the elbow-to-elbow crowded dance floor while appearing to be able to recognize every FBI agent inside and kill most of them even though you the viewer can't tell who is who nor imagine how anyone else could.After exiting the club and reclaiming his cab driver outside by killing the LAPD detective who the cabbie thinks has rescued him from the evil Cruise, the cabbie freaks out and flips the cab. Cruise exits and runs off to make his next kill while the dazed and confused Cabbie is first helped by a cop then arrested when the cop discovers the body of Cruise's first victim in the open trunk.But, as the cuffs are going on the cabbie, he peers into the back seat and sees the open laptop screen on which Cruise has the address and pictures of his victims. The final one is there and it is the attractive U.S. Attorney who the cabbie scored a date with just before Cruise got into his cab and began the nightmare hours earlier. Now, besides the cabbie being dazed to near unconsciousness, the laptop is a good six feet away from him and the picture of his fantasy date is about two inches squareEven an alert eagle would have trouble seeing that. The cabbie then fights off the cop, handcuffs him and takes off running with his gun to stop Tom Cruise from making his final kill of the evening. You know how that comes out. Even the morons who this movie was apparently made for can figure that out. Now why would Cruise be trying to kill the U.S. Attorney doing the prosecution? The sophisticated gang who hired Cruise (who appear to operate at a level beyond the Mexican government) couldn't figure out that the Federal government has more prosecutors? It's amazing that this kind of money could be spent and a director like Michael Mann would be involved with a flick that had a script this lame. Every cast member and plot turn in this movie is as hollow as Tom Cruise's hit man psychopathic character. You were warned.",Collateral

Vincent shows up outta nowhere and moves about LA at night systematically murdering his victims who are related as being witnesses in some sort of pending drug case (phone book killer, anyone?) until the cops finally figure it out. He is ostensibly relentless, unstoppable, focused and efficient (terminator like?) in his single mindedness. Sound familiar? Until finally, he is stopped by our hero, who saves the girl. Plenty of thrills, chills and spills, plausible action. I'm not hollering ""plagiarism"". And don't get me wrong, ""The Terminator"" was one of my all time fav's.

My expectations for Tom Cruise were considerably lower; after numerous mediocre performances and only a few good ones, (Interview with the Vampire and Jerry Maguire) , the only excuse I could make for Cruise is that he is such a big star you can never see the character he is playing. But in Collateral he literally pops off the screen I have never seen him act with such force and presence. Undoubtedly Cruise was aided by Foxx taking his abilities to another level, already known for his comic wit and gift for mimicry, Foxx shows he can be subtle unassuming and pitiable. Their performances were enhanced and enabled by Michael Mann's masterful direction his use of angles and different filters give this picture a raw reality, Mann shows us the unglamorous side of LA and he shows us humanity at its most vital and vulnerable.",Collateral
611,John-Sigl,best action-drama I've seen in a couple years,9,22 December 2004,"Hey....I checked the spoiler box....but I find it hard to believe anything I say here will be considered a spoiler.Cruise is a hit-man who has to kill 5 people who will be involved in a trial the next day. Jamie Foxx is the cabbie who drives him around L.A. to his various destinations.Cruise is cold and calculating....but not devoid of humor and emotion...a different kind of hit-man. He plays Thur role well and it is a strong rebound from his disappointing ""The Last Samurai"" which is a blatant ""Dances With Wolves"" ripoff. That being said....Cruise is one of my favorite actors and I'll watch pretty much anything he is in. He is cast well here and the role fits him like a glove. Though he has been nominated twice for Oscars (""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July""), it is my belief he will NEVER win one. Sadly, he probably won't be nominated for this role either.Though I dislike Jamie Foxx....I must admit that he is fantastic in his role here. He gives his role of cabbie scope and dimension that I never thought he had the talent to give. He is as responsible as Cruise is for whatever accolades this movie receives. Whatever bouquets get thrown Foxx's way for this film....they are well deserved.The film has a very atmospheric feel to it. The sun never shines and the film itself is dark and depressing. These are my favorite kinds of films as I need to see people who are suffering in life more than I am. Director Michael Mann has become well regarded as the type of director to helm material of this nature... and he creates mood and feel galore here.Scipt and soundtrack are top notch and all technical aspects are first rate also. The film's only drawback is a somewhat flat ending. Five more minutes of film and it all would have been cleaned up beautifully.Years from now...I'm sure critics will look back fondly on this film and rate it a ""sleeper"". It didn't make moucho $$$ and never really achieved any great status when released...but it will be remembered in a positive manner.Finally...let me finish by saying....I'm a film junkie and watch 'em all from the 1930s to present day...and I'm telling you....if you like your films on the dramatic dark side....this is one for you.",Collateral
612,rickblaine1942,intriguing premise falls apart,6,17 November 2006,"Michael Mann's 'Collateral' has lots going for it including lush visuals and an atmosphere of a surreal-looking L.A. and its diverse topography.A beguiling, cold-blooded assassin psychologically losing control while his counterpart, a mild cabbie, becomes emboldened- is an intriguing concept. Dialogue, acting, and pacing were all involving.But it would be nice if there were a halfway plausible narrative. And that ending was telegraphed early on in the movie. Then a horde of coincidences and plot holes conspired to undermine it all.SPOILERS AHEAD What are the chances that on a night a cabbie had two random fares in the largest city in the U.S., one would be an assassin and the other one of his targets?It was ludicrous when victim #1 fell out of his 4th floor apartment. After all, what competent hit man would shoot his target right in front of an open window? (Yet Vincent, the hit man, is presumably the ultimate in the profession). Sure enough, the victim then goes splat right atop Max's cab- gee, what are the odds? Later, Vincent decides to take time out for a friendly visit of Max's mother in the hospital- normal protocol for an assassin. Who should they meet in the elevator? Why the cop sniffing out their trail! Max then decides to run out of the room leaving poor Mama briefly with the conscienceless, amoral assassin Max had just seen murder five people (three targets plus two intruders).Well, Max and Mama weren't that close, anyway.And how does a quaking cab driver convince a vicious drug overlord that he is really the hit man he's just hired? Because drug czars are really idiots, don't you know?Vincent stresses that he be anonymous- yet what happens in the big night club shootout? While guns are blazing away, scores of people see Vincent hacking his way Terminator-style toward target #4, a big Korean with a large coterie of bodyguards. Amid all the chaos, the Korean never moves from his seat in the booth. He awaits his fate like a seal pup in front of a shark. I guess he was really into the music. And how does Vincent calmly walk by L.A. police and the Feds, into the street unchallenged after having just caused so much destruction? (He even plugs a cop on the way out).Just prior to the night club shootout, there are police cars and helicopters tracking the taxi cab through crowded L.A. streets. A few minutes later, after the shootout, the streets are suddenly deserted. Huh? Oh I get it, that was a mood change.After Max crashes the cab, Vincent's laptop is conveniently open revealing who target #5 is. Anyone could see in the foreshadowing at the beginning of the film, who that was going to be.I probably could have forgiven the plot contrivances, if the denouement hadn't been so klutzy. We've got Max desperately trying to reach the damsel in distress on his cell phone, which is breaking up because the battery is low (only seen that one about a hundred times). And of course, Max finds a spot atop a parking structure which can still transmit a signal, which naturally gives him a view of our heroine's office in a federal building and also a view of the heroine and our assassin. Even though it's about 3 a.m. at this point in the movie, our heroine (the prosecuting attorney) is still getting prepared for her case that very morning (oh yeah). And our assassin takes no notice that there would be cameras all over a federal building. But that's OK because we've already noticed that our terminator is none too bright about details.Why Vincent needs to whack the attorney is a puzzle in itself, since all the prosecution witnesses have been taken out. And why he takes time to locate the power source for the 16th floor and knock out the lights, who knows? He could have just walked in there and killed her, but no, at this point of the story, with the claustrophobic effect of the taxi cab ride over, we need to try and fabricate suspense. And when Vincent finally gets his gun trained on her, instead of drilling her quickly like the marksman he was with the other victims, he simply stands there for 5 or 6 seconds until our cabbie enters the scene, and they can have a couple lines of witty repartee.Later, after jumping on the back of a moving subway train, (the back door is open, of course) our rivals move toward their final confrontation. Then we're supposed to believe that Max, who doesn't even know how to brandish a gun, accidentally kills Vincent with a miraculous shot through a window. Bravo, Max.And of course, the last line in the film has Vincent muttering a repeated line of psychobabble he had made reference to earlier in a cab scene- to the effect that if a man is shot dead in a subway, will anybody notice? Well, not that hit-man anyway.Since Mann had made it a big point in the film for Vincent to talk about man's insignificance in the universe, the movie would have had a much more impactive ending if there had been some sort of final psychological warfare staged between Vincent and Max. Perhaps Vincent could have finished off Annie, walked out and left us wondering what would have gone through Max's mind. Almost anything would have been better than the Hollywood clichéd ending that was presented here, and it's somewhat surprising that a director of Mann's stature and intelligence didn't give us one.But, hey Mr. Cruise. You looked icy cool with that spiked silver-gray hair and matching suit. A hit man should always be stylin'.",Collateral
613,rk-26,In a word,1,14 February 2005,"The worst film that I can remember seeing in a long time. Experience has taught me to stay away from the slapstick ""comedy"" and teen movies, but this was sluggish, hard to understand (due to poor diction) garbage of the first degree.Cruise must have been desperate for money to agree to ""act"" in this pile of manure....The opening scenes set up the film to an extent and for a while it looked good - the Taxi driver had a warmth and the female passenger (leter to be the last on the hit list) jelled well and there was a chemistry between them.Once the carnage began though the reason for the killings and the way in which they were done was not as clever as the trailer depicted. Some of the characters parts in the carnage seemed unclear, for a while you could not tell the goodies from the baddies....My wife fell asleep half way through and has declared that she would have to think twice before watching another DVD with Cruise in, we liked Last of the Samurai and loved that - but this latest attempt was futile. I just hope he is in better form in War of the Worlds - a film I want to see having enjoyed the old version. GARBAGE",Collateral
614,lewiswill,Stupid stupid stupid,2,24 November 2004,"Sorry but I really thought this movie was pretty stupid. I enjoyed the conversation in the taxi at the beginning, but once it became clear that Max was required to keep driving Tom around LA, bad memories of Phone Booth (even worse) came back and the stupidity quickly ensued. The actors are good but the plot is one of those silly whipped up stories that movie-makers are tending to use more and more to fill up two hours. There was no real flow to this movie, nor any subtlety or beauty. I am not a particularly demanding movie-watcher, but I require movies to have an IQ of at least 80 - this movie fell well short of that. I am surprised that it is getting so many good reviews.",Collateral
615,destinysmile,A superb film though I know some of you will complain about ending...,10,15 May 2005,"I saw this film on a preview before it was officially out. It had a rather profound affect on me. It was cleverly made and well acted, most definitely one of the better action films of our time. The story line is interesting and fast paced and the twists and turns intermingled with clever dialogue lead you along nicely. Perhaps the ending will disappoint some, yet I am a believer in good... and rather have a sweet rather than bitter taste left at the end. In a nutshell; a taxi driver picks up a passenger, who turns out to be no ordinary guy and the night that follows will change our taxi drivers life... Go see it, it is most definitely a little different and Cruise for once is on top form.",Collateral
616,ultramoviemad,Just not believable,5,4 December 2014,"Its just too far fetched to think that a professional killer would act in this manner & draw attention to himself in so many ways that he did. Quite ridiculous Club scene where Cruise walks in an takes out just about every bouncer in the club & also avoids capture by the FBI & Police squads who are already in position,just not feasible - never going to happen.Tom Cruise just doesn't do sinister villain very well - can't take him seriously in this type of role.Mark Ruffalo's character of suspicious detective is built up very nicely - gets you thinking that he will play a major role in the end but suddenly fizzles out when he is shot at the crazy club scene - not much sense in all of that..",Collateral
617,Kinhell,Cruise at his best,9,1 May 2005,"It started like any other night...For Max (Jamie Foxx) a cab driver in Los Angeles who takes his job seriously. After dropping off attractive lawyer Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and bagging her number he then gets a new pickup. Enter Vincent (Tom Cruise with grey hair) a mysterious business type character who poses as a real estate agent. Impressed by Max's excellent navigating skills and the speed in which he gets him to his location, Vincent asks to buy Max's services for the evening taking him to a few destinations. Reluctantly Max agrees, not knowing what the night will bring.What the night does bring is Tom Cruise as we haven't seen him before. As a ruthless ass kicking assassin, he plays the role of Vincent superbly. There isn't a huge cast, the majority of the film is the two main leads, Cruise and Foxx, who have excellent chemistry together. While there is a sub plot going on involving a detective on Vincent's tail the film really doesn't get too caught up in it, which is a good thing and a break from the norm.There is little action in Collateral but this really doesn't affect the pace of the film at all. Mann has done a terrific job of balancing it out and making it into a stylish gritty movie. When there is action it is jaw dropping stuff, especially the way Cruise executes a scene. A big plus for me was the way the film doesn't really go into Vincent's character, leaving him mysterious and leaving your own imagination to think about what his past may have involved.I have few gripes about this movie, I really enjoyed it and I have to say its probably the best film I have seen this year. The only noticeable flaw for me was the Hollywood style ending. Although by no means was it bad, I think it could have possibly been done differently, but then you have to cater for a majority audience.Overall this movie left me thinking when I left the cinema, always a good thing. Its different to most of the crime thrillers we tend to get an abundance of today. The acting is superb, especially Cruise as I mentioned before, I really cant emphasise enough how kick ass he is in Collateral. In a nutshell its not too overwhelming or fancy, it has perfect pace and well worth going to see!",Collateral
618,Wannabetaxidriver,The Best thriller of 2004.,9,2 July 2005,"Collateral combines star power, great performances, top notch direction, a fantastic soundtrack and what is a bona fide contender to be called the best action scene in years. Quite simply, I can not think of a movie released in 2004 that thrilled me quite as much as Collateral. Collateral has Tom Cruise (Who rivals Sean Penn to be called my favorite actor of the generation of 40-something year olds) as Vincent, a smart, precise hit-man in Los Angeles to kill five targets in one night. He hires cabdriver Max (Jamie Foxx, in a now Oscar nominated performance) for the night and they're off. Max realizes that something is up around the time that Vincent leaves at the first stop and a dead body hits the roof of his cab. Upon his return, he replies that he didn't kill him, ""Bullets and the fall killed him."" Over the course of the night they make more stops, most of which turn into great scenes, whether they're going to a jazz club to off a guy or to a hospital to pay a visit to Max's mom. The scene I was referring to the best action scene in years takes place in a night club where Max and Vincent, some cops who think Max is the killer, a thug belonging to Vincent's employer who also thinks Max is the Killer, a cop who knows Max isn't the Killer, club security, Vincent's target and his bodyguards and a dance floor full of bystanders meet up. There is about five minutes of characters driving to the club that builds up tension beyond belief. When it goes down, it may be a flurry of gunfire, but with the setting of the club, the quality of Mann's direction and the coolest piece of music I've heard in a movie this year(Paul Oakenfold- Ready Steady Go,) it adds up to the best action scene of at least this year, topping even the car chases of movies like The Bourne Supremacy, Which I loved, The Matrix Reloaded, Which I liked, and I, Robot, Which I didn't care for. Collateral can be seen as an adrenaline pumping thriller, which it is, or as something more. For those of us who loved Mann's 1995 epic Heat, Collateral is definitely the latter. Mann makes references to heat in several ways. For those who thought that the subway finale was a disappointment, check out Heat. The nod there is that Heat begins on a subway platform and ends at the airport, while Collateral begins in the LAX terminal and ends on the subway. That is just one of several nods. When people have been saying stuff about the best thriller of 2004, they are frequently mentioning Collateral, The Bourne Supremacy and The Manchurian Candidate. While I consider Collateral a clear victor, I certainly understand why someone would mention The Bourne Supremacy, but The Manchurian Candidate was murky all the way through, had a weak ending and was a major step down from the 1962 version, which is one of the best movies ever made. I'll use the phrase that James Berardinelli uses on his favorite summer movies to wrap this up. When the dust settles, Collateral will be the best of this (Last) years summer movies. Sadly, Collateral only got two Oscar nods, Supporting Actor, Foxx, and Editing. However, that's more than any other mentioned summer thriller got. ***1/2 (Out of ****)",Collateral
619,collin_twardowski,Personal Favorite,10,28 January 2021,Collateral is one of my all-time favorite films. I personally think it's one of the greats. It's visually beautiful and is masterfully directed by Mann. The suspense and tension just keeps going throughout. Tom Cruise gives one of the most underrated and one of my favorite performances ever as hitman Vincent. Cruise plays a character opposite his normal good guy persona and does absolutely amazing.,Collateral
620,aignatiou,FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!,10,29 July 2004,"I just saw Collateral in a screening and thought it was just awesome. Tense, funny and fun to watch. Tom Cruise is as ruthless as ever playing a better villain than he can play a normal everyday guy. Jamie Foxx was great. The cinematography was awesome. The soundtrack fit the movie perfectly. Definitely a great movie that I highly recommend. Lots of action and witty dialogue, which was the last thing i was expecting from this movie. It's a long movie but it's a good one. It keeps you're interest and you don't get tired watching it. The characters are fascinating and the direction is really cool. The idea was great and it worked very well. When it comes out I'm gonna go see it again just to support one of few good movies that came out this summer. Go see it. 9/10",Collateral
621,breakangel,one of Cruise's best,8,3 May 2006,"Firstly, excuse me while I run around the room and scream like a pathetic little fangirl. JASON STATHAM WAS IN COLLATERAL! Who knew? I can't believe that nobody TOLD me that one of my most favorite actors in the whole wide world had a cameo in this flick. I would have gone and seen it SO much sooner if I'd known. Plus, he used his real accent for all of the two lines he had. *swoon* Ahem. Okay, fangirl moment over.The initial idea that came to mind after the movie ended was this: I read rave reviews for the Ethan Hawke flick Training Day, in which Denzel Washington portrays a rogue cop with an agenda for murdering his rookie partner. In most of these reviews, Denzel was said to be ""completely gripping, fiercely charismatic."" He even won an Oscar for the role. Although I enjoyed the movie, I thought that the reviews of Denzel's acting were ridiculous. He was no more gripping and charismatic in that film than he was in Glory or Virtuosity.Those compliments, however, would fit Tom Cruise perfectly. He captivates with his villain turn in Collateral. Nothing describes the cocky, smooth-talking Vincent better than the term 'fiercely charismatic.' Every moment that Cruise was on screen, I was enamored, breathless, on the edge of my seat to see what he'd do next. And all this coming from a non-Tom fan...Jamie Foxx, in stark contrast to Cruise's slick confidence, is quiet and moody. He plays cab driver Max as beyond deep, someone who reels you in like a fish on a hook, someone who captures your heart and your interest in one fell swoop, and never- even in his brief moments of weakness- lets you look away.In short, Collateral's acting is superb.I was also pleasantly surprised by the addition of actors Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett-Smith to the mix. (Mark Ruffalo's hot, but if you like him as much as I do you may not want to see this film- he meets a sad end before his character even really comes into his own.) Both were believable in their roles, although Ruffalo seemed to struggle a bit in the flat characterization of well-meaning undercover cop.Max and Vincent have great chemistry- from the beginning, you sense a spark between the two that hints at some similarities besides the obvious. Max is quiet and submissive, and thus Vincent alternately bullies and builds him up throughout the movie. Ironically, in the end it is Vincent's constant encouragement that helps Max stand up to the contract killer. The dramatic rise in Max's self-confidence throughout the film is interesting to watch, and you can't tear your eyes from Vincent. He goes from cool, collected businessman to lethal killing machine, from threatening to put a bullet in Max's skull to killing a cop for aiming a gun at the cabbie. It's enough to make your head spin, and it's incredible.In my opinion, the film was drawn out about twenty minutes too long. The ending was a bit too contrived, the dialogue a bit too stale. The saving grace in this film is, again, the incredibly vivid acting by both Cruise and Foxx. Their characters came to life for me; I could see aspects of their lives and imagine their thoughts.This film is right up there with Road to Perdition on my list of fantastically directed and acted movies. Plus the cinematography was utterly fabulous. I'd recommend it to anyone.",Collateral
622,brian-watson8057,Really enjoyed this film,9,6 August 2006,"Got the DVD recently for my Birthday, had heard good things about the film but didn't really know what to expect. At first I thought it was quite slow in starting and it took me a while to stop looking at Tom Cruises wig. Some of the way Tom Cruise was talking came across a bit strange coming from him, ie the bad guy talk. The actual killings looked really realistic and very quick. Ever camera angle was great. Jamie Fox played a good part, I had watched jarhead first so I was used to seeing him play a strong character, he succeeded in the transition from tough Sargent to innocent cab driver.The ending was great, although I think I'm going to watch it again to see what bullet actually killed Vincent.I also think the film being filmed in Los Angeles was a great idea as it added to the atmosphere.Overall good movie",Collateral
623,malchikizkurakh,It's Like That 'Gold & White Dress' All Over Again,2,26 January 2020,"Some people have been loving this movie, some went further by calling it a masterpiece. And the others have been wondering why so many people, let alone loving, even liked this film. The dichotomy in scrutiny is significant.I've wondered the reason behind all of those 'over the top' ratings until the last 15 minutes. After that, I realized that those peeps who've been reviewing the movie must have just saw Tom Cruise and slapped those 10/10 ratings. There can't be any other reason.Cheesy and shallow philosophical arguments, Jamie Foxx's below-the-bottom acting and his pseudo-humanist character, plot holes that are bigger than the plot itself, trying too hard for a ironic climax and making Tom Cruise's bound to his character only subtle thing about this movie by acting as if the viewer is stupid by making the character explain the irony and so on.Only good thing about this movie is that it ends.

625,Angel_Arioch,"Like Heat only, not",3,7 September 2004,"The idea for Collateral (A taxi cab driver forced against his will to drive a hit man to 5 separate locations throughout the night) is excellent. Tom Cruises acting, along with Jamie Foxx who usually annoys me, was above par. However, Michael Mann's decision to use:A: The worlds worst editor in the history of film B: One of the dumbest musical arrangements/scoring ever recorded and C: The most idiotic coincidences I've ever seen in a filmReally really pushed this movie into the crap category for me. I mean don't get me wrong, if you absolutely LOVE Bacardi Silver and enjoy staring at an advertisement for it which literally fills the entire screen for like 15 seconds, or if you enjoy watching scenes that drag on for no apparent reason then yes, this film is incredible.Personally though, I would have probably paid someone to actually act as an editor on the movie instead of allowing a retarded monkey to put the scenes together. And I might have considered paying someone to put together a soundtrack so that there weren't scenes where 15 minutes of piano elevator music put the audience to sleep.--- Spoiler Alert ---And the coincidences, oh my god. Honestly, the cop being at the hospital at the same time as the killer just by chance? And the fact that Jamie Foxx randomly met one of the assassins targets immediately before picking him up as a fair. What the Christ is that? It's bad writing is what it is, and despite having a good cast and director this movie really imploded into itself after about the first 30 minutes.I don't even want to go into how poorly the club scene was put together. I mean honestly, where did all the cops go? There was a club full of swat team special ops and as soon as the loser from Macguyver gets shot in the foot they all disappear to I guess let Tom Cruise murder his target.What?Anyway, this movie really upset me because it had such a great premise and some of the dialogue was excellent... just, got destroyed by the editing department. Really really bad cuts, still worth seeing just, maybe not in theaters. Maybe they'll release a re-worked edition on DVD, that would be nice.",Collateral
626,stephenjsavage,I finally raw this movie,4,27 December 2012,"And liked it for the first 90 mins. Sure, I can like movies like this that slowly become more impossible so long as it IS possible.But the last 30min. or so was unbearably ludicrous. Let's begin to sum it all up in a nutshell. It starts with the Asian club scene where everyone runs around in a circle for 3-4 min. while Tom Cruise physically breaks (non-chalantly to those he pushes into these short attack zones and with purely permanent or deadly injuries) a few punks down and no one seems to notice until the next 3-4min. when obvious gunfire is going on, only Cruise hitting anyone while three factions are against him, and yet people keep providing cover while they circle in the middle of it all, again, for several minutes, and they cover their escape. Next, the cab car crash where they don't mention (Jamie Fox asks but there's no answer, that's helpful incredibly hurt cab driver) or seem to say that either wore a seatbelt, no airbags at all, the car flipped violently and would have put both in critical condition at BEST with seatbelts and no airbags, but both walk (RUN did Cruise) away. Tom Cruise ran a two minute 800 meters out of that.Then it gets even worse, as if it could have. I could post more run-on sentences to sum up the rest, but it's pretty much the same run-on joke.Screw this movie.",Collateral
627,markneamtu,Mann's movies - doesn't tend to work out the shooting scenes well,6,26 December 2004,I am a big of Michael Mann's movies. However I recently watched 'Thief' and after watching Collateral - I have found that he doesn't tend to sort the logistics well in the plot with regards to the shooting scenes. The protagonist in his movies tends to rely on luck in order to survive extreme shooting scenes. It implies to me that either his writers or the director have not fired a hand gun very often. Jamie Foxx's character's action in the last couple of scenes was almost insulting to the audience's intelligence. Why did Tom Cruise's Vincent - didn't shield himself from the shooting in the train like he did in the club? It just defies logic... James Caan's character in 'Thief' comes up with a incredible shots in a outnumbered firefight. He shouldn't have survived... just like Al Pacino shouldn't have seen Robert DeNiro in last scene of 'Heat'. Michael seems rush to end his action movies sometimes but the audience get cheated. Vincent should have killed the Cab driver Max a long time ago. The good guy doesn't always have to win. The movies would have been more edgy if the Mark Ruffalo's character doesn't get shot but tracks down the case while Vincent kills all 6 objectives including Max as the 'patsy'.,Collateral
628,maxpackchris,Pointless Brutality,5,23 January 2005,This may contain a spoiler.This movie was stupid. By the time it was half over I could hardly take another minute of the pointless brutal violence that took up half of the screen time. This movie is about Tom Cruise ruthlessly killing people. If he was a contract killer the storyline behind this is never developed to any meaningful degree. We never get to really know who his character is other than that he wears a gray suit and is a lawyer in Washington. The most we learn about Cruise is that he has a particular shooting style of shooting in bursts to kill his targets. We learn this from the coroner :/ Jamie Fox's character is hardly developed either. The most we learn about Cruise Don't pay to see it. Ever.,Collateral

Reading these posts here I feel like that guy  one of twelve in before mentioned flick  and cannot believe what I see. Great movie? Someone even said 'lovely camera angels'? What in the name of movie fan that supposed to mean?This movie is just another shallow example how Hollywood does not give a sh* about a real, good, exciting story. I mean, that was a slew of impossible events (one cab driver in a city like L.A. the same night meets both a Prosecutor on the case and a Killer on the same case, give me break) and a bundle of plain stupid episodes (Killer goes with a cab driver to see latter's mother in a hospital, the police pull over the damaged car and let it go. Every cab driver would tell you that there is no way he or she would drive all night around L.A. with broken windshield) etc., etc. etc.! Than that shutout in the nightclub? My gosh, just look at that stupid mess, no sense whatsoever oh, my, I can not even continue thisQuite a few people left the theatre before the movie ends. I stayed hoping something would happen, something exciting, surprising, interesting. Nothing happened, of course. This movie is, like waste majority of Hollywood new wave garbage waste of time and money.Before making a parallel with Alfred Hitchcock rent one of his movies instead.

630,mcandy,Tom Cruise Breaks Mold,8,21 February 2005,"This is the usual Michael Mann mix; a slick script, with good action sequences, and his usual sweeping shots of Los Angles. Tom Cruise breaks his usual mold by playing a grey haired professional killer with a busy night ahead of him, a pleasant and not unsuccessful change. Five kills. One night. Although one can't condone his actions, the viewer (or particularly this one) can't bring himself to dislike him. Jamie Foxx does well as the taxi driver that under duress transports Cruise to his destinations. The conversations between the two men is as riveting as the short sharp action scenes. Jada Pinckett-Smith pads out the cast in what is essentially a cameo role.

The move just kept getting better and better. The shoot out scene in the club is simply magnificent. Jamie Foxx is amazing and he has finally got a role he wanted with Tom since he missed out on Jerry Maguire. Will Smith's doing was definitely part of this movie since his wife and close friend Jamie is in the movie but the chemistry is great. I loved this movie because it was very original and realistic.

633,skateboardr180,A fierce backseat thrill ride,9,11 November 2004,"Collateral takes place in the depths of night in LA. The city lights are a powerful element of the film whilst the plot unravels and Mann refers frequently to the bird's-eye shot following the cab throughout the city.Tom Cruise plays role of Vincent, the hit man with no remorse or consent, whereas Jamie Foxx fits the role of Max, the edgy cab driver who finds himself amidst a situation he is powerless to escape.Vincent enters the car with simple commands, he has five stops to make and offers $600 if Max drives him throughout the night from hit to hit. Max soon starts to tremble and tries to start deals with Vincent to let him go free but the job must be done.

634,southernmissfan,Collateral,7,10 April 2005,"A supposed action movie starring Jamie Foxx, of all people, and Tom Cruise as the bad guy; that's about as bad as movie formulas get, right? Boy was this film a surprise. Director Michael Mann, famous for such films as Heat and Last of the Mohicans, has created a cool, stylistic and thrilling crime drama with unexpectedly fine acting, excellent cinematography, great sound and a gripping story.Story The film opens with a bearded, grey-haired Tom Cruise exchanging his suitcase at the airport. This older, slyer Cruise is much different than what movie-goers have come to expect, and Cruise definitely pulls it off. As soon as we are introduced to Cruise's character, the movie shifts to a taxi station, where we see Max (Jamie Foxx) getting into his cab and leaving for his normal shift. Jamie Foxx is definitely an interesting pick, considering he was mostly known for comedy and Booty Call up until this point, but Foxx gives a surprisingly breakout performance and establishes himself as a future big-time star. The shift starts off like any other and Max picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), a no nonsense lawyer who quickly gives very specific directions. Eventually, the characters start to open up and the fare becomes one long conversation. The interesting opening gives insight into the character of Max, and also introduces us to Annie, who will reappear in the climax of the film. Max drops off Annie downtown and then, under unusual circumstances, picks up Vincent (Cruise). Vincent attempts to connect with Max, but to no avail. But when Vincent is brought to his desired destination, he proposes a deal: he has to make five stops, and he is willing to pay seven-hundred dollars for the night. Max accepts because it is only a ""part-time job"" to pay the bills. This marks the beginning of the relationship between the cold, always in control hit-man Vincent and the bumbling cabbie Max. The suspense starts setting in when Max realizes he isn't just driving around a customer, he's taking part in a series of assassinations! Collateral isn't a dumbed down, generic action flick but rather a smart, enthralling drama set around these two men and this one night. Mann uses controlled settings exceptionally well, with much of the movie taking place inside of the cab and all of the events taking place in one single night. The use of character development in a suspense-thriller as opposed to unnecessary action is refreshing change. The film is such a wild, top-notch experience that the ending is a little disappointing, but not entirely bad. Smart dialogue and meaningful character relationships are rare now days, so believe me when I say Collateral is a very fresh and well executed movie. It is by no means perfect though. After the hard-hitting first two acts, the ending was disappointing and dare I say over the top. While Collateral is still a quality film, a weak end prevents an all-around instant classic.Cinematography With great camera work and amazing lighting effects, Collateral features some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Mann's beautiful L.A. night really is an incredible treat, with the empty streets and stunning shade of lights, dominated by a blue tint. Collateral just has so much style, due in part to the visual masterpiece we see on screen. Later on is what I consider to be one of the best shots of the film, when Max and Vincent are driving along an empty highway when a few coyotes walk across the street. The way in which the coyotes cross, Vincent's facial expression, the entire scene is skillfully crafted and is one of the main visual highlights. The top-notch style and cinematography sets it apart both from other movies in recent years as well as movies within the genre.Sound The sound and music is another strong point of the film, with nice, loud sound effects and a mood setting soundtrack. The music seems to coordinate perfectly with the action and camera work, and it creates numerous memorable scenes. When Vincent and Max go into the ""jazz club"" at the third stop, it is unforgettable. The ""Fever Nightclub"" scene is edge-of-your-seat action, with the music once working perfectly. The sound compliments the style, and really adds to the film.DVD The quality is first-rate, and there are some interesting special features spanning the two discs. ""City of Night"", a behind the scenes documentary, is intriguing and enjoyable. Also included are features on Cruise and Foxx, a deleted scene with commentary from Mann, ""Shooting on Location: Annie's Office"", and ""Visual FX: MTA Train"". Technical information: English DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound, English and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, English Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround; 2:40:1 Theatrical Aspect Ratio, enhanced for widescreen TV's.Overall Collateral is an excellent, stylized drama, with heavy emphasis on smart dialogue and character development. An all around solid performance, it performs exceptionally well in the sound and cinematography departments. Too bad it could not remain consistent, because the film really had something going. Entertaining, thrilling, witty, and gripping, Collateral is one of the best films of 2004.",Collateral
635,mark-1224,Worth a Watch...or two but don't expect too much.,7,25 March 2006,"So a lot of good was said about this film. I heard many people coming out saying, ""That was a wicked film! Brilliant!"". So was it? Well the answer is no. It's not a wicked film, it's not even a great film but that doesn't mean it isn't good. The cinematography is great with shaky cameras reflecting the ride in the cabs, though this does get a little annoying in 'on-foot' scenes which probably hints that the effect wasn't intentional. Maybe Mann should of simply used a steady-cam for 'out of car' scenes, that would make it a little less nauseating. But colours are dark and mysterious and you do get the sense of the short time phase this film take place in; one night, which a lot of films do not achieve. The one feeling viewers do not get a sense of is hate for Tom Cruise's character, a hit-man who simply ""carries out the garbage"" and kills people in cold blood. In fact we don't really feel very sorry for the main character which I feel could have been pulled off better.The soundtrack for Collateral is staggered but very good. However, with the exception of Audioslave's re-recorded version of 'Shadow on the Sun' which works beautifully, the music wasn't implemented into the film very well . Even the main club sequence with the great remix of the dance track 'Ready Steady Go' by Oakenfold wasn't choreographed and/or synchronised well. The music builds up and you expect someone to really kick arse or maybe something cool to happen but it rarely does and the music simply fades away.Saying that, the plot although quite weak, still keeps you watching. You're not really bored until the very end which comes quite suddenly. All that really happens is they kill four people, but this is still quite entertaining. All the best bits really happen at the start, the film starts to run out of fuel about halfway through.Collateral is a good film to watch, and I would see it again, but don't expect the next Pulp Fiction this is still far off that mark.72%",Collateral
636,Jayfranklin99,Night Of The Wolf...(Spoilers!!!),9,10 October 2004,"Like many other films of great intelligence, this film has suffered less-than-brilliant reviews because people have been viewing it as a straight-forward thriller which, by God, it is not. Just like Signs was not a film about an alien-invasion repulsion (that was Independence Day) but a preacher losing and regaining his faith, Collateral is not a film about a cabbie (goodie) triumphing over an evil hit-man (baddie). No, no, no, no! If anything, I felt more sympathy for Vincent then I did for Max. This is a story about a man, Vincent, who has a had a helluva bad childhood and has tried to come to terms with it by developing extreme Darwinistic theories whereby the whole human race is nothing and singularly even more worthless. He tries to overcome this by revolting against them, by becoming better, by killing them, it makes perfect sense doesn't it? Mann cleverly draws us in and makes us an accomplice, even though we may not know it, in the scene with the two muggers, everybody that I have talked to about this film mentions this scene and it's true, we'd all like to kill people who would do things like that to us, Mann makes his point well, the only difference between us and Vincent is that he does what he wants to. However, at the two key moments during the film, Vincent learns that he is not better than the rest of us, he is, if anything, worse. The wolves that cross in front of the car are him, he is like a wolf, hunting down his prey, pure and simple and we can see it, written across his devastated face, a wonderful, moving moment in film. The other moment being his last line ""A guy dies on the MTA. Think anyone will notice?"". Hauntingly poignant, this is a film about humanity, an honest film, for once. Cruise, of course, is fantastic, I think that it's my favorite of his roles. He is iconic in his grey suit with his prematurely grey square-head hair-cut and achieves a cool during the mugger scene which stands with Eastwood's ""My mule don't like people laughing"" scene toe-to-toe on that scale. Fox is very good as well, but it is with Max that sympathies lie. The direction is superb and the digital camera element only adds to the darkness. The film is fully entertaining on a superficial level throughout, so even the cheap thrill-seekers will enjoy it also. Please get it into the top 250, it is a blue poignant character study which achieves what other mere thrillers don't, it stays with you long after the end credits.",Collateral

Despite a few people finding parts of it unpredictable, I felt the storyline was much more predictable than others seem to lead on, as long as you pay attention. The bottom line was it wasn't a movie you talk about with your friends afterwards, asking about parts of the movie. It's not a movie that gives you something to think about later (other than discourage you from becoming a cab driver, if you ever thought of becoming one). It's about as enjoyable as a rerun of a good TV show; and let's face it, if I wanted that, I wouldn't go out to the movies and pay for it.",Collateral
638,review400,Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx at the top of their game.,10,8 August 2004,"REVIEW400 - Reviews in 400 words or less!Jamie Foxx was always a comedian I could count on to make me laugh. From 'In Living Color' to 'The Jamie Foxx Show', Foxx's knack for humor often left me in tears and with side-splitting stomach pains from uncontrollably laughing so hard. Now it's different: After watching 'Collateral,' Foxx has shed his comedic shell and spawned into a mature and able participant in the drama genre by taking on the role of Max. In short: Jamie Foxx is now a major player in the world of Oscar. This guy is not only funny, but has just proven that he can adapt to any role that's thrown at him (he is also starring as Ray Charles in the upcoming film 'Ray').Max is a reserved Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of becoming a limousine business owner. His life is repetitive and subtle, yet controlled, but all changes when he picks up a fare by the name of Vincent, a character brought to life by Tom Cruise.On their first routine stop, Max accidentally becomes a witness to a murder committed by Vincent, and from that point on becomes his hostage and chauffeur, driving him to his various destinations to rub out the remaining witnesses on Vincent's hit list.Vincent is a straight-talking hit-man hired to take out these principal witnesses that could possibly influence an upcoming trial. Just like Foxx, Cruise sheds his typical persona by playing this silver-haired, aged, and seemingly emotionless assassin. At first, it might appear as though Vincent is nothing more than a hidebound nut job. But as the film progresses, it's evident that Vincent does harbor some sense of emotion and personality made apparent through the jovial interactions with Max, and both characters even go as far as to save each others' life at least once.Thanks to the performances given by Cruise and Foxx (their best ever), Michael Mann's direction of the night city of L.A. (amazing high-definition film work), a stupefying soundtrack of jazz and techno (finally!), and the chemistry between it all, 'Collateral' is more than just another thriller. It's a complex piece of film work with multifaceted characters and a well-written script. It's witty without being dreary and entertaining without being far-fetched. This is one of those films where you're rooting for the bad guy to win. Cruise is just that good.

639,sartoris99,Without a doubt one of the Worst Movies Ever Made,1,28 August 2004,"The film is based on the implausible premise that a contract killer would take a cab for the purpose of completing his assignments.As if wildly contrived and convenient plot details didn't make it bad enough, the movie is poorly conceived and poorly executed. For example, in a large crowd scene set in a crowded trendy club, the blood flows and the bodies fly in a terrifying shoot out. Extras in t he background, however, play it cool as supposedly terrifying patrons who keep a tight hold on their glasses to avoid spilling there martinis. Tom Cruise looks sexy with the slick silver hair, but that's all the movie has to offer.What's more troubling than the implausible premise and absurdly convenient coincidences is the film's less than subtle racism.Whenever the black character played by Jamie Fox points his gun as a white face the victim's fear is played for laughs. You're not supposed to care as the many Asian patrons in a crowded nightclub are caught in the crossfire. It seems calculated to promote laughing at violence as long as the victims are different from you.",Collateral

The plot is well done, you don't know exactly what to expect. There are definitely some scenes that shock. The movie starts off kind of slow with the every day life of a cab driver, but it quickly picks up the pace after Max picks up Vincent, who poses as an insurance agent. Once Max finds out the truth about Vincent then the two become adversarial with Vincent holding almost all of the cards. But later on Max shows that Vincent doesn't hold all of them. We paid matinée price for this movie and thought it was well worth seeing. Will probably watch it again when it comes out on DVD.",Collateral

But there's a big reason for watching this movie since 2005... and that's the exceptional acts. Tom Cruise has his first anti-hero role (as I guess) and he delivers a great acting through movie that won't be forget. JAmie Foxx has a very great changing in his personality and character through the movie (like in the middle of movie you'll surprise how beautifully his watching changes.)

The story is like an episode of Seinfeld, in that several seemingly incongruous events, characters, and plot lines all criss cross, without the people realizing it until the end. Yes, there are some gaping holes, such as Max not doing more to escape or get rescued (there are easily a half dozen situations where he could have gotten away), or why he didn't tell the cop he handcuffed that the US Attorney was in grave danger, but the movie gels so well, you just don't care. I always tell myself that even though he is calm, Max's world has been ripped out from under him, and it is amazing that he can think as well as he is anyways.Mr. Mann, you have created a true masterpiece.

Their response is always something along the lines of 'But... It has Tom Cruise in it.' That fella sure does seem to be picking up momentum on the hate train. After watching this movie, I respect him. Still, he doesn't make this movie. It's the whole package. I liked it more than most, granted. But most people will agree that this movie is at least GOOD. Even today the film has a unique feel. Come to find out, this is because of the early all-digital shoot they did. On a Thomson Viper HD camera, I believe. Why does this matter? Shooting all digital back in 2004 was a feat in itself. But beyond that, they digitally adjusted the shoots to have a really natural field of color. The setting of nighttime LA is captured beautifully. This does have its downsides as sometimes graininess will show up. The DP does some nifty camera work. Its not so much a 'shaky-cam' as it is a 'pannycam(?)'... The camera likes to move itself. Its fun to watch and is really unusual.I've already mentioned Cruise's commendable role, but Jamie Foxx nailed his as well. The BEST thing about this movie is the uneasy relationship of their characters. The cautious interaction between them. How Cruise's killer is always trying to get his looser cabbie to talk and open up. Most of it comes back to the dialog, I suppose. Also worth mentioning is that Javier Bardem has a nice little role in here too. The most noticeable problem, after watching it a few times, lies in the pacing. Every time we get 2/3 through the movie I feel a lull. This was recognized in the editing. And they did the smartest move in the book. They rolled with it, and built up our expectations of the promise of violence set to the soothing, but volatile sound of Audioslave's ""Staring at the Sun"". Its may masterpiece to me, but certainly worth anyone's viewing. Don't let people's overreaction to supposed plot holes keep you from missing out of an excellent ride.",Collateral

Sound effects are solid but the music isn't a great match to the action, resulting in some dialog difficult to understand. The maturing of Jamie Foxx's character (Max) is the goal. He does mature but sometimes it's not smooth enough. Tom Cruise (Vincent) is direct, motivated and convincing. Any Tom Cruise fan will love his look and manner in this movie. I don't know why cell phones don't work in LA except from rooftops but accepting this as a given allows for a suspenseful scene late in the movie.

Jamie Foxx is incredible at his role, as usual, and tom cruise is not much worse. the combination of two totally different people (max stops his taxi to let the fox cross the road while Vincent kills people with no remorse) makes the movie that much more interesting as the two are almost always in conflict. i also liked how the plot developed throughout the movie. in the beginning the audience had no idea why Vincent was killing those people but by the ending it was very clear. because the movie let the audience find out little by little what Vincent was doing it was much easier to not lose interest (i watched at about 1 in the morning so i needed this). Vincent's last hit also helps keep the movie very attention grabbing as he is not killing a ""nobody"". because i did not want this review to have a spoiler in it i will not go into the ending, but i will say this: the ending of this movie is the only reason i did not give it 10 stars.",Collateral

649,ronny-ferrat,Another missed opportunity,5,14 January 2006,"Well, another disappointment by Michael Mann. Just had the flick on a DVD from my library. Well, it is very well filmed, a gift that Mr. Mann has given proof of already back in the early 80ies. However, I am wondering if he does think that people who watch films must be mindless creatures. As a producer and director he should have toppled such an unrealistic and stupid script, and as he was obviously involved in the financing of this film, i am sure he would have had the means to. I have no intention to become a professional murderer, but if i wanted to, i would never accept 5 hits per night (maybe Vincent was offered an extra bonus or whatsoever......(. I can only advise any potential hit-man would be, don't do it! Look into yourself, become a script writer, even if you f*** it up, you will never go to prison, on the contrary, you might get seriously wealthy, legally!!!!!! (This statement does also apply to Directors, Actors,Producers, etc. etc.......)The worst flaw, our dear screenwriter wants us to swallow is that a Professional Criminal on a secret mission, would be stupid enough to clinch to a simple minded cab driver till the bitter end,and threatening him to death all the time, not only with his firearm but, maybe even more, with his rather department-store-like philosophy.I think there is a good film about the same topic, i think it's a Don Siegel film and is called ""The line up"". Virtually the same plot, but definitely better written and with inherent logic which ""Collateral"" is in desperate shortage of.Now, let us stop complaining, as i mentioned at the beginning, it is very well filmed. Mr. Mann really is a visual person, and my biggest surprise was, that the ""intimate"" scenes in the Cab don't make you yawn..........!!!!!! So he must now how to handle Actors, maybe he will take an additional class in Script-plausibility....Nevertheless, a missed opportunity, though i hope that the Producers and Investors were able to get their money back.

I have to say though, that the ending was sort of a letdown. Obviously, Jamie Foxx's character has to prevail in the end, but since the movie is serious about showing how competent Tom Cruise's character is as hit-man, it seems pretty unrealistic that he would get shot by a cabbie in a shoot out. Yes, it's a movie, but it is such a good movie that is serious about it's characters, that the shoot out bugged me. I mean, Tom Cruise is such an ice cold pro who's killed ""I-don't-know-how-many"" and Jamie Foxx is a freaked out cabbie, who is portrayed like he's never held a gun in his hands before. I just think they could have made an ending that made more sense. Never the less - Collateral is so much better than your average action / thriller flick.",Collateral

The movie depicts this picture in a very sensible manner.The movie is backed by two great actors Jammie Fox and the ultimate Tom Cruise. I think the cast was perfect because the slot of taxi driver was perfect for a relatively new actor and that of Vincent needed to be a tough guy who has a lot of experience in acting. This is a perfect blend of characters. The expressions shown by Jammie Fox are exactly of a common person watching a dead body for the first time. Tom Cruise has shown a phenomenal presentation of acting, to act as a professional killer is not a simple job. Some of the best quotes are, ""Get in the car"".

Tom Cruise, on the other hand has an role of a coldblooded assassin, Vincent, who has no feelings, who does not bind with his 'clients', and is certainly not loved by them:) So about the movie: it really expresses emotions of an scared citizen who has found suddenly himself in the hands of an person who doesn't care for human feelings ,compation, and pure love. Max is a person who probably represents every one of us, and what would we do in the given situation. Vincent, on the other hand, he is an assassin, and what can you expect of an assassin? Only one thing is expected from an assassin-cold bloodiness. That is the basic principle of being an assassin, and let me tell you, Tom Cruise has played it flawlessly, really, I can't think of anyone who might play it better, congratulations to Michaell Mann for that excellent, one of a kind movie.",Collateral

The pace could be misinterpreted as sluggish, I however applaud the uncompromisingly 'un-Hollywood' rhythm Collateral has from start to finish. 'Action hungry' punters might feel a little short changed with this offering, because although it does provide beautifully executed battles  chiefly in the nightclub  Collateral is essentially a film that gravitates around the interplay between the two leads, near perfect visual sequences and a soundtrack that at times sounds angelic.My few snipes with this film are minor, yet worth mentioning if only to ask why such things were left in1. Vincent's trousers need lengthening  not a good look wardrobe guys! 2. NONE of the actors can run properly, although watching Foxx try to run offered me a huge slice of amusement and dramatic relief. 3. The only fight scene  fleeting though it was - between Foxx and Cruise looked ridiculousalmost comical. I expected to see an action bubble saying ""POW"" or ""KABAM!"". 4. As the film hurtles towards its culmination in the offices, Cruise suddenly adopts a Jason Vorhees-esquire approach towards his body posture, mannerisms and movementit just seemed a little odd to me. 5. The final scene  as the tube descends into the night - looked like the editor didn't quite know how to end the film smoothly, so didn't bother trying. 6. Plus, I didn't quite know if Cruise died in the end or was simply taking a napI just hope he didn't miss his stop, is anything more annoying?Aside from all these downers, I thoroughly loved so many things about this film, and wish more Hollywood films would adopt a similar laid back approach to future thrillers.Stunning!",Collateral

Collateral is a strong piece of work that came from Mann since Heat, he really brought everything to life in this movie, the way he shows off L.A. can blow your mind away with how well he angled everything to look perfect. Not only are the visuals great, but when you get a killer movie with a strong casting such as Cruise, Foxx, Smith etc. it's no wonder this movie turned out so strong. Most people didn't like how the ending of the movie happened, but if you pay close attention, Max(Jamie Foxx) out smarted Vincent(Tom Cruise) and came out to be the top dog in this chase, he simply tricked Vincent by stepping into the view of one window then quickly changed when the lights went out and had the upper hand when Vincent was blindly shooting, it's little details like that that are in the movie which makes this such a strong movie. I still wont remember the club scene where everything goes to hell basically, it's one of those moments where anyone can get killed and it has you on the edge of your seat.

The plot line of this movie is not one that would entice many, but the way that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise executed their roles is so unprecedented that it was a film that many people saw as ""edge-of-your-seat"" material. The plot line was where a cabbie had to drive a hit-man around so that he could make his raids. I was on the edge of my seat when Max (Jamie Foxx) discovered that Vincent's (Tom Cruise) final stop of the 5 stops that he had to make was to kill Annie, (Jada Pinkett Smith) the woman that Max met when he took her to her office downtown. I won't go into details because I want to keep the movie suspenseful. Also, I was a bit more impressed with Jamie Foxx's role in the movie because he is mainly a comedian, but he did very well in the role of a thriller. Tom Cruise is an actor who performs in a lot of different genres of films. Many people who watch these kinds of movies will not see them as realistic, but there are plenty of cabbies just like Max that could get suckered in as a chauffeur for a hit-man like Vincent. Overall, I thought that Collateral was a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone that liked suspenseful thrillers. This is not the kind of movie that will scare people too much, but it is so chronological and entertaining that it would keep someone in the living room watching it from start to finish.",Collateral

The film ends with Max rescuing the girl he dropped off just before he picked up Vincent. The performances from the lead actors are superb. They get into the role extremely well and pulled off what could have been a major flop. However the actors cannot get all the credit. The film has been made visually beautiful. Although it may not be as visually stunning as a Baz Lurhmann film, Collateral has some of those special moments that can take your breathe away (the wolves scene).

Only a few shots of Tom Cruise are a bit interesting. Otherwise as a whole the movie has nothing to offer. It totally lacks pace except for the last ten minutes. All the murders are very boring. The movie does not look like a motion picture at all. Even the camera work isn't right. Only you should watch it for the performances for Tom Cruise and Foxx.

After some more dialogues it got worse. Yep, another wannabe 'intelligent' action movie, with a few jokes throw in, because we don't want it to be too excited. Really cheesy 'psychological' dialogues, and some really horrible unnatural flow of the story (the taxi driver seeing the same girl he talked to earlier is on the list (chance of that is like 1 out of 867, 545,124. The guy chasing Tom Cruise himself, why inform the police right? etc. etc.)I can really enjoy an action movie, but this one really tries way too hard, but it worked for most people i guess?4 out of 10",Collateral

Excellent screenplay, perfectly directed, with a great cast. Can you get better than that? Michael Mann is the master of LA crime films, and one of the best directors out there. And ""Collateral"" just proves all of this.Containing various elements from noir film's (my favorite genre), this is a powerful dark look at contemporary L.A. at night. Micahel Mann, as always, does an excellent job in analyzing each characters emotional state during the various different moments of the film. With an awesome performance by Cruise, and even better by Foxx, the film really catches you, just can't run away from the story! One of my favorite films! Definitely recommend it!",Collateral
664,gmess38,This is a very good thriller,8,15 August 2004,"The rarity of an unpredictable thriller. This is a very good movie that almost never sells out to the classic action genre where the good guy never gets hit and every one else dies. And they didn't bring someone alive for that last harrowing moment. Cruise is interesting and complex. The initial scenes with the cab ride are well developed. A relationship for which I was actually interested. Very well done overall. The only let down was the club scene where just a few too many bad guys were killed without a scratch to Cruise. The scene where our hero advises the heroine of her eminent demise was a little weak in its cinematic assumptions (""He knows where you are!"" .... How did he know he knew where she was? Could he see that he was looking at the phone?) And why would a guy like Vincent waste his time trying to cut the power. Did the lack of light somehow help him. I think it just made the job harder. He was a psychopathic killer. That part didn't make sense. Otherwise, very well done.",Collateral

666,TSuke23,Best movie of the summer!,10,17 September 2004,"Michael Mann is a master of realism. Movies don't get much better than this. Collateral is a movie that has a little something for everyone. It has extremely entertaining action for the action fan, it has subtle humor for the Jamie Foxx fans, it has hard drama for those fans who like to believe what they are seeing could actually happen, but the best feature of this movie had to be its suspense. Mann had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene of the film to the very end. Tom Cruise of course handed in another impeccable performance. It was actually quite refreshing to see him as the anti-hero. However, being a big TC fan, I continually found myself cheering for him. Tom makes you believe that the character Vincent is real. Mark Ruffalo gave in a star-turning performance as the lead detective hunting down Foxx and Cruise. This is the kind of role that will turn him into a strong supporting star for many years to come. Ruffalo also made you believe that his character Detective Raymond Fanning was a real person and Ruffalo made him very easy to relate to. Michael Mann of course made all of this happen through his masterful camera-work and location filming. Mann is a master of on site filming and makes you feel as though you are in the cab with Cruise and Foxx during a normal LA nite. Mann's past experiences with Manhunter and Heat are relevant in this film and made it more enjoyable to watch. Last but not least is Jamie Foxx. Jamie played the unbelievably real cab driver Max Durocher. 3/4 of the way through, Foxx stole this movie. His character had an epiphany and I soon found myself cheering for his character of Max. This is the kind of role that will put Foxx in the position of starring roles for many years to come. Mann was also able to amp up the feel of this movie with an unbelievable soundtrack, featuring a bone chilling hit from Audioslave, Shadow on the Sun. The audio in this movie is second to none and the soundtrack is a great investment. Mann's signature camera-work was a joy to watch; which is probably why I already went to see it three times. His scene with the coyotes was the best scene in movies all summer. It gave me goosebumps and let me know that something big was about to happen. It's not often that a director can evoke such emotion from such an intelligent viewer. Overall, this was probably the best movie of the summer. Mann did nothing wrong. His mix of characters and actors portraying them perfectly,his haunting soundtrack, stunning visuals, masterful camera-work and real-life dialog make this movie one which will imitated and looked up to for decades to come.",Collateral

668,Mythos_Ruler,Collateral is one of the year's top mainstream films,10,16 November 2004,"Collateral is one of those films that pulls you in through characterization and then blows your mind with events. This was easily Tom Cruise's best performance, as Vincent the cold-hearted killer for hire. Foxx was top notch as well, as the cab driver Max thrust into events and situations out of his control. This Tom Cruise doubter has been thoroughly convinced of his place as one of modern Hollywood's true superstars and Foxx's star will only continue to rise after this performance. The characterizations provided by these two men are first rate and speak loudly to any moviegoer who has contemplated the direction of their life as these two characters do. The lives of both Vincent and Max become so intertwined by the end of the movie the death of one of them is a rebirth of the other.The camera work was the right blend of intensity and subtlety. The city of Los Angeles is on display in this flick like never before as a dark, yet colorful, backdrop for our characters and events. The camera makes love to L.A. with beautiful tracking shots and pans over the Christmas tree lights that are the city. By the end of the movie, one realizes that this film is as much an homage to the city, as a suspenseful character-driven action piece. Also integral to the feel of the film is the original motion picture soundtrack by various artists. Techno and Electronica beats seem to fit nice and snug next to Hispanic flavored rock, alternative, jazz, easy listening, and movie-themed-tracks. Despite the eclectic nature of the music in this film it all feels strangely ""right"" and fits the movie as perfect as any hardcore instrumental soundtrack would fit an historical epic, for example.With all that, and more, this film is one of the best I have seen all year (if not THE best). If you love film, acting, suspense, or the technical aspect of film-MAKING, go see this movie NOW.",Collateral
669,TXgirlCA,Pleasantly surprised and satisfied by this character piece (some spoilers!),10,31 July 2004,"I don't like Tom Cruise, and I don't like Jamie Foxx. I thought the former was empty and pretentious, and I thought the latter was empty and cheap. I went to see this film out of obligation, and I wasn't entertained by the trailer or any of the clips. However after the screening, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and their performances. The whole time LA was described rather negatively, and the events show a grim city, BUT the cinematography was beautiful and showed a glamorous city. Why is this so appealing? I don't know, but these two contrasting portrayals of LA complemented each other. Second, many things were very unrealistic and illogical in this film. There's no way to predict LA traffic, esp around the downtown, west Hollywood, ktown area!!! Who would hire a killer to do this in kind of job without an accomplice? How do BOTH people walk away from that kind of accident? OK minus those annoying details, the jewel of this piece lies in the characters. THey really stayed true to themselves, and their dependence as well as the inevitable riddance of one or the other made this film. The struggle was definitely complex between Vincent & Max. Darwin was used jokingly throughout the film, but it really was central to their decisions, esp. Max at the end. Props to Mark Ruffalo, who's always wonderful and Mr. Cruise, who blew me away and made me fall desperately for his character (except for some cheesy background info). Oh and Mr. Mann, no one could have shot the club scene more eloquently, artistically, yet accurately. The plot had some problems, but the story had great characters, which shows this film deserves more than being referred to as an action genre piece. 8/10",Collateral
670,ksport86,Best in 2004 -- Top 5,10,3 January 2005,"'Collateral' is not your average summer film. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give stellar performances as Vincent the contract killer and as Max the cabbie (respectively). Can't forget Jada Pinkett-Smith as Annie! Michael Mann (one of my favorite directors) is at his top form. The story is original, the characters are very well developed and complex as is the story. The Stuart Beattie screenplay is simply awesome and it never lags at any point in time. The best part of the film is that the dialogue and action is perfectly balanced. This film doesn't have too much action or too much dialogue. Like I said before, the balance is perfect. The characters have real conversations that exposes who they truly are and what their lives really are. Tom Cruise is (again) simply perfect, but Jamie Foxx is a real surprise. He's kind of the 'it' guy of 2004. Mann shot the film in hi-def, which has a huge payoff, making the image crisp and clear (considering the entire film takes place at night). The city of L.A. seems to come alive and looks vibrant as ever (remember 'Heat?'), thanks to the hi-def. Don't miss out on this one, it is truly a masterpiece.***** out of ***** This film is stunning.",Collateral
671,jordanandashley,"Pleasing, yet somehow lacking",8,4 September 2004,"Collateral is not just an action movie. It's not just a suspense movie either. The good thing about Collateral is that it spans genres through its story and does it effectively. Tom Cruise's character is convincing, although Jamie Foxx does a better job at capturing the audience's attention.This movie depends on the interactions between the two, and it's in those moments that it seems to succeed. The twist at the end was good, and definitely surprising, but there still was some (or a lot) left to the imagination. Leaving this movie, it was hard to be completely satisfied because it's hard to be sure if everything was really resolved. This movie was pretty good but with its cast and direction it could have been much better and should have aimed much higher.",Collateral
672,brandon-bailey-326-237450,Cruise and Foxx in top form!,8,27 March 2012,"Collateral is an interesting, exciting and suspenseful movie that is well acted and centered on a story that builds throughout the movie. Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith all do an excellent job of bringing their characters to life. Cruise is first rate as Vincent, the hit man, who is in pursuit of completing his agenda regardless of obstacles or circumstances. In fact, he does such a good job, you tend to forget you are watching Tom Cruise acting out a role. He is more than believable as the bad guy. Jamie Foxx also does a great job as Max the cab driver who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His chemistry with Cruise and Pinkett Smith is excellent. He is a real joy and almost steals the movie from his much more famous co-star. While on screen much less, Jada Pinkett Smith delivers a believable performance as the taxi cab passenger who becomes more involved in the story of this movie than she might have really liked. To say more would give away some of the thunder of the movie. This is one you do not want to know too much about before viewing.Check out the DVD when you get a chance, you won't regret it!",Collateral
673,brianfargher,An exciting film with a ludicrous plot,4,17 December 2005,"First off I have to admit that I find it difficult to take Tom Cruise seriously in any role which requires the distillation of menace. He is too lightweight to give much credibility to the role of a professional hit man. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, is a credible innocent victim caught up in a nightmare taxi ride. The story is exciting enough but the circumstances around the involvement of Foxx in the night's horrors is too ludicrous for words. That a professional hit man would deposit his first victim on the roof of the cab he is using to carry out his contract is so stupid as to completely discredit the remainder of the movie. That such a man would use an innocent dupe to carry him around is feasible but that said dupe would be fully conversant with the man's murderous schedule is not. I really cannot understand the high ratings given to the movie for the script might have done justice to a fifth grade essay competition but little more. Sorry to say it but both Cruise and Foxx have done better things.",Collateral

The first twenty minutes are actually pretty good but from then on it just gets worse and worse until, eventually, it descends into nonsense. Cruise's ruthless and anonymous assassin suddenly becomes sloppy and very public when it fits in with the writer's wayward plot. He even takes time out from his hectic evening schedule to make a caring hospital visit. To say certain bits are unrealistic is an understatement. As a kid I probably would have really enjoyed this film, what with all the action. As an adult I just see the plot holes and unrealistic bits as plain frustrating. And the 15 minute 'wonder who's going to win' climax was always going to be predictable. Waste of time. Although Cruise was still very good.",Collateral
675,FourSpades,Gifted filmmaker strikes gold yet again,9,26 February 2005,"Collateral was one of the big noise blockbusters I missed last year, so I lapped up the opportunity to attend a matinée screening. My comments shall briefly echo the majority of those before me, in singing the praises of this joyously crafted masterclass in post-noir cinema. Michael Mann, he of ""Miami Vice"" origin, has accumulated quite a resume of taut, introspective thrillers in the 90's with ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""The Insider"", and the seminal ""Heat"" as his defining moments. Collateral in many ways bears much resemblance to this latter work, with Mann's sweeping, neon-drenched cinematography again purporting the vibrancy and mythical qualities of Los Angeles whilst surrounding an unconventionally explored tale of good vs evil, and the increasingly blurred line on which they tread. Certain elements of its final confrontation also recall Heat's outstanding Pacino-DeNiro face-off finale, although this time the audience has more idea who they're rooting for.As hit-man Vincent, Tom Cruise shows off a perfectly satisfactory yet previously unexplored flair for villainy - he is ruthless, dangerous, and darkly reflective of the nature of his work. His low-key intensity carries a near-perfect contrast and sizzling chemistry with the psychological frailties of his co-star, a certain Jamie Foxx. Already launched into the critical stratosphere for his performance in Ray - for which he will in all likelihood receive the Oscar tomorrow night - here Foxx is given the opportunity to create his own character, and does he ever. He perfectly conveys the twitchy, downtrodden confusion of a man at breaking point from failure to follow his idle dreams, suddenly thrust into a violent world of seemingly random murders and dubiously moral retribution. Personally, I'd enjoy seeing him receive the supporting actor Oscar for this and allowing Leo DiCaprio best actor for The Aviator (a scenario currently hanging by a mere thread of possibility).By now you most likely know all about the plot of ruthless hit-man commandeering taxi-cab across big city, but it's the sheer intricacies of the screenplay and direction itself which seemed to hit me with shattering impact. The entire opening sequence with Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith, apart from its gentle romantics, was a pitch-perfect beginning to the film in allowing the density and tragedy of Foxx's character to be unearthed to the viewer, before the brutality of Cruise suddenly hurtles into his world. My personal favourite, though, would be towards the middle of the film, immediately following a bickering section between the uneasy acquaintances as they stop at traffic lights, and an Alsatian wanders across the road. It turns to face them briefly, its eyes caught in the cab's headlights, and trots off again. Everything about this brief moment, the camera slowing down, the way Foxx and Cruise both stare at the animal, is perfectly setup, and provides one of the most gently reflective moments in the whole film.Mann, like Tony Scott, is one of a select few distinguished Hollywood directors who can adapt to contemporary settings and styles without making them seem obnoxiously exclusive for the 'short attention span' youth audience. He pulls off an LA nightclub setting with panache and flair, without cynically layering it in multiple split-second camera angles and excessively intrusive music so common in modern action blockbusters. Similarly, he retains his trademark tension throughout, with even his dialogue-focused sections (notably a superlative conversation about Miles Davis) brimming with the anything-could-happen factor that remains prevalent for the full two hours. Occasionally, this factor seems TOO prevalent - when Cruise is shot in the face, and then stands up again almost immediately, I half-expected a glimmer of titanium skeleton to flash from underneath the bloody organic tissue. (Indeed, occasionally Cruise's performance recalls Robert Patrick as the menacing T-1000 cyborg in Terminator 2!) Despite this and the employment of various supposed genre clichés - the ""pairing of white-black"" old chestnut, the ""happy ending"" of sorts - the terse atmosphere leaves you too entranced to really consider such trivialities. People who moan about plot holes and over-suspension of disbelief should be ignored anyway. It's cinema.The film certainly serves what is expected of Mann, but it stands out amongst the increasing crowd of modern genre thrillers, taking pride in being as thoughtful as it is tense, as contemporary as it is classical, as violent as it is human, and as well acted as it is conceived. If its sporadic bleakness makes it occasionally difficult to watch, its tightness of structure as a narrative and the caliber of performance it extracts from its two leads more than compensate for such a discrepancy. Only The Bourne Supremacy has been anywhere near as impressive from last year, and that had its uneven moments. A discerning cinema-goer could do far worse than what is arguably the best of its kind from 2004.",Collateral
676,MisterAlex,"I saw the film, and I'm pretty critical of it. (maybe spoilers)",1,7 August 2004,"I was talking with a friend of mine just now, and we got on the subject of movies. He asked me if I'd seen anything recently, and I responded in the negative... but quickly had to correct myself; I'd nearly forgotten that I went to 'Collateral' last night... yeah, it's that memorable.What I do remember about that movie was that I greatly disliked it. It had its moments... like the bad guy getting shot by the person he totally didn't think had the guts to fire a gun. But that's not cliché at all.I'm still not sure why the whole 'wolves crossing the road' scene was thrown in there. Was it supposed to be a profound, mystical thing? It was lame and not at all clever -- a little like the rest of the film.The ""twists"" are much too predictable. I was able to call more than five lines of dialog before they were spoken, and I don't go to movies to think; that's just poor writing.Foxx's character was WAY too dynamic to make any sense. A polite, considerate, taxi driver who is ready to puke/faint in the presence of death becomes, in the span of a few hours, capable of talking down fully armed mobsters and of shooting a man in the face. Granted, there's a woman involved, so I can certainly see letting that slide a little... but then her involvement brings me to my next point.This movie relies WAY too much on totally absurd coincidences. I kept thinking to myself, ""What in the heck?! What are the chances--!?"" Overall, the actors weren't terrible, though their abilities should have been spent doing something else; the writing was rather lame, and as I said before, it just wasn't clever.If you'd like to watch a movie with a couple of gunfights, a bunch of things breaking, some folks dying, and a hit-man arguing philosophy with his cab driver, this is probably the flick for you.

678,rxgonzalez,"Review, by a self-proclaimed movie snob",10,16 August 2004,"So, as many of you may or may not know, Michael Mann is no stranger to great movie making. Although his resume includes ""Ali"" (a mediocre movie in my opinion), he has created such breathtaking masterpieces as ""Heat,"" ""The Insider,"" and of course my personal favorite among his work prior to ""Collateral,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans."" This last movie was the first Micheal Mann Movie I ever saw. What a masterpiece of visual imagery. Many of you might be tempted to say that ""Last of the Mohicans"" offered nothing new. But watching the movie was like a drug, a feel-good ride that has offered me the same thrill over and over in subsequent viewings. Perhaps it is this effect that attracts me to Mann's work: A consistent promise of great things to come, a dreamlike perfection seldom attained in everyday life.As with any other Movie, I attempted to clear myself of any preconceived dispositions in lieu of a new work. Once in my chair, the first scenes play like a slowly spoon-feed meal laced with that bit of Mann's magic that pervades all of his work. Thirty minutes into the movie, and I have no clue where I am. Just that I am now in Los Angeles (the backdrop of the film). Slowly I am ever more engulfed in the carefully and delicately weaved story taking place before me. Soon, I forget that Jaime Foxx ever appeared on ""In Living Color"" or that Tom Cruise ever appeared in such movies as ""Risky Business,"" ""Top Gun,"" or ""Minority Report."" Instead, I see the characters for what they are: complicated and real.....amazingly real.The stream of little details written into the script plays well to the audience. We learn about more about the two main characters in two hours than many of us learn about our friends or colleagues in many weeks or months. And yet, it all seems plausible, as if somewhere, this all might actually be happening.All this, and one major shock. Jaime Foxx.....when did he become such a great actor. His portrayal of a man cornered, played out so believably and fluidly. I cant think of anyone else for his part. He really was Max! It was a Pacino-esque performance! Amazing! So good, that he severely overshadowed the ever-talented Cruise.My only complaint: near the ending.....the overall steam of the movie falls short temporarily, however it quickly picks up.Overall Rating: Best Movie so far this Year: 10 out of 10Awards and Praise are in Order",Collateral

From the opening scene you now that Mann is going to take you on a memorable ride of the urban L.A. landscape. Cruise displays his best performance ever as far as I'm concerned. I loved the decision to give him the gray hair and the stubble, It really separated him from his previous clean cut characters he has played. Jamie Foxx acts surprisingly well in this movie, I was impressed. Cruise's character is a slick, don't take crap from anyone bad ass in this movie.

680,awpuel,Hit-man score: Mass murderer/Psychopath,5,14 January 2013,"Most of the reviews cover it all.. the movie looked so promising with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. An assassin using a taxi driver to transport him around the city over night whilst he kills his 5 chosen targets. Great potential!HOWEVER if ""Vincent"" was rated based from the rather known Hit-man game his rating would have been mass murderer or psychopath.. the worst rating! 1. Why use a taxi driver to drive you around the city? And if using a taxi driver, why not kill your victims silently and efficiently without the cabbie knowing.. would have made a better story. And WHY not just rent a car with a gps system, kill your victims and fly home safely at 6 AM?2. Oh the mistakes.. having your first victim fall out of his window and on top of the taxi? Really bro.. really? Killing two random guys 50 meters from pedestrians...sending your cabbie into a gangster meeting..not killing your taxi driver who throws away all your essential information.. driving around in the same car all night with a broken frontwindow, a corpse in the trunk and with a police warning already? Not risky? COMMON! And then the super idiotic nightclub scene.. not even gonna comment on that one. Wow, Just cringeworthy...3. Why the freak did he kill the lights before he tried to kill the attorney? Why is there only one guard on watch in a major lawyer HQ? Why did no one see the camera footage of a dead body and call 911? Omg.. 4. Why not just shoot the LAST target before talking to her and Jamie Foxx... the train scene..dreadful.Overall I enjoyed some parts of the movie but it turned out to be just to unrealistic, over the top with a TERRIBLE ending.

681,lilith_dz,a film where everything is real and nothing can be foreseen,9,18 October 2004,"It' a very well made movie, a sort of thriller with psychological implications (but not a psycho-thriller!). Although the principal characters are two, and we all already read or heard they acted both very well, the film seems to be a sort of choral movie, as it gives the right importance to every character. Just think about Javier Bardem acting in the role of the criminal who ordered the homicides, or Mark Ruffalo acting as the witty detective who is the only one to understand the situation. I didn't like very much the use of the steady-cam intermingled with more conventional filming. But it's only a personal point of view. Actually, it is pregnant of meaning. The changes between this kind of ""real-tv"" and conventional filming, as sudden and rapid as the changes between air filming and close shots, represent the intention to depict the characters from many different points of view: as being part of a big city, as little points over the face of the world, as main characters of an action scene, or in a more intimate way, as they talk, for example, into the taxi, or in the two nightclubs. A very good device is the startling homicide of the jazz player, exactly because the scene presents us a Vincent which resembles most the calm Vincent in the Taxi, who is a good listener, aware of the ""facts of life"". That's to say, although seen from different points of view, there is only one Vincent, and the Vincent in the taxi isn't less cruel than the killer. Another very interesting device is the continuous critic to ""common sense"" (in the worst exception). Anytime one of the two risks to sliver into banality (as in action as well as in his talkins), the other character destroys the impression by saying something startling.The result is a very realistic film, where everything is possible and nothing can be really foreseen.",Collateral

Tom Cruise plays a great bad guy in whom is cool, so you tend to like him just as much as you hate him. The quick fight scenes are intense and highly entertaining. Of course ""hit-man"" movies don't have in-depth plots like a Gladiator epic, but one must know that when watching the movie. So you can't compare it to that. The problem with some of the reviews on people who didn't like the movie, usually makes comments on how it was to quick or the storyline wasn't really deep. Hmmm, considering its a hit-man movie, yes it would be rather quick, and considering its not some Lord of the Rings trilogy, I suppose the person is right, it isn't that ""in-depth"". Go into a movie expecting something good ""WITHIN ITS GENRE"". I mean, how can you compare Robin Hood Men in Tights with The Return of the King?

When Max leaves the meeting with Felix, Felix tells his associate that if 'anything goes wrong, kill him.' Well, if Felix thinks that Max is Vincent, and Jada's character lives, then isn't Max doomed to be murdered by Felix? Vincent never got to finish his assignment. Felix thinks that Max is the hit man that's working for him, and Felix makes it very clear that if the job isn't done right, then Vincent will be killed. If Felix thinks that Max is Vincent, he'll go after Max. Therefore, Max now has the life expectancy of a housefly. So, no chance of a Collateral II. Beyond that, I personally thought this was one of the best movies of 2004. Tom Cruise doesn't normally play dark characters, and I thought Jamie Foxx had some really great lines (What?

It is not only this outline that it tries to display, but also it suggests considering nothing as valuable in real life. So all we see are only obsessions that has to be cared for and to be taken into account! In the film, it is inevitable to see how ""Vincent"" was obsessed with his job and being ""successful"" gives him the right to judge the life and underestimate it cruelly. On the other hand, we see ""Max"" as always struggling to keep his dreams as alive as possible not to disconnect with real life before he gets what he wants from it. Thus, for me, ""Max"" and ""Vincent"" are the very same person in the film in terms of understanding the life! They are just living at the different stages of the very same life style. What I criticize is that Hollywood always tries to divide this very same life style into as two different life styles to emphasize on the ""right"" one and to let us catch a glimpse over what the ""wrong"" one might bring in the end! Western social understanding has some contradictions in this sense, and in a way, it is implied between the scenes of such films!",Collateral
686,hernandezf87,This movie is terrible don't believe the morons who say it's good !!!,1,1 April 2016,"This movie is awful. So many gaping plot holes and the ending is so cliché. First why would a lawyer randomly give out her number to a CAB DRIVER ? Why would a LAWYER have feelings towards a cab driver, he's obviously out of her league. And oh yeah what a coincidence that this is one of 5 people on the hit mans list. WHAT ARE THE ODDS!! For a ""6 year assassin"" Vincent is probably one of the worst hit men in any movies I have seen. Instead of killing people in a secret and in a quiet manner, he does it so everyone can hear and see him. For example, when he shoots the two thugs near a busy sidewalk no one apparently hears him but manage to hear the taxi honking ? Then during the club scene he kills so many people in front of a large crowd as if the police won't ask those witnesses what he looks like, Then for some bizarre reason Vincent starts to encourage Jaime Fox to talk to this girl and have moral conversations with him, Lastly, the ending was horrible and cliché. Instead of having a nice twist or different ending, the movie ends with a taxi driver with no gun skills or experience being able to hit a ""highly trained assassin"". Like come on this is so unbelievable. For the morons saying it's the best movie, they obviously don't take moves serious and have an IQ of a monkey. It wasn't even entertaining. Don't watch this movie. I wasted so much time and money on a lousy movie !!!!!!",Collateral
687,bonniemahei,Collateral,10,7 March 2005,I watched this movie and thought it was excellent very well made every bit of the movie was exciting and brilliant. Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor and there is no movie he makes where he will bore you also Jamie Foxx is great . i wish the movie was for abit longer though as it was so interesting to watch and it also has some very good music and songs in this movie which works well for it. The acting of every person in this was done brilliantly these actors really know how to act and it would be great if there was a second part to the film but i doubt it. If you are into thrillers that is done with style then this is the movie for you it is defnetly worth watching and also buying no regrets at all.and is defnetly in my DVD collection. i can watch this over again!,Collateral
688,justabloke616,Character study packaged as a taut thriller,9,30 November 2006,"Collateral is such a great thriller because it makes you care for its characters. You see the shyness and lack of initiative in Max's expressions and you know that these traits have plagued him his entire life. You see the loneliness in Vincent's eyes and you begin to wonder how he became the cold, sophisticated killer that he is.Mann develops his characters in subtle nuances. A brief three minute scene is all it takes to show how lethal Vincent is. An early conversation between Max and a passenger reveals everything about Max's character, while developing the passenger's personality as well.I have watched Collateral many times and while the action remains realistic and exciting, it is the characters and their transformation under the cold neon lights of LA that makes this movie refreshingly satisfying.9/10",Collateral

Such a curious thing that it seems that we all live in a parallel world where you don't know the guy who's sitting next to your seat at the train or the one who is in front of you just across the street. He or she might be a dying wolf in the middle of this jungle we call city.The steady cam makes you feel your rolling alongside Max and Vincent, and shows you the lights and shadows of Los Angeles.Collateral, in my opinion, might be the best Tom Cruise performance.I invite you to take a ride on Jamie's cab across an L.A. night.",Collateral
691,polaramethyst,Good Acting / Troubled Production,6,15 May 2015,"The main story and players are all over the box art and the other reviews, so I'll focus on the essence of what is good and bad about Collateral. Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and to a lesser extent Mark Ruffalo, are the best parts about the film. Jada Pinkett Smith isn't as impressive, but she does an okay job as a sort of love interest for Foxx. What brings the movie down amounts to a slew of embarrassing production defects. During the mid 2000s, digital filmmaking was starting to gain more traction, and Collateral was one of the first big budget films to make use of the new technology. What might have looked groundbreaking at the time looks simultaneously dated and aimless now. There are way too many shots that are unfocused or jittery for seemingly no purpose, effectively taking attention away from the above average narrative. Another issue is the laughable choice in licensed tunes; the songs aren't necessarily bad on their own but don't match up with the tone of what is on screen. There are some character inconsistencies as well but I don't want to include spoilers here.In summary: If you focus solely on the lead actors performance and narrative, then Collateral will be an enjoyable thriller where Tom Cruise plays against type. If you prefer an engaging story that is propped up with cohesive production design, then there are better crime thrillers to see first, including ones from the same director.",Collateral
692,calearm,it greats movie ever seen,8,4 December 2007,If you have a lot of money it is wise to invest it in something secure and dependable. This is why it pays to cast Tom Cruise in any big budget production for despite his rise to stardom in a film called Risky Business Cruise has shown an unwavering consistency in his career that guarantees he is alway a safe bet when it comes to making a film bankable.Cruise you see always plays the same EXACTLY the same character by that dazzling grin and slight shortness of stature Cruise is invariably a brash self-confident charmer with a mere hint of vulnerability think can do salesmanship accompanied by just the tiniest scruple of doubt. Yet if performance never really changes there are occasionally films which exploit this by placing him in unusual positions and bringing out the cracks beneath his cocky all American surface films like Magnolia Eyes Wide Shut and now Michael Mann Collateral,Collateral
693,olyle,"Good direction, performances, and suspense. Weak ending..",6,11 August 2005,"I believe that the scenes in Collateral were very well set up. The lighting, the angles, and the camera movement. I am also glad to see that seemingly raw digital video was used for filming. Although a bit distracting at times(because it's noticeably different than standard film or modified DV), it's something I'd like to see more of because of its' crisper image on screen.The direction and performances were also great. You really got to know the characters, and learn about them throughout the progression of the movie. Initially, I doubted Cruise's ability to portray ""The Bad Guy"", but he did so very well, making his role as 'Vincent' believable. Foxx also did a great job, showing his ability to portray serious roles, in contrast to his usual comedic jobs.The disappointment to me was the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film. As many reviewers have stated... It was cliché'd and almost ridiculous.It was a big let down to see an extremely experienced, sharp, collected, ruthless hit-man instantly turn into an obsessed, rampaging, sloppy madman. While at the same time, a clumsy, frightened daydreamer becomes a cool, collected ace.. all in an 8 hour span. Not to mention that he overcomes by blindly firing a weapon which 'just so happens' to inflict a fatal wound on Vincent, who at the time (although still keeping his shots in form) fails to realize that the steel doors he's aiming for may not allow the bullets to pass into his intended target.I personally would have much preferred for Vincent to have lived, whether or not he accomplished his final hit. (Seeing as the case the hits were intending to jumble, had for the most part, been effective) When they both ran out of shells, it should have stopped there, without further casualty, and ended up with Vincent walking off and disappearing, with Max left dumbfounded, but grateful for his own life (which would have been taken under any other circumstances according to comments earlier in the movie). The reason for this view is that throughout the movie, Vincent shows that he can be empathetic, and tries to understand Max's situation. This shows that Vincent is performing his job, and is probably a nicer guy off the clock. I'm not trying to excuse his status as a murderous hit-man, but show that he's someone who strives to be the best at what he does, just like Max is in regards to his cab driving job.",Collateral
694,isaiahliljequist,Tom Cruise: The Original John Wick,7,4 August 2018,"The movie starts off relatively slow, but the moment Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx's taxi is when the movie kicks off. The interactions between the two are a joy to watch. Even though Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a villain in this movie, He's just so charismatic that some part of me was rooting for him. Vincent is like John Wick before he existed. This movie may not be as fast paced as John Wick, but it's more intense in my opinion. I've never been the biggest fan of Jamie Foxx, but he played his role as Max, the taxi driver pretty well. A part of the movie I found to be unrealistic is that near the end, Max suddenly knows how to use and shoot guns pretty well. Overall though, I enjoyed the movie and would gladly watch it again in the future.",Collateral
695,ogre780,Vincent's Conscience,7,30 December 2005,"There were three separate instances in which I think we were supposed to see the trace of humanity still alive in Vincent's character. Here is where I saw his conscience showing through: 1. He buys flowers for Max's mother reasoning that she carried him for nine months. This was very inconsistent with Vincent's proclaimed nihilism.2. He felt that Max was indebted to him after he saved his life at the club fever. In the cab after the shootout he shows genuine frustration at the lack of thanks that Max gives him. Vincent shows a desire to be commended for doing something good.3. Vincent's death at the end of the movie is portrayed as being tragic instead of justified. His last words ""do you think anyone will notice?"" indicates that he would like his death to be a loss to someone. Despite whatever his reason may tell him, he still at some level wants a certain kind of human contact.I kinda had the feeling that the audience was supposed to pick up on the conscience that Vincent will never be rid of. so wha'd'ya'll think",Collateral
696,ikensey,unremarkable thriller,6,26 March 2006,"Michael Mann's Collateral has a great deal of critical acclaim and hype behind it, so I was looking forward to watching it. But sadly, I was disappointed to find a very unremarkable thriller. The story really is as straightforward as you've heard: taxi driver meets hit-man, hit-man has five stops to make, and needs taxi driver to bring him to all five hit locations. The plot, I think, is the main reason why it was so hard for this film to work- it's just too linear. There are very few or no ways of pulling a plot twist, or changing the course of the plot. It was obvious Vincent would not be arrested with three hits to go etc. Compared to the best thrillers of the last ten years, Collateral appears even more average. It is not as violent as Reservoir Dogs, as complex as The Usual Suspects or as thought provoking as Fight Club. There is still some things to enjoy, however: the brilliant scene where Vincent confronts the muggers, and the nightclub shootout is good too. Foxx is fantastic as the cab driver Max and thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination, while Cruise is also cold-hearted yet charismatic. If you like thrillers, give this a look, but don't expect anything too heavyweight.",Collateral

The entire story is cliché and I liked the hit-man with a heart of gold character a lot better Jean Reno played it in The Professional. I can't take Jamie Foxx seriously as a leading man. I know this is a Hollywood movie and not real life but when is a hot, lawyer ever going to give her phone number to a cab driver?

699,wesjanson-1,Nuanced and Perfect,10,1 March 2006,"Collateral works for several important reasons: the acting, soundtrack, directing, and story are all exceptional, without any major flaws. Reading the comments on this film from other viewers is almost amusing, because the film is almost too subtle for many people to fully appreciate. Here's why: SPOILERSTo fully understand Collateral, it's helpful to watch the film several times, and keep in mind the ""bigger picture"" of the story. If you don't pay close attention, then you're not going to understand why the events in the movie transpire as they do.The biggest complaint about the story is that Max, who has no experience with firearms, is somehow able to gun down a professional killer. But the true beauty of that scene is that not only does it make perfect sense, the outcome is almost inevitable. Not because the story dictates it, but because the mathematics of the people and environment add up to Vincent's death. Here's the breakdown of the scene: Car crashes, Vincent runs off without his pistol (H&K .40 S&W), but with a spare magazine still on his belt. Vincent then kills the guard and steals the guard's Smith & Wesson-which is in a different caliber. He undoubtedly shoots the guard at least three or four times.Max throws down the police officer, and picks up Vincent's gun from the wreckage. He shoots the door twice to get in. Then he shoots Vincent once in the neck. Vincent fires five rounds at the fleeing Max (so he's already used eight or nine rounds).In all likelihood suffering from blood loss, Vincent trades shots in the subway with Max: Vincent fires three shots, Max fires somewhere between 6 and 10. Except that Vincent is a trained marksman, and is aiming directly at Max by instinct. Max, on the other hand, wildly pulls the trigger, throwing his shots all over. Vincent's three shots all impact the metal frame of the door, and stop without going all the way through. One of Max's lucky shots goes through the window and hits Vincent in the side. At that point both run out of ammo: while Vincent has spare magazines, they won't fit in the gun he's holding. Already badly injured, Vincent realizes he's mortally wounded, and sits down to die.That's only one example of how precisely thought-out and planned the film is. The laws of physics are never broken. Nor are the laws of reason: every action has a motive. By the end of the film, both men have intellectually demolished each other. The only thing left for Vincent is to complete the job, it is the very core of his existence. For Max, saving Annie is also saving himself-his morals, and his future. Neither of them desires to kill the other: Vincent warns Max by saying ""I do this for a living"" while Max shows stunned regret by telling the dying Vincent that they're almost to the next station, and medical care. At the heart of the film is the existential question of why we're here on this earth, and what it means for us. Neither Vincent nor Max seem to really have an answer to that question, and in comparison Vincent's nihilism and Max's working values both seem equal failures. It's clear in the jazz club scene that Vincent regrets the necessity of killing the musician. And it's clear after the Fever shootout that Vincent is seriously uncertain of his own reasons for being from his facial expressions and defensive tone. At the same time, Max is undergoing a transformation of his own, beginning with his confrontation with Felix, he begins to finally assert himself. Arguing with Vincent, crashing the cab, assaulting a police officer, and finally shooting at Vincent, he truly lets go and approaches Vincent's state of free-flowing improvisation. Only by letting himself act freely does Max become a whole person. The tragedy is that Vincent couldn't. Since one of the foundations of the film is the influence of chance in everyday life, one must wonder what could have been...END SPOILERS There's much more to be said about this film, multiple perspectives to approach it from, many more subtle hints buried in the material that I'd like to explain. But regardless, Collateral is a masterpiece of recent cinema, and fully deserves to be ranked with other classics of drama.",Collateral

I have seen other work from Michael Mann but these were/are my favorite. I was so pleased to see these actors assembled-- each playing great parts and getting them together so well on screen.Tom Cruise is impressive-- easily filling and succeeding in roles that might have gone to other greats in their time, such as Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Steve McQueen, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, or Gene Hackman. Tom Cruise has definitely got more gift than some may give him credit for, including myself.Jamie Foxx was terrific! I haven't seen him in too many films, but I'll definitely be looking closer now.Jada Pinkett Smith really has something special about her!

702,wagola,Mann's Best,8,10 August 2004,"Collateral is Mann's best work to date in my opinion, even eclipsing Heat. The film has just the right feel to it throughout with fantastic cinematography and use of HD digital. The filming style is so dead on perfect for the deep, somber feel this film has. The images noticeably sharp and crisp, especially in expertly shot club shootout scene, and in the Taxi.Also, excellent work by Jamie Foxx turning in a top shelf performance and displaying phenomenal range.*SPOILERS*The story is gripping and thought provoking. The two main characters have inverse flaws. Vincent has lost all emotional elements a full human being has. He is cold and calculated, never getting anxious or out of place. He is essentially a ""terminator"", which is exactly what he looks like when he comes crawling out of the crashed taxi unphased, and moves on to complete his mission like a machine. Vincent takes the viewpoint of his work is no less inhuman as everyone else. Max has the inverse, he is too soft and timid to take any risks. He might be the best cab driver in LA, but is clearly underachieving. Max lacks the confidence to match his intelligence. He visits his sick mother every night talking about his dreams, and has his days free for 12 years to complete his business plan. Both men touch on the fact that they were raised differently creating their respective flaws. This theme runs throughout the film of environmental factors are the primary contribution to one's persona. Mann also brings many different ethnicities into play illustrating this environmental theme. In the fantastic ending, Max is forced into a position of protecting Annie out of moral obligation, and ends up killing Vincent. Vincent's actions have pressed Max to use confidence, and force him to take action. He never would have called Annie, and never would have changed his life. Vincent in the end chose not to pick up that clip of bullets. He became more than a ""terminator"" because of Max. We actually feel sorry for Vincent as he asks ""Do you think anyone will notice?"" This film combines sociological and philosophical elements with a gripping and interesting action/drama. This kind of film is always hard to pull off, but Collateral clicks on all cylinders. 8/10",Collateral

Just wondering if anybody else noticed? Jamie Foxx was the best I've ever seen him! It was nice to see Cruise make a departure from his normal rolls. Even though this film seemed predictable, I was still really entertained by it. I don't think Michael Mann has ever made a bad film and this is no exception.

707,mgoodman_4,A film I like with Tom Cruise in it!,8,2 January 2007,"I fell in love with Michael Mann's perspective of urban architecture and how it's transferred to film after watching 'Heat'. This film sets you in a great city(L.A.) with great music(Audio Sound plus more)with all the night creatures. Jamie Foxx is amazing and Tom Cruise's Supporting Role is spectacular right to the point. It's as if the role for Tom Cruise was made for him(not at center stage). I have watched this film at least 4 times and sit in awe even though I know the outcome. Mann seems to get the exact angles and creates the urban lighting that puts you right at the scene. I haven't seen 'Miami Vice' yet, but I fully endorse Michael Mann's abilities as a film director and suggest this film as a keeper for any movie collection. It may not be the best Mann film, but surely ranks with 'The Last of the Mohicans' for detail and stylized violence that keeps you in disbelief that these events follow an average guy working a honest living. The only negative point I found was the ending. Foxx's character did more than he was probably capable of, and Cruise's character slipped up when he had did greatness throughout the film. I enjoyed the concept of the storyline that many films lack. Hollywood should try making stories into films rather than finding ways to dazzle us with special effects and amazing computer graphics.

But as strange as it sounds to say, I can find nothing wrong with the masterpiece that is Collateral.This film noir is unbelievably subtle yet completely compelling. It proves to all that a 'good' movie doesn't require a huge budget, because as proved here you can't put a price on talent.Tom Cruise leads this on its otherwise limp feet. Never have I seen such a fascinating character build than Tom's Vincent. I say build because that is quite simply what it is. What Tom shows us is that no human is completely impenetrable, no matter how well trained. We see this in Vincent by the calculated coolness and mathematical killing that he has programmed himself to do which yet falters in a few situations during the film: the killing of the Jazz musician and the occasional fletching look after he has killed him. Vincents love of Jazz makes him realise what he is doing, but only for the fletching moment which is then quickly thrown out in his pursuit for the remainder of his targets. I know see Tom Cruise as one of the most talented actors I have ever seen.Yet Jamie Foxx's role must never be underestimated, as he proves the equal to Cruise, both in character and in acting ability. His step away from comic acting has been a successful one, as he plays the lonely and collective cab driver Max.The relationship between the two characters is the driving force of the entire movie. The wariness of each other which soon grows and develops as these two characters create a bond that the most important one of both of their life.Whilst the ending has been criticised for its predictability, there is no other real conclusion possible as one of these two men must fall. But frankly, I believe that this can be happily over looked, as the rest of the plot and the pairs relationship has enough twists and turns to satisfy.And to be honest, some moments of this movie are grippingly tense, such as the library cat-and-mouse, the dramatic and sudden car crash and the dependency during and after the night club scene.And as much as Max and Vincent are characters in this movie, the third main character in this movie is the city of LA. Never has a place been so unnervingly portrayed through someones eyes, in this case Mann's. The pallet of colours and locations are vital to the greatness of this film, and can not be overlooked. Small touches like the coyotes (can't spell it, sorry!) add a touch to this movie that parallels some of Vincents views of mankind: the selfishness, the insignificance, the loneliness etc.Frankly I could go on about this movie forever, so simply do yourself a favour, whether you are a fan of a brilliantly executed film showing someones view on mankind and life or simply love a great thriller, go and see the masterpiece that is Collateral.",Collateral

He is a great actor, I know that, but he hasn't been as credible to me as who he's playing more than in the role of Vincent. He straddles that line between cold hearted and charismatic villain. Jaime Fox nailed his role so good too. I can see it in his face, Max didn't know whether to admire Vincent or hate him. Just like we, the audience, did not either.

713,randall_kippen,Disappointment from the beginning.,5,14 August 2004,"**Scattered spoilers** for a scattered movie here on out.In the beginning you experience the life of the taxi driver (Foxx), cleaning his car, driving in the city, picking up people, taking a break to eat. All-in-all not too surprising.One of the fairs he picks up just happens to be a pretty woman (lawyer) that will later turn out to be the final victim. We get to see the entire cab ride of the pretty woman and the taxi driver, along with their conversation and his funny remarks which finally lands him her business card. This is important because he needs a number to phone to warn her that Cruise is coming to kill her.Back to the beginning. So after Cruise shoots his first victim (on the 4th floor), he crashes out the window and onto the taxi, oops. Cruise has to hide the body so he gets the help of the taxi driver to put the body in the trunk. The question is, assuming someone wouldn't see a body crashing out a window, assuming the taxi driver would really help, why didn't he take a cheap shot at Cruise?Then we ride to a penthouse. Then we ride to a Jazz bar. And midway through the movie we visit his mom in the hospital, which I guess is supposed to be the collateral. Cruise and Foxx are apparently always side-by-side, which makes one wonder if there was no opportunity for Foxx to sucker punch Cruise. Next we ride to a club called Fever.The ""Fever"" Club scene was probably the worst. From the time the first bullet is fired, 5 minutes later people are still running back-and-forth on the same dance floor, and the guy who is on Cruise's list is still sitting at his table waiting to be shot.Cliché list-getting stopped by cops who get another call to go somewhere else-throwing a garbage can to break a window but it doesn't break-last bullet cliché (where both people run out of bullets and are face-to-face)-invincible attacker (Cruise is shot but gets up and keeps going)-crashing the taxi to escapeIs he a smart guy or a dumb guy? It is really hard to connect with the taxi driver at an emotional level because his character kept switching between being portrayed as stupid (deserving of sympathy) and being portrayed at the over qualified taxi driver who can think his way out of any situation.The problem with this movie is that in each situation there were a million different ways it could've went, but in each situation the director always took the least probably to really occur.

The premise was interesting, but after about 30 minutes, it became the most predictable and ridiculous plot that I have seen in recent memory..... The last 30 minutes of this film had me wondering what the screenwriters were thinking, the director was smoking and what the producer was on.....Simply the worst movie I've seen in quite some time..........Shall I go on?

716,imnotthere-1,Better than ''Heat''?,9,5 April 2008,"Better than Heat?If i say that i'm sure that 90% of the IMDb members will label me as insane or just stupid.But i will say it...In my opinion...''Collateral'' is better than ''Heat''!Here!I said it.Before you go to another comment or movie,let me tell you why I think that way. First,''Collateral'' is not just action-drama-thriller movie.''Collateral'' examines the people in the big city.It is FOR the people of the big city. Vincent says:''17 million people. This is got to be the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other''.And this is not so unusual.I mean,look at the main characters.Max is just ordinary man,not a super cool taxi-driver,not a former CIA special agent,not ANYTHING special.Max is just one man with hopes.He got a island picture,and he just dreams when he wants to relax or just to get out from LA.He want to make a limo-company.He got dreams for the future...We all have!And he is just a man,who is in the wrong time,in the wrong place. Vincent is contract killer.Well,it's not the typical contract killer we've seen in movies like ''Jackal'' or ''Bourne Ultimatum''.He got philosophy.He got life.And he is a professional.Vincent just uses this for living.Like the butcher.The butcher kills animals for money.He take lives.Vincent makes the same.He didn't know the people he got to kill,but he don't want to know them.And he hates LA,he hates the big cities.The example...When Max is tied to the cab and he calls for help,nobody even notice him.Nobody,except the bandits.They use Max's position to rob him.Big City. Second,the actors.Well,i have to say that all the actors(From Mark Rufallo and Jada Pinkett Smith to Jamie Foxx and Tom Crusie) act at least very,very well.I mean,there is no bigger and small roles.That is the idea of the movies.Everybody are small in the big city and not only there.I think Tom Cruise makes his best performance since ''Born on 4th of July''.He is just charming in this so unusual role for him.Jamie Foxx plays excellent,he completely deserves his ''Oscar'' nomination.Smith and Rufallo also play good,not anything special,but good. And final,the directing.Michael Mann has a CLASS.I mean,for me only the scene with the wolf beats everything in ''Heat''.That's not only-the first scene,the last scene(which also is just great),the shootout when Vincent gets killed.And many more... Just watch the movie and try to understand it.",Collateral
717,basa90,Abel Kills Cain?,6,1 February 2005,"Collateral Starring-Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx w/Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg & Bruce Mcgill Directed by Micheal Mann Rated R for Violence & Language As the Film opens we are introduced to the films main character, no it's not the silver haired Cruise as ""Vincent"" or even the Oscar Nominated Foxx as ""Max"". The main character of Micheal Mann's newest picture is Lala land (Los Angeles). So much effort is put into rendering LA's nighttime beauty that it's almost a shame that this movie turns into a glorified chase thriller. The Films pace and mood are excellent until the ""Feds"" get involved. At this point it seems that Hollywood takes over and the underbelly of LA is forgotten. Up until Max walks into a Mexican cowboy bar the film almost seems plausible. From this scene on the movies storytelling and tension give way to corny lines (by the cops and feds alike), a car crash, and a terrible climax on the subway. I enjoyed Collateral's cinematography it echoes Mann's other work such as Heat and the Insider. Dion Beebe (Chicago) and Paul Cameron (Man on Fire) split the Director of photography role. Even though both DOP's did not work on any previous Mann films, they used their combined efforts to turn out a visually stunning piece that kept the same dichotomy of grainy film noir and ultra crisp pop art that is featured in other works of Mann. The almost Cain and Able comparisment between the movies stars works well, especially when both characters visit Max's mother in the hospital. This is further played out in the films climax. We never truly understand why Vincent is how he is, but we do know that he shares an almost brotherly love for Max. One which he has probably never felt before. *** out of *****",Collateral
718,Josh_Hartnetts_Beard,"WOW, this movie should be a lot bigger then it is.",10,17 December 2008,"I don't care what u think about Tom Cruise, love him, or hate him personally, he was just FANTASTIC in this film, as well as Jamie Foxx. I watched this movie when it first came out and thought, this was gonna win a LOT of awards, I can not fathom why that never happened.I ended up buying the movie within a week of first watching it, and im not the type that buys a lot of movies, only the movies that I consider classics, I don't have a very big collection, but I consider it a strong one, and this one is one of my favorites, if not the favorite of all time. The acting was perfect, the writing, the dialogue was perfect, and the action was perfect. The shootout in the club, was just so EPIC, I GOTS TO SAY it was the best shootout in any movie ever, TOMMY was so cool, calm and collected, and so slick, quick, and ruthless, in this scene, he was an unstoppable force, that pistol action was, so SICK!! When I watch this movie, I find myself rewinding that scene over and over and over again, and every single time, im in aww! It was GODLIKE!! Makes me wish I was that good, cuz then id be a hit-man. :D I only have a slight complaint about this movie, cuz the end, *spoiler* the whole movie Vincent is setup as this just absolute BEAST of a hit-man, that never misses a shot, or makes a mistake, and then him and max unload there guns on each other, Max with his eyes closed hits Vincent, but Vincent somehow doesn't hit Max a single time, granted Vincent had bullet shot in the face from earlier, and easily could have been disorientated, I still didn't think Max coulda pulled one on Vincent like that. I try to pretend that maybe it was because Vincent was on battle stimulants the whole movie or something, and he was starting to come down of them at that point, you know like the Air Force pilots ""GO GO"" pills, that HAS to be the only reason Vincent messed up, lol.GREAT MOVIE!!!",Collateral

If you watch carefully at the beginning of the film When Max left his first customer at her place he was bothered with some bullshit. Then Vincent appeared, he was looking for his duty friend that is to say a cab driver. Firstly He saw the cab of Max. He wanted to get inside of cab but Max didn't saw him. He changed his mind and when he just about to looking for another cab Max realised him and said "" Sorry man I didn't realize please get in I can get you "". What if he don't realize him ? He would never get involved that mess. But The Lawyer girl that he meet in cab would killed by Vincent as you know. Thats the point. We have lots of breaking points of parts of our lives.

Tough to believe that Ebert or any other critics liked this flick, it's one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The plot is terribly flawed and unbelievable, it's impossible to get into, forced and predictable. Foxx won an academy award for his performance in this? Must have been a bad movie year...Or was this a case of the Hollywood inner circle being overly gracious with it's 'elite'? It doesn't make any sense to me. Also interestingly, most of the discussion on IMDb is about what a good movie Collateral is. I use ratings on here to decide if I want to spend time on a film because most are usually fairly accurate. This was not the case with Collateral.

Nothing more stupid and complicated for a hit-man to have a taxi driver as a driver in a tour of murder. A taxi driver who is also a hostage. A taxi driver who can at any time shake the whole operation. Why going through all this????? The police on the street. The hospital! Nonsense!! Any other argument falls under its own weight. If we add to this a poor taxi driver beating a professional murder, a human deadly weapon, a man who spit bullets with precision, brakes legs and kills at least ten bodyguards, is too much",Collateral
722,roddsullivan,My review of Collateral,8,1 August 2010,"In the movie Collateral there are many twists and turns like you would see in your typical thriller. Collateral however combines 2 types of movies in one. It is an action packed thriller. It stars Tom Cruise as the hit man Vincent, Jaime Fox as Max the taxi driver, and Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie the district attorney. This film is about a taxi driver Max who drives Annie to her office and during the trip she tells Max about a case she is working on. After dropping her off he picks up another fare, Vincent. Vincent is a hit man using Max to transport him around Los Angeles to do his contract hits in one night. When Vincent first approached Max's cab they almost didn't even hook up. Everyone in the audience knew something wasn't right with Vincent but they didn't know what. Unfortunately for Max he didn't see it coming in the beginning, however he should have suspected something when Vincent wanted him to drive him to his various business appointments and wait for him. After Max told Vincent he wasn't allowed to wait for fares Vincent pulled out a stack of $100 dollar bills and enticed him to drive him around for $600. This is when Max should have known something wasn't right but money can make people do what they ordinarily wouldn't do. Everything went downhill from here for Max. That first stop changed the rest of his night. As you watch the film Max's night will come full circle.The director (Michael Mann) did a great job in the beginning of the film to demonstrate the upcoming suspense but you weren't sure what was coming. He showed Vincent and another man walking through different parts of an airport. In these scenes all the people around them were blurred and the voices were muffled as to show that they 2 were destined to cross paths. They bumped into each other and one dropped his brief case while the other set his down to apologize then they each picked up the others case. This scene was very well done. It is much better than one sitting on a bench reading a magazine or something and then the other sitting down next to him and then one leaving and picking up the others case. Basically I'm saying it wasn't predictable. Looking at the film as a whole this was a great way to start the film. This film was a very entertaining action packed suspense thriller and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The editing for the most part was superb, however I did find a couple of areas that either could have been done differently or better. First some (not all) of the taxi scenes were unrealistic. The viewer knew which taxi window scenes were real and which ones were movies playing in the window. There weren't many but in my opinion with today's technology there should not be any scenes that look like a movie in the background window. Next in the end of the movie when Max and Annie are fleeing Vincent in the subway they go to the lower level platform and hide out of the sight of Vincent. As Vincent comes down the escalators he stops at the platform above the lower platform as 2 trains come into the station, one on the lower platform and one on the level he is on. He is trying to determine which train he thinks they're on. The director or editor didn't show Vincent going down or even attempting to go down to the lower platform they just showed him getting on the same train as Max and Anne. Like I said earlier, this is a great entertaining thriller with just a couple mistakes on the editing side of things. Maybe I am a bit too anal.",Collateral
723,nnw,"Great writing, great acting, great directing...",8,4 August 2004,"I saw an early screening of COLLATERAL and was very impressed. I really liked Michael Mann's choice of using hi-def digital film and loved his use of many parts of LA to convey how gritty this character-driven thriller/action movie is. Jamie Foxx has definitely proven that he has a lot of range and I cannot wait to see him in the movie RAY (where he plays Ray Charles). Tom Cruise did an excellent job as the villain (I enjoyed this villain much more than his portrayal of Lestat in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE). There is a ton of witty dialogue (thanks to Stuart Beattie's great script) with all characters, but especially between Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. For those looking for action, there are some great ""shoot 'em up"" scenes, but what really stood out was how strong each character is written. SPIDERMAN 2 proved to be a success because it wasn't so much genre-driven as it was character-driven, and I think the same applies to COLLATERAL.",Collateral
724,zimm1349,Walk a Mile...,9,8 December 2010,"How would it feel to have to drive a mile in Max's shoes? As I watched this movie I kept asking myself what I would have done if I was in Max's (Jamie Foxx) position. Vincent (Tom Cruise), a contract killer, forced Max to drive him around Los Angeles while he murdered people. Ultimately Max had two choices, to either drive the cab for Vincent and be a part of his murders or refuse to drive which would most likely result in his own death. If Max refused, wouldn't Vincent have just gotten another cab? Why didn't Vincent just get another cab driver? These questions filled my mind as the movie progressed. At the climax of the story, Max got away from Vincent but then found out that Vincent's next victim was his earlier passenger, Annie (Jada Smith). Max gave up his freedom and safety and decided to try and rescue her. Through pure selfless ambition, Max made every attempt to save Annie's life. What causes somebody to give up their luxuries or freedoms to help someone in need? Eventually Max saves Annie's life and rids the world of another killer. Max killed a person in order to save a life. Is Max's decision to kill Vincent justified? It is easy to say that he made the right decision because he saved the innocent person, Annie and took away an evil, Vincent. But doesn't this make Max ultimately wrong by taking somebody else's life? I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a thriller and a chance to focus on human responsibility and morality.

I had eagerly anticipated this movie for months.My only regret was that I knew too much about it before I saw it. It would have been soooooo delicious to have experienced it without thinking ""oh this is where such and such from the previews is about to happen.""One other aspect that Mann brings to his filmography of action sequences is the sense of 'witnessing' the event. His camera angles, timing, and audio effects combine to provide the ideal experience of an eyewitness.If you have not done so, go back and watch his movies with a particular eye towards the realism he brings to 'your experience'.

Imagine this film without the accompany of music.

727,rocket69,One of the best motion pictures in 2004,9,24 November 2004,"Collateral [2004] ; Might contain a few slight /SPOILERS/.In the beginning of this movie, we can perfectly see how Max the taxi driver (Foxx) lives in a total routine and we are shown which dedication he puts into his job despite the routine. Soon, we meet a man called Vincent (Cruise) who is clearly referred to as a delicate but not an ordinary man, who has just arrived in the town and hires Max's taxi for the night.Foxx perfectly acts out the role of a casual man, who is frightened after finding out what Cruise's character really is up to. His character also ""develops"" into a more confident and braver man . Cruise also does a wonderful job as Vincent, showing us how cold-blooded and yet, so discrete a ""hitman"" can be. What I also liked about the acting is the way how Cruise's character is somewhat lesser than Foxx's, which is quite exceptional as Cruise is a tremendously more distinguished and popular actor.The movie doesn't get boring even for a single minute, because no scene is left without action or interesting dialog for too long - Michael Mann is the man when it comes to not letting the audience get bored.To my mind, this motion picture is the best of 2004 so far. 10/10 .",Collateral
728,amaranth_sola,Through a Glass Darkly,10,13 August 2004,"Take the simplest of stories, say, two guys meeting, at night, in a taxicab, in Los Angeles, and turn this into, not just a mesmerizing visual experience but a poignant unselfpitying portrayal of the metaphysics of alienation in the 21st century, and you have crafted the rarest of the rare, namely a cinematic masterpiece.Shot entirely at night (mostly with a Thomson Grass Valley's Viper FilmStation digital camera), _Collateral_ pulls the viewer into a dark world, lit as if from inside a black hole of lost dreams, murdered futures and raw fear without losing sight of the possibility for physics-defying change within the main characters of the story, the hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) and his accidental chauffeur for the night Max (Jamie Foxx). Each actor underplays his role, and it is via this quiet intensity that the film's director (Michael Mann) moves these two men out of themselves and, however unwittingly, into each other's lives, not unlike the way Al Pacino and Russell Crowe had done in Mr. Mann's equally disquieting previous film, _The Insider_.Like its predecessor, _Collateral_, too, makes trust and betrayal as palpable (and as explosive) as guns and bullets, and also (again like its predecessor), this film makes you (the viewer) actual care about individuals whom you would most likely in your real life choose to avoid at all costs. In so doing, this film makes the mere act of living nay, of MAKING a living, an exercise of deepest courage and direst necessity. And it makes us see, through a glass darkly, that every word is a confession, every act a benediction, and every encounter a transfiguration of good and evil, right and wrong, life and death.",Collateral

Getting tired of car crashes where people just walk away (Bourne Supremacy as another example). Cruise did an adequate job of relaying emotions and shift in character through his eyes.

For me the bar scene is at least a match for the heist scene in Heat.If there was a criticism it would be that the film changes tone in the second half by giving way to more traditional Hollywood needs and therefore loses some of the edginess that is created in the first half.But don't let that put you off, this is a film that has something different and will appeal to a number of age groups on different levels.",Collateral

Like when he magically decided to go down the escalator instead of outside, and picking the right train to jump on to. It's also always a good idea to cut the power so you can't see anything, when you're trying to find the person you want to kill, yeah... The movie had some decent action scenes, the one in the club was probably the best scene in the whole movie. If not for anything but the old, played out track Paul Oakenfold - Ready, Steady, Go.

Collateral, though running just below 2 hours, is as Michael Mannish as it could be and more. Tom Cruise, playing a role that must've not been written for him, was really awesome. Jamie Foxx, unintentionally providing a touch of humor to Max's character, too, was awesome.yes, the story did not offer anything new, BUT the character development was just great - done in real Michael Mann fashion - that it made you think of other people and wonder how they, too, think and ultimately live their ""regular"" lives. just like how Mann pried into Crowe and Pacino to pour out Jeff Wygand's and Lowell Bergman's minds and souls in The Insider, he had Cruise and Foxx act out their characters to perfection. i've never seen Foxx deliver this kind of performance - far better than his stint as Willie Beamen in Any Given Sunday. could anyone have done any better as Max? probably not. could anyone have done any better as Vincent? probably. deniro + pacino, come to mind BUT we'd be missing Cruise's debut as a villain, which he did so in convincing fashion. in fact, it is just not convincing, it leaves you wanting Cruise to get even or, at least, go on two or more killing sprees just to show off his coldbloodedness!the cinematography was great; night-time LA, as well, was given character. Michael Mann was even able to squeeze in some of his signature nauseous arias as integral part of the drama [see The Insider, Heat + Ali].so, did anything go wrong?

I sat there waiting for a clever plot twist, something to keep me awake, but to no avail. Everything happened in typical crime drama/action film fashion. I wanted to see the end not because I was eager to see how it panned out, I wanted to see the end because I was tired of sitting through uninteresting dialog and shaky shots of the L.A. skyline.The slow burning hour or so eventually leads to something that you will want to sit up for, but if you've seen enough movies, you'll have this figured out and like most people who walked out of the theater with me, will leave, disappointed and expecting more.The action is played pretty well here. Standard fare, but well done. I enjoyed it for the most part.Overall, this isn't the breath of fresh air everyone is raving about.

Certainly the DV Cam (digital) night shots can get a little distracting at times, but a compact script of a well-written closely knit story that is worth watching for its often clever quips and good performances by its two leads. Surprisingly, Tom Cruise plays both a sardonic and charming, sometimes philosophical, sociopath menacing Jamie Foxx's perpetual dreamer (a cab driver stuck in a temporary job, as he puts it, for the past 12 years). In addition, Mark Ruffalo, playing the ""no one believes me when I tell them there is something strange going on here"" detective showcases the calm demeanor you seem to find in all his roles. He does this expertly. About the only knock I have on this story is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith. I think the role is so minor that it would be better to cast down, so as not to give anything away.Still she does an admirable job in yet another role for her where she is primarily furniture in scenes, as her character only serves to trump up the action. Then again there is just not enough room in the story to accommodate this.In a year fraught with box office titans simply trading on controversy, it is a pleasure to see a movie of modest scale that is poignant, real, and witty. Unfortunately, Mr. Mann's biggest gamble may prove to lose him recognition for his fine efforts. I applaud his desire to try and integrate digital and celluloid film, but like all pioneers he may be a little ahead of his time. Still, thank you, Mr. Mann. I enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next one.I certainly hope this movie has legs. If you ask me you should go see it.",Collateral
742,Laurie-76,What happened to plausibility?,6,7 August 2004,"Having read a great review in the LA Times about Collateral, I was excited to see this film. Stylistically it is well done and captures the dark ""aloneness"" of LA. The acting for the most part was also good and very convincing. Where the movie falls apart is in credibility and plausibility. There is nothing more aggravating than watching what would appear to be the makings of a great action/thriller fall apart because of ridiculous ""Hollywood"" plot conventions. The viewer is able to write off a few implausible quirks in the beginning of this film but by the end, it is just way over the top, especially with Tom Cruise's character jumping on the train at the end. Can't imagine what the director had in mind when he shot this particular scene. While this movie has some great ""film noir"" moments, in the end it is just another Hollywood ""cheesefest"".",Collateral
743,JABWLRSB,"Tom makes a better villain than romantic lead, but who was scared?",3,8 August 2004,"Tom Cruise makes a better bad guy than a good guy. But Jamie Foxx's character didn't seem scared of Tom Cruise's character - so why should we be scared of the character either? Jada Pinkett Smith had a great role for any actress. Good scripted part, she gave a very strong performance, and there was no nudity or exploitive stuff! What a terrific role to play, what a great job she did. I felt the most 'transported' by the club scene - it just sucked me right into it. I felt it - the crowd's panic, the confusion, the randomness. The balance of the movie was far less effective in my opinion. Too bad, because I expected top drawer due to the buzz.",Collateral
744,cordelldavidson,Strange...developing friendship......,10,14 August 2004,Very well written and suspenseful. The director out did himself this time I am sure. This is the first movie of his that I have watched. I will be checking to see what else is out that he has directed. The way he correlated the two people (Max and Vincent) to the point that Vincent seemingly liked Max...enough to take care of him in the strange situations that developed. Vincent even liked Max enough to the point that he felt lead to give him a few suggestions/resolutions to Max's life. I had to close my eyes numerous times on some of the scenes. They seemed so real. In the end though this was a strange way to begin and abruptly end what seemed to be a developing beautiful friendship between Max and Vincent (despite the fact they were forced into it). This is a must see movie.,Collateral

However, he does it with style and pizzaz. This dude is sent to LA for an evening of take out - to take out five witnesses who are scheduled to testify in Federal court against a big time thug. Cruise ends up getting Jamie Foxx as his cabbie to chauffeur him to each whack job and soon ends up as a hostage driver. Jada Pinkett plays the assistant US attorney. The movie really starts rolling with the last hit. The action is fast and furious with hardly any down time. It's the best directed (Michael Mann of Miami Vice and Manhunter fame) movie I've seen this year.",Collateral

A film to remember,10,11 December 2004,"First, let me start with director Michael Mann, which has made an excellent film, very well crafted story, shot beautifully, LA was the perfect set, those views over the city are just amazing! The story is very well told, soft ambiance, it takes you through a journey full of unexpected situations. The idea of being shot with digital camera fits perfectly, and gives it a kind of cool, soft and fierce ambiance. Tom Cruise is the king, along with Jamie Foxx, performed superbly! Tom Cruise, is cold, calm, and a unique sense of humour. Foxx has proved that he's not just comedy! It looks a real cab driver, funny, yet serious and pretty normal. Overall, one of the finest movies I've ever watched. Brilliant!! 10/10",Collateral
747,adam-491,"Disappointing, Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise",6,5 September 2004,"Collateral has none of the suspense or thrills of 'The Insider' or 'Heat'. Mark Ruffallo is wasted, Tom Cruise looks like George Michael circa Faith. The taxi driver, Max, appears to have had Danny Glover (in Lethal Weapon) providing 'how to be cool around psycopaths' acting lessons. The love story is token, bowing to commercial pressures which youwould expect from Collateral Damage, but not from Mann. Moreover, Bacardi, purveyors of the funky fresh rum, appear to have sponsored the film outright, and their logo is in the second shot (and subsequent). Tom Cruise is not capable of carrying this off. He managed to play serious in Magnolia because (a) he was parodying himself, so excelled through irony, and (b) he wasn't the lead. Here he is still looking like he did in Top Gun, but with snow spray on his hair, and a Wham 4'oclock shadow. He is not helped by the dialogue either. Mann, like Tarentino, seems to have lost the knack for convincing small-talk among villains. In 'Heat' he humanises unusually brutal characters. In Collatoral, as critics have pointed out, there is an unusual amount of talk between the two leads. I'll steal from Pulp Fiction here; Just because Vincent is a character, doesn't mean he has character.Cruise is still wanting to be the charmer. So unlike Brad Pitt, who knowshow to unsettle us enough to ignore his beauty for a moment, Tom hangs onto his likability like a dog to a slab of meat. The 'sieze the day' and 'look at yourself man etc etc.' would be excusable if Vincent (Cruise) was exposed for the psychopath he is, a la Patrick Swayze in Donnie Darko, but instead Max the Tax sucks it all in and accepts his life is a failure. Odd, given he is the honest, hard- working stooge and Vincent is the ruthless psychopath. There is too much macho posturing, from the muscled cops and from Vincent's various penile extensions (PC tablets, cool Nokia phones and of course huge, huge guns), for his character to be truthfully presented. Instead we get an undercurrent of respect and sympathy for Vincent's effortless machismo and nihilism. This is dishonest, as Vincent's character is never developed enough to provide genuine reasons for our sympathy. So we are left with fetishistic appreciation of Cruise's martial arts skills, which he has picked up over the years in a series of awful action bonanzas, which I hope he returns to after this.",Collateral

The soundtrack in this movie really sets a certain mood that i haven't seen in any other movie. the movie can be really calm at moments and in some other moments it bursts into action. the characters are very well thought through.

It might not be quite that bad, but there are holes in it that you could step through sideways. The Premise of a trained killer using one Taxi driver to run around L.A. for 5 hits in one night is the benchmark. If you can swallow that you needn't read further.Call me demanding, but what's the point in watching a mean -mutha-movie if the mean mutha is really a bad ass amateur who has a soft spot for congenial cab drivers. From the inconceivable rebellion by Maxx to the achingly dull mobile battery going flat, this film manages to do the opposite of it's intent and suspend belief.For a real slice of Tom Cruise as a bad ass (with the added bonus of depth) look no further than Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolias'.",Collateral

The helicopter shots, coupled with the in-car close ups make for a visually stunning picture. My favourite shot is when Cruise takes down two men with his gun, the camera stays on one shot and captures the action instead of cutting in with several fast shots. the effect is as if you were a first hand witness to the event. The music, specifically a song by audioslave, surprise you at first, but soon after become soothing and suit the mood very well. Jamie Foxx pulls a ""Jim Carrey"" and proves that he can be a serious dramatic actor. His performance is a memorable one. Cruise is his regular incredible self, playing a tremendously hateable villain. The story itself is very engaging and takes some very unexpected turns. I highly recommend this Film.",Collateral

Now, after watching it, i have calmed down. It wasn't any kind of historical masterpiece. Yes, Tom had some style as a bad guy indeed and there was some nice camera-work. But the script - it was boring and so predictable. Already after first killing, it was quite obvious, that Annie will be one of the targets. And in the end, Max will somehow kill Vincent. So i had to wait one hour, just to see, exactly how those things will happen. Such waiting, it is a sign of a bad thriller, isn't it?If this movie will get Oscar(s), i will be quite disappointed.

Collateral is very mindful action movie easy to miss in the sea of Bourne-alikes that quickly followed during this era.The format itself, set throughout the night time of LA gives the movie a sense of urgency as we follow Jamie Foxx's everyman cab driver through the streets and alleys.How good it is to see two actors here exploring a different side to their range; there's an ever present quiet menace in Cruise's depiction of Vincent that at times we are caught between rooting for him and recoiling from him; balanced by Foxx's hapless and helpless everyman cab driver, a far cry from the charismatic persona we are used to.Mann has wonderfully captured the LA night to give a sense of dread and danger throughout, down to the sound in the shout out scenes to give that flavour of realism.In some ways i feel this film has precursory elements to John Wick despite them being two different kinds of movies.Great movie making, rewatchable for the scenes, the backdrops, the acting, and Cruise's assassin.",Collateral

I think this really proves Jamie Foxx should be looked at as a legit actor and was a great lead-in to his performance in ""Ray."" As for Tom Cruise, he shows a good dark side. Most of his roles can be a bit goody goody, but I think he convincingly pulls off a hit-man. It sucks Mark Rufallo is shot, but I think it adds to the drama of the movie.

Reading the board comments causes me to ask: ""Am I the only one, besides the other people in that theater on that day at that time, who saw that version of the movie?""The Review(s?): I thought both versions were really good, the DVD version seemed a little more tame but the acting and final message of both films were excellent. The characters, combat sequences, car wreck, emotional trauma, physical trauma, and cinematography all seemed very real (A Mann trademark). The more common of the Collateral movies that I just saw had a Hollywood feel to it, the music might have been something to improve on but it fit the story (The music from Bourne Identity was a plus). The nonDVD Collateral: had no soundtrack other than Max's cab radio, nothing to suggest what you should be feeling as you watched (although that was back on Aug 6th, my memory could be failing...); The fight sequences, actors (other than leading roles), were all different. Vincent was more of a casual killer and Max was less of a hero. The comparison between the two, nonDVD Collateral wins the high impact award while DVD Collateral wins the drama award. Each film seemed to have something useful to say. To compare it to Bourne Identity (have not seen Bourne Supremacy), sort of like the beginning where the girl feels she might have picked up a psycho in her car, multiply the effect by 10 or 20, throughout Collateral, and you have an idea of what the film feels like.As I watched, I attempted to fit what I saw in the theater to the DVD and could not do it, sort of a Twilight Zone effect...",Collateral

From the first hit to the last minute i was hooked with each of Cruises assignments getting harder and harder (expecially club fever) i was on the edge of my seat. A very moody but witty Tom Cruise as the bad guy was impressive none the less but i thought Jamie Foxx as the everyday cab driver stole the show as i was not expecting much from him but he delivered a hell of a performance.

At points you think he'll say what you expect him to say, but his character has some tweaks that make him all the much better. Jamie Foxx put in some hard work as well, and showed that he is legit in all kinds of acting. Jada Pinkett Smith fit in nicely, and Michael Mann worked his cinematic magic. The soundtrack was well put together, and the use of bright lights and different colors is really appealing and desirable. It is a movie's movie. It's enjoyable, slow- moving but for the right reasons. The pace is perfect, and the story has some holes but that should not be misleading because the movie is all- around solid.

I'm not a big Cruise fan, but was very impressed with his acting in this movie. Generally I've found his work to be shallow, or maybe it's the parts he is given to play. This was a fascinating character, and he did a fabulous job. I admit I kept hoping for some kind of change, some evolution of the character, but honestly it couldn't have happened as the story was unfolded. It had to end the way it did.Foxx was excellent.

Such a professional piece of work; no bells and/or whistles, just super solid crafting. The acting performances from Cruise, Foxx, and Smith are pitch-perfect, with Cruise grabbing the title of 'biggest surprise' as he more than pulls off the bad guy act while shading the character of 'Vincent' with some humanity.Mann's direction embodies the idea of camera as innocent documenter and not the camera as fully involved character. We are shown what happens, the scenes are framed well to properly convey the evolving story, but Mann does not dress things up with unnecessary trickery.

Jamie Fox was very good in it and i think that it would be a type of movie for 15+ overs but kids still may enjoy it. It is a interesting movie but a little violent. I as myself thought it was a interesting violent but very good. It was basically about a cab driver & and a contract killer and the contract killer has to kill 5 people.

My favorite thing about the movie was the sudden plot twist during the end, that had me on edge and not blinking until the climax had ended. Formula wise, i'd say the movie is about 40% action and 60% thriller, their is quite a few action scenes although most of them are fairly brief.

766,tpicamoles85,"Great performance in acting, but a feeling of déjà vu.",6,28 January 2006,"Collateral was and remains the first thriller directed by Michael Mann after his masterpiece : Heat. In this regard, Collateral appeared to me as the revealing of a temporary lack of inspiration. I have been disappointed since Collateral seems to be in many ways a pale carbon copy of Heat. I don't say that the similarities between the two movies were not intentional : for instance Heat starts in a station and ends along the lanes of LAX whereas Collateral starts in LAX and ends in a station that could even be the one used for the running of Heat. That obvious symmetry was an implied reference, whether to satisfy the fans or to highlight the tragic side of the short-lived characters ? I don't know. An other similarity : two men, who don't know each other, who are apparently opposed in everything, find out what they have in common before ending up killing each other. In Heat the communion between the predator an the prey was credible and genuine. But in Colateral, the characters just do not match. By trying to bring Heat's emotions back to life, Michael Mann has reused the same dramatic features exaggerating them. A cop and a robber can grow aware that they are leading the same kind of life on ""opposite sides of the law"". In Collateral the scriptwriter chose a cab driver and a hit-man! If only Jamie Foxx' character suffered from the Stockholm syndrome! But it is not even the case.Last but not least there is a main difference to point out : the rewarding role of women. In Heat the parts of Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd helped us to picture the situation of family breakdown and personal failures the leading characters experienced. In Collateral the character played by beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith is only designed to lead the story to an end that you can see coming a mile off.5/10 because Michael Mann is better than that.",Collateral

I was astounded, but really happy that it is in my mind, as good as Heat - a great couple of stories, with great actors holding their own in both.It's a story that begins with a man on a mission to assassinate set against a man whose life is passing him by, because he never really stood up for himself.A story that ends with a man who dies just as he's realising where his mission has led him, but who doesn't know how to stand down, killed by the hand of the man who showed him where that mission destroyed his personal choice. But the assassin who dies only died at the hand of that man, because he taught him how the assassin's mind works.And it made me cry... tears at the scene when he dies. And it's made me cry before again, tears at the scene when he dies...when I saw my first Michael Mann film, Heat.A story that begins with man on a mission to pull heists set against a man whose life is passing him by, because he's committed to hunting murderers.A story that ends with a man who dies just as he's realising he has to escape the mission he's spent his life committed to, but who refuses to stand down, killed by the hand of the man who showed him what life could be if he ended his mission. But the heister who died only died at the hand of that man, because he taught him how the heister's mind works.In them both, there are so many similarities, not just the central theme. The denouement of both unveils the driving forces of the two central characters, and how those forces are unbalanced by their interaction with each other. And he unravels this showing strengths and weaknesses in both men, blurring the edges of the standard good guy / bad guy relationship, by illustrating more of an insight.",Collateral

But the character development, such as it is, is shallow and unbelievable. The conversations between Cruise and Foxx are meant to be profound, but are so banal they barely qualify as sophomoric. Foxx's performance is solid, but unspectacular, unless you want to give him extra credit for rising above the script. Tom Cruise is, as usual, Tom Cruise. If you like Tom Cruise you won't be disappointed. Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem elevate the film briefly in minor roles. Bardem's scene in particular is a gem. If you love Mann's previous films, help yourself. Otherwise, pass. There was more action, emotion, and character development in ""The Invincibles"" -- and that film was equally stylish to boot.",Collateral
771,daytony94,A Masterpiece,9,25 February 2005,"Collateral is a masterpiece of American cinema. Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, ""Island Limo"". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.His worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.When a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree. Director Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali) does a masterful job manipulating texture and tone throughout the movie, taking us to settings as diverse as a junkie's apartment, a penthouse, a hospital room, and a smoky jazz club, all the while making the city of angels a central character in the story.The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mixture of popular music and ambient tracks perfectly-timed and synced to the story... tribal drumbeats during the chase scenes, haunting rock ballads at pivotal moments, and one track that reminded this viewer of the scene at the other end of Tom Cruise's career, when he drives his father's Porsche out of the garage in ""Risky Business"" to the accompaniment of a thumping synth track. A bizarre side-note, I know.As the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.There are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.Troy Dayton",Collateral

Though it is still fun to watch, because they are cast out of their role cliché.The plot contains some annoying holes and inconsistencies - how they are regrettably typical for an action movie. But this is the major downfall for me. And I found the climax way too predictable and constructed.6,5/10 -",Collateral
773,venessaj,Music...??,6,5 March 2005,Hi.. i enjoyed the movie.. gave me another view on Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox..I found it had many different aspects to follow.. Jamie's relationship with his mother..i actually liked his idea for the limo company loll..i also agreed with Tom's character about big city's and people being so disconnected.. OK i have a question tho.. i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name and artist of the song.. that was playing in the taxi when Jada asked him to turn it up.. he commented about it being a classic.. I've looked at the sound track.. but of course that doesn't help if i don't have the title..I hope people are still reading these comments because seeing i'm in Australia the movie has only this week been released on DVD in my town.. Yes i'm in a very small country town.. Thanx..,Collateral
774,simonnicol,A truly well thought out script,10,12 March 2005,"Just saw this on DVD. 11/03/05 Real edge-of-your-seat stuff. A challenge to Leon (Luc Besson). Direction is good, but who can beat Luc Besson? The real power of this movie is the script. Every movie seems to have a bit where 'everyone has a heart to heart' then it's on with the action. This script however segments on several occasions between action and reason. The action getting more dramatic as the film progresses and the relationship between the passenger and driver, unfurls superbly. Total suspense. At the conclusion one is left still thinking. Thank you Mr. Beattie for the trill of this spectacle.Acting by key players superb throughout. Though the 'F' word uttered by Mr. Cruse should have been cut, one can tell he's not use to it by the taint of the sound in his voice, a he plays too cool a customer to get agitated, but what a performance - totally convincing.A new action/thriller favourite!",Collateral
775,booklady-2,About Collateral,10,15 March 2005,"Last time i saw a movie this good was ,10 years ago 'the Grifters'. I cant believe its (not butter) a mainstream movie! this small but perfectly crafted movie is a joy. From its low key, muted cinematography to the unadorned , restrained quality story-telling it entertains.Collateral Honey , you were robbed! Utmost respect for Ray Charles, he remains always, a Titan in 2oth century music. Documenting his life is worthy & long overdue. However for me this movie is the oneJamie Foxx deserved an Oscar for.All movie drama should tell a story well without extra immaterial unhealthy garnish.I'm glad Tom Cruise gets to show the world again that he can in fact act and commits with unexpected skill to a meaty 3d character best ever. He plies his craft humbly and with empathy for his fellow movie makers. Jada Pinket-Smith chisels out a living breathing woman and blends seamlessly into the mix of a (living,breathing) believable story.Jamie Foxx gifts us a non-stereotype of a man who lives down the road from you or you or me.He is the structural beam for our journey into a story more than sum of its parts, and guess what we cant even tell hes doing it! We are with, the people in this story and share their rough ride. For me this film touches that ,that which is inside of us. Its big and small,its all feelings at once ;situated deep inside and i don't care what its called.So I guess this movie is a gift and all about giving. The actors are allowed to ACT , together! And tell a story with dignity.We the watchers are allowed to think, be independent and marvel at things we do and don't understand, but HELL we want to try!The final gift for me in this unpretentious art is that for the first time in o so long i am allowed to fall in love with the characters (in all their perfectly flawed humanity);and savour a square meal of a story in a movie that is for anybody & everyone. Not such ordinary food for masses of individuals.",Collateral
776,daredsox04,Unbelievable,9,11 June 2005,"This movie is great! The acting by Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith is fantastic. Tom Cruise is the bad guy in this film. With Jamie Foxx as the tragic hero. The relationship between Foxx and Cruise's characters are so intriguing. Tom Cruise doesn't kill Foxx even when it seems like he should. The question is, does he not kill him because he likes him?, or because he doesn't want to find another cab driver? Tom Cruise does an unbelievable job in this movie. Although he is a horrible person that kills people for money, you still can't help but like him.The culminating scene is definitely the most interesting scene in the movie. foxx and cruise get in a shootout with a subway door between them. cruise gets hit in the torso. he sits down on a subway seat and then foxx sits on the seat across from him. they just stare at each other. smith then sits next to foxx. then cruise asks foxx how long it will take for someone to realize he's dead. he bends over and dies.

777,power_house64,Best Hit men Movie Ever,10,30 April 2005,"If you are into action and like ""Hit man"" type of movies, then this is the best movie for you. Tom Cruise as the assassin--more likely a hit men is the best character that can play this movie. The beginning of the movie is classic, Jamie Foxx playing as the Taxi Driver and then little romantic time, I don't want to reveal the whole movie. Anyway this is my first time watching Tom Cruise into action, murdering people-looks like a real serial killer. I was flabbergasted by his act; I have to say he is the Best Hit men ever. The scheme of the movie was well written and displayed. From beginning of the movie to end you will have your eye wedged to the screen. Jamie Foxx(Max)the little helper of Tom Cruise(Vincent), as like the old school, Man helps Man. In the end the movie have very good twist, when Max discover that Vincent is after his Girl, so he tries to save her. The ending was very sad for me. Fascinating act by both of them, I give them high extol. By the act of the Hit men, you really can't tell that Tom Cruise can be a killer. You can't judge a person, until you become familiar with them. But, role of Jamie Foxx was also exquisite as he turn himself as a shooter to save somebody's life and then kills the villain. It's also good to see that Hollywood didn't portray Jamie Foxx as the bad man. Mostly you see Blackman always the criminal. My opinion - that he can't play the role of Vincent as Tom Cruise did anyway -- Tom cruises is the best. I wish I was playing Vincent as the Hit men, but Tom Cruise showed the best fighting and gun action that you would expect.",Collateral

Ikkle Tommy was wet, pathetic and not scary, mind you he wasn't helped by the fact the film itself was rubbish.So dull, Foxx didn't deserve to be put in this poor, boring film. The plot took a good half hour to get going if you had seen the trailers, which meant that once again the Hollywood machine has ruined a film by letting you know the point to the film - Tom is bad! Wow, the wee man has been trying to get an Oscar since Jerry and the reason he won't get one is that he is not the best actor year in, year out. Nothing in this film makes me think that will change. I'm perfectly happy to be proved wrong but frankly all the hype around this film was not justified.",Collateral
779,Lolballs,A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do,10,7 May 2005,"I had high hopes for this film, as I am a big fan of Mann's ""Heat"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Thief"" and saw that this could be another urban thriller with thought and brains behind it. Of course it was! As a thriller this film works quite well, but if that's all that you are after. A simple thrill, you're missing a lot of the subtle points with this one. Max is a simple, unhappy working-man who has been driving a cab ""temporarily"" for over a decade, whilst he is dreaming about starting a limosinecompany. Vincent is a professional hit-man and sees no problem with what he does. The world around them is cold, distant, indifferent and very, very hard to get along with. One has to adapt or fall into shadow and self deceit. When Vincent says ""I do this for a living!"" the message is clear. Vincents lines are not just random, true words to make you smile (Like some of Tyler Durden's words of wisdom in ""Fight Club""), or feel sad. They really paint a picture of what the world has come too. All this philosophy is gracefully placed on and around an excellent action experience. The actors are doing some of their finest work, Tom Cruise is perfect for the role and does a masterful, physical performance. Why Cruise fits so well might be because he has played the typical ""professional"" so many times before. Doctors, lawyers, spies and even more lawyers. Now the idealistic young man is all grown up, and see what became of him! Jamie Foxx is brilliant when he gets to play roles that demand jokes and loudness, but he handles a low-voiced man under pressure perhaps even better. Hope to see a lot more of him, and I'm pretty damn sure we will. The music plays a big part in this film, all of it might not be my/your taste, but it adds to the whole feeling of a city at night. As if we are hearing a car stereo running. The taxi's radio perhaps? In a car at night, sometimes a song you normally would never like sounds great or fits your mood perfectly. The film was shot using Digital Video, which some people hate. I love it when it fits the context like it does beautifully here. The close and personal-scenes as well as the action scenes get a sort of nakedness. Also the shots of Los Angeles are some of the most beautiful and atmospheric I've ever seen of a city. Flying high among the buildings or following the road closely it really looks spectacular all the way. If you feel, like many others I hear, you don't quite like the ending, I believe you have missed a few of the points along the way. About the compassionate man standing up against indifference, that there is hope, what the woman represents, or perhaps just a few of the things that Vincent said earlier in the film. Anyway this is a great film.Either I like, or don't like. This one I really like, 10/10.",Collateral

The story is not interestingly Topsy-turvy and it doesn't REALLY arc well...it tries several times but it just never gets there. The camera work is horrible...the hand-held business is pretentious and takes away from the storyline. All in all, though I've always enjoyed Michael Mann's films, I have to say that this was terrible. Too bad so many good actors, excluding Tom Cruise of course were wasted on this film. It's become obvious that the producers in Hollywood are positively clueless as to WHAT moves audiences in this day and age.

785,star1-4,Michael Mann's most recent work of art!,8,12 July 2005,"Two separate worlds collide for a night when a smooth but very simple taxi cab driver Max, (Jamie Fox) picks up his next customer Vincent (Tom Cruise), a very talented fast moving hit man on a killing spree through the moonlit streets of downtown Los Angeles. All goes according to plan except for his last hit when his cabbie Max gets involved. Collateral shows that the value of human life is irreplaceable and significant to most people, and that to some people life is shallow, expendable and unimportant.Collateral allows its viewers to interact with the lives of two complete opposite individuals and the conflict that is created between Vincent and Max. The film displays the beauty of life in many variations, for example Michael Mann shows that underneath all the materialistic and separations of different society levels that connections are made between people of all likes makes and models. Perhaps the following may be a bit of a spoiler, however in the beginning of the film viewers witness this connection with the interaction that takes place between Max a cab driver and Annie a federal prosecutor. But from a different perspective Michael Mann reveals that certain people are disconnected from the wonderful gifts of life. Mann reflects this disconnect through Vincent's character thought process and actions.Another film that helps to reinforce Collateral's theme for example is the movie The Professional, Also known as ""Leon"", 1994. The main character Leon a hit man plays a similar role like that of Tom Cruise. Leon who is a very dangerous hit man also allows his audience to view his very intimate softer side; viewers can witness this affection with his relationship to Matilda a young girl who he desperately protects with his life. Collateral displays the wonderful talent of director Michael Mann. The majority of the movie is shot in low-key lighting, to signify the intense intimacy between the city, Vincent and Max. A great scene to help reinforce this statement is when Max and Vincent get pulled over by the police and Vincent is warning Max that he must loose the police and talk his way out of the dire situation. The scene is shot in low-key lighting with a close-up shot of Max's facial expressions and in the frame a selective focused shot of Vincent in the back seat of the cab. For most individual's life is a priceless gift, however some are on this earth to seek and destroy it, Collateral's stars Tom Cruise and Jaime Fox's characters reflect a great example of this dilemma.",Collateral

No other film captures the city of LA as well as this. Nor does any other film capture the night hours in such a beautiful and distinguished way. This might be attributed to director Micheal Mann's excellent directoral abilitys or by his choice to use digital cameras to record much of this film.

787,Appocolyptik,There are six billion people on the planet and you're getting bent out of shape cause of one fat guy?,8,18 August 2008,"The name Tom Cruise has become synonymous with the word 'wooden' over the last few years, a label not unfairly bestowed considering he's never really starred in a world class film, yet remains one of the highest paid movie affiliates of all time. He innately performs extremely similar roles in all his films, the virtuous and admirable American hero that all women love and that all men want to be. So it comes as a surprise to learn that he takes on a rare villainous role in this film, the role of a sociopathic hit-man tasked with murdering five people in a nights work. Jamie Foxx is cast as the routine taxi driver with aspirations to become something more, but is held back lack of ambition and a reliance on security and routine.Even more surprising than Tom Cruise' role is the fact that this is the finest performance he's ever committed to a film. His depiction as the brutally proficient killer is scarily inspiring. He underplays his role, abandoning his self imposing demeanour for simple efficiency and the end result is that he makes a one man army capable of engaging multiple opponents and defeating them all seem very believable. His execution of the Mozabique drill is highly accurate and it's inclusion gives Vincent a higher degree of realism that if he was merely blindly shooting his way through scores of assailants without injury like any standard Bond film. The rare interludes that provide his philosophical insight into sociology also give Vincent that extra depth that separates him from the standard action villain.Jamie Foxx similarly provides an excellent contribution through his subtle portrayal of an average cabbie thrust into a mortally threatening situation where the slightest mistake would undoubtedly result in his death. His initial bewilderment to the situation is excellently executed, as is his careful transition to assertive man of action, influenced by his constant proximity to Vincent. The relationship between him and Cruise gives the film a certain degree of depth rarely committed to the action thriller genre. The whole film is ridden with carefully laden undertones depicting the delicate balance between planning and improvisation that dominate everyones life. Both characters are extremes of each, and their struggle to irrevocably find a balance between them is superbly scripted.Furthermore, Michael Manns directing is nothing short of stellar. His mix up of camera shots and fast edit cuts give the film a excellently balanced pace, involving the audience with the quick transition through scenes but not storming through the film at such a pace that it compromises necessary detail.Overall this is an excellent film definitely worth watching, one which Tom Cruise undoubtedly deserved an Oscar Nomination for but bafflingly failed to receive.8.3/10",Collateral
788,jeffrey-romulo,Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,20 October 2005,"Collateral is by far the best action movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The actors, the plot, and the action in the movie are all just wonderful and exciting. One major reason why this movie was so amazing was because of the outstanding actors that were in the film, which included Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith. I absolutely loved every aspect of this film. I watch a lot of movies and this is the only movie that was worthy enough to buy on DVD. Basically the movie is about Max (Jamie Foxx) is a failed comedy writer living in Los Angeles who makes a living as a cab driver. Max also has a lifelong dream of owning his own limo company called ""Island Limo,"" where only the best service will exist. The entire movie focuses on one very chaotic night for Max, as he figures out that his cab passenger (Tom Cruise) turns out to be a contract killer, committing a series of hits as Max can do nothing but drive. Ultimately, it's up to Max to stop the killer from executing his last witness as well as himself. The action sequence in this movie has something different about it. It has a unique style of action that I have never seen before; it's just beautiful to watch. Michael Mann, the director of the film did an excellent job staging the action and all the relative events. I believe that this is a great movie with a lot to look forward to.

It is interesting right from the beginning to the end, yet the death of Vincent was a bit modest. I'm no critic or anything, by all means, but his death could have been more elaborated. I did not know he got shot until I saw the blood on his side, very interesting though, he didn't seem to be in pain. Quite a valiant death, in my opinion, too valiant. I admire the scriptwriter's spunk with the unforgettable remarks of Max and Vincent. One I favor most is the scene where the fat man falls onto Max's taxi, when Vincent comes back out and Max confronts him about it, Vincent didn't kill the fat man, the bullets and the fall killed him. I don't know how Tom Cruise kept a straight face at that moment, even after all his years of acting and practice, I could never do that! Someone would have to threaten me with the loss of my life in order for me to keep it straight!Another thing, Tom Cruise will no doubt age gracefully since he looks quite good with gray hair. Professional, yet simple with a sort of laid-back feel. I honestly thought he would be the hero at the beginning of the movie! Maybe someone else thought so, too!In conclusion, I think this movie deserved more publicity than it got, perhaps it was that a taxi driver's cab being hijacked was a bit too outrageous, or that maybe that the ending was sparse, I do not know. I also liked the music, being a musician ('cello), I enjoy listening to the music in movies. I recognized a piece by Bach toward the beginning of the movie, it was in a jazz format with the the bass playing the 'cello part and the piano playing the orchestra part.

The two main actors are brilliant in it - Jamie Foxx showing the kind of acting that got his the Oscar for 'Ray', and Tom Cruise showing that he is better as a bad guy (like 'Interview With A Vampire'). To back this up, the supporting cast are good as well - led by Jada Pinkett Smith - and the soundtrack constantly pumps out modern rock and dance tunes.

And he uses a cab, so the driver is a loose cannon as the film showed. Could he have not just used a car that could not be traced to him? All points to him wanting to get caught/dead but the film doesn't seem to fully explore this. If you want to see a hit-man movie then Leon remains the best and Vincent could learn a thing or two from Leon!

Shortly after the first stop, it's revealed that Vincent is a contract killer, and all the stops are his next victims. As this review is spoiler free, I won't go into further detail, but all I can say is that this story is extremely well written.Characters: Tom Cruise is very convincing as an assassin, and he and Foxx's character have a strange sort of chemistry that just works out well. The supporting characters do their parts well too.Screenplay: The cab scenes are relaxing in a strange sort of way. The camera wobbles while they're in it, and though that may sound crude, it feels like you're in the cab with them. The action scenes are shot extremely well too.Overall: This film is just awesome for anyone looking for a suspense film with a hint of action that has a good plot. Even if you're not a fan of Jamie Foxx or Tom Cruise, this film will make you forget that.
