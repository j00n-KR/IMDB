0,SnoopyStyle,powerful straight story,8,15 August 2021,"Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) gets picked up by the Mauritanian police after 9/11. It's the start of his odyssey to Guantánamo Bay. Three years later, New Mexico defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) gets recruited to be his lawyer. She is joined by junior associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). Meanwhile, Marine lawyer Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is recruited to be the prosecutor to give the prisoner a death sentence. He is eager for the job after losing a close friend in one of the planes. Former classmate Neil Buckland (Zachary Levi) is involved with the interrogation.Director Kevin Macdonald delivers a clear-headed dissection of the case against Mohamedou who is known here as The Mauritanian. The power of this movie comes from a straight forward telling of his story. I am uncertain about portraying the torture but somehow it has to be laid down on film. I would consider a less direct approach to give the audience some space. There are a few lines of dialogue that I wish Nancy would say. The performances are beyond reproach. All in all, this is a powerful truth seeking missile of a film.",The Mauritanian
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Very entertaining and informative, a slight drop in quality in the second half keeps it from being a great watch",6,20 July 2021,"""The Mauritanian"" is a co-production between the United States of America and the United Kingdom and one of the bigger players this awards season. Maybe not biggest. The film runs for over two hours and is mostly in the English language, but due to the story and background also includes a few words in other languages here and there. Director is Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald and his biggest achievement so far was the Academy Award in the documentary category, so it is not surprising at all that this film here is not only based on real people, but also had a documentary touch to it at times. Sometimes it also felt more like The Newsroom, but never really like one of those many lawyer-themed shows from over the years. Anyway, also not a surprise as a consequence that one of the writers has mostly worked in the documentary genre so far, also as a producer. The other two are known for the television show Informer. As for the cast, Tahar Rahim may play the title character and he is also the man you see on the photo here, but even if he gave a strong performance it felt for good reason that the film feels just as much about Jodie Foster's character at times and this may be the reason why the latter actually won a Golden Globe for her portrayal here, but at the oscars she did not get in. Still, even at almost 60 now, Hollywood seems to love her and the star potential is undeniable. They even made room for her a bit in the second half it felt when Shailene Woodley was out of the picture for a while, but then returned for the purpose of an all-around happy ending. Anyway, it still felt a bit awkward to see Foster now closing in on 60 if you remember her from Taxi Driver and how young she was there, a movie seen as a classic by many. I am not sure if I would go that far. Okay, I mentioned the key players already now and you can also add benedict Cumberbatch there. I am not a fan when it comes to him really and I see him as pretty overrated, but here he is tolerable. I wished they could have gone with a more sinister character. Instead, it is all about his grief being overshadowed by reason and he does not bring enough to the character to really make an impact there. He will always be the good guy I suppose. But kinda fitting that Foster won so big and he did not score any nominations.As for the film itself, you can see in the title of my review that I thought the first hour was very, very good, but it went south a bit quality-wise afterwards when the focus was on torturing mostly. I mean it was still shocking when those tough guys took over, but also the forced sex for example and, to a lesser extent because it just matters when he asks for it after the confession, the sleep deprivation, but something was missing. I do believe that they could have kept this at around two hours as well and would not have lost too much quality by cutting out the right (or wrong) scenes in the second half. The second half was also much more serious than the first. Early on, we do have some light moments here and there too. I would not go so far and call it comic relief, but Foster's character can make you smile here and there and I am not really talking that much about the scene when she tells us what happened to her marriage. On the contrary, it is even a bit sad that all she lives for now is really her job. But I think Jodie did fine in delivering both depth on the drama scale and an occasional smirk as well. Props to her for that. Woodley I like too, but she really has no good material here. She is rather depicted as the one not ready for the situation and the comment about her father not wanting to see her was almost a bit cringeworthy. Not the greatest line delivery either. But how she is so in awe of Foster's character (still a strong female the way they should be more often in terms of authenticity), how she says something she should not have said during the talk to their client, how she almost collapses on one occasion and Foster's character asks if she's fine etc. Yeah well they should have turned her less into the dumb girl I think, also with how Foster's character gets her back.As for Rahim, I am not sure I liked him as an actor that much on other projects, but I also have not seen this much from him before. Just a Farhadi film I remember I think and he was decent there. His performance here is also not as challenging and as central as you could think and maybe that's why he did not get in at the Oscars either. But he is okay with what he was given I'd say. There just wasn't too much to the character than one would imagine. The shades come more from the writing. Like the scene with the other prisoner and I am sure almost everybody in the room wondered if it is perhaps not really a prisoner, but one who is an agent in disguise with the task to pose as an unseen friend and get information out of the title character. But nope, he was a prisoner really. Then there are these moments when we see Rahim's character even bond with some of the people working at Guantanamo. His outgoing nature makes it easy for him to not be seen as a quiet antagonist and it is contagious. I mean they even celebrate a little but with him when they find out about his acquittal. Oh yes, his speech at the end is pretty good though. This was where Rahim shone, also the question if they heard all he said. He played a smart character. If he resembles the man this is based on in real life is up to you to decide when you see him with the closing credits. I still found it interesting that we do not get a 100% verdict if he is really innocent. I mean it is all implied, also with his easy-going nature and stuff like the crocodile reference etc., but there is still no 100% safety. As Foster's character stated early on, a call from Bin Laden's compound is still a call from Bin Laden's compound or something like that. This is something I liked. The film does not turn him into a hero, just into a (seemingly) nice guy. I also liked the brief prologue years before all that follows afterwards and how he won't be back for a long time. I personally found it a good decision that they did not include many flashbacks.It's in general the small and witty moments where the film shines the most. Like the quote about why he wanted them to call his mother and just tell her anything. Sadlly, this was once again also a moment where Woodley's character looked a bit stupid, even if Foster's character's explanation made total sense. I did not see through it either, but then again I am far, far away from Woodley's job status. As for Foster, I also remember the moment in which she talks about her client's chains to somebody at Guantanamo. This was a really powerful female acting moment, also how they vanish quickly afterwards. Here and there, the film lost itself too much in anti-Republican propaganda again, but this is not a surprise given the 100% liberal climate in Hollywood. I am of course mostly talking about the Bush and Rumsfeldt inclusions and how the title character is going up against these two and agrees to do so as if it was nothing special. Also maybe kinda fitting to watch this film now because Rumsfeldt died less than a month ago. As for Obama, I guess we can also be happy that it was at least written on the screen briefly that this terrible human being cost the title character almost another dacde of his life. I am of course not surprised that this is not part of the movie in terms of specific scenes. Just quickly rush it in at the end is the best you can get and maybe this is also why they kept up the possibility that he could be a terrorist. Or could have been, even if never as influential as he is suspected to at the beginning.With Cumberbatch, mentioned him early already, he basically just turns into an aide in the end to Foster's character when he tells her about the lie detector test. Before that, you get some of the usual from films like this: (forced) confessions, doubts, professional honor etc. No negative criticisms or anything. It was mostly okay how they depucted it here. Not too much that could have been done better. Thinking of it, I do believe that Cumberbatch's character could also have been much more interesting because he is the only one really with massive character development and change in mind. Pity they did not cast another actor there and I am not too sure if I am positive on the ways the other people were shown here, the ones to whom the Mauritanian will always be a terrorist with a gigantic amount of blood on his hands, like of course the one who calls Cumberbatch's character a traitor before getting in his car. I still fail to see Cumberbatch somehow as somebody realistically portraying a high-profile member of the forces. Maybe just me. But come on, look at all his honors there. Anyway, that is it. Overall, a good movie, but not a great one because it could not keep the initially really high level. Definitely interesting if you care about the genre and subject and I don't regret watching it one one bit and there was also never the slightest doubt for me if I could hand out a positive recommendation here. I certainly do. Would be nice if this could be some kind of breakthrough for Rahim in Hollywood, but I kinda doubt it. At least it keeps Woodley more relevant for a while, even if I hope she can get better roles in the future. This is really all about Jodie in terms of the women. The gap between Jodie and Woodley here is probably even bigger than the gap between Rahim and Cumberbatch. Enough said. Go watch this one.",The Mauritanian
2,nogodnomasters,Special Measures,8,29 March 2021,Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim ) is a prisoner at Guantanamo. He has confessed to recruiting the hijackers and masterminding the 9-11 attack under duress approve by Donald Rumsfeld. Benedict Cumberbatch is his prosecutor. Only Jodi Foster can save him.This is based on a true story of one detainee. We know it is true because they show all the real people at the end. It is a slow moving drama that leads up to a court scene that is not the climax it should have been. The saga was slow but interesting.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,The Mauritanian
3,CinemaSerf,14 years of hell....,7,1 April 2021,"Tahar Rahim and Kevin MacDonald have come some way since their first collaboration on ""the Eagle"" (2011). This one sees the former - Mohammed Ould Slahi - incarcerated, without charge, by the American authorities in Guantánamo Bay. His case comes to the attention of attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and together with her colleague Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley) they fight tooth and nail to secure his release. Benedict Cumberbatch is their opponent, the formidable and honourable Col. Crouch, and as the story unfolds both parties begin to appreciate the extent of the atrocities being carried out. Rahim is super. His portrayal demonstrating startlingly well the extremes of human endurance - of body and spirit - as Hollander works tirelessly to secure his release. There have been a spate, of late, of these style of films that point the finger squarely as successive US administrations who use the rule of law as/when and if it suited them - regardless of their red or blue politics - and this poignantly delivered documentary-style film uses dialogue potently (and sparingly) as well as flashback and actuality-effect photography to gradually (OK, maybe a bit too gradually) depict the backstory of this young man - whom, so far as we know is guilty of nothing at all - really sensitively and powerfully. This is not a film that sees much actually happen in any traditional sense, and if you have read any of his best selling ""Guantánamo Diaries"" then you will know just how this legally protracted story concludes, but as an assessment of a state's attempts to systematically dehumanise a man; and of the blind obedience of some of it's servants in-so-doing, it is a compelling film to watch that cannot fail to leave a nasty taste in your mouth.",The Mauritanian
4,evanston_dad,Underrated,8,13 July 2021,"I had modest expectations going into ""The Mauritanian,"" a screen adaptation of the book ""Guantanamo Diary,"" which blew the whistle on the U. S. treatment of prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. Usually, if a movie as Oscar-baity as this one fails to receive a single nomination, it's because it's not very good. So call me pleasantly surprised when I discovered the film to be the exact opposite.To some, ""The Mauritanian"" will likely be too heavy handed. It's one of those liberal Hollywood diatribes (and I say this as a self-identified liberal progressive) that can be too much even for those who've already bought what the movie is selling. I might have been turned off if I'd been in a different mood when I watched it. But sometimes, the commitment of the people making the movie can overcome its excess earnestness, and that was the case for me here. Among the usual Liberal Activists = Good, U. S. Government and Military = Bad tropes, the film does try for some nuance in its characters. Jodie Foster gives a sensational performance as the attorney dedicated to freeing the film's protagonist, played in an equally wonderful performance by Tahar Rahim, and we're allowed to see that she's unlikable and conflicted. Likewise, Benedict Cumberbatch, as the prosecuting attorney, is introduced as what we're sure is going to be a macho Southern military goon stereotype, complete with unacceptable accent, but the movie subverts our expectations and shows that he's capable of letting personal and patriotic feelings be outweighed by humanitarian ones. Granted, the film does none of this elegantly or delicately, but I just appreciated a story that at least attempted to populate a liberal/conservative issue movie with characters that are more than easy ciphers. The film could probably be criticized as yet another white savior story, and those criticisms would be justified. But it's a damn good one.Shailene Woodley rounds out the cast as Foster's assistant, and she's excellent as well. The director is Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland""), who has a knack for making blisteringly entertaining movies out of gruesome true event subject matter.Grade: A.",The Mauritanian
5,ferguson-6,tried to tackle too much,6,12 February 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. September 11, 2001 will be always remembered in history books, and seared into the memories of those who were there or watched the horrifying events unfold on television. As Americans, we were stunned and felt vulnerability for the first time in years. Also as Americans, we demanded justice for those responsible. Oscar winning director Kevin Macdonald (ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER, 1999) working from a script by co-writers Michael Bronner, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, brings us the true story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, based on his best-selling 2015 memoir, ""Guantanamo Diary"".Tahar Rahim (so good in A PROPHET, 2009) stars as Slahi, and we first see him in November 2001 (2 months after the attack) as he's returned from Germany to Mauritania, West Africa for a family wedding. He's told, ""The Americans want to talk to you"", as he's taken into custody. The movie skips to 2005 where we find Defense Attorney Nancy Hollander (2 time Oscar winner Jodie Foster) and her associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley) in the courtroom. These two are crusaders for the law, and take on the case of Slahi, who has bounced first from a prison in Jordan and now to Guantanamo. Four years with no hearing, no trial, and no charges brought against him.The film jumps around from Slahi in Gitmo, to the two sides prepping their cases: Hollander for the defense, and Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) for the military. Couch had a friend on one of the 9/11 planes, and he's instructed that this is a death penalty case - the only outcome that will deliver justice to the American people. Director Macdonald includes flashbacks to Slahi's arrival at Gitmo, and even further back (1988) to his earning a scholarship to Germany. We also see the reenactment of the documented torture and ""enhanced interrogation"" procedures used against Slahi. It's difficult to watch even these snippets of what he endured.It's 2009 before a judge even hears Slahi's case, and 7 more years before he's released. A total of 14 years captive with no charges, on top of the well-documented torture. Was Mohamedou Ould Slahi in some way responsible for the terrorist act of September 11, 2001? Did he recruit others to join the cause? The fact that we don't really know the answers goes to the heart of what went wrong at Gitmo, and how the American need for justice caused a horrific detour in the legal process.Unlike some, I have no issues with ""agenda movies"", and it seems as though director Macdonald set out to make this one. The problem is that the multiple pieces and characters are just too much to juggle for one film. At times, it seems to highlight Hollander as a crusader. Other times it wants us to understand the struggles of Couch. And then there are times when the attention is on Slahi. The fragmented approach leaves us lacking in all aspects, especially for teasing a courtroom drama that never occurs. The actual footage included at the conclusion leaves us wondering whether the intention all along was to tug on our heartstrings, rather than expose the wrongs that transpired.

6,gradyharp,"'In Arabic, the word for free and the word for forgiveness is the same word'",10,5 September 2021,"A very timely release for THE MAURITANIAN - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attack coupled with the controversial withdrawal of troops and civilians from Afghanistan as that twenty year long war ends. Finally we are offered insight into the Guantánamo imprisonment of 'suspected initiators' of terrorism through this true story as offered in Mohamedou Ould Slahi's book GUANTANAMO DIARY written in 2015.Kevin Macdonald directs this well-written screenplay (Michael Bronner, Rory Haines, Sohrab Noshirvani) that places before us the tragic treatment of detainees at the prison in Guantánamo. The gifted actor Tahir Rahim (A Prophet, The Past) brings a stunning performance as Mohamedou, facile in English, French, and Arabic, and grows into the role so well that he captures not only the right to be released as innocent after 14 years of torture and misery as an uncharged detainee, but also our hearts and minds. He is championed by his lawyer Nancy Holland (Jodie Foster) assisted by her associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). The testy prosecution attorney Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is ultimately able to unlock the files that reveal Mohamedou's innocence and has the courage to bring this into the courtroom at lastThe entire cast is excellent, including the prisoner's family, and even the guards mistreating Mohamedou are convincing in their depiction of the horrors of the prison, and the musical score by Tom Hodge incorporates music of both sides of Mohamedou's life without overwhelming the film. This is a difficult film to watch because it is true - and still happening! But this is an important film for all of us to experience and then strive for correction of this dark and ugly problem.",The Mauritanian
7,deloudelouvain,"Another scandal from the USA, the land of the free...",9,27 June 2021,"Movies based on true events are always more interesting to watch and when it's a story like this one you can't help it to have very opiniated emotions. It's another (yes there are plenty) scandal coming from the land of injustice (even though they think they are so rightful whilst the opposite is much more accurate). The land of freedom and justice, of opportunities, where people are treated like equal no matter what your religion or skin color is... That's how they like to portray their country. If you tell yourself a lie long enough you might start believing it. The Mauritanian is a powerful movie with excellent actors. Tahar Rahim did a great job playing his character and so did Jodie Foster. It all starts a bit slow but as soon as you get into the story you can't take your eyes of the screen. Guantanamo Bay, another enormous scandal everybody knows about by now, another scandal where nobody had to pay the price for their wrongdoings, a scandal where the only ones that paid a very high price are the innocent. It's not a movie that will leave you with a pleasant feeling, but it's for sure worth watching. To me one of the better movies I watched this year, or even in the last decade.",The Mauritanian

Hard to believe that things like this took place in Guantanamo Bay. Really this cast a black cloud of how the federal government covers up as they would go to any measures to get truths and confessions, as the scenes and punishment that one Mohamedou Ould Salahi(Tahar Rahim) went through is telling and the legal work of his defense team Nancy(the bold Jodie Foster) and Teri(Shailene Woodley) is truth seeking and telling as it's a fight for justice and it tries to write facts the right way.

In those harrowing flashback sequences Macdonald adopts a square frame to heighten the incubus that haunts and torments our hero, the torture part is shot like a bleached, flashy music video for a heavy metal band, fast-edited and circumspectly removes shots that contain any concrete exertion of physical violence, so as not to make the film uncomfortable for the squeamish, who must be its key demo.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",The Mauritanian
10,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Solid, absorbing legal procedural drama",9,13 April 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the aftermath of 9/11, the US State Department is under pressure to round up suspects, at home and abroad. Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahoe Rahim) finds himself taken from his home in Mauritius, placed on a rendition flight and placed in Guantanamo Bay. His case attracts the attention of defence attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and her assistant Teri Duncan (Shailene Bailey.) Under the terms of Habeus Corpus, Hollander knows that Slahi can't be held overly long without being charged, and as she and military prosecutor Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) dig deeper in to the case, they uncover evidence that casts everything in a new light.Years after it happened, 9/11 and the events that followed it are still fresh in everyone's minds, and can still be felt in the political climate today. One of the scariest ones has got to be America's standing as the superpower of the world, and how it can abuse that power to it's whim, which can be witnessed in the shocking amount of people from around the world hoisted away from their homes, and held for years without being charged or having a trial, one of which this sprawling legal drama from director Kevin McDonald explores.Performances wise, Foster is effortlessly effective in the role, with just the perfect presence and it's hard to think who would have done it better. Cumberbatch is also reliably solid in support, with a commanding presence you've come to expect off him, and doing a great American accent. But stealing the show is relative newcomer Rahim, still fresh from hit BBC drama The Serpent, as the central protagonist, sometimes cracking but still trying to keep his humanity together in spite of his desperate predicament. Director Macdonald also makes his contribution to the proceedings, with neat touches, like closing the screen in during the scenes with Slahi in the detention centre, to add to the feeling of claustrophobia and being trapped.It's all rounded off with some horrifying true life statistics regarding those incarcerated and those charged, leaving us with the uncomfortable realisation that the subject's situation is far from unique, and making you question America's legitimacy in its role as the world's policeman. ****",The Mauritanian

12,Cineanalyst,Taking Liberties,4,8 August 2021,"""The Mauritanian"" is a hard movie to watch for two reasons. First, the obvious, it's about post-9/11 torture of suspected terrorists during the W. Bush administration and the suspension of habeas corpus for uncharged Guantanamo Bay prisoners that continues to this day. To paraphrase a quip made by Jodie Foster's lawyer in the movie, turns out the U. S. Constitution does have an asterisk for terms and conditions. Second, it's a significantly flawed, by-the-numbers legal procedural. The happy ending comes off as especially forced, but otherwise it suffers some of the same problems as the similarly-themed ""The Report"" (2019). Cinematically, the sad truth is that a picture that tacitly approves of so-euphemistically-called ""enhanced interrogation"" as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), which was specifically referenced in ""The Report,"" is aesthetically a better-made movie.So, in the war of convincing movie-goers with their messages, putting the truth out there, or however one wants to phrase it, the side of ""The Report"" and ""The Mauritanian"" remain at a disadvantage two decades on. And, if one doesn't need any convincing of the horrors of torture, assault, sexual degradation, fighting terror with terror, violations of the Constitution, rule of law, and so on, then what's the point. It's just a clichéd echo chamber. I'll take ""The Mauritanian"" over ""The Report"" for mercifully fewer supercilious rejoinders in the Aaron Sorkin school of screenwriting, but I'd have to take the other side as far as this one not only going for that comforting ending, but also going all in on the white savior trope. It's not just that it assumes a white audience for the movie, it's also patronizing of that hypothetical spectator. Having a sympathetic prison guard in these movies seems to be a trope onto itself, lest the spectator think all prison guards are abusive monsters, I guess. ""The Hurricane"" (1999) is another such film with such a character serving that sole purpose that readily comes to mind.I think it's best Jodie Foster wasn't nominated for an Oscar, although she won a Golden Globe, for her role here, as she's a fine actress, but this part just isn't very good. Besides, she's more of a lead than a supporting actress here. Tahar Rahim's part as Mohamedou Ould Slahi is the emotional core of the picture, too, although I wish they (and Mohamedou himself, as it's based on his memoir, and he advised on the production) hadn't whitewashed his character, as if viewers can't be expected to be horrified by anyone other than a saint being subjected to such inhumane treatment. I'm also not sure how I feel about the stylization of the torture scenes here, whether it would have been preferable for a more docudrama approach, but they are undoubtedly the most impactful moments in the picture. And, then, there's whatever is going on with Benedict Cumberbatch's accent. Apparently, his character was born in North Carolina, but I thought maybe he was trying to do a Texan, Dubya kind of thing, or just more general Southern American. Regardless, it's distracting. I even searched for some video of the real Stuart Couch that Cumberbatch impersonates here, and, no, that accent isn't right. Yet, that's the least of the problems here.Also, I'm fine with the alternating between square and widescreen rectangular aspect ratios here, as there's a thematic purpose to it (i.e. The walls closing in on him during the prison scenes), but this is becoming a somewhat distracting trend in recent movies. There was no good reason for it, say, in ""The Aeronauts"" (2019), by contrast.",The Mauritanian

14,westsideschl,Do Your Research,9,11 June 2021,"Organizations outside the US that have no stake/interest in US politics have almost all found that Guantanamo prison violates most all agreed upon societal & legal norms for imprisoning people. Exceptions are Russian & China (Wonder why?). Prisons (and the US has others in other countries) are distantly remote for one main reason - out of sight, out of mind. Kind of like how we treat our plastic garbage.Crime: Being associated with someone who is associated (what that means broadly captures a lot of innocents) with Bin-Laden. Usual stereotyping - you're guilty if you look, talk, believe different.Every conceivable, and some not, form of torture practiced (by practiced add in just doing it for fun or because you can or you have some ego inadequacy issues).At the time of this production 779 held; 8 of which have been convicted, but 3 of those overturned.

He was detained and imprisoned without any charge and now with the help of some lawyers he will fight for his freedom.I liked this movie very much because it was based on true events, it had a nice and very interesting plot, and some outstanding interpretations. The direction which was made by Kevin Macdonald was simply amazing and he presented very well and very careful this sensitive case. He also succeeded on presenting his main characters very well without confusing the audience with all the dates and the locations. The interpretation of Tahar Rahim who played as Mohamedou Ould Slahi was simply outstanding and he made the difference.

16,eddie_baggins,A familiar legal drama with some fine performances,6,31 August 2021,"Nominated for two Golden Globes and winning one for the performance of its leading lady Jodie Foster, The Mauritanian is a prestigious drama that knows its way around a good story but director Kevin Macdonald's film never excels in any major facet, meaning whilst always watchable and at times gripping in its telling of a true life tale, this rather generic and forgettable film can't find its own voice in a marketplace filled with many such trial over adversity legal dramas.Having not made a truly good film now since 2009's underappreciated thriller State of Play, that followed on from his best works The Last King of Scotland and the unforgettable Touching the Void documentary, Macdonald finds himself struggling once more to infuse his features with much energy or stand out elements and The Mauritanian really suffers from its restrained delivery that the best efforts of its leading performers can't help overcome.In her most fully formed role in some time, Jodie Foster is as solid as you'd expect playing real life American based lawyer Nancy Hollander who found herself working towards freeing Tahar Rahim's Guantanamo Bay inmate Mohamedou Ould Slahi from his years of imprisonment and torture after American intelligence agencies pinpointed him for involvement in Al-Qaeda activities and dealings with September 11 terrorists, despite a seemingly serious lack of hard evidence against the well-spoken and long-suffering soul.At its best when Foster and Rahim share the screen (with Rahim finally getting a role worthy of his talents after his breakout A Prophet lead turn), The Mauritanian plods along on its two hour journey and while the injustices committed against Slahi are evident and emotional, the film itself never quite manages to combine all its powerful moments or situations into a white knuckle thriller or a gripping all round drama as Macdonald ticks off a serious of typical political drama features (boxes of evidence delivered to offices, people crying while reading reports) and wastes the supports of Benedict Cumberbath and Shailene Woodley along the way with underwritten and basic side characters.It's a shame the film didn't manage to become more than it is, far from a bad film and telling a story worth being heard, The Mauritanian is a respectable effort from all involved but one that could've been more when you compile all the evidence in its favor.Final Say -Two strong central turns and a worthy true life tale make The Mauritanian a solid film but there is nothing remarkable about Macdonald's generic and familiar feature that never stands out from a crowded genre.3 redacted records out of 5.",The Mauritanian

18,paul-allaer,Important topic not done full justice by uneven movie,6,13 February 2021,"""The Mauritanian"" (2021 release; 129 min.) brings the true story of Guantanamo Bay detainee Mohamedou. As the film opens, we are in ""Mauritania, November 2001, 2 months after 9/11"", and Mohamedou, who now lives in Germany, is back for a family visit. He is pulled aside by the Mauritanian police that the Americans would like to speak with him. Next it is ""Albuquerque, New Mexico, February 2005"", and by then Mohamedou has not been seen or heard of for over 3 years. Human rights attorney Nancy Hollander decides to take on his case, and finds out trough an old contact of hers at the Pentagon that Mohamedou is in fact now at Guantanamo Bay... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Oscar winning Scottish director Kevin Macdonald, whose previous work includes ""The State of Play"" and ""Marley"". Here he adopts Mohamedou's best-selling memoir ""Guantanamo Bay Diary"" for the big screen. Put aside for a moment how you feel about Guantanamo Bay, and instead ask yourself: is this a good movie? The answer is, alas, that this is a mixed bag. The script is unable to turn the explosive underlying story into a riveting movie experience. Jodie Foster, whom we haven't seen much of in the last decade or so, tries her best as Nancy Hollander but fails to stand out. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Pentagon lead prosecutor who discovers thing he couldn't have imagined. Tahar Rahim fares best of all as Mehamedou, and gives a deeply personal performance. As to Guantanamo Bay itself, this particular movie exposes once again the brazen and illegal behavior initiated by the Bush administration and continued by both Obama and Trump. It absolutely blows the mind. At the movie's closing credits, we are reminded that 779 suspected terrorists were detained at Guantanamo Bay. The US military was able to obtain 7 convictions, of which 3 were overturned on appeal. So a grand total of FOUR convictions in 20 years of relentless pursuit of ""justice"", while violating all kinds of US and international laws along the way, Or as Hollander puts it: ""I don't fight for the terrorists, I fight for the rule of law."" A darn shame the movie couldn't match the importance of its topic.""The Mauritanian"" premiered in theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (7 people, including myself), which is more or less par for the course while the pandemic continues to rage in this country. The rest of the movieplex resembled a ghost town. I honestly don't understand how these places can operate profitably. All that aside, if you keep your expectations in check, and you have any interest in what really happened at Guantanamo Bay, I'd suggest you check out ""The Mauritanian"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Mauritanian
19,stevendbeard,Compelling Story,7,21 February 2021,"I saw ""The Mauritanian"", starring Tahar Rahim-The Kindness of Strangers, The Eagle; Jodie Foster-Hotel Artemis, Panic Room; Benedict Cumberbatch-1917, Thor:Ragnarok; Shailene Woodley-the Divergent movies, The O.C._tv and Zachary Levi-Shazam!, Thor:Ragnarok.
This is a true story that is based on a book called 'Guantanamo Diary' written by Mohamedou Ould Slahi, the Mauritanian mentioned in the movie title. The name Mauritanian comes from where he is from, Mauritania-and no, it has no connection to the Star Wars character, The Mandalorian. Tahar plays Slahi, a man that spent years in prison, without ever having been officially accused of a crime. Tahar was brought in for questioning after the 911 attacks and was thought to have had connections to Al Qaeda and the terrorist attacks. Tahar was transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he was held and tortured for years before anyone tried to get him released. Jodie is Tahar's lawyer and Shailene is her assistant, trying to get to the truth. Benedict is the military prosecutor-trying to make sure Tahar gets the lethal injection to avenge his buddy that was on one of the 911 planes-and Zachary was at the 'questioning sessions' of Tahar so he has specific information as to what really happened. It is a compelling story and when the end credits start, you see what happened after the trial and the actual Slahi is shown.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, sexual assault and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it is an interesting story about the events that went on at Guantanamo Bay.",The Mauritanian
20,kevin_robbins,This is an amazing picture that is definitely worth your time.,9,8 September 2021,"The Mauritanian(2021) is a movie my wife and I watched on a Delta flight fairly recently. The storyline follows a man in the middle east during the Taliban uprising shortly after 9/11 asked to help his cousin. He is quickly identified and imprisoned by the American government and put in solitary confinement before he ever does anything. After years of imprisonment a legal team comes to his aid and asks what due process he went through? The US government will be asked some hard questions they aren't prepared to answer. This movie is directed by Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) and stars Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs), Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) and Shailene Woodley (Divergent). The depiction of the circumstances in this are well done and delivered in a very believable manner. I loved how the story unfolds and the chemistry between characters. The justice systems approach and process for these types of activities are unbelievable and also well presented to the audience. The cast is absolutely remarkable and you could easily see both sides of the case and argument. I also loved seeing the real characters during the closing credits.

22,alindsay-al,A Great Film that has been underappreciated by The Academy,8,8 April 2021,"This film has had quite a bit of buzz about it and came to Amazon last week and I have now had a chance to watch it and here is my review for the film The Mauritanian. The premise of the film sees a man attempt to fight for his freedom when he is detained in Guantanamo Bay for years without any charges against him.Main Character
It seems like that 2021 is a very good year for Tahar Rahim. After his brilliant outing in BBC show The Serpent he continues that here with one of the best performances of the year and is a performance that should have gained him an Oscar Nomination. He is fantastic here, despite being accused of terrible things, Rahim does a great job in making you feel sympathy for him and caring about the situation that he has been put in. The film explores plenty of his life and it is a good way to show the man underneath the accusation and that is crucial to the film.Supporting Characters
Jodie Foster plays the main lawyer representing him and she is good also. Her character has a clear arc and progression in this film and Foster does a good job in showing that and the reasons for her defending her client. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the opposition Lawyer and despite a very thick Virginian accent he is also good. The accent is a bit strange at first but it grew on me as the film progressed, I just liked how the parallels of Foster and Cumberbatch's characters affects the story and adds depth to the people that are seen on film. Shailene Woodley and Zachary Levi are also good in their roles and add plenty when they are on screen.Story
The story is really interesting. There are huge questions of morality and right and wrong which is handled in a very mature but interesting way. The characters are great and really well realised by the performers that it makes you care about this interesting real life tale. But I have one issue which hurt the overall film for me and that was the fact the film spends a long time setting up a trial which we barely see. I love courtroom dramas and I would have happily watched another 30 mins to an hour if it made the film a more complete experience.Script
The script is really good, the drama is really well realised and makes you care about the people and the interesting story. But what also surprised me was that this film had little sprinklings of humour and it worked for me with this script maybe also getting ignored of an Oscar nomination.Style
The style of the film is good, it keeps you interested for the majority of the run time and does show the real horrors that happen in this prison and to this man. Though as I said above, I felt like the film could have gone longer and needed a stronger finish. Also this film changes its aspect ratio when in different timelines and I get it for a thematic approach but I just felt it was unnecessary and was a bit jarring.Overall
Overall, The Mauritanian is a great film that should be watched. It has an amazing lead performance and a gripping story and I think this film deserved a bit more recognition from The Academy so don't miss it.",The Mauritanian

Jodie Foster plays his defence attorney and Benedict Cumberbatch as the patriotic prosecutor who realises that this is all being done without any recognition of the law.A fascinating insight into the appalling treatment of individuals held in Guantanamo and how, after 9/11 it was decided by the President and the military to ignore their own laws. The focus is on Slahi's treatment and the determination by the government not to provide any details to Foster's defence team, all in the name of National Security. The disappointment here though is that the official denials process, further controversy and indeed the court hearings are replaced by words of explanation across the screen at the end, which is somewhat anti climactic. Good performance by Foster, with Cumberbatch ok but something of an odd casting choice. The star of the film is Rahim though who is quite exceptional throughout.",The Mauritanian

Well, those people weren't at Guantanamo Bay either so I am entitled to my opinion. I believe this film tells of a tremendous abuse of human rights as thrust upon a man named Mohamadou. His case is among the worst yet certainly not singular. The actor playing Mohamadou is unknown to me but I'm 100% convinced he deserves the Oscar for best actor. He is a tragic figure brought to life exposing the worst of the post 9/11 frenzy for prosecuting suspected terrorists. Do not just see this movie in a vacuum. Read and explore as much as is possible. It will only give more credence to the inexcusable breakdown of The U. S. Constitution and basic Christian values as a feverish frenzy to coerce confessions went to depths none of us can be comfortable with even under the extreme circumstances of the fight against terrorism.This movie moves fairly briskly and is topical, yet it is at times heartbreaking to watch. It makes a case for cleaning up this whole mess of Guantanamo Bay and the larger effort to reign in terrorsm. It is certain we must vigorously pursue the terrorsts yet we must uphold moral values and The Constitution while doing so. In that vein this is an important film that is highly recommended and should be on a short list of Oscar considerations. It is important to note that although often abused and painfully slow justice does often prevail against long odds.",The Mauritanian
27,jadepietro,The Good Fight,8,19 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: Very good acting enhances this true story about injustice.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) stands accused of terrorism and defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and her associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley) fight for his freedom in Kevin McDonald's impassioned but slightly flawed film, The Mauritanian. After being detained and imprisoned without charges in Guantánamo Bay Priso by the U. S. government for years, their case and cover-up finally goes to trial with some surprising turns of events.The Mauritanian is based on a true story and director Kevin McDonald skillfully depicts a series of chain events that led to Slahi's capture and imprisonment. The screenplay by M. B. Traven, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani has some compelling dialog and strong conformational set pieces, but it is a tad choppy with out-of-sequence flashbacks providing his backstory. These scenes tend to slow down the film's pacing and serve more as sub-plot than needed exposition. Whenever the film stays focused on the investigation and its legal maneuverings, the movie excels with its two standout performances by the lead actors.Mr. Rahim is excellent in his well-written part. We watch his strength and disillusion shift and he delivers a harrowing portrayal of man tortured and accused. Ms. Foster is commanding in her no-nonsense role as his crusader, a woman more concerned with the law than her client's morality. Their attorney/client moments together are superb and help to build interest in this legal drama. Both are worthy of award consideration.Some of the supporting characters, while well acted by Shailene Woodley, Zachary Lev, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the prosecuting lawyer, seem stereotypical products of that era of terrorist activities and national paranoia: the gung-ho military soldiers, the liberal-minded defense attorneys, the innocent or not so-innocent client,, the questioning prosecutor, etc. But the basic scenario of injustice rings true and gives moviegoers a gripping drama.Director Mr. McDonald does not shy away from the intense scenes of sound deprivation sexual humiliation, and waterboarding techniques which were a part of his stay there. (The film is not for the squeamish.) To the filmmaker's credit, he also never confirms Slahi's guilt or innocence of the criminal accusations, although he does place the blame for his illegal confinement solely with the US Government. One wishes the film contained more courtroom scenes than investigative ones. This could have shed more light on the case and its characters.The Mauritanian is a strong cinematic plea for tolerance and justice to prevail in our legal system. It is an important film worth viewing.",The Mauritanian
28,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Mauritanian,5,23 May 2021,"The Mauritanian (my latest review) refers to a suspected 9/11 terrorist who spends over a decade in prison without ever being charged with a crime. Frenchman Tahar Rahim plays ""Mauritanian's"" lead in Mohamedou Ould Slahi. Rahim is not a bad actor by any means but his performance here feels a little off. He mugs and shrugs to the camera but there doesn't seem to be a lot of fear in his eyes.So yeah, The Mauritanian as a movie feels a little off as well. It's capably directed, it's good to see Jodie Foster in something again, and some of ""Mauritanian's"" scenes crackle from time to time. But there's not a lot of drama and/or spectacle with The Mauritanian appearing like the film equivalent of a wiki page entry (the ending credits have the need to explain everything). Added to that, ""Mauritanian"" harbors a TV feel and its subject although unforgettable, comes off as aptly dated after twenty years.Fashioning itself as a talky pic, directed by Scot Kevin Macdonald, and somewhat reeking of obviousness, The Mauritanian is about a man who was thought to be one of the chief engineers of tragic 9/11. While being imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, two defense lawyers jump through hoops to try to pursue his freedom. What 2013's Parkland is to Oliver Stone's JFK, The Mauritanian is to Midnight Express and The Hurricane. The latter films in that last sentence are for a better word, superior.In retrospect, The Mauritanian goes through the motions with its chronological storytelling about as facile to follow as paint-by-numbers. Yeah ""Mauritanian"" is based on a true story but its tribute is a tad limp. If not for a few emotive moments courtesy of veteran actress Jodie Foster and some hallucinatory torture clips, the film would've never bothered to haphazardly take off.",The Mauritanian

Indeed, my faith calls it original sin. The difference being, I believe we are all capable of it. But my faith also believes in deliverance and hope, responsibility and the power of redemption.

33,bob-the-movie-man,A dreadful abuse of human rights: a movie to make you angry,8,14 April 2021,"Positives:
I've not read the book so I found the story gripping. As the related legal information is divulged, the movie drip-feeds flashbacks of Slahia's story, which is clever..Acting wise, ""The Mauritanian"" has top notch stuff. Tahir Rahim is excellent as Slahia. He portrays charismatic and confident businessman, brought down to earth with a bump. Not recognizing him with an Oscar nomination feels like a minor crime. He will have to make do with the BAFTA nomination. Also brilliant is Jodie Foster. As the illustrious Mrs Movie Man pointed out, it's so nice to see an actress acting her age with confidence. The ever-watchable Shailene Woodley is also great, especially in a dramatic 'dismissal' scene. She adds some much needed warmth to the legal team. The southern drawl from Cumberbatch is a bit of a surprise and takes some getting used to. But it's still a strong performance from him.After ranting on last time at Zack Snyder's use of 4:3 screen ratios in ""Justice League"", here is an intelligent use of the technique. The film is in 16:9 ratio, but then pivots to 4:3 for all of the Guantanamo flashback scenes, reflecting the claustrophobia of Slahia's position.Real-life footage over the closing titles is absolutely fascinating.Negatives:
I personally didn't find this a particular negative, but I went into the film knowing it to be a ""legal drama"". So there would be lots of scenes, as in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", with courtroom debate and gavel-banging, right? Actually, there is almost none of that. Most of the legal action is in terms of the preparation of the case and the paperwork involved. (If this makes the movie sound excruciatingly dull... think again!)The Guantanamo story ends quite abruptly (with the above-mentioned jolt), and left me wanting to see more of the intervening time. It's not often that I complain about a film running too short, but here is one where just a little of ""the Snyder treatment"" might have been welcomed!Additional Note for the squeamish: For those worried about seeing distressing scenes of torture (e.g. Fingernail extraction, etc), these are - although disturbing - more of the ""psychological torment"" type. So those of a squeamish disposition can still watch this one.Summary Thoughts:
The fact that ""The Mauritanian"" is a true story hammers home just what the US has been up to over the last 20 years. War crimes are not only committed on the battlefield.Director Kevin Macdonald is no stranger to documentaries (""Touching the Void"", ""Whitney""). He's also proved adept at bringing gripping true stories to the screen (having previously given us ""The Last King of Scotland""). Here, the emotional journeys of the key characters are well observed making the movie 'highly recommended'.(For the full graphical content - and a few more controversial comments! - please check out the post on One Mann's Movies... via the web or Facebook.

A Mauritanian was accused by the US government as being an instrumental part of 9/11, and held in a prison without any charges for years. Now a lawyer seek to defend him while another military lawyer seek to prosecute him.This genre is one of my favorites because it was just shocking and incredible how corrupted the government or big organizations were in the past. The movie Spotlight, for me was the best of this genre.This film, although not as good as Spotlight or others, still successfully conveyed the horrendous corruption of the US government in the past. The star of the show was not Jodie or Benedict as the lawyers, but it was Tahar Rahim as the Mauritanian. He was very likable and charismatic. Although being badly tortured, he still cracked jokes and made American show references. Because I cared for him, I wanted justice for him even more, and felt dismayed at what he had to go through.As for problems, even though the story delivered the message, the plot was told in a predictable way. The first half's pacing was slow and somewhat boring. Only when the audience knew more about the Mauritanian that the movie became much better.Overall, despite the predictable storytelling and pacing problem, Rahim's great portrayal of the Mauritanian brought heart to the movie and also reflected the common theme of corruption and torture by the US government. 8/10",The Mauritanian
36,tm-sheehan,Great performances exposing a shameful chapter in Amer,8,27 March 2021,"My Review- The MauritanianMy Rating 8/10I was thrilled to see Jody Foster win this year's Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Nancy Hollander a defense attorney, who with her associate and a military prosecutor uncover a far-
reaching conspiracy while investigating the case of a suspected 9/11 terrorist imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for six years.Jody Foster is one of the finest Actor/director Producers in Cinema today and I hope we will see more film and television projects from her in the future.The movies Star Actor Tahar Rahim as Mohamedou Ould Salahi the suspected terrorist was also nominated but missed out on a win to Chadwick Boseman, in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom a sentimental win for the deceased actor that will probably be duplicated at all the major awards this year. I have to question a sentimental Award which is a wonderful tribute but when far worthier performances are ignored like Anthony Hopkins and Tahar Rahim's it's disappointing.The Mauritanian is also nominated for 5 BAFTA Awards including Best Film of 2021 Best British Film , Best Actor ,Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography.So the question in many cinema goers and most movie publications including variety is why was this movie totally snubbed by The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.?Could it be for Political reasons as this is based on true events and concerns a suspected Muslim terrorist imprisoned at the notorious Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp.The film follows Mohamedou Ould Salahi (Rahim), who is captured by the U. S. government and is languishing in Guantanamo Bay detention camp without charge or trial. Losing all hope, Salahi finds allies in defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Foster) and her associate Teri Duncan (Woodley). Together, they face countless obstacles in a desperate pursuit for justice. Their controversial advocacy, along with fabricated evidence uncovered by formidable military prosecutor, Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch (Cumberbatch), eventually reveals a shocking and far-reaching conspiracy.Despite playing a Mauritanian, Tahar Rahim is of Algerian descent he gives a fine performance in a very challenging and difficult role .Benedict Cumberbatch gives his usual fine performance as the Colonel who says he would personally administer the lethal injection to Mohamedou if he was guilty until he uncovers corruption and coercion to obtain false confessions and decides to drop the case .The Mauritanian isn't a fast paced film at 2hours 10 minutes long but it covers a part of American history that is more than regrettable it was inhumane and the depictions of Government sanctioned torture to elicit confessions from the inmates of Guantanamo Bay many who were innocent as been verified as fact not fiction.Jodie Foster and Tahar Rahim both deserve Oscar Nominations in my opinion there are films and performances that have received nominations that they just don't deserve .Of course this happens every year but to totally snub a film because of its unpalatable and shameful subject I think is another form of censorship .",The Mauritanian

The real-life story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi was obviously unknown to me at the time of this viewing, but The Mauritanian does a great job in telling his shocking, insane, unbelievable life at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The existence of this outside-the-law prison still baffles me to this day. Two decades into the XXI century and humanity still finds a way of immorally and illegally destroying the most basic of human rights.Kevin Macdonald, a director who's probably more recognized for his documentaries than his feature films, offers a straightforward adaptation of the protagonist's memoir, focusing on the main narrative without letting too much of the typical Hollywood melodrama get its generic, diminishing share. It follows the usual formula when it comes to this type of movie, and its technical attributes aren't distractingly flashy or overwhelming, which might be the best compliment I have to give The Mauritanian. Its story alone is interesting enough, so I deeply appreciate that Macdonald used his doc-experience to produce this film since it could have easily been a regular documentary - and in some ways, it's very similar to one.The screenplay written by M.B. Traven, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani is quite captivating throughout most of the runtime, but it does lose a bit of steam due to some unnecessary, unimpactful sequences. During many moments, the writers and Macdonald make their point come across efficiently, but these scenes keep going for a few extra minutes that don't really add anything new to the story, the characters, or the atmosphere. Despite the main narrative being about Slahi, these subplots involving secondary characters are far from being remotely interesting. If not for an always captivating Benedict Cumberbatch and a charming Shailene Woodley, some of these storylines could have hurt the movie a lot more.One of the most important moments of the film occurs at the beginning of the third act. While it's vital for the audience to experience the same horrors that Slahi did, this overlong sequence goes from purely shocking to genuinely uncomfortable to the point of some viewers actually skipping the whole thing. It falls into the issue above of not knowing when to end a scene, extending it too much, consequently increasing the already substantial runtime. Nevertheless, I remained wholly concentrated on the central story, which is partially due to the outstanding performances from Jodie Foster and especially Tahar Rahim.The former delivers a truly remarkable display by interpreting Nancy Hollander, a lawyer who raises the most common moral dilemma in the respective area of profession. Does everyone - literally everyone - deserve the same human rights? Or are there exceptions, such as terrorists or rapists? Foster beautifully incorporates that challenging task of defending someone who 99.9% of the world would refuse to even talk to, let alone risk their life and reputation to defend him. However, in the end, it's Rahim's award-worthy, emotionally powerful physical performance that steals the spotlight. From his look of desperation to his never-ending hope that justice would be made, it's impossible not to feel for Slahi and root for his freedom.The Mauritanian is one of those ""based on true events"" movies that will remain in my memory for quite some time. The must-watch, shocking, real-life story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who received unbelievably unfair, immoral, and illegal treatment by the U.S. government, is told through a formulaic yet efficient screenplay, placing the spotlight on Tahar Rahim's exceptional, award-worthy performance. Kevin Macdonald employs non-distracting storytelling and filmmaking methods, allowing the main focus to be on Slahi himself instead of flashy visuals or weird camera work. Despite being mostly successful in this attempt, it still loses some of its energy and overall interest by overextending irrelevant scenes featuring secondary characters. Jodie Foster also delivers an incredibly captivating interpretation of a lawyer who never gives up on her own principles and morals. It might follow the generic structure of other films in the genre, but it accomplishes its mission of bringing this story into the world without any restraints. I recommend it but beware of a violent and long torture sequence that could bother some of the more sensitive viewers.Rating: B-",The Mauritanian

40,ronakkotian,Not that special but it's a decent political thriller,7,3 April 2021,"The stunning cast made me want to check this film out and whilst I think it's good, it's not particularly special.The Mauritanian is about Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a suspected 9/11 terrorist fighting for freedom as he gets detained and imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay.With The Mauritanian, we get another political thriller that reveals some shocking material. It was fairly intriguing all the way through learning about this man and all the trouble he experienced. What makes this film truly shine is Tahar Rahim as Mohamedou Slahi. I've never seen him before but this performance alone shows me the talent he possesses. He's very convincing and charismatic as this person and I liked how the film played with the question of whether he was guilty or not. He excels especially during the final act where he delivers a monologue beautifully as well as during the torture scenes that were hard to watch. I liked some of the visual choices Kevin Macdonald made. The 4:3 aspect ratio where we see Slahi's life at Guantanamo Bay was effective in making the location claustrophobic and tense. The production design was well done and the editing of the torture scenes managed to make me feel uneasy. However, I do think the film's pacing could have been improved. It went too slow at times making the film lose its thrill at certain points.The rest of the performances were also great. It's nice to see Jodie Foster after a long time and she does a great job as Slahi's lawyer. Shailene Woodley was also good but I wish there was more to her role. Benedict Cumberbatch was good although I was constantly distracted by his accent. I've known Zachary Levi for his comedic roles like Shazam so I like how he played a more serious character here.The story is ordinary and something that we've seen many times in the past and the film doesn't take many risks to make it stand out from the rest. It's a decent political thriller with solid performances especially from Rahim.",The Mauritanian
41,latinfineart,An exceptional film,9,23 April 2021,"One of the truly extraordinary aspects of this film is how it lays out the extraordinary guilt and shame of the Bush Administration. Rather than go after our true enemies, they picked easy targets.And Obama could have easily turned around the vast moral regression of the Bush Administration by shutting down Gitmo, by releasing prisoners who could not be convicted, and by attempting to right the wrongs of George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, Condaleeza Rice, and these other men and women who were completely lacking in morality, ethics, compassion, decency, honor, nobility and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong.We all wanted some retribution after 9/11, however just randomly picking scapegoats was not the answer. It shows how broken America has become. It shows how morally bankrupt the culture is, and it shows how corrupted it became by a small group of totally misguided men and women. Were the results worth the transgressions? Of course not. That this house of fools and zealots was never held to account, will go down as true revisionist history.The film itself is extraordinary. It is not an easy film to watch, it is a tough subject, but one that needs to be told.Kudos to the entire crew for such an extraordinary job.",The Mauritanian
42,danielmanson,Brilliant story and film,8,3 July 2021,"To start, I have to say that I knew absolutely nothing about this true story at all, so I was going into it completely blind and watching from a entertainment standpoint and I have to say this was an excellent film.The story itself had me on edge the entire time and I was so curious to know what happens next and how this is going to end. And it was just very very interesting, both from a general storyline point and knowing it's a true story.What was really standout for me was the characters. The acting from everyone involved was absolutely superb, but the arcs and the development of them were so good to watch.Only negative I have to offer really is that I found the random scenes when he's being tortured really jarring, I know that's probably what they are going for, but I was just too overly confused by them and they didn't make any sort of sense to me. Felt like it was being too over the top and too weird.But overall this is a very good film and for an Amazon exclusive I thought this was top notch, hidden gem this film and I would highly recommend if you are debating watching this one!",The Mauritanian
43,PyroSikTh,Fantastic Performances. Ineffective Narrative,7,23 April 2021,"The Mauritanian follows the true life story of Mohamedou Slahi, a Mauritanian national who had ties to Al Qaeda through the Afghan war and his extremist cousin, who was picked up from his home and muscled off to Guantanamo Bay with no charge, and held and tortured over the course of fourteen years. Enter activist lawyer Nancy Hollander who made it her mission to help Slahi find legal justice by the code of the US justice system, innocent or otherwise. The film is largely split into two parts. The main thrust of the story is the legal wrangling Hollander had to go through in order to fully represent Slahi at trial. Interwoven with this is Colonel Stuart Couch who was picked to prosecute the trial, but surprisingly found his own issues in obtaining the necessary documents. The US Administration was perfectly content in staging a sham trial and keeping Slahi detained for indefinite periods of time. Either that or they genuinely believed the ""damning"" evidence they had was enough for a legal conviction. The second part of the story is told through extended flashbacks as we follow Slahi's experiences at Guantanamo Bay, including interactions he had with a fellow cellmate and the unspeakable torture he suffered for months on end. Unfortunately this divide between the two plots often creates pacing issues between them. The aspect ratio handily changes so we can easily tell which story we're watching, but what starts of feeling like flashbacks often goes on and on for large portions of the movie, derailing the Hollander storyline entirely.While the story The Mauritanian wants to tell is a very important one to make people (especially Americans) aware of, it's a story that was already covered in almost the exact same way by The Report. Of course I'm not suggesting we can't have two movies about the same things, but it brings up an interesting comparison point. The Report was about the journalistic and political uncovering of the torture, while The Mauritanian is about one man's experience specifically, and the legal wrangling surrounding him. The Report is cold, emotionless, and a little dry in its portrayals of the facts, whereas The Mauritanian is more emotionally charged and not altogether bothered with facts and figures. Either way, if one impacted you, the other is less likely to do so simply because there isn't much new in The Mauritanian. I mean hell, even the building Daniel Jones and Nancy Hollander are allowed to research classified documents in looks the exact same. It would be an interesting experiment to splice the two movies together to see if a more fulfilling experience comes out of it.While The Report was possibly too cold and detached to make enough of an impact, The Mauritanian gets us going by focussing on Slahi and developing his character. He's a charming and jokey guy who doesn't fully understand the predicament he's in until it's too late. It's easy to like the guy and root for him, and makes his eventual torture hit even harder. However the movie also makes a conscious decision to keep his guilt ambiguous. The evidence they have against him probably won't hold up in a court of law, but it is compelling nonetheless. He took multiple calls from his cousin using Osama Bin Laden's phone and wiped his contact list when he was first detained, was pointed out by a confirmed terrorist as a recruiter, and had spent time with Al Qaeda in the 90s when they were backed and supported by the US government. It's easy to see why the CIA came to the conclusion of his complicity in 9/11, and the movie makes no effort to refute those conclusions either.This movie also doesn't make a particularly big point of the torture either. There is a lengthy flashback to it later on, with probably the most true to life depictions of the methods used, including Halloween masks, fake scenarios, and even sexual humiliation by female soldiers. However the bulk of the flashbacks dwell on his early interrogations by the CIA where he was just asked the same questions over and over again, something we've seen a million times in a million different movies and TV shows. Much of the abuse is implied rather than shown, which is a problem when what we're shown is basically just a high security prison environment. They got a mattress, a loo, were given books to read, and even had time outside to pray and take in the sunlight/fresh air. Couch points out the hooks on the ceiling and walls of each cell, but the only implication as to their use is through dialogue. Show don't tell.There are other narrative choices I wasn't sure about either. The whole Hollander plotline hinges on how the torture Slahi suffered invalidated any and all of his confessions, building up to a courtroom climax. But the climax never comes. Instead Slahi gives an impassioned speech about forgiveness over video chat, and then we cut away without any mention of torture of what impact it had on his trial. We next cut to him receiving a letter telling him he won his court case and his infectious joy and happiness at finally being free. Then it cuts to black and we're told that this ruling was appealed and Slahi spent a further seven years in confinement without charge. While I liked the very sudden way the tables turned, it felt a bit lazy in just explaining this part of the story away. If the film had cut out a whole bunch of the early CIA interrogations (which added nothing), they would've had the runtime left over to properly develop this final twist to the story.It's also worth noting that while Hollander is made out to be the main thrust of the movie's plot, she doesn't really have a whole lot to do either. Her arc is interesting, taking her from cold and to the letter of the law; seeking nothing but proper due process, all the way to feeling an emotional connection for Slahi and viewing him as a real human who has been robbed of his freedom. Other than that, all she does is spend the majority of the movie complaining that the government won't give her the unredacted documents she needs. Couch's side of this story is much more interesting though, with a personal connection to one of the pilots killed in the attacks, as well as the ones who keep blocking the due process Slahi is owed. He becomes torn between his own personal thirst for justice at all costs, and a duty to do his job to the best of his ability, slowly coming to the realisation that maybe he's on the wrong side.One area in which this movie doesn't falter though is the acting. Jodie Foster is as fantastic as ever, giving Hollander's arc all the weight it needs despite the somewhat lacking writing. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a pretty great performance too, marred only by his questionable American accent, and it was definitely interesting to see Zachary Levi in an antagonistic role. However the film his held on the shoulders of Tahar Rahim as Slahi, who gives the character all the charisma required to make us root for the guy despite his questionable associations. Added bonus is the footage of the real Slahi at the end, which felt like the same character Rahim managed to tap into perfectly. Despite everything that had happened to him, he still seemed like a fun and down-to-earth guy, which Rahim managed to maintain through every scene.The Mauritanian is another flawed look at the events that transpired at Guantanamo Bay, and presumably still go on to this day. There are still forty prisoners held there, and god only knows what they endure and how long they've been there for. Where The Report only cared about the facts, The Mauritanian takes a much more humanitarian approach, which would've been far more effective had it not been for its narrative missteps. I give this movie an effective 7/10.",The Mauritanian
44,sweidman-28016,Solid Movie,7,9 March 2021,"""It doesn't matter what we believe. What matters is what we can prove.""The Mauritanian is the true story about Mohamedou Ould Salahi as he fights for freedom after being detained and imprisoned without charge by the U.S. Government for years. With the Golden Globes honoring the movie with one win and a nomination, my expectations heightened slightly. Beforehand, this looked something similar to The Report to me. The story seemed important but the execution felt nothing too spectacular where I forgot about it almost instantly. The Mauritanian surprised me with how well it differentiated from that typical style like I discussed with The Report. Kevin Macdonald has made a few notable movies in the past, but I've only seen How I Live Now, something hardly anyone has heard of or watched. He has a clear cut approach from the two I've seen. As a thriller, I did feel that intensity throughout. This is mainly from the harshness to it. Mohamedou has his own sequences where we see the horrible treatment he endured. The technicalities of these scenes are spot on. The cinematography caught my eye especially. There's an aspect ratio change and a filter over it so we, as an audience, feel this extreme intensity.Tahar Rahim is really good in this and definitely deserved that nomination. I would like to see more of his past work to see what has lead to this. Jodie Foster won the Globe which surprised everyone. I can confirm that she is good in this. There are a few scenes that show she hasn't lost her talents. The last thing I saw her in was Hotel Artemis. Though it may have flopped, she still is good. The acting is what makes this movie good. Even with all that talent, some characters feel wasted. Benedict Cumberbatch has a side plot as a prosecuting attorney, but there's not enough to it. They try and make it conflicting for him to prosecute this man, but we hardly know anything about him. And there are quite a few scenes with him, though all spread out, and it just took away from the movie as a whole. Some of that happens with Shailene Woodley. She feels more like a cameo, much like Cumberbatch, even though she is good. Structurally, it can be messy. Where it works is with Tahar Rahim, but with the other characters it feels like they just jabbed this story in for some change. Overall, this movie does good in showcasing this important story. With the 20th anniversary of 9/11 coming up, this comes out at a good time. The Mauritanian delivers what it needs to, even if it overstays its welcome and could use a little work. Most will like this and I would recommend that $19.99 rent.",The Mauritanian

We see his initial gentler interrogation and his later ""enhanced interrogation,"" i.e., torture later during which he ""confesses.""Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) is a human rights lawyer who takes up Slahi's case even though she initially believes he might be guilty because everyone deserves a fair legal process.

Over an extended period, both Hollander and Couch learn the true state under which the Slahi's confessions were obtained. Slahi was eventually released after 14 years without ever being charged.This is a very moving film experience. Some of the torture scenes, although not overly graphic, are hard to watch. Some reviewers have found ""The Mauritanian"" to be emotionally manipulative. However, I resonated with the film's message and cried several times by the end.

49,fciocca,"Slow but effective buildup, wonderful editing. An excruciating but important story that needed to be told.",8,26 July 2021,"What happened in Guantanamo after the 9/11 is no secret for a long time now. Many books and documentaries have explained horrible tortures made in that place. This movie brings to the spotlight these barbaric practices made by american soldiers to people that basically were not charged. Clearly the prevention policy from the American Government failed greatly and we saw results through the years. Coerced proofs and confessions, that in most cases, did not solve anything.The movie builds up slowly. It shows Nancy Hollander, a lawyer firmly convinced to defend Slahi, in this battle against the government. Jodie Foster showed a lot of passion for this role and she was extremely convincing, great performance. The resemblance with the real person is stunning. Same for Tahar Rahim. He was able to portray the suffering that this guy lived for 14 years, forced into any kind of abuse. I really wonder how someone can go back to his life after this experience. I am not able to even conceive it. He was able to carry a lot of different emotions, and you could see the discomfort in his eyes, the pain in his facial expressions. Not a lot of actors are able to transmit so much. He definitely needs to be praised for this part. On the other side we find Stuart Coach, played by the very talented Benedict Cumberbatch. In general the cast is good, except for Shailene Woodley, that confirmed once again to be a terrible actress. For the whole movie she had the exact same face. Luckily she was just a side character that had very little screen time.Whoever edited this movie, did a wonderful job. Some scenes made me feel uneasy and perfectly simulated the disorientation and the confusion that Mohamedou felt during torture. Quick cuts, flashing lights, hallucinations shot with anamorphic lenses are just some of the very effective techniques used. There was a clear and cohesive idea of what this movie was supposed to be. For sure one of the best edits of this year. ""The Mauritan"", is not an easy watch, and I felt uncomfortable many times.

52,movieman6-413-929510,Tough sad battle against a corrupt system.,7,28 June 2021,"The Mauritanian is a new drama thriller directed by Kevin Macdonald, the director of The Last King of Scotland. The film is based on the true story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi.In the film, Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) is being held in Guantanamo Bay by the US government, who suspect him of involvement in the 9/11 attack. With the help of lawyer Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and her assistant Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley), he tries to bring justice. For this, they have to play a difficult game against the US government and military, who sometimes work against them in corrupt ways. During this investigation, they learn about the dark activities taking place in Guantanamo Bay, and Nancy Hollander wants to put an end to this if she can get enough strong evidence.This film is mainly about the dark American history of what they did to certain prisoners and terrorists in Guantanamo Bay. This subject has been brought up in films before, but was often told from the point of view of investigating officers. The special thing about this film is that it is told more from the prisoner's point of view. This shows how the prisoners were treated here. From guards who deal kindly with prisoners in the hope of gaining their trust and so that they can be manipulated more easily later, to soldiers who deal with them more harshly. This film does contain some violent scenes, which are not so pleasant to watch. Despite all these awkward actions, Tahar Rahim remains the bright spot of the film, as despite everything that happens to his character, he tries to stay positive.The storytelling is done in a way that takes some getting used to, because it actually consists more of a flashback of what happened to Mohamedou. He writes all his events in letters to his lawyer, hoping to prove her innocence, even though other Americans now see her as a traitor for helping a possible terrorist. This creates a close bond between the two who seem to be going up against the rest of the world.The acting is well done by the film cast. Tahar Rahim gets the chance with this film to show what a good actor he is. Before this, he has played more in French films or only had small roles in Hollywood films. Despite playing a supporting role, Jodie Foster also gets another chance to come out on top in a movie. Together they manage to overshadow the rest of the film cast.",The Mauritanian

I would say that this story shocks me, but by now, I have no doubts of the depths the USA have sunk to.Following the detainment and subsequent interrogation of a man implicated in recruitment for the 9/11 attacks, ""The Mauritanian"" looks at both the prosecution and the defense, fixating on the lengths the US have gone to silencing such a fugitive.This is a film that is more about the story than the players, so the acting was only required to make the narrative believable. Jodie Foster and Tahar Rahim are both decent, but Benedict Cumberbatch felt surplus to requirement (given he didn't look like his character or have any unique qualities to justify his selection above an American).Set-wise, Cape Town was transformed to represent Guantanamo, doing a good job of creating a stark contrast between the hostility of the prison against the rolling sea only metres away. I enjoyed the repetitive, claustrophobic soundtrack as well (clearly added to contribute to the tension), but still felt the hard-hitting stuff should have taken up a larger portion of the film.""The Mauritanian"" is adapted from a bestselling biography, and it's not hard to imagine why - this story is as harrowing as it is damning.What vexed me most was the news that accompanies the credits: that there are almost 800 people who experienced the same abysmal treatment, some of which are still having their human rights violated by a country that holds everyone else to higher standards than it does its own patrons.",The Mauritanian

A shy and somewhat shady person at first, but ultimately turns out to be an exceptional soul, forgiving and understanding despite the absolutely horrendous and unjust things that have been done to him.I am slightly puzzled as to why, despite it being nominated for both the Golden Globes and Baftas, that it had zero nominations at the Oscars. Could it be that it was too critical of what the US government had done?After all, there was another film that was heavily nominated a few years back, a film called Zero Dark Thirty, which dealt with similar themes. Only in that film, the torture the CIA used on suspects to find and kill Osama Bin Laden was seen as total justification, in order to catch the terrorist. Which apparently never happened in real life.Hollander and Couch are repeatedly given lacklustre and redacted information about Slahi's detainment. When they find out the truth from Slahi's own words, they are overwhelmed. The government not only coerced a forced confession through torture but also covered it up on a massive scale. Things like this are happening all over the place, and it needs to be stopped.Overall, however, the film is about one man, strong and faithful, fighting to be free. He is incredibly admirable and inspiring.",The Mauritanian

I'm always impressed when British actors do a convincing American accent but Benedict did an amazing southern accent. Personally I think Shailene Woodley is a horrible actress who always comes across as whiny & shrill. Jodie Foster was awesome but that's no surprise. I first saw Tahar Rahim in The Looming Tower, then I saw his amazing portrayal of a twisted serial killer in The Serpent. In The Mauritanian Tahar steals the show as an innocent man who spent fourteen years at GITMO being tortured & abused while never being charged with any crimes.

Something I really liked was the changing of perspectives from Nancy Hollander to Stuart Couch to Mohamedou. With each perspective you get a good sense of their point of view and how each one is feeling as the story progresses. Most of it stays cloudy until the end, but it makes for a compelling and gripping story that makes you want to know more.
The run time dragged a bit making the two hour duration of the movie feel more like 3, but the performances of Tahar Rahim and Jodie Foster, along with a super captivating story keep you well grounded.

There are powerful stories that must be told properly to help avoid the causes. Read an article called ""A Guantanamo Guard And His Detainee Reunite"", or Swallow the Cumberbatch/Foster narrative that is almost gag-worthy.
I do not recommend this film. You've seen the same false narrative many times before from Hollywood. I propose that the reason we don't learn from our past is because of the Cumberbatch/Foster conundrum: promote a false narrative and wonder why we end up at the same destination when we learn nothing. I I give three stars for the performance of Tahar Rahim - the only performance worth praising.

71,douglasmcbroom,Fruit Of The Poisonous Tree,7,2 September 2021,"I could write pages on the legal and political aspects of this film, but this is a film review, not legal/political commentary. I have no problems with 'enhanced interrogation', under exigent circumstances, wherein the information is more important than any future legal case. This is where the US Government did not think this through. Once 'enhanced interrogation' was authorized, a legal case in a US court of law, was no longer possible. All evidence obtained was inadmissible. I could see from the circumstantial evidence how the government was very interested in Slahi: Phone calls from bin Laden's mobile; money transfers from a close relative working with bin Laden; Germany was a hotbed of activity surrounding 9/11; and, a high-profile witness who put Slahi in the soup. But, the system was set up to break prisoners and obtain confessions. The system was never designed to actually bring the accused to trial. It is also very important to note that, in spite of all of the outrages against Slahi, perpetrated by both the Bush and Obama/Biden administrations, once the case got into a court of law, the justice system worked.The film drags and is about 30 minutes too long. The last third of the film picks up the pace and finishes smartly. Director Kevin Macdonald does a very credible job of laying the convoluted story out, whilst still providing drama. Tamar Rahim is nothing short of outstanding. Oscar nominated stuff. Jodie Foster is also good, as she tackles the role of an ice-cold attorney who warms to her client.

What should have been gripping was actually deathly dull due to the uninteresting context of the plot: man gets captured, incorrectly serves a very long sentence that a group of unconvincing lawyers manage to quash after what seems like a hundred years.Is that even a success, or movie worthy?So much went on during this historical period of time and people definitely need to know about it, yet this movie is about pretty much nothing.",The Mauritanian

You can see both sides in this.Also the production companies. BBC films. Just like them to use taxpayers money in a critically acclaimed money sink. Stx films, the Chinese company? This is odd. Though they have been involved in a lot of duds it is good to see them involved in a good movie but to what ends? A Chinese company seeing the Americans as evil aggressors? I wonder if they will be making a movie about the torture camps in China of which there are many. Not just one on an Island, hundreds of thousands of their own populous interned and tortured. I had a look and no such expose from Stx films is being produced by them. Which is interesting to note. Most people look at the singular notion of one man or even 800 men in a camp.

Facilities like Guantanamo came up for this. This is the real story of MA Slahi who was picked up and interrogated ruthlessly without being charged for any crime for years in order to break him down and make him confess . It is his fight against the establishment so that he can retain his dignity and sanity in the face of sustained physical and mental torture. It speaks of the triumph of the human spirit against injustice.A taut, brilliant screenplay with excellent direction by Kevin Macdonald gives opportunity to Jodie Foster (defense attorney ) and to Tahar Rahim ( Detainee Slahi) to give us award winning performances. BTW the Golden Globe award to Jodie Foster was for supporting actress, which leads me to believe that Rahim who plays the protagonist equally deserved the best actor award. ( In fact he was nominated for Best Actor in the Golden Globes ). Both actors successfully get under the skin of the characters. While on performances, Benedict Cumberbatch plays the military prosecutor with sincerity, while it was sad to see Shailene Woodely wasted in a clearly underdeveloped role as Jodie's deputy.The film remains gripping most of the time and Tahar Rahim must take credit for making it look authentic.

What happened to Mohamedou Slahi is not something any of us wants to experience. I am also glad that I do not have to live in a country where exactly what we see here happens. The law is trampled on, people are mistreated just so that a scapegoat can be found. As terrible as the horrible acts of 11 September are, the reaction of some people to them has been terrifying.

With its such heavy subject this film could've been so hard to watch and straight up boring. But The Mauritanian manage to make it 'enjoyable' with some little humor here and there makes it far more entertaining, although there's some viewers discreation (torture, assault, etc).They give each side (kinda) the benefit of the doubt, and took you to a journey of who's right and who's wrong. I like the way they portrayed Mohamedou and Nancy, Tahar Rahim and Jodie Foster did an extremely well done job. Finger crossed both of them got an Oscar noms. Also one thing worth noticing is the cinematography, i really like the different dimensions between the past and present. It's a very nice touch.BUT, this film is not perfect by any means.

88,blackoutH,Terrorism is a matter of perspective,7,25 August 2021,"It continues to sadden me the horrific stories about how American government agencies that were supposedly created to protect their nationals commit such inhuman atrocities every single day most of them being forgotten without any punishment.I am not an American national but I can understand how the events of 9/11 shocked an entire country and struck fear in everyone's hearts, problem is when fear kicks in rationality goes out the window.There seem to be no limits to US agencies actions when it comes to pursue their interests, the ends always justify the means, even if in the process they start to become very similar to what they claim to hate - terrorists.I can't even imagine what it would be like to be innocent yet still be placed in jail for years and being tortured on a daily basis, and this is happening in plain sight, in one of ""most developed"" countries in the world, how this stuff continues to happen is completely out of my understanding.As for the movie itself, I saw some other depictions of the topic like ""The Report"" and I believe that the Mauritian doesn't do such a good job, for starters it feels ""less real"" the whole editing and directing feels too much like a movie, it moves slowly and a lot of the scenes don't seem to add much to the story.Although there are some heavy weight actors there and as always Benedict delivers, Jodie Foster seems kind of blend and with a forgettable performance on this one.Also one thing that bothers me is, although the main message is ""guilty until proven innocent"" and that everyone deserves to be defended and cannot simply be put in jail without proof, at the same time it's never made completely clear in the movie that the main suspect is indeed innocent, I am not sure if this is made on purpose and in real life it's the same, but for some reason that makes it have less impactful than the Report for instance.Still what he went through is still horrible and no human being should ever be subjected to such treatment, because if he is indeed innocent you might just have broken an individual or worse, if he wasn't a criminal before he might become one as we've seen in so many other stories, yet I am afraid nothing will change...",The Mauritanian

90,severindringel,"Bland approach, but an important story about injustice with Tahar Rahim's finest hour",7,7 April 2021,"Political thrillers and Kevin MacDonald - it just fits! Some fourteen years after The Last King of Scotland, the British director is now attracting attention with the top-cast The Mauritanian. The film tells the tale of woe of Mauritanian Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was held without charge for years in the controversial Guantanamo detention centre and was traded as a 9/11 recruiter.As mentioned above, the film boasts a cast full of big names. Jodie Foster plays Mohamedou's lawyer Nancy Hollander, who takes on the case without being aware or certain of his guilt or innocence. At first Foster seems a little absent and apathetic in the role. She flashes her skills in the last third of the film, when she goes from being the dry-as-dust pragmatist to the emotional support of her client. Above all, her scenes with Tahar Rahim, who embodies the protagonist Mohamadou, bristle with great chemistry and emotional connection. Rahim is the revelation of the film. His acting is mysterious at first, leaving someone who doesn't know the real story in the dark. From the second act onwards, his performance is filled with emotion, heartbreak and cynicism. Rahim throws himself into scenes that are insanely hard to watch and it seems unimaginable that even an actor would take on such. From this point on, at the latest, all sympathies are on the protagonist's side and Rahim transports this brilliantly into a passionate speech in the film's finale. Despite all the seriousness and brutality, his dialogues with actual enemies in particular are sometimes enormously witty and sarcastic, which rounds off his multifaceted performance brilliantly. While Foster and Rahim shine, Benedict Cumberbatch as the initial antagonist Stuart Couch and Shailene Woodley as paralegal Teri Duncan look a little down the tube. Woodley's character is hugely underused, underdeveloped and represents every cliché. Cumberbatch does his best, but his character is somewhat mis-written. Also, Cumberbatch fake dialect is as authentic as an Adam Sandler movie.MacDonald doesn't necessarily manage to tell an original story here. We've seen all of this a zillion times before, which is very noticeable in the first half of the film. The approach seems very generic and drags on immensely. Often you don't even know exactly what's going on now and due to the opaque editing it's sometimes even difficult to make out the time in which a scene takes place. As soon as Rahim and Foster raise their game, the quality of the film improves considerably. The last act is suspenseful and then even presses the tear-jerker. Here it also becomes clear what message MacDonald wants to send: the effects of injustice on a victim who always keeps his head up despite all the taunts. Rahim's charismatic performance is the absolute highlight of the film and ultimately makes The Mauritanian a worthy narrative of a thoroughly important event.

94,j-madej,The Mauritanian is an imperfect movie helped by nearly perfect performance by Tahar Rahim,7,27 June 2021,"Sometimes the performance of the lead actor can be so captivating, that it not only outshines the other cast members, but it also casts shadow over film in itself. Filmmaking as an art form is a combination of many parts and the best movies work in tandem, with all the filmmaking departments. If one or more departments isn't fully working, we might notice that something in the film structure feels uneven. More so then not, the problem is narrative, where you feel that some characters have a paper thin objectives, and we don't fully buy their motivation, or how they express it. It isn't quite what you would call a bad acting, its perhaps their performance feels little forced, next to someone that basically steals every scene they are part of.As an actor it is even bigger challenge for your performance, to act as a real life character, if it happens that the story you are trying to tell is actually based on true story.How do you approach this type of role? Are you trying to externalize the characters behavior and pick up their mannerisms, or you are focusing on the internal understanding of who that person truly is and what motivates them.If you are approaching performance externally, you are running a risk of building a caricature of the actual person and you will miss the most vital component, which pulls the audience in, as they are watching your performance evolve. I am not bashing different approaches to acting, internal vs external. I am only postulating, that if you need to play a real life person, try to understand what is the inner make up of that individual, so you yourself can build a performance, that has a clear inner depth behind it, which will propel your performance. Basically, if you have done your homework right, your subconscious mind will eventually take over and you will cross the line between acting and being the character.The subject of 'The Mauritanian' is rather controversial one and it deals with infamous real life story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, the Mauritanian national who was accused of helping 9/11 terrorist. He was healed in ""Guantánamo Bay"" for almost 15 years. Half of that time without a trial.The film is loosely based on the book ""Guantánamo Diary"" which are compilation of his letters to his attorney Nancy Hollander played by Judie Foster. As he fights for freedom, after being detained and imprisoned without charge. With the help of Hollander and her right hand Teri Duncan played by Shailene Woodley, both ladies try to find truth, in an otherwise convoluted Top Secret investigation, which leads them to sue the government of the United States for unlawful detainment, torture and all around treatment of the detainees at the infamous Guantanamo Base in Cuba.Fosters performance feels solid, but as funny as it might sound we might feel little distracted by the wig she is wearing and once you start paying attention to this type of external nuances, it can take you out of the movie.Benedict Cumberbatch as Stuart Couch is a high ranked Marine, who is being groomed to lead an investigation in the prosecution of Ould Slahi. He has a clear motivation having close friend who was killed on 9/11, to make sure that at least someone will pay for the death of around 3000 people on that frightful day. His character starts from the position of confirmation bias, but slowly starts to understand that the evidence presented to him about the guilt of Ould Slahi, are circumstantial at best and as the film progresses, we find out that are obtained through means of torture, which changes his view point on the whole situation.There is an old saying 'One persons terrorist is another persons freedom fighter""
I will not get here too deep in to the plot, focusing more on the actual performances of the principals.In many ways 'The Mauritanian' is an imperfect movie, saved by very good performance by Tahar Rahim, who's talent previously has already been noticed in 'A Prophet' and Netflix's 'The Serpent' among other roles. He has a fantastic ability to bring duality in to his performances and is able to build report with the audience, where we tend to feel sympathy for the characters he portraits. You could call it charisma, but there is more to it then that. In his performance as Mohamedou Ould Slahi he is leaving us not hundred percent sure if he is indeed guilty, or just a victim of circumstance. He knows how to press sympathy buttons for us the audience, as well as his lawyers which start caring for his well being. This is the best part of his performance which divides him from the rest of the cast, which seems to be bit more cookie cutter, play by numbers, sort of performances.Specially Cumberbatch which I usually really like, his performance feels like is relaying too much on external subconscious voice technique (making it abnormally deep in it's pitch) and next to Rahim feels little too one dimensional .Rahim knows how to create chemistry not only with his fellow actors, but with the audience, which makes him very endearing.If you watch this film very closely you will find nuggets of messages which director is sending our way, like the number 760 (7+6=13 😉 ) which was given to Ould Slahi as an indication of sacrificial nature of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, as well as he might not have been fully innocent. Those anchors are subtle and often shine through the performance itself.I am very interested what else Hollywood has in store for the bilingual Tahar Rahim,. Hopefully he will not be just another talented actor who passes through Hollywood, but with his emotional and charismatic personality, will be one of performers which we will be able to watch evolving in future projects.The Mauritanian is an imperfect movie helped by nearly perfect performance by Tahar Rahim. Normally I postulate to see movies in cinema but this one due to it's intimate nature might be also suitable for home stream.",The Mauritanian
95,actaction,"The Best of Christianity & Liberal Values Work Together for Best Overall Film of 2020, Possibly, Editing, Writing, Direction & Cinematography All Very Strong",8,2 March 2021,"The film does something very important: it criticizes, without accusing, the US Government, taking great care to show the various working parts that went into the unjust treatment of one person, as an example of what has happened hundreds or more times before and since. Unlike several of the other award nominees in 2021, the film is extremely well-rounded in not just one category (acting, directing, cinematography, writing, creativity of all). Whereas the Billie Holiday bio-pic had a breakout performance by its lead, but the film had questionable editing and cinematography choices or Nomadland had great direction and acting, but lacked the overall special quality to lift it to Best Picture status -- The Mauritanian had enough of all to make an overall engaging, challenging, heart beatingly tense and heart wrenching film from first to last frame. It took chances with the filmmaking, with camera angles and editing style that seemed odd for all the right reasons (that phone receiver camera angle was purposely awkward, a sign of a wire tap perhaps). It did not take chances on the acting. Instead, the actors were vets, played classically & charged with nuance between the lines. I fear this movie, necessarily, came too late to get proper attention from critics or audiences more removed from the days post 9/11, but the tension was captured perfectly from the time... the need to be both patriotic and never forget juxtaposed with the need to keep America as beacon of fairness and defend Habeas Corpus was and still is our generational battle to not let ourselves become the enemy we hate. In my opinion, Foster deserves recognition & so does the film's technical work and possibly for Best Picture, though I'm pulling for Trial of the Chicago 7 as well. Other actors are also extremely strong and I would have no problem them also being nominated. I hope Oscars nominate the film for editing, cinematography, direction, writing, actress (Foster) and Best Picture. Finally, it is also so good for showing that the military prosecutor's Christianity was what prevented him from agreeing with the state in trying the case. Conservatives were out for revenge during this time, waged a holy war and all who resisted blindly accusing faced repercussions. It's important Christians have a model to look up to who didn't put politics first and decided to do what was right under the law and in his heart.",The Mauritanian
96,theshanecarr,Aggressively / Okay,6,8 April 2021,"This movie is fine. I have nothing bad to say about it. I have nothing exciting to say about it. It's decent. It works. The performances are good. It's well shot. The pacing is grand. Yeah. I watched it. It more or less works.The thing is, this subject is important. The world's most powerful democracy threw people in prison, told no one where they were, tortured them, and did so on the basis of no evidence. Or none that would stand up in court anyway.In recent years, I feel like America under W has started to take on a rose-tinted hue because of how bad things got under 45 but movies like this, that reckon with the past, that drag the sins out into the light so we can understand both who we are, and how we got here are necessary. They are important. I salute all of the film-makers who committed their time and energy to this project.I just wish the movie itself was more urgent, more powerful, more emotive.It may be that as someone who read a lot of the contemporary journalism I was always going to be a little ahead of the movie. When some of the third act sequences began to play out, it came as no shock to me. I knew all about what and how this would play out. Maybe in the future this will be more shocking to people. Maybe one day, audiences will look at this and ask ""how could this happen?""
It's never a good thing to be too far ahead of a movie, and yet that's the problem with a film based on a true story that is widely known.And the film-making is just not wow enough to hook me in any other way.Tahar Rahim is good as Slahi. Foster is good as the extraordinarily dedicated defence lawyer, Holloway. Cumberbatch is definitely doing an accent as the principled prosecution lawyer, Couch. Shailene Woodley is mostly wasted in a supporting role.The film does not examine the case against Mohamedou Slahi because the courts never did. The man himself (and the lawyers) remains a mystery.This is a film about the terrible things that were done in the name of keeping us safe. I should have been more angry when the film was over, (What anger I did have mostly came from onscreen text telling us what happened after the events of the movie. It is SHOCKING.), instead I mostly felt like this was too even-handed an appraisal to truly convey the horrors that were perpetrated.Get this, there STILL prisoners being held without a hearing in Guantanamo. How is this possible??! We should be up in arms. As Foster's character, Nancy Hollander, says in the movie (something like) ""The constitution does not have an asterisk beside it: does not apply all the time."" If we start putting limits on it, where will that end? Lawyers, like Hollander, who stand up for the system even when it costs them dear are heroes. So who are the villains?The system is at fault but the film is reluctant to say who, or more importantly, why it happened. It just shows us that it did.I needed more.",The Mauritanian

In fact, despite the reprehensible knee jerk use of torture by the USA that equally spread presidents from Bush to Obama, it's a message of hope that we even see films like this from the USA.

Argo
Zero Dark Thirty
ViceThis movie is the biggest snub from the 2021 Oscars. Because it came out relatively late in 2021 (and didn't yet come out in some countries at all) I automatically assumed it will belong to the next Oscars season. It won't, apparently it just never made the shortlist. I have a slight suspicion that most of the people from he Academy didn't actually watch it because of such a late release date; this film is better than at least Minari and Judas. If I were the one deciding I would most definitely have given it Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress nominations at the very least.The Mauritanian is a real, but vastly unknown or forgotten story that took place in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, a 32-year-old man named Mohamedou Ould Slahi is captured in Mauritania, and subsequently transported to the Guantanamo Bay, an American military prison in Cuba. He is accused of being associated with the 9/11 attacks, but there seem to be either conflicting or next to no evidence against him. The plot of this film is about what happened while he was in the prison, but also what was happening behind the scenes of his trial, both from the side of prosecution and defense. At the point of possibly the greatest national grief in the United States history, everything anybody could think of was punishing the responsible. This is understandable on another level, but how to stay sane, objective and just in such a morally and emotionally devastating situation? How, in fighting a monster, not become a monster yourself? I loved the way they managed to portray how the prosecution and the defense sides were both tormented by this moral conundrum, one facing a possibility of wrongly accusing an innocent man, and the other facing an even more psychologically agonizing possibility of selflessly defending a potential terrorist and murderer. The first hour of the film is a tiny bit slow, but it picks up substantially once all the cards are on the table. It's always strange to talk about ""spoilers"" in the context of movies about historical facts, but I still discourage you to read anything about this before watching the movie, it will leave a bigger impact on you that way.The Guantanamo detention camp is still open and Mohamedou is still alive, so this story is at the very least worth knowing and sharing.

121,AntiFakeReviews,A well crafted screenplay with great performances,9,5 March 2021,"Tahar Rahim amazed me greatly for his realistic performance as a wrongfully imprisoned at Gitmo. His micro expressions on his face, his hands...all of his body language, perfectly synchronized with the dialog, so profoundly and so sincerely showed his every word, exactly like a hopeless and helpless condemned prisoner. Benedict Cumberbatch also gave me a chance to finally realize how good he is as an actor. He completely changed his accent from an English native to a native American officer with his heavy American accent. Unlike Jimmy Stewart or Mattew MacConaughey, who always spoke in their natural born native accents, I do think a really talented actor should learn how to change their accent to different localized characters, Benedict Cumberbatch , a British actor, and Toni Collette, an Australlian, both can deliver perfect American accent when the roles they played required.This film is a well written, well directed with perfect casting job. It's actuallly a quite monotonous one which only shifted between the Gitmo prison, the law office and some minor party scenes, but it never felt boring and could maintain its ongoing developments to keep the viewers' interests.This film also reminded me how American government unilaterally manipulated and violated the democracy and the justice system to frame innocent people at will. Butchers like Donald Rumsfield and Dick Chenny, the American Department of Justice, two POTUSs, G.W. Bush and Obama, and the American military....they all played a monstrous and atrocious roles against humanity.""Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss.

127,mha-89327,A Worthy Production Which Asks Difficult Questions,8,2 April 2021,"'The Mauritanian' (2021) is not a typical Hollywood production. This is a good thing. Interestingly, while the story's lead subject is controversially situated as guilty as charged according to US military sponsored jurisprudence, and as enforced by black site incarceration in Guantanamo, Cuba; arguably, this charge is entirely without merit. Thus, one is a terrorist according to stereotypical suspicion and cultural prejudice.Hence, the premise of this dramatization is positioned such that it questions which is more important? - the US constitution and the writ of habeas corpus - innocent until proven guilty, or US anger and an overpowering American sense of the need for vengeance for 9/11.Understandably, this argument or assertion is deeply mired in the horror and victimisation of fanatical religious terrorism and the trauma and loss borne by the families of victims of terrorism. Thereby, the finer points of empirical evidence, jurisprudence and right to fair trial may all fall by the wayside in the rush to hold someone, or something, accountable. However, sadly, the premise of this drama also situates itself upon the razor margin of integrity and human rights, as opposed to principals anchored in doctrines of suspicion and assumptive stereotypes framed by heavily discriminatory processes of legitimised military justice.Interestingly, this production asks no questions concerning American foreign policy and the historical disconnection between US foreign relations and US domestic perceptions of international views of American foreign relations. What is reinforced is the august demonstration of the inherent failure of Guantanamo authorities to illicit any substantive justification for their function or operation outside of the US legal system. Finally, the Mauritanian demonstrates the entirely fatuous argument which supports and legitimises torture as a valid means of interrogation and information gathering. Ultimately, condemnation is passed and it crosses multiple US administrations.In summary, for those amongst the audience still paying attention, or who care whether someone is subject to human rights abuse and torture when the accused is not an American citizen. 'The Mauritanian' is a compelling and gritty rendition of well-crafted drama. The writers seek to ask uncomfortable questions of US government sanctioned anti-terrorism programs of torture and rendition which operate without legal merit or legitimacy.Unspoken, yet still forefront, is the question of cultural bias and a willingness to condemn foreign cultures in reflection of American cultural prejudice. Such that, empirical evidence aside, if an accused offender is ethnically aligned with a guilty party, by association, such institutional processes, in turn, will render a finding of guilt, legitimising the ends justify the means as valid legal precept uncontested in American courts. Numerous little known actors deliver outstanding performances as both supporting and primary characters.

129,calsonassociates,The Importance of Freemasonry in Democracy,10,20 September 2021,"In accurate filmmaking, stating something is true must be carefully considered. The trust of a Mason is in God. But before a man can trust in God, whom he cannot see, he must learn to trust in his fellowman, who is made in God's image. As you placed yourself in the hands of this lodge and followed your conductors through the ceremonies of initiation, you exemplified your trust in your fellowman. So ever place your trust in God and walk uprightly through life, fearing no danger; know that a man's worst enemy is himself, and that with one, God is a majority.Sharp instruments may torture the flesh, but unless the torture be unto death a few short days suffice to heal the wounds and only the scars remain to remind of the agony endured. But the torture of a guilty conscience is not so. Memory of pledges violated, evil deeds done, kind actions left undone, comes to us after years have passed; comes to us as we lie upon our beds and chases 'sleep, tired nature's sweet restorer,' from our eyes, and makes our bed a hell; comes amid our innocent social pleasures and turns our joy to pain; a face, a word or an odor may bring back the hateful incidents of a scene that no subsequent life of purity and holiness and rectitude of conduct can banish from the memory...guard well your actions, that henceforth no memory of evil deeds disturb your peace or rack your mind and conscience.It is in practice of these virtues (truth, love, and relief/charity, like writing a review maybe, that our practice of virtues that mankind most nearly reveals, is his/her kindship to God. If the cardinal virtues of Freemasonry, which are temperance, fortitude, prudence, and justice, were practiced by all mankind, then charity, as an act of almsgiving would cease. For banished from the world, and the woes of misery and penury that follow them, would then give place to joy. But the poor we have with us always; so, as we administer our charity, let us remember that it is not only those who are in straightened financial circumstances who need our assistance, but that the poor in spirit, the despondent, the discouraged may be heartened and lifted up by kind and encouraging words, perhaps from me.It is axiomatic that the preservation of a stable political democracy demands an 'informed citizenry,' and this means a citizenry which not only has the necessary factual knowledge for making rational decisions but also insight into and understanding of the social environment. The voluntary association is supposed to contribute to both ends; indeed, association in it very meaning, presents the individual with the opportunity to become aware of how processes function in filmmaking and how things are done in a democratic society where there is in fact an equal protection of the law.I am not sorry for anything about describing the film, music, and writing guilds as anything but helpful in The Mauritanian (2021) and will end now with something important when sharing my views and opinions in the form of a 'YOUR REVIEW' for all world inhabitants and not for any profiting companies.No man discovered law or can locate its beginnings; no man invented education, or can name its birthplace; nor is it possible to state when religion took its place in the moral sphere of men. These great forces sprung from the needs of the human soul, and are the result of growth and development. The same is true of Freemasonry. It was not created, but grew out of the past. No one is certain. Research continues. Theories abound. Believe what you will with the only certainty being that the fraternity of men and women have been around for a long time.Thank you kindly.

Possibly the Obama administrations part in the torture of detainees too. I daresay there are some glaring factual errors here too, but who cares right?

This movie open up the brutality and injustice of the U. S law system that only believes in labelling everything a threat without any proper evidence. Tahar Rahim is undoubtedly a class actor who deserves every accolade for his performance as our helpless innocent protagonist. This man can easily transform into any character whether it be the mastermind criminal Charles or a normal innocent man Mohamedou. A totally worthy performance was made by the awesome actor Jodie Foster. She is just mind blowing with her subtle expressions and powerful dialogues. Everyone other actors did well too.

There is still no explanation why Mohamedou Ould Slahi after being told he 'won' was still held for another 7 years and this under Obama.

166,joshuarenealvarez,The Mauritanian (2021),8,27 April 2021,"The Mauritanian is a political-drama based on the 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary written by Mohamedu Ould Salahi, a true story of Salahi's experience of being held for years in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. He was accused of orchestrating the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. Mohamedu Ould Salahi is portrayed by Tahar Rahim who delivers one of the best performances of the year. His facial expressions and mannerisms for the character were nothing short of outstanding and they will always be engraved in my memory. A man who was tormented mentally, physically and emotionally due to the belief that the blood of over 3,000 victims were on his hands. I could never imagine myself being in his position. Surrounded by nothing but hopelessness, based on suspicions for a crime that he may or may not have committed. This is a very important motion picture because it represents the abuse of authority by the American government that has been happening in our world. Only his devotion towards God and his dream
of leaving his captivity allowed him transcend his obstacles, turning this into an inspiring and motivational depiction about one's faith. Jodie Foster's role in this film is absolutely essential, winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her powerful portrayal as defense attorney Nancy Hollander who strives towards uncovering the truth with the aid of her assistant Teri Duncan (portrayed by Shailene Woodley). Sharing the screen with them is Benedict Cumberbatch who manages to stand out in his performance as Lt. Colonel Stuart Coach. Determined to have Salahi pay for his

173,cmhouser,Good film with some things left to be desired,6,2 March 2021,"Ah yes. Another film based on the outcome of 9/11 but does Hollywood get it right?! That's always the question and the answer is usually ""no"". But, is this one a ""yes""?! Not likely.I always struggle a bit to determine whether a film should be reviewed based on its ability to be accurate or its ability to entertain?! What would the writers and directors want? Accuracy or enjoyment? What would the viewers want?!This film is a mixed bag of good acting and directing with writing that is quite obviously bent towards the dramatic. The pacing is pretty good and Tahar Rahim knocks his role out of the park. It's always nice to see Jodie Foster in modern roles even if her previous modern efforts were a bit ""meh"". She does a good job here.My biggest problem with these types of movies is they are meant to stir up emotion to sell you on something that isn't necessarily there. On the contrary, this film (and topic) would likely be considered boring without the penchant for drama and overselling the situation. Undoubtedly it's wrong for any person or Government to detain someone indefinitely and after 9/11, the US Government took FULL advantage of its citizen's emotions to enact draconian policies. Not all that unseemlier to the situation many find themselves in today with lockdowns.There were several moments in the film where I had to dismiss what I knew to be extreme drama for the purpose of selling itself to views but I feel the movie overall is a real good watch. The sad truth of 2021 is that most people don't do any research and seem to base their opinions off fictional dramas that are ""based on real events"" when the reality of the situation is much more straight forward or in this case, much more complicated. So complicated the story shouldn't be told?! No and this film does a good job at breaching the topic compared to other attempts.In the end... if you just want to watch a movie that ever so slightly informs you of the situation while keeping you entertained... this film does that very well. But, as with most all things Hollywood, if you seek more accurate information about what occurred, go read real stories. The reality isn't better than the fiction or more entertaining... but it is worth knowing outside of the ""based on a real story"" narrative.",The Mauritanian

187,moviefest-90757,Tahar Rahim Goes Back To Pen,9,4 March 2021,"Whilst 'The Mauritanian' may feel a little flat to some viewers due to director Kevin Macdonald's reserved approach to the harrowing subject matter, I myself cannot help but appreciate the quiet, subtle and slow-paced escalation of the narrative.Macdonald slowly draws you into the story, affiliating you with not only the protagonist of this procedural, but both sides of the law, fighting with and against Mohamedou; the prosecutors and the defense. This is a dry, cutting, up-close and personal exploration into the lack of justice in America's flawed ""justice system"" and the brutality of America's illegal and barbaric prison torture regime. The audience is invited to participate in every grueling event that takes place, whether that be sifting through the copious amounts of legal paperwork, being constantly rebutted by superiors, the induction into prison, torture, interrogations, it's a bleak affair.I appreciate how Macdonald presents the difficulties that arose for the opposing side, where most would just focus on one side or the other. We experience frustration after frustration, just like all the key characters in this story, and at the heart of everyone's frustrations is the American Government. A system that will quite happily exclude, manipulate and/or sacrifice those of which that fight on their behalf at the behest of all their dirty secrets. Secrets that are gradually coming to light.What prevents 'The Mauritanian' from pitfalls of other films of its ilk is the incredible performance from Tahar Rahim and boldly directed sequences that explore the horrors of an unjust system. The interrogation/torture scenes are incredibly disturbing due to the authenticity of the set designs, the deafening sound effects, intense strobe lighting and intimate yet dizzying camera angles. The scenes are extremely well choreographed and performed to startling perfection, some of the best you'll see in any film of this ilk. Macdonald also utilizes two different aspect ratios to aptly portray the differing time periods, the cinematography is well shot, creating a gritty, dry, bleak and unforgiving atmosphere. The characters played by Jodie Foster, Shailene Woodley, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tahar Rahim bring a well-needed lightness to the film, their morals and heart provide a sense of hope for not only the case in hand, but the future of justice. Tahar Rahim gives everything both physically and mentally for what is one of the best performances of 2021, his emotional depth, facial expressions, body mannerisms, it's truly gripping stuff.The meandering pace may not be for everyone, but this is definitely a fitting retelling of another piece of distressing history added to the canon of ever-growing reasons to hate the united states government.Check out my IG @MovieFestUK",The Mauritanian

259,mi_adi,"A Shrew, a Coquettish Ingenue and the Planes that flew, into the Twin Towers",8,4 July 2021,"The Mauritanian begins with scenes of serenity. The sweet dissonance of waves breaking on the shore is always soothing. Our protagonist, then, is taken away in the middle of a family event. Everything happened to him while he was just being a part of his family, when he was just being himself. A circumstance of enjoyment and closeness. A display of culture and tradition, maybe to show that not everyone is the same and that is just ok. This, making sure that whatever follows is all the more palpable; the torture and suffering our protagonist has to face later on in the film. It is a true story after all, about a scary-terry.The cinematography and the direction in the beginning actually seem more like an enabling device and scaffolding for the story and the actors rather than something which has an existence or a style of itself. The approach is such that it isn't even noticeable. The credit most definitely goes to the writers here who seem to be relatively new to this, but their technique is quite similar to other films of this nature and verily speaking it reminds me of Citizen Kane. The constant bombardment of information relevant to the plot keeps the viewer hooked and builds intensity. If the story had not actually been based on truth and the screenplay on a book, the writers would have been deserving of greater credit and kudos. The score is sparse, which seems quite apposite as the film is mainly carried through in dialogues and the job is done subtly indeed through string-based compositions.However, as the film builds up, one begins to notice the closeup shots and the jarring aspect ratio shifts which definitely do the job of breaking the linear story telling style. Something which has become quite a trend in contemporary film making. This is where the artist really shines. Once all the facts and the technicalities have been established, the pain, fear, suffering, desperation, loss, frustration, exasperation and bleakness of the future is unleashed upon the viewers. This shift actually makes sense here as it is meant for a purpose, rather than Zack ""pretentious"" Snyder's choices who simply forces it upon his viewers without rhyme or reason. While the film gradually developed, what I found to be quite evident, is that the director here takes a cue from Denis Villeneuve's Sicarrio, in that there is a continuous build-up of intensity with a final release. What makes it absolutely different from the intensity in Sicarrio is the fact that in the latter it was developed and maintained entirely through visual cues. But here, it mostly develops through dialogue and events and it doesn't enter into intensity at the outset. It becomes intense gradually and quite unhurriedly so that one doesn't even notice it. There are bouts of intensity and relief. This film creates waves. Crests and troughs. One doesn't realize when it has become intense and one has been caught in the grip and one keeps gazing at the screen. Then the grips slackens and the viewer is led in the trough of story and character development. Again, kudos to the technical artists - the writers, director and editor.Tahar Rahim, I have to say, is the star of the show. He's a new face for me but his performance here is extraordinary. The role of any actor, I believe, is not only to emote but also to cause to emote. And Tahar Rahim is an expert at that. Looking him up on IMBD I came to know that he was also on The Serpent, playing the titular role, which was entirely unbearable to be honest and quite unwatchable. Yet here, he is dynamic and convincing to say the least. What he does, is to make one believe in him, the script and the direction assist him of course. But it is he who carries it on his shoulders. And by ""him"" I mean the character, our protagonist. Jodie Foster here, distinctly reminds of herself in Inside Man. She plays the same kind of role, though quite a bit more earnestly. It seems she's become adept at playing an erudite professional. The piece that just doesn't seem to fit is Benedict Cumberbatch. Not that he isn't effective, it's only that he is one of those British actors who have the worst American accent. And he employs a south-eastern accent here. It is oddly obvious that he is speaking in an affected one and it isn't how he actually speaks. I had felt the same about his accent in Doctor Strange and it sure doesn't seem that he was able to improve anything here. He feels like a loose Lego piece and out of place. It's not that he's bad at his craft, but every time I see him, I'm reminded of Smaug or Sherlock Holmes or Khan. He does exactly what he's supposed to do, but seems so nice, so out place as an American.Yet, what is absolutely striking about the acting here is the style. Each actor brings their own style to the character they portray which feels quite consistent throughout. The cadences, the facial twitches, the reactions which seem obvious for the character, they all seem very earnest and truly felt.The words I've been thinking of for quite a while for describing the film's overall method is ""technical"" yet ""poignant"". I cannot judge the film on facts, because after all it's based on a true story, otherwise it would be a documentary. The interrogations and the time spent in prison, bring something terrible and special. But what they also reveal to the viewers is how diabolical the American legal system is for people the system doesn't like. How crazed with retribution the American's were after the attacks, because of which many innocent people had also suffered. The American alleged-terrorist prisoner management system that is. It makes one wonder about the purpose of democracy and the efficacy and reliability of institutions, especially those for incarceration and administering justice.",The Mauritanian

261,cutedimples57,Spoiler alerts *** Great Film***,8,27 April 2021,"This film touched me, as a proud British woman and a supporter of all military personnel I was unsure what to expect as I haven't read the book. In the film it portrays a Muslim man being taken by local police however he is never returned. Few years later he is found to be in guantanamo bay with no crimes charged. They however name him a terroist. They said he recruited the members who brought down the twin towers. However he is scared and says he is innocent. The lawyers who take on his case believe everyone is entitled to defence. They later see he has written confession letters to the crimes mentioned. For a split second I thought is this true. It turns out they used incomprehensible torture to get him to confess they starve him of sleep food threaten to bring his mother in to custody and have her raped by fellow detainees. They sex shame him they play music so loud and flicker lights waterboard him beat him batter him and make him confess to something he didn't do. He had a tenuous connection who then blamed him. Americans believed the tenuous connection and the torture began. He won his court case in 2009 however in the Obama registration it was appealed and he was kept for a further 7 years and he had already done almost 8 he got released after over 14 years of jail with no crime or conviction to his name. I understand why torture in a way was used as as far as they were concerned he was their man even if it was such a tiny connection and they didn't want a repeat of 9/11 however this poor man served so long and lost so much of his life to bigotry and suspicion. He is now released and living back in Mauritian he is married to an American lawyer and has a baby son but he is unable to live with them in the USA due to visa issues however this man still Remains smiling and positive.I'm in awe, he knows that people who commit the crimes he was accused of should be punished to the full extent of the law however he also knows he never knowingly or even remotely did anything to help the war. This innocent man is free now and I wish a long and happy life. I also want to say I know if I there was anyone I know being hurt by such acts I would want them punished too and I think he feels the same. I get from the credits at the end he has forgiven and felt at peace with it all.",The Mauritanian
262,deepakdarryani,Amazing true story,10,10 June 2021,"A must watch!It's a joke that still none of the government agencies have taken any responsibility to treat a person so horribly. In which kind of system / society we are living? Which kind of democracy is there? There are no words which can explain the agony of the experiences these kind of people are going through. Few people of higher chain are ruining the image of the system we trust. There should be some programs for governement employees to teach, remind & instill the humanity in them.",The Mauritanian

264,sander_kooistra,Compelling story with great cast,9,3 July 2021,"The story really moved me and I thought the acting was very good. It's appalling the see how human beings can treat each other. The movie built up to this really well and showed how both the prosecutor and defence were horrified about the interrogation techniques/torture. That moment when they both find this out was filmed in a beautiful way and really made me emotional. The movie does not take a position on Mohamedans guilt, which I like.",The Mauritanian

268,sundancer-50980,"a very difficult movie to watch, but necessary",10,28 April 2021,"I was particularly interested because I'm from Albuquerque, and remember hearing Nancy Hollander speak about the case. I also remember all the people who refused to believe that this was happening. What's important to remember is that the perpetrators in the government were never held accountable, and Gitmo has not been closed. His verdict was appealed under the Obama administration, a liberal presidency. What else is important to remember is that this was not an isolated incident but needs to be put into a context with the secret torture what was going on in Chicago prisons, and probably elsewhere too. If this is ever going to end it has to be acknowledged and put into the larger picture of anti-Asian violence, murder of unarmed people by the police, etc etc etc etc.",The Mauritanian
269,royt-71697,Beware the 10's and 1's,5,16 March 2021,Whenever I see review after review after review of 10/10 I know this is the PR company at work. It just isn't normal review scoring. The same is equally true of 1's too. It's a hate group of some kind.The problem with this film is that it represents Jodies world view and only her world view. If that fits yours then you and the PR firm are going to be thrilled.To me this was a wasted opportunity to explore the deeper issues. So what if 'we' get one wrong but ensure a 100 others survive. Would I kill an innocent to save the children in Manchester bombing? I don't know and hopefully will never have to find out.Unthinkable in 2010 did a better job here. Because there is a story to be explored but in todays political climate we are very unlikely to have a chance to do so.Is teh film well made? Yes. Well acted? Yes. But will it persuade one single person to change their mind? ABSOLUTELY NO. Ultimately therefore it is another 'feel guilty because' (FGB) film and that will mean that we will not remember it even 6 months from now.,The Mauritanian

275,bethirwin-81371,Incredible,9,17 April 2021,"This film really affected me. I confess I know little about the finer details of US military protocols and the judicial system Over There but this hit me hard as a human being. Knowing this kind of stuff happened - and is STILL HAPPENING - to human beings hurts me so much I don't even know where to begin. Tahar is just incredible and deserves all the recognition an actor can get but really the people who are fighting this in their tiny corner of the planet are the ones who need our spotlight on them. This torture needs to stop, military 'justice' and ''we are just following orders' be damned. I can't imagine the damage. Where is our conscience?!",The Mauritanian
276,marcmeldrum,"Slow, turgid, painful",3,3 April 2021,"A good opportunity for a true story to be retold which has been wasted by a slow, painful script and poor, haphazard editing. Nobody excels in any role in this movie and it's two hours wasted in my opinion. Not worth a watch.",The Mauritanian

Invented, allegedly, by us Brits to keep the Boers in check at the back end of the 19th century(?). One thing to bear in mind is that just because there's not enough real evidence (+ obtained legally), to secure a conviction under the ""without a reasonable doubt"" criteria, it doesn't necessarily mean that a defendant is actually innocent, just that it can't be proven. Just another thought.................. really, riveting & enjoyable movie all the same. Well worth the 2 hours expended.",The Mauritanian

The movie very strongly shows their side to the audience with complete transparency and at times its just heartbreaking, but extremly necessary, to face the truth. All the actors and actresses in the movie were completely amazing and you could feel the depth in their characters just by their face expressions.I deeply recommend everybody to watch the movie.",The Mauritanian

It's a difficult watch and the pace may stop some from staying the course, but this is a powerful and well told story that needs to be seen. The end credits show the man at the heart of this story and show his heart for all to see.
