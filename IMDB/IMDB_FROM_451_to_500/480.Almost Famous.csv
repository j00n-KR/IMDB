0,bkoganbing,Rock and Roll is Here to Stay,8,14 December 2007,"Young Patrick Fugit, a talented juvenile writer, gets a once in a lifetime opportunity, to travel with a mid level rock band as a journalist. If the piece is good, Rolling Stone may pick it up and his career is made. Trying to pin the band down for an interview, especially the deliberately elusive leader, Billy Crudup is harder than you would think. These guys in the band Stillwater are Almost Famous, they're just a step away, but it's hard step to take.Billy Crudup is one of the best players around today and it's his portrayal of Russell Hammond, lead singer of Stillwater on which the film pivots. It's a very complex role and we see all sides of Russell Hammond, talented, charismatic, loyal, self indulgent, hedonistic, it's all there and whole lot more. Just how honest can young Mr. Fugit be and where does being a fan stop and being a journalist start. Fugit may not know, but the band members keep asking the question.Kate Hudson is around and does very well as the girl 'Penny Lane' who follows Stillwater. She's not a groupie, the term she prefers is Band Aide. And Frances McDormand is around as Fugit's mom who is constantly checking in on her son to see that he doesn't enjoy too much of the good life on the rock scene.Almost Famous is a very graphic picture of the rock scene of the mid Seventies. Director Cameron Crowe did a great job capturing the mood of the times as well as good performances from the cast. Still it's Billy Crudup's picture and this is a must for his fans.",Almost Famous
1,SnoopyStyle,The best of 2001,9,19 April 2014,"Elaine (Frances McDormand) is an all-controlling weirdness mother in San Diego, and her daughter Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels running away. Elaine even lies to her son William Miller (Patrick Fugit) about his age skipping grades. Anita leaves behind her collection of records for him. Then forward to 1973, William is a 15 year old high school music geek who has written a few things for magazines. Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is his all-talk mentor. While trying to interview Black Sabbath, he befriends Band-aid Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Then he meets Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and the band Stillwater. A few praises and he's in with the band. Then Rolling Stone magazine calls.This is based on director Cameron Crowe's life as a young Rolling Stone reporter. As such, it has an air of truth in this fictional account. It hits all the correct notes. It is fun, poignant, and heart warming in all the right places. Kate Hudson is an instant star. The music is wonderful. It won the Oscar for best writing, but I would pick this over any of the best picture nominees. It is simply better than the best of that year.",Almost Famous
2,Horst_In_Translation,Not just almost a quality watch,6,1 September 2019,"""Almost Famous"" is an American movie from 2000, so this one is almost 20 years old already, maybe more depending on when you read this review. The writer and director is Cameron Crowe and (not only) because he won an Oscar for his screenplay here, this is probably his most known career effort. Critics probably also say this was when he peaked and long before he came up with stuff like Aloha. In any case, in the tradition of this one here, he recently worked on a rock band centered television show. Anyway back to this one here: There's several versions and the one I saw is the longest at over 2 hours and 30 minutes, the director's cut. You could certainly say that for most cast members here that is their career-defining effort, some even have not really been in anything else fairly famous. Lead actor Patrick Fugit is sort of the best example. Then again, while he does give a good child performance, he is really only the vehicle to the actors and characters around him making their marks. This is especially true for the two Oscar-nominated actresses here. Frances McDormand was quite good, at times maybe Oscar-deserving playing his worried mother with a hang to superbly correct spelling and grammar. How dare you even write X-Mas? I think she made the character her own with the approach she gave the role. The opposite is Kate Hudson who was probably the one closer to the Oscar because of her Golden Globe win. I still think McDormand was better. But Hudson probably played the more memorable character and that's why she got this attention, like a pretty specific brand of music/band fans who are partially like groupies, but not really because they mostly care for the success of the band and not just for being ""prostitutes for the road"" or making quick money. I think there it was basically a perfect casting choice and the character was perfect for her. Still she gave a pretty good performance, no denying. Quite a shame though she was wasted mostly in romantic comedies afterwards, and mostly not good ones. Her career could have been a lot more honestly. Aside from that, i want to give a special mention to the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman whose immense talent was more than visible here already and even if he only played a minor character, he sure left his mark and made the guy pretty memorable.So overall, with the quality movies about Queen (Mercury), Elton John and others hitting theaters these days, you could definitely say that this one here is ahead of its time. I am not superbly impressed, but I was kinda surprised how quickly these not too far from 3 hours flew by eventually. There are serious moments that involve the (potential) death of several characters and even if these do not turn out as tragic as you may have thought, mostly thanks to the intervention of a teenage boy, it's still slightly shocking material. I must say I perceived the potential tragedy at the swimming pool as more dramatic than the overdose scene about Penny Lane, even if the latter went longer, but that is just personal perception. I think this film gives a good, sometimes even great, insight into the touring life of rock musicians back in the day. Of course, some of it is a bit over the top like that they almost have a fatal plane crash the first or during one of the first times when they take the airplane instead of the regular bus, but there is a lot more good than bad. Yes maybe these confessions there in the face of death do not feel too realistic (like come on really the gay guy? Nah) but they fit in well in the sense of ""show must go on"" and they stick together in the end despite what they told each other, which does seem realistic, even if the band members hate each other more than ever at that point. Also what I liked were the power struggles in terms of record companies and the representatives they send and pop culture references like the Rolling Stone cover or discussion about certain band members standing out in terms of talent compared to others.Now you already see I say virtually nothing about the young main character although there were no long sequences with him missing. But I gave you the reason earlier already. He's there and at the same time he isn't. Like in the film he is basically an observer and interviewer, but not the star and so does he feel to audiences as well. Nonetheless I did not really like his key story in the sense of how they see him as an influential journalist and it feels kinda tough to believe that he wins everybody over so quickly with his talent, like not just the RS, but also for example the older musician he is hand-shaking with early on already and that he meets later again briefly. Still it is okay, he is not bad or anything and you don't really have to make a connection with him to appreciate the film. It's a good outcome all in all. I don't think it is as great as many say or think it is and also not among the best from 2000, but it's still worth seeing, especially for people interested in music from the past decades. Thumbs up. Watch it. Nice music, a quality script and strong performances all around can only result in a positive recommendation from me here.",Almost Famous
3,kosmasp,"Not almost, but totally",10,19 May 2020,"Now I don't know all the facts about the real stories behind this, but it is obvious that there is so much love and research to what happened, that it translates onto the screen. You can feel the love for what is being shown and you can feel the passion of the makers of this. Including everyone involved.I did watch the alternate longer cut of it (called the Bootleg version), so I can't really talk about the original theatrical cut. But I can advise anyone to watch the longer cut. It is more than worth it. It is really amazing and breathtaking. The story holds up and we can identify either with the boy or other characters of the movie, which make it so accessible.The humor, the music, the acting, the way this was put/edited together help elevate it to a different degree. I almost feel ashamed having not seen it before. But I made good for it, so I could sort of celebrate the 20th anniversary of it.",Almost Famous
4,classicsoncall,"""One day..., you'll be cool.""",6,13 April 2018,"Except for an almost decent soundtrack, I found very little to like about this film, and marvel at the effusive praise for the film from a wide range of IMDb reviewers. If fifteen year old 'Rolling Stone' writer William Miller (Patrick Fugit) had taken Lester Bangs' (Philip Seymour Hoffman) advice, we might have had an honest and unmerciful portrayal of an aspiring rock band, but instead got a somewhat sanitized look at the sex, drugs and rock n' roll scene of The Seventies. And speaking of which, the idea of a fifteen year old rock journalist writing for 'Rolling Stone' just took all credibility out of the picture for me, not to mention fifteen year old Band-Aids like Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) criss-crossing the country to keep tabs on their favorite band. The word that kept coming back to me from those days was 'teenybopper' and it seemed to me that the picture was made for an audience comprised of nothing but. The only kick I got out of this picture was when the hot shot manager wanna-be (that was Jimmy Fallon?) tries to strong-arm the members of Stillwater into signing with him by stating ""...if you think Mick Jagger'll still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty, you're sadly mistaken"". Hmm, seems to me that at nearly seventy-five!!! as I write this, Jagger has a lot more staying power than anyone else associated with this picture.",Almost Famous
5,gavin6942,Cameron Crowe Tells a Good Story,8,19 January 2015,"A high-school boy (Patrick Fugit) is given the chance to write a story for Rolling Stone Magazine about an up-and-coming rock band as he accompanies it on their concert tour.Jason Lee as a rock star? Jimmy Fallon as a record company agent? And even a young Zooey Deschanel being somewhat charming (one of her few roles where she pulls this off)? Crowe has consistently made some fun films, and this is definitely one of them, drawing from his own life experience.The music is great, Frances McDormand makes a great (and believable) dominant mother (who still allows her son to run off). Kate Hudson is not as charming as the film wants her to be, but ultimately she does not have to be, so that works. She is flawed, after all.This is definitely a film that will only grow in reputation.",Almost Famous
6,lee_eisenberg,It was actually a little too fluffy for full credibility.,7,14 September 2005,"""Almost Famous"" was almost a really good movie, but the whole thing was a little too fluffy to be fully believable. It seems that the band members - and the tag-alongs - would have been strung out on drugs. But other than that, it was a pretty good flick. It's fairly well known that director Cameron Crowe loosely based the story on his experiences covering a band's tour for Rolling Stone magazine. One thing that I couldn't quite understand is why, when the movie came out, a lot of people told me that the boy reminded them of me. Okay, so he had a different take on everything; that seems like a bit of a stretch. But either way, ""Almost Famous"" is worth seeing, with fine performances from Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, and newcomer Patrick Fugit.",Almost Famous
7,jboothmillard,Almost Famous,5,2 October 2007,"From writer/director Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire) this is an okay story about how living in the fame world can get to your head. As a kid, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) was intrigued by his older sister Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel) to listen to rock music, and as he grew up it became his passion to somehow get involved with it. So he first worked for Creem magazine, before going to meet well known music critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who helped him to start working for Rolling Stone magazine. His job was basically to find a band rising to fame and interview them on their tour, and he managed to find a band called Stillwater. The lead members, guitarist Russell Hammond (Big Fish's Billy Crudup) and lead singer Jeff Bebe (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee), do have their little squabbles and differences, but they make sure the band stays strong, and that their new friend William, along with ""supporter"" Penny Lane (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Kate Hudson) are a part of the action. It is the drug and alcohol filled journey that is making William doubt his report and self esteem can last, and obviously his over-protective mother Elaine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Fargo star Frances McDormand) is especially worried. It does slum towards the end like the critics say, but the band does succeed in making a great tour and going on the cover of the magazine. Also starring X-Men's Anna Paquin as Polexia Aphrodisia, The Craft's Fairuza Balk as Sapphire, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Noah Taylor as Dick Roswell, Jimmy Fallon as Dennis Hope, Bijou Phillips as Estrella Starr and Peter Frampton as Reg. I personally didn't think it was good enough to win, or be nominated for many of these awards, but it won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Crowe (against Gladiator, Erin Brockovich and Billy Elliot!), and it was nominated for Best Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay (same films nominated, and also O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Nancy Wilson and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Worth watching, in my opinion!",Almost Famous
8,moonspinner55,A warm fuzzy,5,30 November 2001,"A big, entertaining puff-piece on the way the 1970s music scene never was. So spotless is the scenario that we never see anyone take drugs (we just hear about it), and the parking lot outside the concert venue is so clean and tidy one could set-up a picnic out there! The acting is all very good, though the cast is hampered by the cutesy handling; they smile movie-star smiles in close-up, all darling and doe-eyed as if they're thinking this is an instant classic, the next ""American Graffiti"" (the only one who bucks the trend is Frances McDormand, who overcomes a gummy, TV-neurotic role with grace). For young movie-goers, this may be something new, something that may even speak to them; to folks over 30, it's all been done before--and with less twee responses (sample dialogue: ""I need to talk face-to-face...I'm not as good without you here!""). It's rock and roll filtered through cotton candy, with little ""Jerry Maguire""-isms dotting the script. Mindlessly enjoyable while you're watching it, but the film touches on no truths. ** from ****",Almost Famous
9,dbdumonteil,paint a nostalgic picture,7,26 October 2003,"According to me ""almost famous"" is Cameron Crowe's best movie. I find it widely superior to ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001) although this movie was made after ""Almost Famous"".If this movie is really good, it's because Crowe perfectly controls his subject that deals with one of his main passions: the golden age of rock music in the first half of the seventies. This is a partly autobiographical subject and with which you feel Crowe at ease and inspired. His script is full of allusions and references to rock music in general and through the decades. For example, when William Wyler is with Kate Hudson driving the car, the sleeve of ""Dark side of the moon"" by Pink Floyd (we are then in 1973) reflects on the windscreen. Then when William is listening to ""Tommy"" by the Who, he's lighting a candle. Is it an allusion to the cover of ""Daydream Nation"" by Sonic Youth?Through the adventure of the band Stillwater and the amazed eyes of William who is passionately in love with rock, it's the occasion for Crowe to take a lucid and mesmerized look on the condition of being a rock star with its advantages like fame and wealth but also its drawbacks such as pressure or tension between the different band members. Many people have considered ""Almost famous"" as Cameron Crowe's letter love to rock. I would say that this movie makes him feel years younger. I highly recommend it to any given rock music fan and concerning the original soundtrack, guess the tunes that Crowe chose...",Almost Famous
10,Quinoa1984,Surprisingly sweet dramedy hits the mark,8,18 September 2000,"This film may have just one flaw- it aims too high.  But that doesn't matter in this world.  Here, we see the autobiographical tale of Cameron Crowe (writer/director and co-producer of this film) in his days as a young writer for Rolling Stone (one story I think) as seen by William Miller.  He follows a rock band called Stillwater (much to mom's dismay played well by Frances McDormand) on a Almost Famous tour with rockers, groupies and bandaids. Real sweetness comes when the worlds of Miller and the band combine and dramedy kicks in.  Quite the Crowe picture, one of his best ones, that takes a look at the days of rock when it was still cool to do drugs, have sex and be cool singing Elton John in a bus (that scene was the highlight).  Band members include Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and others including Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, and in a exceptional performance, the free spirited Penny Lane played by Kate Hudson.  This film is definately in my top 25 list of the year.  A-",Almost Famous
11,michaelRokeefe,"Life 101: Welcome to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll!!!",8,4 July 2001,"I find it so easy to praise this movie. All the components are here to insure a good time for the viewer. Just the right amount of humor mixed with the abundance of music to keep the story rolling. This is a semi-autobiography of writer/director Cameron Crowe, who at age 15 toured with a rising rock band and described it in Rolling Stone magazine.Patrick Fugit is wonderful as the young boy(William Miller) getting ready to take his first bite out of life. Frances McDormand is outstanding as the boy's overly protective mother. Young William finds a mentor in a teen magazine editor played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman is one cool dude, man. The enchanting Kate Hudson as ""Penny Lane"" seems to steal every scene she is in. Talented and terrific. Impressive is Billy Crudup, the questionable leader of the band. Jason Lee also is more than  notable as co-leader of the band. This movie shows Miss Hudson's potential of being a very big star. Hoffman really had this role right on. The music itself deserves top shelf compliments. The music sure helped the characters make this movie.",Almost Famous
12,sunwarrior13,"The World Of Sex,Drugs And Rock And Roll",10,25 May 2014,"Almost Famous is a film that tells the coming-of-age story of a teenage journalist writing for Rolling Stone magazine while on the road with a fictitious rock band named Stillwater during the 1970's.The ensemble cast of the movie includes Kate Hudson,who won an Oscar for her portrayal,together with Patrick Fugit,Billy Crudup,Frances McDormand,Zooey Deschanel,Jason Lee and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.It is based on the experiences of Cameron Crowe,the producer,writer and director of the movie,when he was a teen-age writer for Rolling Stones.Elaine Miller is a strict single parent who has distrust of rock music and fears about drug use.Unfortunately her children,Anita and William does not approve of their mother and has created tension in their relationship. Anita drops out of school and becoming a stewardess.While William uses his love of rock & roll by writing for a local underground newspaper. His work attracts the attention of Lester Bangs, editor of renegade rock magazine Creem.Lester takes William under his wing and gives him his first professional writing assignment which happens to be covering a Black Sabbath concert. William is unable to score an interview with the headliners, the opening act, Stillwater, are more than happy to chat with a reporter, even if he's still too young to drive, and William's piece on the group in Creem gains him a new admirer in Ben Fong-Torres, an editor at Rolling Stone. Torres offers William an assignment for a 3,000-word cover story on Stillwater, and over the objections of his mother, and after some stern advice from Bangs (who says under no circumstances should he become friends with a band he's covering), Williams joins Stillwater on tour, where he becomes friendly with guitarist Russell Hammond and singer Jeff Bebe. William also becomes enamored of Penny Lane, a groupie traveling with the band who is no older than William, but is deeply involved with Russell.The film has great performances from the ensemble cast especially Kate Hudson,who won as Oscar in it.Also,we get to see Crowe's impressive grasp of the rock and roll music industry - the world of sex,drugs and rock and roll - as well as the definition of cool and uncool.He provides great scenes that will bring the viewer an understanding of the world of rock and roll seamlessly and without complexity.Overall,this is an accurate and realistic portrayal of music during an era depicted in this picture.",Almost Famous
13,hitchcockthelegend,"Hopes, Dreams & Nightmares.",9,13 July 2015,"Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's paean to rock music, of bands and songs, of journalism and promotion, of sex & drugs. Drawing from experience and stories passed on, Crowe tells the tale of a young teenage boy aspiring to be a music journalist in the 1970s. Finding himself backstage with the rock group Stillwater, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) embarks on a road journey with the band that's awash with egos, groupies, perils and pleasures, all of which change his life forever.Lets go find something real!The most striking thing about it is that it's not overtly funny or sensationalistic, it's a production that's full of love, real love, for the subject matters to hand, and it's very often a moving experience to be part of. Narratively speaking, Crowe takes his time, steadily building characters and backdrop essentials, it works a treat as we become immersed in all the major players within the music circle, while also feeling the concerns of those on the outside of the rock group circle. Which of course gives us the great rewards come the final third of film when all matters come to a head. Crowe and his design team also work some magic for period flavours, capturing the early 70s vibe with awareness of clothing, food and drink and transport. Nothing ever seems false, which is remarkable in this era of product placements and shameless plugging. 50 bucks and a case of beer! Another one of Crowe's strengths is how he garners great performances from his actors. There's no big stars here, no Tom or Renée, but Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Kate Hudson and Fugit, who respond to their director with sincere and believable performances, no caricatures or ham sarnies here, no way. While outskirt performances from Frances McDormand (brilliant as William's fretful mother), Anna Paquin, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the legendary Lester Bangs) and Fairuza Balk, consistently hit the hi-hat. The music of course rocks, from metal and progers, to folkers and bubblegum, to some punk godfathery, these sounds feature on the soundtrack and kick the decade into orbit - while the Stillwater scenes are effective and the use of Elton John's Tiny Dancer will land in your heart and stay there.Cameron Crowe has created a smashingly memorable film that will stand the tests of time. Two cuts are available, where both the theatrical and director's cuts are sure fire things (the latter Bootleg Cut my personal favourite). This is a music based film to sit with the best of them, God Bless Rock N Roll and God Bless Cameron Crowe, for he could have easily embellished and over egged his rock pudding, instead he kept it real. 9/10",Almost Famous
14,Theo Robertson,"Entertaining In A Subtle Way , But ...",6,31 August 2004,"... Ultimately shallow and possibly egocentric I find it difficult to review ALMOST FAMOUS because I find it difficult to understand what sort of genre it falls into . Black comedy perhaps
Let`s look at the good points first . ALMOST FAMOUS has a very subtle barbed wit to it like the clever one liners via the groupies ( They don`t call themselves because they only perform oral sex on rock stars ) and Francis McDormand`s performance as an anti rock and roll reactionary , and a band who are at heart a bunch of bitchy prima donnas man . These aspects could oh so easily be overdone which would have absolutely ruined the movie . I was also impressed with the early 70s rock and roll hedonism of being invited to house parties . Things like that don`t happen too often nowadays ( I doubt if they happened in the early 70s either ) , I mean would you invite Gary Glitter or Pete Townshend to a party at your house ? Especially if you had a computer lying about somewhere . That`s rock and roll for you
Ulitimately though ALMOST FAMOUS is rather empty and shallow a problem I had with this director`s latter movie VANILLA SKY  . Worse there`s a suggestion that Cameron Crowe is flaunting with the audiences wish fufillment of going on the road with a rock band who know how to enjoy themselves . Want to tour with the 70s answer to The Dandy Warhols ? Crowe has done it for real and he wants everyone to know it via his thinly disguised character of William Miller who is a surrogate of himself . Is it modesty that stops this teenage journalist being called Cameron Crowe or is it the possible threat of legal action ? Call it a case of sour grapes but I don`t honestly think ALMOST FAMOUS deserves to in the top 250 IMDB movies chart . I award it six out of ten",Almost Famous
15,preppy-3,"Boring, stupid, clichéd",4,18 September 2000,"Good acting is the only thing this movie has going for it. The story is very predictable--a young 15 year old tours with a rock band to do a piece for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine--along the way he grows up, learns life lessons, yadda yadda yadda. The story was dull, and clichés were flying fast and furious. Possible SPOILERS ahead! I groaned when there was an actual sequence of someone running alongside a plane and waving goodbye to their girlfriend--that was being laughed off cinemas in the 1940s. I totally gave up on the film during a sequence in which the group is in a plane, hit a storm, think they're going to die and (of course) start screaming out secret to each other. It also includes an ugly homophobic moment. The only good part was Kate Hudson's wonderful Oscar-nominated performance. This was also a big bomb--critics (for some reason) liked it but audiences rightfully stayed away. Worthless movie--Crowe has done much better.",Almost Famous

It has a lot of acting talent going for it too; Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, Kate Hudson, Noah Taylor etc. Pretty much every major character is played by a talented actor/actress.

He starts out trying hard to interview them, but quickly finds out it's hard enough just trying to keep up with the band. He meets a girl, a groupie who doesn't admit to being a groupie, and falls in love with her. This is a great movie about the environment of the music of the mid-sixties. A very insightful look into the world of groupies, drugs and rock'n roll.

He reveres them and respects them to the detriment of them as people. His women characters don't seem like living creations, but rather like fantasy constructions, which has the exact opposite effect from the one he intends.But still, this film is worth seeing for two things: the performances of Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Grade: B",Almost Famous
20,ferguson-6,So You Wanna Be A Rock 'n Roll Star,9,29 September 2000,"Wow! This movie is a must for anyone who grew up in the early to mid 70's and lived for Rock 'n Roll.  Writer and Director Cameron Crowe (rent ""Say Anything"") captures the essence of life on the road with an on-the-rise, opening act band called Stillwater.  The cast is amazing.  Young genius and want-to-be rock critic William, is being raised by an overprotective, loving-to-a-fault mother played superbly by Frances McDormand.  William, 15, is sent by Rolling Stone magazine to follow Stillwater and submit an article for publication.  This is his first big break after writing for a local rag. William is quickly adopted by the band and their band-aids - ""we're not groupies.  we love the music"".  William falls for Penny Lane, played with amazing screen presence and charm by Kate Hudson (daughter of Goldie Hawn). One big problem: Penny Lane is in love with Russell Hammond, the leader of the band.  Russell is expertly played by Billy Crudup, who captures the feel of an artist struggling with potential fame (hence the film title).  He knows he's good, but hides his fear of success behind ""loyalty"" to the band. A few great moments in the movie occur when Jason Lee, as the lead singer, comes to grips with the fact that he is not the main attraction in the band; the hilarious confessions that occur at 25,000 feet; Crudup's ""I am a golden god"" moment; and the mom and daughter reunion on the front porch.  The real scene stealer of the movie, however, is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs, a hack rock reporter, who thrives on his high level of uncool.  Yes, it seems Hoffman has been in every third movie over the past 3 years, but face it, he can ACT!  His gems of wisdom to the doubting William are priceless.  A couple of interesting side notes are Nancy Wilson (of Heart fame) contributed the original music, and Peter Frampton provided some Rock Bank technical advice, as well as a small role, and I assume was responsible for the Humble Pie references.  Don't miss the real Jann Wenner (editor of Rolling Stone) in a cameo as a taxi passenger.  Go see this one!!!",Almost Famous
21,anaconda-40658,Crowe's Musical Masterpiece.,10,16 September 2015,"Almost Famous (2000): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Philip Seymour Hoffman: Brilliant film about individuals who gain a taste for fame and never really swallow its illusions. A rock music journalist receives opportunity to accompany Stillwater on their tour. He learns the truth about fame when he informs a groupie that she was sold for a case of beer. She brushes back a tear and asks, ""What kind of beer?"" His mother is so overprotective that when a band member claims that she freaked him out, he is really voicing his respect. Director Cameron Crowe skillfully makes the event both uncertain and real. This is his followup to Jerry Maguire, both films deal with individuals dealing with higher powers and their resolution through reality. Patrick Fugit brings a love for music and the honesty to see it through. Frances McDormand is a dominating presence as his mother. Kate Hudson wishes to be realized but Fugit observes more humanity in her than in the band she follows around. Billy Crudup is outstanding as a confused rocker who takes a liking to this young journalist due to his level head and honest nature. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a great cameo as a rock journalist who delivers the blunt news about what the industry really is. An astonishing masterpiece of fame, exploitation and a complete reality check. Score: 10 / 10",Almost Famous
22,zetes,Destined to be Incredibly Overrated,5,22 September 2000,"Ah, the year 2000. What a God-awful year for the cinema. Can it possibly get any worse than it has been already? In truth, it will probably get better as we now move into Oscar Season.And here is the first major film contending for Oscars, already touted by many a critic as one of the best, if not the best, film of the year. It is possible that it will pick up some. I myself am praying to God that it is entirely ignored. Well, mostly ignored, because there is at least one decently Oscar-worthy performance in the film. But most of it is medium-par Hollywood filmmaking at its best. At its worse, it is a sitcom.Okay, let me do a pros vs cons list for Almost Famous:Pros: Okay, the one very good performance in this movie belongs to Billy Crudup (playing a rock guitarist named Russell Hammond). I have never seen him in a movie before, but I commend him to the utmost for bringing the character of Ashitaka to life in the corrupted American version of the Japanese animated masterpiece Princess Mononoke. In Almost Famous, he is probably the most fully developed character, even more fully developed than the film's two ""main"" characters, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Crudup is the only actor in the cast who is capable of being funny without trying to look like he is funny. He emits an aura of apathy, as his character requires, in a very natural and believable manner. The only scene in the film which attains greatness, the only scene which is not going to be out of my mind entirely by the time I go to bed tonight, is the one where Russell, sick with the way the band is going, goes to the house of some Topeka teenagers who are having a party. I won't give the scene away, since it is the best scene of the movie, but it is amazing. It works both dramatically and, especially, it is successful as comedy. Other highpoints in the movie...well, there aren't all that many. It sometimes has a nice mood to it, but there was always something coming up to ruin it. There were a lot of great songs, but they were poorly used. Oh yeah, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it and he was great, but he had too few scenes, so he in no way could save the movie.Okay, well, it seems that I've already gotten into the cons, so let me proceed  with them: SPOILER ALERT Poorly judged comedic moments were frequent. A groupie, oh, sorry, ""Band-Aide,"" is running after the tour bus to tell William something, and she crashes into another bus when running. This isn't a slapstick comedy, so this scene just shouldn't have been in here. That had to have hurt a lot, and we should be aware of that, even though I'm willing to bet that nobody in the audience was. Francis McDormand, often a great actress, just see Fargo or Blood Simple or Mississippi Burning, is extremely annoying as an unbelievably insane mother. There are many moments involving her character which are supposed to be funny, but just ended up making me cringe with discomfort. The only scene where humor involving her character succeeds is when she talks to Russell Hammond on the telephone, and that scene is only very successful because of Crudup's good performance. And the single biggest misstep of the entire movie was the scene where the band's plane gets caught in a storm, everyone thinks they are going to die. So what do they do? I bet you've already guessed that they start to tell each other truths. Oh yes, where have I seen this before? Perhaps the last episode of Seinfeld, but it has been done many times before that. Patrick Fugit has a nice moment where he accuses the band of having used Penny Lane. It happens during a scene which could potentially ruin the movie, so that speech does a little to save the scene. But Crowe thought he just had to top it off with the drummer confessing that he's gay. Wow, that had to take some genius to write. Then of course, the second he screams that, the pilot opens the cockpit door and says, ""Don't worry folks, everything's going to be okay!"" And, if you have any insight into the natural artificiality of the film world in the first place, you'll notice how much of a set the airplane is in the first place.Lots of name-dropping. Every two minutes, someone is screaming, ""Hey, there's David Bowie"" or ""Robert Plant is on the second floor"" or ""Black Sabbath is going to be here tonight"" or ""Bob Dylan sat down with us last night."" Of course, they don't appear in the movie (well, the tambourine player from Humble Pie does). They couldn't. We know what Bob Dylan looked like in 1973. They couldn't have gotten an actor to play him successfully, and of course they could never have gotten away with a cheap Forrest Gump technique of inserting celebrities into their movie. So what does this name dropping do for the picture? It becomes distracting, and thus harms greatly the pacing.Performances: well, this is perhaps the biggest category. Only the two leads need to be discussed. Patrick Fugit is a newcomer, and he is the very main character, so his performance is what makes the film. Well, he's not terrible, but he's certainly not up to it. His main problem is that his face has only one expression: insanely happy. Oh, those dimples! He's a very warm person to look at when his character is supposed to be happy. But when it is supposed to be anything else, I just couldn't accept him. When he chooses to tell Penny Lane the truth near the end of the film, he has to be a little cruel, but the performance cracks here.Okay, the biggest failure of the film is the acting, character, and the whole situation involving Penny Lane. The acting first off: Kate Hudson is a complete bimbo. Okay, so her character was, too. But when they tried to give her depth, it never worked, because Kate Hudson has no depth. Of course, many a teenage boy is going to go to bed thinking of her after they have seen this movie, but the script required more depth from her than she could produce. She deserves porn, no more. My suggestion would have been to switch Hudson with Anna Paquin, an Oscar winner at the age of 11, who played another ""Band Aide."" She was absent for a while, but she came back earlier this year with the best performance in X-Men, although the movie failed generally. She would have brought much more depth to Penny Lane. Of course, a blond was needed, because that is what sells.Now, the whole ""Band Aide"" situation was horribly misogynistic. It does happen, surely, but Crowe is attempting to justify it throughout the film. Oh, they aren't just, how do I put this delicately, free hookers. Groupies, we're informed, just want to sleep with someone famous. Band Aides are fans, and because they are fans, they help the band. With what, besides to boost their egoes? Crowe tries to have William Miller defend Penny's honor, but that theme never goes anywhere. He never seems sufficiently offended at what they are doing, the band or the hookers. At the end, the whole situation still basically seems acceptable. Of course, if Cameron Crowe actually did have the orgy with the three band aides as his effigy did in the film, I can see why he is not offended. Of course, that scene is lifted straight out of pornography anyway with no connection to the real world.Add to all this a dozen or so other cliche scenes, and you have yourself a bad movie, worth no more than 5/10.",Almost Famous
23,deloudelouvain,I guess rock 'n roll is boring then.,5,17 January 2021,"One Oscar and three nominations for another Oscar, I guess the year 2000 wasn't a good year for movies if they didn't find anything better than Almost Famous. I think I watched the extra long version, the director's cut, and I wish I didn't. It just was way too long for this story. A story where almost nothing is happening. If that is the rock 'n roll life they want to portray I guess it's a pretty boring life. The film editing was good as was the whole cinematography, but not Oscar worthy in my opinion. As for the acting, yes it wasn't bad, but certainly not award winning performances either, for that there are way better acting performances even for the year 2000.

As you can see director Cameron Crowe really makes this a film of exploring it's like it's a coming of age film. This film is blended well with drama and comedy as it is set in the world of rock and roll. All of it starts when a young teenage reporter named William gets the chance of a lifetime and lands an assignment to cover rock for the legendary ""Rolling Stone"" magazine and objections are everywhere from his strict and overprotective mother played by the good Frances McDormand. Still William hits the road with an up and coming rock band to discover more about life and music it's really a double dip of material for him to write about.And to round out the cast is in good supporting form with Kate Hudson as a rock girl groupie and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as an adviser to young William and the soundtrack captures the film times of the 1970's just so well.

28,KineticSeoul,"""incendiary""",9,10 August 2013,"This is probably one of the best semi-autobiography film I seen and probably the best work by Cameron Crowe so far. It just absorbed me from the beginning, although it has mostly non well known actors and actresses at the time. Just about all of them stood out, even the ones that didn't have much screen-time. This could have gone in the typical and predictable sex, drugs and rock n' roll direction. Sure it has sex, drugs and rock n' roll. But it goes in more of the insight direction and realistic direction. When it comes to the rock band, money, jealousy, marketing, trying to be cool and image. All of it was just so darn entertaining and intriguing to watch from the perspective of a young naive and innocent boy trying to make it as a journalist. In the story it focuses in on this young journalist boy going on tours with a fictitious rock band called Stillwater. And the journey although it has the typical sex, drugs and rock n' roll elements. It does although focuses in on the inner areas of the rockers the groupies or band aids and the obstacles they go through. Although most of the tour is full of booze, drugs and sex. But it doesn't go in a dark, depressing and hardcore direction. This is more lighthearted, mellow and laid back. All the elements fit together well, the chemistry and the conflicts are well blended together superbly. This film just seemed to have the right flow to it. And I personally kinda got attached to some of the characters during their journey or tour. Overall this is one of the best going with the group, getting attached and coming of age type of film I thoroughly enjoyed. If you know the bands in the 70's and the music in this movie, chances are you will probably enjoy it even more with the references.9.3/10",Almost Famous
29,ThomasDrufke,"""It's all happening""",10,14 September 2014,"I think at one point or another we all want to be famous. Whether it's being an actor, singer, or an athlete we all tend to want to live the life of a famous person. Almost Famous gives us a breathtaking view of the music industry and one kid just trying to write an article for Rolling Stone on the band Stillwater. When you get past the fact that a 15 year old being allowed to travel with a band, and even getting an article published by Rolling Stone, it's a masterpiece of a film. It takes a little while before each actor settles into their role. I wasn't too keen on the newcomer Patrick Fugit for the first hour but he really stepped it up in the second half.Billy Crudup gives his best performance that I have seen so far and Kate Hudson is great in her career defining role of Penny Lane. The family dynamic to begin the film was a bit boring and Zooey Deschanel was forgettable but once William leaves with the band everything about this movie becomes great. Frances McDormand was an increasingly sympathetic character and Crudup had a great character arc. Fugit was as good as any child/teen has been in film in a long time and shared many memorable scenes with Crudup and Hudson in which he basically out-shined two Oscar caliber actors.It's very hard to make a great film based on or around the music industry. Almost Famous is one of the few films that take you into the world and time frame but also make you want to go listen to that particular band or genre immediately after. I can't stress how much I enjoyed this film and in particular the last 45 minutes. It was emotionally captivating and renewed my love for film once again. It didn't go too far in exploiting the music industry but it also didn't glorify the life in any way either. It's near perfect filmmaking and filled with career best performances.(edited 9/15/14) After thinking about this movie for a day, I have realized it's a 10/10 not a 9.7. It really shows us how music can actually change people and how it's such a beautiful way to connect with people. A job well done Crowe.+Fugit out-shined the entire cast +Hudson and Crudup give career defining performances +Music based film that works +Last 45 minutes are emotionally captivating +Relatable coming of age story about something not usually relatable -Slow start 10/10",Almost Famous

An adolescent's wet dream travelogue that rings true without the over idealized, impossible scenarios. This is a coming of age movie with a heart and a sincerity shot in a voyeuristic style that doesn't pander. As with Stand By Me (1986), Almost Famous has a complete story arch that defines an experience or an event in one's life and in this case it involves primarily three characters (William, the 15-year old journalist, Penny, the band aid who follows bands because of the music, and Russell, the lead guitarist of a rock band, who themselves end up transformed, along with at least two characters (Elaine, the mother, and Anita, the sister).Besides a liberal offering of wonderful music, the audience is allowed to go along behind the scenes of the potential famous, with the rowdy, unsightly scenes, the male's truly sexual fantasy, the tender and sometimes tense filled moments. Yet all of it is wrapped up in a wonderful package of ultimate awareness, honesty, and sincerity by the end, no matter where it takes us. Other movies that have capture the swirling, turmoil of growing through life include an adult version in Under the Tuscan Sun (2003), a young adult version in Across The Universe (2007) with Beatle's songs as a backdrop, perhaps the more ambitious Slumdog Millionaire (2008), the more complex and dark The Air I Breathe (2007) or the more polished and stylish The Devil Wears Prada (2006) yet each could give credit to the earlier Dances with Wolves (1990) or even the Joy Luck Club (1993) for their connection to life experiences and the human growth.",Almost Famous

34,The-Sarkologist,Life of a Groupie,9,18 July 2019,"This is one of those movies that sort of sneaks up on you. I remember seeing posters of it when it was in the cinemas and simply thought nothing of it, so I basically let it pass me by. In fact I get a feeling that quite a lot of people thought the same. Anyway, it wasn't until I was chatting with a friend who recommended it to me. In fact, it came highly recommended from him, so I did what I could to get my hands on it. Well, fortunately, it turned out that the university library had some copies available, so I hired it and immediately watched it, and yes, it did turn out to be much better than I expected.This film is sort of an autobiography, though of course quite a few things have been changed. This has more to do with the writer actually combining a number of events from his early life into a film to make it somewhat more coherent. The other thing is that a number of the characters are more of a portmanteu of a number of people that he met while he was travelling. However there are other characters, such as Lester Bangs and Ben Fong-Torres, who are real people.The story is about how this child prodigy manages to not only get himself a gig as a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, but also finds himself on the road with this band Stillwater (though it turns out that the character the kid his based on, Cameron Crowe, actually ended up being on the road with some quite famous bands, including Led Zepplin). What has happened is that he has caught the attention of Fong-Torres who offers him a sweet deal to write an article on the band, and this fifteen year old kid finds himself on the tour bus.In a way the story is about this kid, and he is certainly a rather geeky kid, but it is also about this groupie named Penny Lane, who is actually based on a real life person, Pennie Lane - the name was changed to protect her privacy. The film is basically about her, though it is told through the eyes of the boy William. In a way it gives us an insight into what it is like to be a groupie, and in fact it not only shows us the good times, but also how, especially in this time period, they would be traded between bands like commodities. In a sense we get the impression that they are basically tour wives - girls that band members take with them while their real wives are at home.Another thing the film does is that it gives us an insight into what it is like to follow a band around, and that there is more to them than just what we see on the stage, or even in the magazines. In many cases it seems that the relationships can be pretty tenuous at times, and sometimes you feel that the only things holding many of these bands together is the fact that they are making money. Mind you, spending so much time together can certainly have an effect upon people's tolerance of each other - which is probably why when bands split they rarely, if ever, actually get back together, at least not for decades.I guess the reason that I liked this film is because of its realism, but also the fact that we have this kid, this really smart kid, who probably should be aiming to be a lawyer, ending up with a band. It is so ridiculous, so out there, that if it wasn't true we would probably write it off as being absolute rubbish. Yet it happened. The other thing is that the band isn't famous, but famous enough to get the attention of the journalists. And, of course, it is quite interesting to note the contacts that the kid had, though it is clear that his background, and his passion, did pretty much set himself up this this position.Yeah, this movie is certainly one of those hidden gems.",Almost Famous
35,eddie_baggins,"Brilliant at times, too mawkish overall",6,25 March 2020,"Inspired by his own early life as a Rolling Stones reporter and showcasing his great knowledge and love of the music industry, Almost Famous is divisive director Cameron Crowe's most personal film and arguably his most well-liked (in a tight race with audience favourite Jerry Maguire), in what acts as a well-filmed if self-indulgent and slightly over the top experience when watched in today's climate.Able too be made after the huge and surprising success of Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous was a commercial dud when first released in 2000, despite it being well-liked by critics and scoring all kinds of awards nominations, as Crowe shines a light on the 1970's American music scene where the likes of Black Sabbath, The Beach Boys and Cat Stevens ruled the roost.Creating a fabricated band known as Stillwater, that features some great turns from Jason Lee as hard too like lead singer Jeff Bebe and Billy Crudup (as good as his ever been) as deep-thinking guitarist Russell Hammond, Almost Famous is literally like a dreamscape road trip and coming of age movie that sees Patrick Fugit's teenage music lover and writer William Miller fall head over heels for Kate Hudson's band follower and ""band-aid"" hanger on Penny Lane, while learning the ins and outs of Stillwater as he follows them around for a magazine piece.The care of recreating the era and the joys of getting to listen to a rollicking soundtrack ensure that Crowe is able to bring out all the nostalgic feels he can muster of a time long gone by, with those from the time period likely to find great joy and emotion in a tale that will be relatable to many in various forms.Watching the extended version of this well-regarded tale however makes you realise the film harbors more than it's fair share of filler amongst all the great individual scenes, like Hammond's impromptu party attendance or group singalongs of Elton John, as Crowe and his characters often get lost in a procession of scenes that don't add much to the core story and also increase the over the top nature and unbelievable aspects of character decisions and hard to swallow interactions.As is the case with Crowe films, they always fall slightly more too over the top and fake rather than the everyday and believable, even his most iconic moments like John Cusack holding up a boom box or Tom Cruise proclaiming to show him the money are great but very ""Hollywood"" and Almost Famous is filled with such moments, that when watched in an extended fashion begin to wear on the viewer as the best moments are more character focused and far less sugar coated.Final Say -Filled with some great characters and performances, Almost Famous is a great trip down memory lane for music lovers and those that participated in the 70's but 20 year's on from its initial release, Crowe's film shows its flaws more clearly, especially when watched in its extended format.3 badly wired microphones out of 5",Almost Famous

That's 1970 for you and that's ""Almost Famous."" Coupled with some great acting, this is an easy-to-love, care-free drama that embodies the time period it captures quite excellently.""Almost Famous"" is about a 15-year-old high school senior named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who gains an affinity for the rock and pop music of the 60s when his sister leaves him her entire record collection when he's 11. He dreams of being a music journalist and gets an opportunity to write for a magazine by covering Black Sabbath. When he goes to interview the band, he gets sucked into the whirlwind of the roadie lifestyle with a band called Stillwater. He meets and becomes close with the band's guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup) and a ""Band-aid"" who goes by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Of course at the same time he is losing his innocence and he must battle an over-protective mother (Frances McDormand).This is a great cast and writer/director Cameron Crowe has given them great characters. This is easily the best role of Kate Hudson's career so far. She needs to go back to this genre and avoid the terrible romantic comedies. She plays a free-spirited. lovable but deeply troubled groupie and gets your attention in every scene. McDormand is probably the best as the fierce, stern, but loving mother, if not Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a magazine editor giving William advice. Crudup is good too--I've always felt he is one of the more underrated talents in Hollywood, but it seems he has intentionally limited his credits.Crowe most easily accomplishes the 70s look in this film. This movie would not have been as good without it. The soundtrack, the characters, the costumes--it creates a free-loving vibe that is really easy to watch. He takes you on this road trip with the characters in that sense, though the film is not really focused on the music, with very limited footage of them playing shows. Instead this is more about music behind the scenes, especially because it follows William as he tries to get a story from these guys. A lot of what the film goes for is the image of rock stars as opposed to who they really are and whether or not those two things are the same.It doesn't quite reach the level of penetration into the dynamic of a rock band as much as it would seem to and the love subplot between Hudson and Crudup is a little watered down, but it's straightforward at least and gives you a lot of entertaining material. The themes just don't go deep enough and that's really okay--I'd gladly be spared another drug-induced music biopic just for some lack of depth and ""Almost Famous"" is for sure not one of those: there is no demonstration (only mention) of drug use in the entire film.

While it's true that the film was filled with great performances and it had a good story made even better by the fact that it's true, the film as a whole is fairly predictable, due in no small part to the revealing title. Almost Famous tells the story of a young kid who was never popular but who can write, who gets a chance to go on tour with a band called Stillwater, and to basically live like a rock star for a few months. Jason Lee is surprisingly well cast as Jeff Bebe, the lead singer of Stillwater  with that beard and all that hair he makes a really good 70s rock star. Also, Frances McDormand's performance as William Miller's (the young reporter) mother is particularly noteworthy. There is also a good presentation of the whole behind the scenes element of the film, dealing with everything about rock and roll that goes on off stage. You have the drugs, the sex, the big money, big business, the fake people, the deflowering of the inexperienced young reporter, and of course, all of the turmoil that goes on among the band members themselves. And the film takes the necessary step of focusing mostly on one of the band members, Russell (`I never said I'm a golden God'), in order to get a more individualized approach. Also look for Noah Taylor - who played the young David in the excellent film Shine  in Almost Famous as the horribly unattractive Dick Roswell, Stillwater's manager. Probably the best thing about this film was the way that the soundtrack recaptured the time period, especially the way that it threw in a bit about how mothers thought that Simon & Garfunkel wrote songs about sex and drugs, and then one of their beautiful songs is played. It was also nice the way that Black Sabbath was presented. There is a scene where we are backstage with Stillwater and you can hear Black Sabbath on stage, and rock and roll fans are sure to want nothing more than to be able to see them, but at the same time, it's a good thing that Sabbath's appearance was limited to the sound of their music in the background, and that they didn't try to recreate the band the way that Stillwater was recreated. NO one could play Ozzy.
Almost Famous is not a tremendously great film, but the excellent performances along with an intriguing story make it particularly noticeable. Rock and roll fans are sure to love it, and almost anyone could enjoy it for the quality character development and the fulfilling story.",Almost Famous
41,southdavid,Stillwater Runs Deep,8,7 January 2020,"I've had an itching to rewatch ""Almost Famous"" for a couple of weeks now, since having a disappointing time with ""Say Anything"" a little while ago. Though the film wasn't as funny this time, as I remembered it being, it's still a wonderfully performed, warm and entertaining film that I have a lot of time for.With a love of music instilled in him by his sister, High schooler William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is offered an assignment to write about up and coming rock band Stillwater, by Rolling Stone magazine. Somehow convincing his overbearing mother (Frances McDormand) to let him go, William joins the band for several eventful dates and meets legendary ""band aid"" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).I love the performances in ""Almost Famous"". It's a real ensemble film with a deep bench of great actors offering their best here. There are a number of great turns but I think Phillip Seymour Hoffman might just pip everyone with his Lester Bangs, an opinionated critic who serves as Miller's mentor. I like that all the characters have their flaws, their jealousy or ambition. Russell Hammond is a charismatic and magnetic rock star, but he cheats on his wife, discards Penny when it suits him to and tries to kill William's story when it looks like they won't come across as cool (and still I can't help but like him, testament to Billy Crudup's own charisma.The story is solid, if a little lacking in a true narrative thrust - this may stem from the fact some of the stories are lifted from Cameron Crowe's own life. For that same reason, it's maybe lacking the ""consequences"" that the film might have in the hands of another screenwriter, I can see how that would make the film feel slight. It's not as funny as I remembered either, and some of the times it tries to be are a bit flatter than I remembered, Faruza Balk running into a wall chasing the tour bus, for example.I can appreciate that it has flaws, but ""Almost Famous"" hit me at exactly the right point in my life when it could speak to me, and because of that, it has stayed with me since.",Almost Famous
42,Vartiainen,"The era of rock, though the eyes of a critic",8,19 February 2017,"It's the 70s, the golden age of rock-n-roll. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple are on the rise and the genre couldn't be more relevant. Enter one William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a budding rock critic and journalist, who gets a chance from Rolling Stones magazine to tour with Stillwater, one of his favourite bands, with the idea of publishing an article about them. The only problem being that he's a bit young, only 15 years old, which is pretty young for the rocky road ahead.The biggest draw of this film is its absolutely brilliant take on the culture behind rock-n-roll in the 70s. That culture is the real star of the film. It's not even really about the music. The band Stillwater is completely fictitious, as are all of the characters. The other bands sited and the magazine are real enough, but that's about it. There aren't even that many scenes of Stillwater playing in the film. Yet this is one of the best films about music I've seen in my life. Because it takes a certain kind of person to uproot yourself, travel across the country, play and compose music. Not to mention those that travel with them with the sole purpose of supporting the phenomenon that is the band.The film explores this culture in a really great way through the eyes of William. Because he is a critic. He purposefully puts himself in an outsider's position. His self-appointed task is to observe so that he can later tell about it to others. The film would be quite different if it was told from the point of view of Russell, Stillwater's lead guitarist and the second most important character in the film.This is a great film for all lovers of rock and music in general. It's acted and shot really well, but its understanding of culture is what truly elevates it above its peers.",Almost Famous
43,robert-temple-1,"That's How It Was, and It Ain't Comin' Back",10,9 December 2007,"Is there anyone who has seen this film and not loved every second of it? It deserved more than one Oscar. In all its awards, the spectacular cinematography by John Toll was never recognised, though it helped so much to make the movie the success it is. I had a brief acquaintance with Cameron Crowe in Cephallonia, and it was enough to show me that he is 'William Miller grown up'. He is a modest, self-effacing, and quiet guy bursting with imagination and creative vitality, but you would never notice him in a crowd. The brilliant performances he got out of Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit show how talented he is at getting the confidence of young and vulnerable actors, and that is because he listens, cares, and is not an egotist. I was a William Miller myself, though I started a decade earlier than Cameron. I warmed up at 14 by hanging out with the Dave Brubeck Quartet for an evening, mostly talking to Joe Morello the drummer. By 15 I was a disc jockey on a commercial radio station. Later I was, like Cameron, a teenage journalist for a national magazine following crazy creatives around and writing them up, though it was not pop singers, it was comedians (Joan Rivers, Dick Cavett, Maddy Kahn, Rodney Dangerfield, et al.), the sex and drugs were not there, and we were not on tour. Otherwise it was all the same. I have known many Penny Lanes, and saved seven girls from killing themselves, just as William Miller saves his one. That was what we did in those days. All the Penny Lanes of then were so tragic, bewitching, heart-rending. This wonderful film 'brings it all back', and there is not a frame of the film which is not honest and as accurate as a laser-guided missile. It is an ode, a paean, and an elegy to a time when 'this stuff happened'. All 'William Millers', whether they were called Cameron, myself, or others, were in the same world where everything creative was possible. It all ended by the 1980s, when commercial forces crushed 'the tao of things' and created 'the systems', run by accountants of multi-nationals. And since then everything is worse, because of big brother governments, wars on terror, mass surveillance, and everything that is making life no longer worth living in the way it was then. Why did I save those seven girls? Why did 'William Miller' save 'Penny Lane'? For this, the appalling world of today? I guess we can all sit and cry at 'Almost Famous', remembering that was exactly how it was. I must get the director's cut. Or can I bear to be reminded even more? Hats off to Cameron William Miller Crowe. All of us who did a bit of that love you!",Almost Famous
44,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,20 January 2020,"You see a lot of people here calling this one of their favorite movies. It's certainly one of mine. But, twenty years after I've found myself wondering if it's the movie that I like or if it's the music.I mean, it references Lester bangs, and he is played by Hoffman. And it is a Crowe film. But it's about Rolling Stone when Rolling Stone was important and not the hallow shadow of it's former self.And with that tale about Rolling Stone's former glory it tells the story about Rock and Roll before it caved into New Wave, Disco, and was finally washed away with the auto-tune and drum machine bubblegum pop that needs a mass burning in Soldier Field in the near future.But look at the sound track, Simon and Garfunkle, The Who, Iggy Pop, Black Sabbath, Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers, The Seeds, Fleetwood Mac, everyone's favorite Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cat Stevens, and my favorite Elton John song.And those are just the highlights. But, that is a playlist, that is an record collection. Most everyone has an album by one of those bands.And, of course, Still Water is a place savor for the Allman Brothers and in some cases it's so obvious it hurts.So, is it one of my favorite films? Twenty years on do I really love this film or do I love the soundtrack? Do I love the era it portrays when Rock was still relevant and the Rolling Stone still meant something?Honestly I don't know... because, at the end of the day, I do really love this movie. I mean, Frances McDormand is in it... but honestly, I think I just love the music a little more.Fortunately, I am Gen-X, I grew up with Pearl Jam and Nirvana and Green Day. I grew up with grunge and punk and I thank God every day that I turn on the radio that I had worthy bands to follow and record stores were still a part of my life.I'd hate to be my wife's age. I'd hate to be a Millennial. I'd hate to be Gen-Z... but a big part of me would have loved to be a Boomer, would have loved to be my father's age, even with all the problems, just because they got experience all that music when it was still new, still fresh, and the musicians were still in their prime and preforming at the top of their games.So, yeah, I love the movie but I like the music a heck of a lot more.",Almost Famous
45,dfranzen70,I wanna rock and roll all night,8,6 April 2001,"Almost Famous is about the travails of a 15-year-old reporter for Rolling Stone magazine during the 1970's. Based loosely on the early life of director Cameron Crowe (who also brought us Jerry Maguire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High), the story follows young William Miller (who claims at times to be 18) as he tags along with second-level, up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater. Stillwater has it all: a dynamic, egotistical lead singer, a mysterious, laid-back lead guitarist, groupies, and teen angst. 
William's (Patrick Fugit) dream is to become a rock journalist. Now mind you, this is during a time when such things hardly existed. Even Rolling Stone was still in its infancy. He gets his break when a renowned writer with Creem Magazine (played by the inimitable Philip Seymour Hoffman) assigns him to write a story on Black Sabbath. But of course William can't get into the backstage area to conduct his interview - he's 15 and looks about 12. Also hanging around outside, trying to get in, are some very young groupies - ahem, friends of the band - who call themselves Band Aids; their exuberant leader is Penny Lane (Oscar-nominated Kate Hudson).Through quick wits and a sharp mind, William gains access to the band. He doesn't interview anyone from Black Sabbath, but gets to talk to - and eventually befriend - the opening act, Stillwater. And thus William's odyssey begins; his writings catch the eye of an editor at Rolling Stone, and William is assigned the task of doing a full article on Stillwater. Naturally, the band likes him - he's so wide-eyed and innocent, after all, and not as sharklike as many other music journalists - and they take him along. William immediately breaks the first rule of rock journalism - don't be friends with the band.The story is one long coming-of-age-tale for William. His eyes are open, but so is his mind. He is not just some dumb kid who lucks into the spoils of rockdom - he comes off as a serious, but not too serious, kid with a crackerjack brain and unyielding, newfound emotions. It's hard to say who comes off best in this movie. Is it Hudson, who manages to play vampish, slutty, sincere, honest, and mysterious all at once, and convincingly? Is it Frances McDormand, also Oscar-nominated, who's a tower of strength as William's doting mom? How about Crowe's Oscar-winning script? There's nary a hole in it, and it's so rich with detail and life of seventies culture that if you had been there before, you were there again, and if you weren't there then, you're there now. But it's not soaked with so much detail that it's a story unto itself - too many movies are based on atmosphere. This one has the atmosphere, but it acts as a background, not as a character.The movie is charming, bittersweet, delicious, and absolutely delightful. Great fun all the way, and some great music, too!",Almost Famous
46,PWNYCNY,Schmaltz job.,5,9 May 2010,"After attempting to watch this movie I just gave up. I admit it. The story meant nothing to me. Frances McDormand's character meant nothing. The whole rock and roll milieu thing meant nothing. There was simply nothing in this movie that inspired me to want to watch it. Now, the movie is a period piece but it fails to give one a sense that they are watching a story from that period. And the plot and subplots are such that it soon becomes apparent that the movie is really a touchy-feely story masqueraded as a cool, upbeat contemporary comment on generational conflict and is a schmaltz job. Now if one likes schmaltz, then go for it; but if one is not in the mood to watch fluff, then this movie will cause you to ask yourself: Why am I watching this movie? Isn't there something better I can do with my time? Whenever a movie opens with the lead player having a scowl on her face, it is time for the audience to beware. You have been duly warned.",Almost Famous
47,meeza,This One Rocks!,8,28 March 2001,"` Almost Famous' was in almost every critics top ten list. Even though I did enjoy it, I did not think it was of a `we are the champions' material. This film is about a teenage journalist who embarks on a road trip with a 70's rock band named Stillwater and learns much about life and love. Even though some of the male actors which included Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman rocked with their performances- it was the women who `shook me all night long.' Kate Hudson who plays the leader of the girl groupies was `goldie' I mean golden with her performance. Hudson is one of the bright young stars of today, and will be `rocking you baby' for many years to come. Frances Mcdormand who plays the overprotective mother was outstanding.  Even though, I did have `more than a feeling' that she was going to kick ass once again.   Director Cameron Crowe based this film upon his real life experiences when he was a teenage journalist in his hometown of `sweet home San Diego.' It is too bad that moviegoers did not show him the money with `Almost Famous.' I guess Crowe got no `satisfaction.' You could `say anything' you want about Crowe, but I still `single' him as one of the best directors in the business. Even though I enjoyed his last 3 films much more than `Almost Famous', I still think that you should rent it tonight before they almost run out. **** Good",Almost Famous
48,mjneu59,vivid nostalgia for the Age of Rock,6,2 November 2010,"'Almost Famous' is almost a masterpiece, presenting so authentic a re-creation of American musical culture during the 1970s that it deserves to be seen as an act of witness, not unlike the flip side to 'This Is Spinal Tap', but without the mocking satire. The film is a thinly disguised, sentimental flashback to when writer-director Cameron Crowe was a precocious teenage music journalist, coming of age while covering for Rolling Stone magazine the ups and downs of life on the road with the (here fictitious, but entirely convincing) band Sweetwater.First-hand experience and a pitch-perfect memory put Crowe in full command of his material, but it's too bad he couldn't assert the same authority over the editing table as well. The film (like so many these days) is at least twenty minutes too long, thanks (indirectly) to Steven Spielberg, who reportedly urged Crowe to shoot every word in what must have been, for many years, an un-produced pet screenplay. The result is padded by the effort needed to gift wrap and resolve every conflict as neatly and happily as possible, contradicting the director's own message (voiced by character actor, screen chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman as the venerable rock critic Lester Bangs) about good writing being ""honest and merciless"".But never mind. The film was never meant to be too much more than textbook crowd-pleasing fluff, crafted with an affectionate eye for period detail as seen through a not inappropriate rose-colored lens. Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll were never quite such wholesome fun; a distinction is even drawn between the usual clutch of groupies and much more lovable 'band aids' like Kate Hudson, whose fresh, photogenic appeal was obviously meant to charm viewers in much the same demure way that she romances Crowe's love struck young protagonist.So why did the movie, contrary to critical expectations, fail at the box office? Maybe it was the relative lack of charisma in the lead character, an obvious analogue of the writer-director himself, portrayed in this deprecating self-portrait as too bland and unlikely a paragon of journalistic virtue. With a little more edge and depth it might have been a career-making role (think of the unknown Tom Cruise circa 'Risky Business'), but all the skills of young Patrick Fugit aren't enough to fill the featureless gap at the heart of an otherwise lively and colorful cast.Or maybe the film was simply made a decade too late. Crowe wants us to believe, as he does, in the redemptive power of musical expression, a romantic idea fast becoming another anachronistic casualty of push-button progress. Times have changed, and now there's an entire movie-going generation with no nostalgic memory of gatefold album cover art, or the unique thrill of settling a phonograph needle into a virgin groove of freshly unwrapped vinyl.For the sake of audio clarity and convenience (i.e. not having to get up and flip the LP over) we've lost touch with a small link to our collective adolescence. Here's a movie that tries (too late?) to remind us of how we lived back when music really mattered, before it was put on a tight corporate leash and sold, with true Pavlovian skill, as TV ad soundtrack fodder.Maybe, to best appreciate Crowe's slice of cultural nostalgia, you just had to have been there yourself.",Almost Famous

He follows the band on tour, also hooking up with cut-above groupies, one of whom he falls in love with.This is a semi-autobiographical story from Director Cameron Crowe, further aided by people in the music business who gave help and training to add authenticity. Performances are all well-delivered and include lots of fine-shading in the characters. The script seems natural and is never predictable. Most of all, the film probably makes the audience feel the feelings, complete with shades, nuances and time-specific context that these kids in the seventies were going through, their trauma of adolescence, of falling in love, promiscuous sex, the central importance of music and its ability (through teenage eyes) to ""set you free"".Given that the subject matter of the movie is kept pleasant and, objectively speaking, inconsequential, it is all the more remarkable that the film carries such an impact.",Almost Famous

I gagged on the sentiment and schmaltz in the overlong ""Jerry Maguire,"" but his autobiographical ""Almost Famous"" made me fall in love with him again, perhaps this time as a person, not just a director. While the basic story of sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and money have become the 24/7 fodder of VH-1 (including the ""Behind the Music"" segment on his wife and sister-in-law the Wilsons of Heart, which I haven't seen, and its recent TV-movies of fictional and non-fictional bands), this is the wide-screen, four-letter word treatment enveloped in love, nay even worship, of the music and its creators and commentators. It's ""Behind the Music"" in a warm, adult bath.Frances McDormand is simply wonderful as the Mom with guts and love, a character who could have been a shrill shrew in one dimension. Guess I'm getting old when I identify the most with her! Patrick Fugit is an amazing find as Cameron's alter-ego from his road trips with the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin Billy Crudup (inspired by the Eagles' Glenn Frey) could attract even more groupies. Everyone's hair or wigs or whatever look genuine and accurate for a change. The disclaimer at the end of the film is worded differently than most movies, claiming it's a work of fiction, except for the ""Penny Lane"" character as loosely based on the real legendary groupie, which Kate Hudson portrays as quite too angelic (the actress is of legal age, but reminder--the character ain't). Yeah, then what about Philip Seymour Hoffman's impassioned tribute to Lester Bangs? The ""Rolling Stone"" editors? Stranger than fiction so it's true is a key airplane flight to Tupelo Mississippi -- whose symbolism will totally go over the heads of any other member of my extended family if they see it.The audience was mostly teens, and the two other boomers in the audience and I howled at a few references and jokes that went way over Generation Y's heads. The musical choices are a bit idiosyncratic, mixing pop and rock oddly -- rights issues? Evidently the record company is thrilled that Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" is being used as a key motif, with VH-1 showing the entire scene it's used in and a re-release of the single coming, but that's a song I always rated with ""MacArthur Park"" (though yeah now it's in my head).

Look, this is rather a cult movie, though it's clearly not typically a cult movie, but indeed, there are many people who fervently love it, and it certainly was an ideal date movie, so I am not going to rain on anybody's parade, I am not going to knock anything on the screen, it is good enough, but the masterpiece it is purported to be? No way! No way! And Kate Hudson won over so many others for this? I just expected so much more. I wholeheartedly agree with a reviewer named 'squeezebox' who wrote the review ""Lame"" and that is more or less exactly how I felt about Mr Crowe's magnum opus. It's on the tenth page this morning, I'd advise you lot to read it. I wouldn't call it 'lame' because it does have heart and soul and warmth and many good things many other films lack, so it is only by my standards of having expected so much more that I am not jumping up on the bandwagon, pun intended.Anna Paquin stole every scene she was in. Kate has got to have the most expressive bare feet in movie history (the hotel Qaalude overdose losing-consciousness and stomach-pumping scenes), but I guess a stand-in was used. Fairuza Balk also got my attention, some voice the weird chick has got. Seems highly-billed Bijou Phillips dropped out of the project early on, what happened? Big story there, what with all the snide comments I've encountered re her on-set habits. Zooey Deschanel was absolutely wasted in a limited part, she can do oh so much better. Don't let a racehorse pull a milk-cart.In closing, Mr Crowe, hey, it went that smoothly for you? I am an unpublished novelist, and I'm sitting on a book that is actually dynamite, but even just contacting a publisher to give me five minutes of their time is virtually impossible. From what you see on the screen, there is no real talent but the driving force of a love for music, which alone is not unique or even remotely standout, so I just cannot find it remotely convincing. It couldn't have been that easy, unless of course EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ON POT? Of course those were the good old days, when there was still respect in this world.

53,slokes,"Mawkish, Sentimental Tripefest",4,19 August 2006,"Directors are generally egotistical sentimentalists who look back upon their youth with idealized myopia, but few smear the lens of their self-gazing with as much metaphorical Vaseline as Cameron Crowe does in this overblown, half-baked tribute to his days as a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone magazine.Patrick Fugit stars as Crowe alter-ego William Miller, a 15-year-old high-school student who writes articles on rock stars for Creem magazine editor Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Under Bangs' benevolent, inspired tutelage, and with William's mother Elaine (Frances McDormand) driving her boy to Black Sabbath concerts, Miller keeps his balance and doesn't let his writing ""hobby"" interfere with his schoolwork. Then fate intervenes when the big leagues come calling in the form of Rolling Stone magazine, in 1973 the Rosetta Stone for all that was cool. Miller lands himself a prime gig covering a up-and-coming band named Stillwater he has had his eye on for a while, mainly because of a groupie, or ""Band-Aid,"" who calls herself Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He loves her, she loves Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but who does Russell love?You can't say this is a ridiculous plot, since Crowe lived it. But it feels fake in his hands as the director and screenwriter, way too gooey and light. Instead of challenging his audience to accept the real-life grittiness of his surroundings, he sugarcoats everything, serving up shots to show us Penny's gentleness and William's undying love, like when he's about to be treated to a four-way by three of her friends, yet he still looks at her in a long, slow-motion close-up that tells us how pure his love is, and gets the 14-year-old girls in the audience to go ""oooh"" while the rest of us curl our toes. At least I did.The best scenes in the movie involve Hoffman as Bangs. He tells Miller the problem they share at the end of the day is they are both ""uncool,"" the opposite of the randy rockers it is their lot to cover and glorify. But that uncoolness is also a secret strength. ""The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what we share with someone else when we're uncool,"" Bangs explains.Except Bangs' words are hollow as fed through the sensibility of this movie. Miller IS cool, and in every frame we are forcefed his exceptionalism, his true heart, his unblinking eye, his unfailingly right choices, the way he manages to impress everyone he meets. There's no source of conflict within the character, and as played by Fugit, that's a good thing since he doesn't seem up to the demands. Watching him declare his love for Penny for all to hear on a buckling plane, or telling Penny her services were sold to Humble Pie for beer, you actually wince for the amateurish nature of his performance. He's supposed to come off as righteously angry, but Fugit comes off instead as a pathetic whiner.Not much better is Hudson as Penny Lane, beautiful but mostly inert as Miller's love object, offering him her friendship early in the movie for reasons never explained except Miller is apparently too cool to pass up in his uncool way. McDormand gets off some good lines, but she's mostly there for comic relief, and the movie never addresses its biggest logic flaw, why she is introduced to us as a smothering parent but then allows her son to take a year off from school to write about sex-and-drug crazed rockers.There have been movies that capture the 1970s in an immediate and recognizable way, with all its stink and glitz. This is not one of them. Nor, despite Crowe's inside view, does it really capture the real rock world in all its sordidness. Maybe because Crowe was one of those rare people who actually found real love with a rock star, his wife Nancy Wilson, he's the wrong guy to raise questions about short-term rock-based relationships. I for one missed the real moral ambiguity of a story about a journalist called upon to write truthfully about people he genuinely admires but sees through at the same time, the story this movie promises but never delivers.",Almost Famous

Her entire performance was filled with the beauty and the innocence that made up the early 1970's role that she was playing. The most beautiful scene was the eye contact between her and William in the bedroom. It's such a breath taking moment that it is too real to take in. It's pure beauty.,Almost Famous
56,Boyo-2,I don't see what the big deal is,4,28 September 2000,"I enjoyed the movie for the most part.  I was bored by quite alot of it also.  It seems to drag in parts and nothing really happens at all for long stretches of time.  Everyone is acting like this is the greatest thing since spaghetti & meatballs and I don't see it.  I liked Frances McDormand and Billy Crudup's telephone conversation, another phone call between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Patrick Fugit near the end, and the ""Tiny Dancer"" sing-along, and that was pretty much all.Some spoilers: I have a hard time with the idea Rolling Stone magazine would hire someone OVER THE TELEPHONE to follow a band on the road in order to do a major story.  Then I have an even harder time with the fact that the person hired has an over-protective mother who allows him to go on the road.  What's the point of showing her personality and then hoping you'll ignore that?As an Elvis Presley fan, I also found it a little strange that Tupelo, Mississippi gets mentioned in the plane scene, but the fact that the King was born there is not mentioned.  Someone on that plane would have known that; unless Elvis was uncool in 1973. But still.  This is not a major complaint but its kind of indicative of my feelings for the entire movie.",Almost Famous

58,triple8,"paints a lovely portrait of love, life, coming of age and all things rock-n-roll",9,6 May 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:Almost Famous could have been called ""Almost Flawless"" because it's at the level of an instant classic. The film is captivating and earnest and heartfelt. It also contains one of the best scenes I've ever seen on film(the ""Tiny Dancer"" scene.) Not that that was the only flawless scene but it was one moment among several, where this film speaks to it's audience and captures in a minute how rock-n-roll can speak to millions.This is a movie that anyone who is a music lover must see but I think even if one Isn't a music lover they can still enjoy this movie. Somehow, even though this is a movie about rock-n-roll, it has a sweetness about it, a purity, that speaks not only about the music, but about innocence and freedom and honesty. It is without a doubt one of the greatest films about rock-n-roll around.Other positives include a rich array of great one liners(""rock stars kidnapped my son.""), incredible performances from everyone(And though so many have commented on Hudson and I did love her in this, I think Mr. Phillip Seymour Hoffman stole the film a few times-and he wasn't even in it much.), and as mentioned, some utterly perfect, flawless moments. The music is great with some of the best music ever recorded being featured such as ""Tiny Dancer"", ""America""(it IS poetry) among others. Music lovers everywhere will be able to free fall into this movie and see themselves and their fellow music lovers in many of the characters. Music lovers who have never been able to express just why they are a music lover will find it summed up by words, actions and mood in this film-again and again and again. And familiarity will be felt as Penny Lane utters those words:""You are home"".Almost Famous provides numerous moments of comedy and fun throughout it's running time and many people will be happy that Cameron Crowe knew his future and made this movie. I don't think it was perfect, I did feel there were to many short quick scenes where I would have preferred fewer, longer scenes and I also felt the music, as great as it was, could have been even greater, if the songs had lasted Longer or more had been played in their entirety or nearly so. However, the pluses easily outweigh any minuses and this is a great special film and a beautiful tribute to the great great force that is Rock-n-Roll. My vote's 9 out of 10.",Almost Famous
59,Spleen,Almost a movie,6,27 November 2001,"I don't know about you, but I tend to giggle when I hear the phrase ""rock journalist"".  Yeah, right, you're a ""rock journalist"" ... so what's the real story?  Not insightful enough to be a critic?  Too ashamed to admit to being a gossip columnist?We're never told whether the central character in ""Almost Famous"" is wannabe critic or a pretentious gossip.  I suspect the latter.  When members of the band squabble with one another and air their personal grievances, he seems to think it's his business - and for some reason the band's lead singer, like the editor of Rolling Stone, seems to agree with him.  If he had any business there at all, presumably it would be communicating what's valuable about the band's music to Rolling Stone's readers - but then, Cameron Crowe can't communicate this much to the audience.By the end of the film I surprised myself by caring - about groupie Penny Lane, about the integrity and future of the band's lead singer, about whether or not Rolling Stone published the article.  For a film so insipid it's strangely moving.  The New Wave critics would have loved it - all lovely, isolated scenes and perfectly judged performances (not counting Frances McDormand and Billy Crudup, neither of whom has been given anything to work with), slight effect overall.",Almost Famous
60,aimless-46,Toby Tyler Tours with Spinal Tap,7,17 August 2005,"This slightly overrated Cameron Crowe film is not quite on the level of ""Fast Times"" or ""Say Anything"" but does have its moments. Imagine a cross between ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and Disney's Toby Tyler (just released on DVD by the way). Throw in an episode of ""The Saddle Club"" to cover the whole ""Band Aid"" thing. Just as we got to live the dream of joining the circus with Toby Tyler, we get to live the fantasy of a 15 year old boy touring with a famous rock band in 1973.The sad thing is that ""Almost Famous"" could have been a classic if Crowe had been able to cast the actress he wanted (Sarah Polley) in the role of ""Penny Lane"". When Polley withdrew, he had to backfill with Kate Hudson who is not really an ""actress"". Hudson plays the same character she always plays, ""Kate Hudson"". Any resemblance to the screenplay's Penny Lane is accidental, or at least coincidental to ways in which Kate Hudson herself resembles Penny Lane. Since Penny is important to the story, the film is not all that it could have been.However, the Polley backfill had one positive aspect because the excellent Zooey Deschanel replaced Hudson as the sister. This elevated those key bookend scenes several notches. The story features Crowe's standard main character that we identify with because he is flawed and makes mistake after mistake. But in the end we are comforted because everything works out. We like this because it supports our dreams of living a life of benign irresponsibility, where none of our lesser actions have negative consequences. Like movies during the depression, Crowe sells tickets by telling everyone that they'll live happily ever. So in ""Almost Famous"" everyone ends up fine, no lasting effects from drug use, no social diseases, Russell does not fall off the roof, the airplane lands safely, and the characters happily bond in the final scenes. Almost as stupid as the ""Tiny Dancer"" singalong on the tour bus, but sometimes comforting is a good thing.",Almost Famous
61,Movie-ManDan,One of Those Movies That's Uplifting and Relatable.,10,19 February 2015,"Almost Famous. The title is classic. The name alone is legendary like The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Raging Bull, and Scarface. It became a classic right away upon its release in 2000 and rightfully so.Almost Famous has been raved as being the best rock 'n' roll movie ever. It is not about rock, it is a coming-of-age movie with rock being just one of the elements the movie contains. It is about a high schooler in the early 70s named William Miller (Fugit) who has a knack for writing who gets a break as a journalist for a rock magazine. He is able to worm his way into meeting an up-and-coming called Stillwater before they open up for Black Sabbath. His genuine kindness and admiration for the band causes them to ask him to go on a tour with them. Rolling Stone magazine has their eye on him and his mother (McDormand) keeps reminding him, ""don't take drugs."" Sure the story is about a kid that tours with a rock band, but it contains a whole lot more that we can learn from and appreciate. One of the things I love about this is the whole 70s style and classic rock element. Stillwater isn't really that good of a band, but I like their style and overall sound. The song structure and quality just never clicked for me. They have long hair and beards, much like Three Dog Night or Grand Funk Railroad. Miller meets ""band-aide"" Penny Lane (Hudson) who is there ""for the band,"" but he learns lessons about love when he falls for her. He witnesses the chemistry between the band members themselves. This movie takes an excellent glimpse at what life is like on the road, without focusing too much on the sex and drugs. It does have those, but it is able to keep its messages afloat by not focusing on the sex and drugs. We also get a good look into the life of a journalist and into the world of journalism. Writer/director, Cameron Crowe was a teenage journalist who went on tour with a rock band during the 70s. Miller tries to get to know all about the band, its individual members and life one the road with any special situation. Rolling Stone takes his story and puts their own spin to it. That's journalism for you. It happens all the time. These bits are the underlinings of all the wonder, joy and laughter that should be in a movie.4/4",Almost Famous

William Miller goes along for the ride of his life and experiences all the band's life has to offer. The performances are great and Penny Lane was a great piece in the puzzle. There are some great scenes and some okay scenes but overall a decent film. 7.5/10",Almost Famous

Not only did I like the movie ""Jerry Maguire"", I also liked ""Vanilla Sky"", his remake of the famous Spanish movie ""Abre los ojos"". I know many people didn't like that one, but for me it did the trick. So far I hadn't seen any other Crowe movie, but when I saw that this ""Almost Famous"" was programmed by one of our national TV stations, I was willing to give it a try.""Almost Famous"" is a movie about what probably every teenager who loves music, but who isn't good enough to be in a band, dreams about. Getting the opportunity to tour with a famous rock band and all you have to do for it is to write a couple of articles for which you are payed big money, that's exactly what happens to William Miller. He's a 15 year old kid who isn't very popular at school and who is overprotected by his mother, when he is hired by Rolling Stone magazine to tour with the upcoming band Stillwater to write reviews about their concerts. At first he isn't accepted by the band, but pretty soon they become friends and introduce him in the life of sex, drugs and Rock & Roll.I must admit that I didn't expect all that much from this movie at first. I thought this would be a typical coming of age movie and that's not really the kind of movie that I prefer. But I was wrong. This was actually a very enjoyable film, full of good drama and funny moments. And that's not even the best thing this movie has to offer. In my opinion the music was the best reason why you should give this movie a try. If you like seventies rock music, than I wouldn't think twice and watch it. If you hate it, you better leave this movie alone, because than you will not even be able to enjoy the nice acting by all the main actors, let alone the fine story.Overall this is a movie that is a lot better than what I first expected. It has a lot of good things like nice performances, an interesting story, fine music,... to offer and that's what makes this movie better than average and certainly worth seeing. I give it a 7.5/10.",Almost Famous
64,brando647,Cameron Crowe Shares his Experiences; GREAT Movie,9,28 May 2009,"Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical film is a film that leaves you feeling good at the end. It's a coming-of-age story that is loosely based on Crowe's personal experiences; 15-year-old William Miller is a hardcore fan of rock-n-roll and is given the opportunity of a lifetime when Rolling Stone magazine hires him to write on article on the band Stillwater. As a result, Miller hitches a ride with the band on their cross-country tour, befriending the band, sharing in their experiences, falling in love, and chasing his dream. Being a fan of the music of the era, this film had additional appeal to me as Crowe shares his experiences of going behind the scenes to witness the trials and tribulations of a rising band.The casting in this film was fantastic. This film was Patrick Fugit's first feature performance and he did great job as the film's centerpiece, William Miller. The entire film relies on his role and he excels as the naive and dream-driven reporter thrown into the wild world of rock. Kate Hudson is Penny Lane, the carefree leader of the Band Aides (women who follow the band for their love of music). I'm generally not a fan of Hudson's films but she blew me away here; one of my favorite moments in the movie is her reaction to discovering the band traded her for a case of beer. Billy Crudup is Russell Hammond, lead guitar for Stillwater and the only band member to truly befriend Miller. You can't help but sympathize with the star who feels trapped in his current path and can't seem to avoid hurting those he cares about selfishly. With a supporting cast consisting of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, and Frances McDormand and bit parts for Fairuza Balk and Jimmy Fallon, the film is loaded with talent.As I stated, I loved the film's story and the music solidified this film as one of the greats for me. Stillwater's music was written by rock icons such as Peter Frampton and Nancy Wilson (of Heart), giving it a genuine 70's rock feel. The soundtrack is loaded with Led Zeppelin, Elton John, Black Sabbath, and tons more music from the decade to give it the time an authentic feel. I have a hard time finding anything about the movie to dislike as all of these elements combine into a fantastic movie. It should appeal to just about anyone and one would be hard-pressed not to enjoy it. I can easily recommend this movie to just about anyone.",Almost Famous
65,begob,Too many stories,6,3 September 2014,"Long movie, telling a few stories at the same time. Starts with a good but dysfunctional family, then the fulfilment of the ambition of an unassuming schoolboy, then his falling in love with a tragic older woman, and all wrapped up in a dysfunctional hard rock band on the road.Well produced, nice viewing. There's a fair amount of humour, some in-jokes, some good set pieces. Something for everyone, but it never really pushed itself, and all the themes were lukewarm.IMDBers are divided on this, and I can't say one way or the other - the version I watched was very long, way beyond 120 mins, so I guess the writer/director overplayed the autobiog element. Big problem I had was with the music - the band had nothing to do with the good stuff (Led Zep, Elton John, Bob Dylan), so it was impossible to like them. And yet they came nowhere near Spinal Tap insanity.The actors were excellent. Production and editing good.",Almost Famous
66,denis888,Not Perfect But Still Enjoyable,7,2 March 2013,"Movies about rock bands are a tough job to do - the filmmakers either tend to make one endless video clip with little action, or many events but with almost no music. Here, Cameron Crowe made a fine and nice balance between much music and much action. It is a movie for music fans and for those who can easily tell an Iggy Pop song from a Lou Reed one, even if a short snippet is played. Music plays a vital part in this long but fast movie, but still, there is enough room for drama, humor, sarcastic portrayal of rock business, magazine running, journalism, fandom, stardom, groupie-dom, family matters and honesty. The band? Stillwaters? Well, they're a nice bunch of moody hombres and they play a good hard rock. The story? it is not boring and rather realistic. The painful questions of who the leader of the band is are not avoided, too. The ever-present problem of sex-drugs is here, too. But what is good, the movie does not praise the ruinous lifestyle and does not teach youngsters to do the same stuff all the time. I do not remember The Director's Cut well, but the shorter version is very upbeat and goes on quite well. The main stars did a good job - Lee, Crudup, Fugit, Hudson - they all play very well and even if are not rockers or journalists, they do a good and decent performance. The film is highly recommended and good for all who are curious about rock lifestyle, but still not the best, as simply there are none. All such movies will lack certain clarity or just drag, or be not what some of viewers would like to see.",Almost Famous

68,bandw,Witty and warm,10,19 December 2008,"This is based on the real life experiences of director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe who was, as a teenager, a rock music critic for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine in the early 70s. I found the movie so captivating that it totally disarmed any thoughts of criticism I might have.Young Patrick Fugit plays William Miller (the stand-in for Crowe), and his performance is most impressive, particularly given that it is his first in a full length movie. He plays the part of the earnest young journalist with heartfelt sincerity. I am sure that landing the responsibility on Fugit to essentially carry this movie was a gamble on Crowe's part, but it paid off handsomely. The film is filled with some truly wonderful performances. Francis McDormand plays William's mother, a university professor who is concerned about her son's zeal for the devil rock 'n' roll, and concerned about his wanting to be in the scene as a journalist. McDormand has a great sense of comedic timing while all the time playing a serious person. A large part of her success is that she is given some great lines. When she drops William off at a rock concert as the crowds are entering the arena she comments, ""Look at this, an entire generation of Cinderrella's, and there is no slipper coming."" And, after William does not show up on an agreed upon schedule, she announces to her class, ""Rock stars have kidnapped my son!"" But the quality that most endears her to us is that she so loves her son that she is not going to stand between him and his passion. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a marvelous performance as the over-the-top rock critic Lester Bangs, who is a mentor for William. Add to this an Oscar-nominated performance by Kate Hudson as a groupie and good work by Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, and Noah Taylor and you have one hell of a cast.But another star is the rock music soundtrack. If this music was the soundtrack of your youth, then you will find this film irresistible; if not, maybe it will open you up to a new appreciation.An acid trip, a drug overdose, and the complications of lax sexual behavior are touched on, but not in a way that seriously intrudes on the overall good feelings evoked.I hated to see this end. There are many memorable scenes, like the group sing of Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" on the bus. And Kate Hudson's solitary dance on an empty stage after a successful concert, to the music of Cat Stevens' ""The Wind,"" is priceless. I just wish that that scene had gone on a lot longer.Ultimately William faces a bit of a moral dilemma. He has grown to like the band he is writing about and has become somewhat of a mascot to them. There are some things to write about that would make the band look not too good. He can be truthful and get his story published or write a puff piece as a fan and stay in the band's good graces. I imagine that this was a seriously difficult decision for Crowe in his day, but all's well that ends well in this film.I can't be objective about this film, nor do I want to be.",Almost Famous

And he's in love. And...? Okay the rest is different except that he's really working hard to be a success and he's around performers and... Anyway ""it's all happening."" By the way, that should be ""It's all happening at the zoo"" a lyric from the Simon and Garfunkel album in the opening scene.Okay, okay. I'm having a little trouble with this one. I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only ""(my) rock and roll fantasy."" However I don't care. I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of ""Penny Lane,"" sweet flower child groupie, ""seamstress for the band"" (to borrow a lyric) who has a ""rock and roll record"" to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there. And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself. (Is writer and director Cameron Crowe again reprising his youth as he did so well in the script for the now classic coming of ager, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)?)Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996). I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love. Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic. Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic. The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original. The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines. (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: ""You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle."") Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration. Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands. And nothing was done in a routine manner. Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed. I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel. Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.",Almost Famous
72,sme_no_densetsu,A feel-good movie tailor-made for classic rock fans,8,31 March 2009,"Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" is a semi-autobiographical journey back to the early seventies when he started out as a teenage contributor to Rolling Stone. Here, fifteen year old William Miller (Patrick Fugit) gets a chance to join emerging band Stillwater on the road in order to write an article for Rolling Stone. Things don't go smoothly, though, and William soon starts to feel that he's in over his head.The cast is a good one with a couple of standout performances. Both Kate Hudson & Frances McDormand were nominated for Oscars. I think that Hudson delivered arguably the best performance (both of the film and of her entire career) but there was also considerable talent in supporting roles, including memorable performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup & Jason Lee.Unsurprisingly, Crowe and his wife, Nancy Wilson of Heart, made sure that the film was not deficient in the music department. The soundtrack includes heavy hitters like Led Zeppelin & the Who along with gems from the likes of the Seeds & Brenton Wood. The original music of fictional band Stillwater fits in pretty well among these vintage tracks, though it isn't as memorable by any means.Crowe's direction is well-handled throughout. He doesn't go out of his way to shoehorn unique visuals into the film; instead, he exercises taste in letting the story dictate the approach. It's also worth noting that his screenplay won him an Oscar. It shows the touch of a true music lover and provides an entertaining plot to take us through the crazy world of seventies rock.""Almost Famous"" should appeal to anyone interested in a humorous and heartfelt coming of age story but it is also one of the best rock & roll movies ever.

73,Howlin Wolf,Enjoyable trip back to a different age.,8,14 November 2001,"Despite having previously seen only one of his films (Jerry Maguire) I still feel qualified to assert that I can always count on Cameron Crowe to take me to a place that is at once realistic, yet also serves nicely as escapist fiction that provides a buffer from the harshness of everyday life.""Almost Famous"" takes much the same tone as ""Jerry Maguire"", yet adds the personal touch for those who felt the latter to be a bit contrived.The result is, for the most part, wholly entertaining. Great acting is displayed by most of the ensemble; and Crowe once again delivers an object lesson in screen writing to many a Hollywood hack. Again, as with ""Jerry Maguire"", the soundtrack is great too.I wasn't disappointed in the least after my expectations of this. I did, however, muse that I might have enjoyed it even more had I been alive to experience firsthand the era that ""Almost Famous"" takes such an affectionately nostalgic look at. Hence ""Almost Famous"" is a couple of stars away from the 'perfect 10'; and I regard ""Jerry Maguire"" as being the better film because I believe it might have a broader appeal. Still, it doesn't miss out by much, and remains well worth seeing. 'Almost' as good as the hype...",Almost Famous
74,pyrocitor,Are you Experienced?,9,15 September 2006,"In 2000, writer director Cameron Crowe rocked audiences worldwide with his semi-autobiographical portrait of a 15 year old commissioned as a rock journalist for Rolling Stone magazine to profile one of the nation's hottest up and coming bands (the fictional ""Stillwater"") while accompanying them on tour. While doing so, he discovers much more about the whole environment and world of music, as well as more about himself and the state of the world in general. This kind of a tale in the hands of a different director might have come across as an overly sentimental rant, but no one was born to tell this story than Crowe, who essentially lived the life of William Miller during his adolescence. Because the movie is so closely based on his own true-life experiences, the film shines in the realism department. One literally gets the feel of being right there, catapulted into the 70s rock music scene, as if trailing behind Miller as his invisible friend or something along those lines. The film isn't necessarily constructed in a typical Hollywood fashion, but instead seems much more like a chronicle, a journal entry brought to life. As such, the storyline may seem a bit jumpy, and certain parts may seem underdeveloped or missing bits, but in a way this also only adds to the journal entry feel of the film, as if Miller only bothered to remember the parts of his story that were the most graphic or outstanding, so it's only a minor criticism. But what really makes the film excel apart from Crowe's spectacularly believable narrative and excellent screenplay is the soundtrack, pumped full of old rock and roll classic hits such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple and Elton John than any self respecting rock fan should be belting out the lyrics along with. Crowe has a tendency for choosing excellent soundtracks, and Almost Famous is perhaps the best example, the superb selection of songs truly cementing the feel and groove of the period, so to speak, as well as all the pitch perfect costumes and outrageous outbreaks of facial hair which truly scream ""Seventies"". Adding to the foray of talent, the superb cast really bring Crowe's sentimental source material to life in a truly vivid and memorable fashion. Newcomer Patrick Fugit is wonderful in an understated yet charismatic fashion as William Miller, Crowe's film counterpart, the young, idealistic rock journalist who finally gets his big break. Billy Crudup gives a superb performance as the band's guitarist, in many ways the stereotypical rock star, yet far too well written and grounded in realistic quirks and mannerisms to be passed off as such. Similarly, the always terrific Jason Lee is great and often hilarious as Stillwater's lead singer. Kate Hudson is luminous as mysterious ""Band Aid"" Penny Lane. She seems to be a beacon of shining light amidst the dark and sleazy world of music, sex, drugs and alcohol, easily deserving her Golden Globe win. Notorious scene stealer Philip Seymour Hoffman arguably walks off with the show with a simply wonderful and inspiring as the world weary yet inspiring writer Lester Bangs; Hoffman's brief appearances are so injected with charisma and likability one can't help but take to his character. Look also for brief appearances by Anna Paquin (as a fellow ""Band Aid""), Zooey Deschantel as Miller's rebellious sister who introduces him to rock and roll, and Jimmy Fallon as Stillwater's new manager. Almost Famous is, above all else, one of the most believable films in recent history. Crowe seems to transport us right back to the crazy hazy days of the mid 70s, where everyone searched for significance and meaning in the mundane. But Almost Famous is so much more than simply a story about a band, it is a charming and insightful commentary on the state of the period's youth, and an entertaining coming of age story as well. For those who have yet to see it, Almost Famous is an experience well worth delving into, it may end up sticking with you quite a long time.-9/10",Almost Famous
75,Xstal,Sin Gas...,3,24 November 2020,"Mostly awful, flat and exceedingly dull. Whenever actors masquerade as musicians, whenever music and bands play a central theme to any film, the unrelenting garbage and homogenous drivel that results is incredibly out of touch with reality and relevance and this certainly doesn't break that rule.",Almost Famous
76,RNMorton,Almost Great,8,15 July 2001,"Pleasant story of talented high-schooler who gets to cover up-and-coming rock band on Rolling Stone assignment.  Not sure if it wanted to be an expose or love story - the band stuff is all pretty familiar, the more intriguing angle is the one between youngster Fugit and worldly Hudson. Hudson has a great screen presence, even in the trailers;  she drives the movie and shows real real star potential.  Fugit is competent but his role is written a bit too mature and reserved; you never quite feel his naivete, confusion or anguish regarding Hudson.  The basic concept of the movie is unusual & good, the cast is fine and the music is solid.",Almost Famous
77,mossgrymk,almost famous,8,16 April 2021,"Almost a great film, denied that exulted status, in my opinion, by a tendency to caricature (i.e. Every scene that features Frances McDormand) and an even more fatal predilection for the overly adorable. I mean. Movies about the music industry, especially rock in the early 70s, should not render all its subjects into warm and fuzzy animals! However, and it's a big however, writer/director Cameron Crowe invests these too idealized creatures with enough humor, perception, and self deprecation so that you like and care for them at the same time you wish they possessed a harder edge. And the acting, with the notable exception of McDormand, is fantastic. Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup have never been better, Patrick Fugit is so good in the difficult role of the Callow Youth that one wonders why his career went nowhere and Philip Seymour Hoffman again makes one wish that suicide was more preventable. Give it a B plus.",Almost Famous
78,DunnDeeDaGreat,One of 2000's best movie,7,15 June 2002,Almost Famous is a great movie even if you don't like rock & roll. Patrick Fugit as William is great in his first role as are seasoned verterans like Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson. The direction by Crowe is very good and he is very well informed about the music. I'm proud to have this movie in my DVD collection.,Almost Famous
79,mstomaso,Very good if you view it in its proper context,8,10 December 2005,"Almost Famous follows the adventures of young rock journalist William Miller (a character loosely based on the experiences of writer/director Cameron Crowe in the same role during the 1970s) as he tries to get his first big story. He is coached by the legendary Lester Bangs, who is wonderfully played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Rolling Stone has offered him a cover and is funding his tour with Stillwater. Stillwater is a proletarian hard rock band apparently based on the Allman Brothers that has just begun to make it big.What this film does brilliantly is to situate the viewer in its action. The film is shot from the perspective of a relatively clear-headed fifteen-year-old - our protagonist is too good to be true, some of his experiences are just a bit fantastic, and the love triangle between Fugit, Crudup and Hudson has magic around its edges. Yet the whole film has an almost voyeuristic truthful feel to it. Notably, this is all done with third-person perspective, so the manipulations are barely noticeable.The performances are great all-around, with Crudup, McDormand, Lee and others playing the archetypal characters of the 1970s to the hilt - rock stars, well-intentioned but somewhat oppressive moms, and groupies. Fugit and Hudson are removed from their time and context through the timelessness of the theme they share - the honest love of two good friends who respect each other too much to allow their friendship to develop into something potentially destructive. The uniquely REAL bond between these two stands in bold relief against the backdrop of unreal, delusional and pretentious relationships created by drugs, celebrity, and the road.The photographic technique is so subtle that it is difficult to make yourself aware of it. The script is more or less flawless, and the pace of the film is fine - neither too brisk nor plodding.Though autobiographical, this film doesn't fit solidly into any specific category. It's mostly a coming of age story, but has forceful elements of road movie, romantic comedy and period piece. There is also some confusion about what the film is about. Some say its about rock and roll. I disagree, but I think my disagreement stems from the fact that of all of this films elements, rock and roll is one of the one's which interest me least. Upon reflection, however, I can also say that the critique the film offers of the '1970s scene' in rock is dead-on accurate, and more truthful than many of the other films I have seen which claim to represent it (The Filth and The Fury being one of the better exceptions).I guess we'll stick with the catch-all - drama. In short, this is a well-made, thoughtful and entertaining film which can be enjoyed from a number of different perspectives, even if you're not a big fan of its general themes. Recommended.",Almost Famous
80,kevin c,"not much SEX, a few DRUGS & ROCK'N'ROLL",5,12 February 2001,"A cast of relative unknowns does allow the film and story to grab the lead mike. And you can always rely on McDormand and Seymour Hoffman to provide strong backing. It's a good sign when you laugh at the gags, that you've already seen numerous times in the film's trailer. Crowe can write a good script, and compared to usual multiplex fare; that's a significant improvement.

It was a fine story and all, but there was nothing *really* special or really intense about it.

83,hall895,Almost perfect,9,26 July 2005,"Cameron Crowe's more or less autobiographical masterpiece. With a terrific (and brilliantly told) story, top-notch performances from all involved and one of the best soundtracks ever put together, Almost Famous is an absolute joy from beginning to end.The film revolves around William Miller, a very thinly-veiled young Cameron Crowe. William is a brilliant but rather sheltered 15-year old music lover living in California in the early 1970s. He will soon live a dream. He is assigned to go on tour with the band Stillwater and write an article about them for Rolling Stone. How does a 15-year old boy land such an assignment? Well, it helps if your bosses don't know you're fifteen. Anyhow, William's journey will introduce him to places and people he never could have imagined even existed. And we get to go along for the thrilling trip of a lifetime.As the character at the heart of the movie, William's role is clearly the key. Everything and everyone is seen through his eyes. Casting for this role could not have been easy but Crowe came up with the perfect young actor in Patrick Fugit. He brilliantly captures the intelligence and the innocence of this young boy. And Fugit really grows with the character as William's eyes are opened to a much larger world. The other two standouts in a brilliant ensemble cast are Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup. Hudson is simply perfect as Penny Lane, leader of a group of devoted ""Band-Aids"" who are along for the ride on the Stillwater tour. Call them groupies at your own peril. Bubbly, effervescent, full of life and not that innocent...that's Penny Lane and Hudson captures it all brilliantly. And as we learn more about the character we find maybe there's a little naiveté in her as well. As a tour veteran she takes young William under her wing and their relationship is a somewhat odd yet fascinating one.The other character with whom both William and Penny have a key connection is Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond, as played by Crudup. Hammond is obviously an immense talent but he also is quite the enigma. While the rest of the band is quite wary of William (the media after all is ""the enemy"" of any rocker), Russell takes a liking to the youngster. Not enough of a liking to grant the interview William so desperately needs for his story however. So young William pursues his interview while Russell carries on with the ultra-devoted Penny. The Penny-Russell relationship could be a movie unto itself. The give and take between Hudson and Crudup is priceless even as it becomes obvious to seemingly everyone but Penny that she is doing all the giving and Russell all the taking. The inevitable tension in that relationship is matched by the tension between Russell and his band mates, most notably lead singer Jeff Bebe, played by Jason Lee. Russell and Jeff can't quite seem to agree on exactly who the star of this band is. The result is that just when it seems Stillwater should be on the verge of breaking into the big-time instead they are coming apart at the seams. Throw in some drugs to go along with all the sex and rock n'roll and you have quite the combustible mix. And young William is there to see and document it all. A long, strange trip for him indeed.There are also smaller but no less wonderful performances by Frances McDormand as William's overprotective mother and Philip Seymour Hoffman as William's rock critic mentor, Lester Bangs. All the actors really nailed it with their performances in this one. The soundtrack, as you would expect from someone with Crowe's background, is brilliantly assembled, touching on so many of the key artists of the period. And the performances by the fictional Stillwater are notably well done as well. Lee and Crudup obviously worked quite hard to make themselves into convincing rock stars and their efforts pay off wonderfully. Almost Famous is a brilliant look back at rock n' roll life in the 1970s. But it is much more than just a rock n' roll movie. It's also a brilliant story of a boy's coming of age. And it is not just William who grows. Penny and Russell each have their own stories to tell and their lives' journeys are fascinating to watch as well. A brilliant story brilliantly acted...you can't ask much more than that from a film and Almost Famous delivers.As a side note, if at all possible, see the Director's Cut available on DVD, titled ""Untitled."" Where most director's cuts seem to add back in only things that were cut for good reason the first time around, this version of Almost Famous is even more of a joy than the original. The characters are further developed and even more so than in the original you really get the sense of actually being on tour yourself with the band. It's an extra 40 minutes or so well spent.",Almost Famous
84,jhclues,"Great Music, But So Much More",10,25 September 2000,"It's 1973, San Diego, California; an exceptionally bright fifteen-year-old aspiring journalist with his heart in rock n' roll goes after an interview with a heavyweight metal band in town for a concert, and winds up tagging along on tour with a band called Stillwater, in `Almost Famous,' a semi-autobiographical story from writer/director Cameron Crowe.  And once the bus leaves, it's music, mirth, mayhem and an unforgettable, career-launching experience for young William Miller (Patrick Fugit), as he gets a first hand look at what living the life of a rock musician is all about.  It's a lot to take in, but Miller's intelligence and adaptability belies his youth and he eases into his role quite naturally, with a little help from a couple of new friends:  Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), leader of the groupie elite `Band aids,' following Stillwater on their tour; and Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), who plays lead guitar for the band.  For young William it's a foray into a real fantasy world, through which he conducts himself professionally and objectively; quite a triumph considering his previous experience as a writer was limited to a few unsolicited submissions to `Rolling Stone' and `Creem' magazines, from which he received, up to this point, no response whatsoever.  His only real link to any of it, in fact, has been a chance encounter with Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of Creem, who ultimately becomes something of an anchor to reality for Miller. Cameron Crowe has given us a brilliant film that works on a number of levels; it's entertaining and insightful, delivered from his own unique perspective and presented objectively and without moralizing.  It's like an excellent piece of journalism committed to film, which enables the audience to make that necessary emotional connection that makes it all so satisfying. Whether or not you even like rock n' roll, it's undeniably a force that has long since been ingrained in the universal consciousness of the world, and Crowe has captured the essence of it's soul in this movie.  There are characters and moments here with which everyone will be able to readily identify; from Miller's mother, Elaine (wonderfully played by Frances McDormand), the professor who cannot understand the music and fears the influence of it on her children, to the kid who just loves the music, to those obsessed and taken over by it.  It's a detailed look at what it means to be, not necessarily a rock `star,' but a struggling band grabbing for the brass ring, and how it affects the lives of so many people directly and indirectly involved.  Crowe takes it deep and demonstrates the upside as well as the down, in a way that sparks the imagination without being too graphic.  It's a movie that allows you to experience the exhilarating, sometimes manic highs as well as the unpleasantness that must accompany it, but Crowe takes pains to deliver the message without ever taking you into unnecessarily dark or murky waters.  He maintains a delicate balance throughout the film that gives it both conscience and credibility.There are a number of memorable performances, beginning with Fugit, who does such a great job of conveying the maturity of his character, which makes him so believable.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee (as lead singer Jeff Bebe) breathe life into Stillwater, while Kate Hudson absolutely sparkles as Penny Lane.  And Hoffman takes the small role of Lester Bangs and imbues him with such spirit and nuance that his presence is felt throughout the entire film, as is Elaine, thanks to the tremendous talent of McDormand.Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Anna Paquin (Polexia), Fairuza Balk (Sapphire), Terry Chen (Ben Fong-Torres) and Zooey Deschanel (Anita Miller).  `Almost Famous' is, in the end, a stirring, thoroughly enjoyable experience; there's great music and some madness, and some real lessons about life in the real world to be learned along the way.  It's a film with wide appeal and something in it for everyone; and if you've ever listened to a record or heard a song, believe me, this is one movie you're going to want to see.  I rate this one 10/10.",Almost Famous
85,aciessi,Face the Music,10,7 February 2015,"An all-time favorite of mine, and purely because of how remarkable it is. The story it tells makes you feel like you're living an amazing dream. You are practically touring with the band, singing their songs, being with all the girls and loving every minute of it. Almost Famous is a time machine to the 70's. From the styles to the mentality. But the real shining star is the great, great music. Believe me, if you aren't a fan of classic rock now, you will be. The characters are very genuine here, especially the bright-eyed dreamer William, and the sad but groovy Penny Lane. This is a Cameron Crowe movie unlike any he's ever done before and ever since. This movie is less Jerry Maguire, and more Nashville. It's proof of the power of movies.",Almost Famous
86,Stampsfightclub,The film that shows us the way music died,9,9 October 2009,"Ambitious journalist William Miller (Fugit) sets out on tour with a rock and roll band who is trying to make it into the music business With everything printed in gossip magazines and internet blogs it is sure difficult to think of a time when we were reliant on a minimal selection of reading material to find out about the rock stars of the 60's and 70's.Almost famous makes me sad. I am nearly 21 and having seen this film a couple of times have felt I have missed perhaps the greatest segment of music to exist, the rock and roll, the raves, the parties, the time when no one cared, the time of individuals, the time of proper meaningful music.Cameron Crowe's picture is a provocative look into the aftermath of the apparent dying faze of rock and roll. The descent of music culture is apparent when scripting is shockingly poignant in some opening sequences here. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's protagonist Lester Bangs makes the point of how certain bands meet the right criteria to defy the odds and play with soul and purpose. When watching his portrayal of the journalist it is hard to disagree with him as he is so accurate. Rock and roll and music practically has died. U2 have lost their originality and meaning, Led Zeppelin has been replaced by a number of pretenders whilst your rock stars have fallen by the wayside. Now we have repetitious artists such as Cascada clogging up the charts with pretentious dance music.The point of this film of course is to show the decline of the industry by depicting a wannabe band trying to make it big in the difficult business. Living the life of a rock star certainly seems glamorous for the stars as they enjoy parties, take drugs and have sex. But Crowe's scripting leaves an underlying feeling of sadness for the music industry and the central character, of himself played with quiet solitude by Patrick Fugit.Fugit balances the need to do the right thing and the urge to be his own person well, balancing on teenage hormones and aspirations, whilst a sparkling sophisticated Kate Hudson gives him food for thought. Billy Crudup is your most interesting star being that little too arrogant and overly pretentious with a quite demeanour to fit the portrayal of a modern musician.As based on Cameron Crowe's experiences as a journalist growing up in this industry it is unfitting to question realism in context and whilst jokes and humorous ideologies such as confession of sexual orientation are squeezed in, this believes and intrigues.As before, this 2000 picture does make me feel sad. Our music has dissolved into overly repetitious dance music with no purpose.Fittingly the score for this picture encodes the classics from the day and brimming with drama and humour, is an important viewing",Almost Famous
87,gbheron,If You Want to See What 1973 Looked Like in the US...,8,2 April 2001,"""Almost Famous"", we are told, comes from the heart. It's semi-autobiographical, Mr. Crowe's paean to his youth, and to a time, the early 1970s. Does anyone else care?  Obviously they do, the movie has been nominated (and won) tons of awards from all aspects of film making, and IMDb commentators have ranked it (currently) as the 53rd highest rated movie.
It is very well acted. Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, and Frances McDormand are excellent. The attention to detail is astonishing. My only complaint is that the story didn't seem to have much meat on its bones. The dramatic elements were established early in the movie, such as William's relationship with the Rolling Stone editors and his difficulties meeting their deadlines, or his relationship with his mother and hers with the band. At the end of the movie I felt they had not been fully resolved. But this might have produced other, negative effects on the film's flow. Who can say? I enjoyed this movie and recommend it highly. What I'm saying is that I don't think I liked it as much as most other people.",Almost Famous
88,jluis1984,An amazing experience,10,24 November 2005,"First of all, this review is based in the 162 minutes version, the Director's Cut, so maybe some of the minor flaws I found are corrected in the Theatrical version.After that small disclaimer here we go. The movie tells the story of young William Miller, a prodigious kid who has a huge talent for writing. Hired by the Rolling Stone magazine, he goes on tour with Stillwater, a band in it's first tour across America.The story is simple, and goes straight forward, but in the dialog(by director Cameron Crowe) is where the movie shines. The characters, their emotions, their reactions, everything is so wonderfully crafted that there is no character that goes undeveloped, and no character goes unnoticed. It really is a remarkable work, that fortunately got the recognition it deserves with an Academy Award.Nevertheless, the script would had been wasted if the rest of the movie were not up to the challenge. First of all, the outstanding direction & edition makes the film feel short and even in the long version you end up wanting for more. The characters stay with you and you want to know more about them. Few movies these days have characters with that impact.We follow William from his house and his over-protective mother going through the turbulent life of rock stars, trying to make a good job as a writer, but also trying to understand the complex life of rock n' roll heroes. It's a coming of age film perfectly crafted.Also, praise should go to the cast, the script gives all of them the chance to shine and they really give their best. Billy Crudup & Jason Lee have great scenes as the lead guitar and lead vocals respectively, and Kate Hudson really pulls out an outstanding performance as ""Band Aid"" Penny Lane; but it's Patrick Fugit who has the most difficult task, since his character, William Miller, carries the whole film. Even when his few experience Patrick managed to create a likable character and really did a great job.Overall, this film really leave sit's stamp in your heart, and even when a little knowledge of the classic age of Rock(it's set in the 70's) could help, it's indeed a timeless story. Remarkable film.10/10",Almost Famous
89,stamper,That's the way I want my Rock and Roll,8,6 January 2002,"Well at least the music. I mean, this is a great piece of work about the early 1970's. It gives us a good insight of the Rock and Roll world. The way the stars, the fans and even the groupies are treated and what happens with them. It also shows us that it is very hard to pick sides here and determine who is good and who is not. It is such a strange mixture of the real world and the unreal one. One minute you are nobody, then the king of the world, until you are nobody again or a legend (alive like Plant, Page, most of The Rolling Stones and so on, or dead like Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and so on). The business is tough and it screws people up, almost everyone. It still happens today and why? Because it is hard to refuse when the world is on your feet and you can almost do anything what you like. This film captures all of this what IS, but it also reminds us what will be LEFT and what will be GONE.
There is but one thing that did not happen in this film of 70's rock stars, I mean there were girls, sex, drugs, Rock and Roll but one thing missed. Overdoses, plane crashes, shootings or suicides. The really dark world of the 70's rock scene. I do not say I missed it, but I just kind of noticed that it was not there in a portrait of a decade filled with bodies of rock stars.
Well, I'm sure there are people out there now, waiting for criticism, harsh words and total destruction of this work, by this works enemy (the critic), even if it is an amateur like me. Well sorry, but I sell nothing but the truth and the truth is, that this movie was good. It was good from the Soundtrack, over the music, the direction, the cinematography, the editing, the length, the acting, the casting, over the producing up to the last split hair that was removed from the actors heads by the hairdressers. It just was good. And I am not speaking of the theatrical version here no, I'm talking about the over 150 minutes lasting UNTITLED: Almost Famous the Bootleg Cut' that is found on the 2-DVD. To be honest, I can't even imagine what they must have taken out for the regular' film, cause I would not want to miss anything of the film I have just seen.
The funniest or maybe most interesting thing of all about this film is, that it is about Cameron Crowe. Because Comeron Crowe is (or better was) William H.Miller. Cameron Crowe himself wrote for Rolling Stone when he was a teen and got on the road with famous bands. So this is not only a fictional film, it is also something of an actual film. But what is about what band and what really happened and what not will always be Crowe's secret (or not). I think it must be a great feeling for Crowe, that a film that is basically about himself and an era that has greatly influenced him is so well received by the public and rightly so. I think this is and will be Cameron Crowes best work ever (no matter what he does next).
Because I enjoyed this film so much, I have the urge to recommend this film to everybody out there, but I'm just not sure if my love for Rock music has clouded my mind. I mean the way this film was made it is sure to make every Rock fan nostalgic. It has to, if it succeeded in making me nostalgic. I mean I am a 20 year old guy, who was not even born in the 1970's. I'm sure though, this is a must see for every Rock fan (and I'm not talking Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, KoRn and Slipknot here). I'm talking about Zeppelin, Hendrix, van Halen, AC DC and so on. I'm talking about CLASSIC ROCK. I'm talking about  the spirit of the 70's or even about pure interest. Rent this folks watch it, do not listen to me, to make up your mind. If you're interested enough to be reading all this, than you're sure as hell interested enough to view the film.
Thanx to everyone involved in the making of this film (and I mean everyone, from the guys that delivered the Pizza's to the cast and crew to the girl/boyfriends, husbands/wives, fathers/mothers and so on who gave their loved ones time to make this wonderful film). Special Thanx to Cameron Crowe (for the great writing and vision to make a true 70's tribute film with all it's ups and downs), Billy Crudrup, Patrick Fugit and Kate Hudson (all three for great acting) and all 70's rockers who inspired the making of this film.

93,FilmOtaku,A sentimental ode to rock n' roll,8,20 October 2003,"Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical film about his work as a teenage reporter for Rolling Stone is clearly his love poem to rock n' roll. Through the eyes of our main character, (portrayed by wide-eyed newcomer Patrick Fugit) we experience the ups and downs of an up and coming band (the fictional Stillwater) as he fools Rolling Stone into thinking he is older than his actual age (15) and goes on tour with the band.The evolution of the band's rise and it's (somewhat) deconstruction makes for interesting viewing, but the true star is Fugit as the young journalist. Coming from a sheltered background and raised by an intellectual but overprotective single-mother (Frances McDormand) who didn't tell him his real age until the age of 12 when he began to question why the other children were bigger than he was (he skipped two grades in school) his own personal growth mirrors that of the band.  Fugit captures his spirit and emotions flawlessly and becomes our eyes and ears into this inner sanctum that probably is extremely true to life.As most of Crowe's films are, this film is slick and visually fun to watch. Crowe also follows his tradition of inserting the right song into the right scene.  The three masters of this technique are Crowe, Tarantino and P.T. Anderson and while the latter seem to utilize obscure soundtracks, Crowe will take a familiar song and forever imprint the accompanying film scene into your brain.  (I still cannot hear `Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys and not think of Tom Cruise running through the corridors of a skyscraper in Vanilla Sky.)There is nothing overtly profound about Almost Famous, and it's not a film that will keep you up at night, but it is a decent film for any music lover and is a very enjoyable experience.--Shelly",Almost Famous
94,jpschapira,"""It's all happening""",10,27 March 2006,"""Almost famous"" is so great that I don't know where to begin. It means so much to me; personally, cinematographically, visuallyIt means so much when it comes to acting and wonderful performances, when it comes to fantastic original screenplays that come from a person's mind without being taken from anything we already know.This was probably one of the first movies to ever blow me away. When I was getting and idea of what cinema meant and which where the good films; this one left me impressed for more than a week. The same occurred later with ""Traffic"", ""The Truman Show"", ""Big Fish"" and others. It was with this film that I understood that to like a movie it has to mean something to you; besides meaning something for the ones who did it or the ones involved in it.It meant something for me mainly because of the music. It was during the main credits written by hand in a paper that I felt something, but then, when William's (Patrick Fugit) sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) leaves the house to become a stewardess, and tells him: ""Look under your bed; it will set you free""; I was introduced to a new world.William's mother Elaine (an excellent Frances McDormand) raised him and her sister forbidding them to use bad words, making them go to school, making them religious, but most importantly not letting them listen to rock music. This all changes when William plays The Who's ""Tommy"" a the light of a candle. Some years later he is writing rock articles and he knows enough to talk with the best music critic in the United States: Lester Bangs (a brilliant and Oscar-caliber supporting performance by the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman).They talk for a while and the critic says: ""Well, I've got to go; I can't spend my whole day talking to my fans"". But then, with a lot of intelligence, a camera shoots a restaurant, and they are both still talking. Bangs gives the kid an assignment: to write about Deep Purple. The kid goes to the concert in his home town and tries to enter backstage saying he's a reporter of ""Creem"".His multiple attempts fail and he is called by some girls who are laughing constantly. These are the Band Aids, and that is the moment in the film during which I fell in love with Kate Hudson. She plays Penny Lane (although that's not her real name), the girl who said women should be with musicians just for the love of the music, not sex or free rides.She plays her as an enigmatic and mysterious person who actually is lost and doesn't know or have another place to be in. And I'm talking, personally, about one of the best performances I've witnessed in my whole life. This personal list of best performances is short, and Hudson's Penny Lane is in it, and she deserved an Oscar for it; and many will agree.Because of how life goes, William stays alone outsideUntil Stillwater arrives, the kid uses his musical knowledge and he is inside backstage before he knows it. Then, before we know, he forgets about Deep Purple, he is touring with Stillwater and writing an article for Rolling Stone magazine that could be considered for the cover; and William is only 15 years old.During the tour I felt what they called the ""buzz"". It was very inspiring to watch the band, each of its members, all the time with a guitar in their hands. Sometimes they were playing together; sometimes each of them was doing his own things. There were pianos and keyboards in each room they stepped foot in; there were good and bad live moments, just as good offstage moments and horrible fights; probably mended with just singing ""Tiny Dancer"".Music is the main factor, as this band travels through the country. All of the members of the band we get to identify, but the one that obligatorily highlights is the guitarist Russell Hammond, played superbly by Billy Crudup. The lead singer is also important and he is played by a long-haired Jason Lee, with the guts of a rock persona.The regretful moments we can't be without...Like Russell's party in Topeka and his last lines if he would die: ""I'm on drugs""; or the plain about to crash and confessions like: ""I'm gay"". This was all perfectly crafted by the hand of Cameron Crowe's peaceful camera and the fantastic screenplay he wrote going back in time to his own similar experience. The man got the best from Tom Cruise, that's already a lot: and ""Almost Famous"" is his legacy; a gem and one of the best films I've seen in my life.",Almost Famous
95,Maziun,"Loud , colorful and empty",4,19 August 2013,"Almost famous"" is certainly nicely directed . There is a lot of good music here . The movie is often very funny . I can't say a bad thing about acting . I think that Kate Hudson gave a good performance , but an Oscar nominee ? Please . Other actors (Billy Crudup , Frances McDormand , Patrick Fugit , Zooey Deschanel and Philip Seymour Hoffmann) also did a good job.So , what's the problem ? Well , I don't think this movie is deep . Hell , I don't think this movie is about anything . What was the sense of William's journey ? How did it changed him ? What was the point of everything he witnessed ? Is it movie about boy growing up ? No , because he's the same at the end of the movie just like he was in the beginning. Penny Lane also doesn't change . Her plans change , but she does not . The only person that changes is the rock guitarist (played by Billy Crudup) . He becomes more matured at the end of movie. Still , it's not that important , because the movie wasn't supposed to be about him.Is it the movie about troubled and confused young people in America ? Is it the movie about rock group that can't bear the success and the conflicts inside that group ? Is it a movie about young girl running from life and helplessly in love with rock star ? The movie pretends to touch all those subjects , yet it doesn't tell anything about any of them . It's also hilarious that Penny Lane doesn't call herself a groupie , even if she is one. I also find it rather unbelievable that William fell in love with her . They don't spend too much time together and there isn't chemistry between them . Friends ? Yes. Lovers ? No . It feels like a bad melodrama.The movie seems to be repeating itself during those two hours . William goes with the group , tries to write article , he loves Penny while she loves the rock guitarist , the rock guitarist acts immaturely and so on and on until the end of movie . There is no catharsis , because there is no drama . None of the characters has to make any important decision. OK , maybe a little bit at the end some characters do make some decisions. It doesn't change the fact that it's hardly emotional moment of the movie. Hell , the whole movie is completely pointless.I give it 4/10.",Almost Famous

Chief problem: There is not a recognisable name on the billing. Brad Pitt was due to be the lead guitarist, but (in the best catholic tradition) pull out at the last minute saying he ""didn't get it.""What was 1973 like for you? Well I was a little young, but I remember it as a low year for music. We were still living the lazy hippie hangover and drugs/drink had killed Hendrix, Morrison and Joplin. The Beatles were gone and the Rolling Stones were laid up in mansions somewhere. Yes - this was the B Leaguers big moment, if only they had know it.The band in the movie are like the Allman Brothers meets Free meets Crosby, Stills and Nash. We don't hear a lot of their music (which is surprising) so a lot of that description it is based on haircuts and attitude. Drink and drugs are introduced early and without preaching, but doesn't seem to effect the band's performance.The soundtrack album seems to be important and features tracks of the time (some a little after!) that don't get played too often on the radio. If you think they are weak - and plenty is rock and pop dirge - well that supports what I said about the times.How clever of writer/director to use a child as our guide. Not a hip and cool one either. A nerdy - but bright - kid (Patrick Fugit) who loves music and already writes about it for underground mags.(What did Lou Reed say about music journalists? ""People that cannot write, writing for people that cannot read."" Hated because they were the only ones around not telling them they are great. )As a child in an ""adult"" world he can tell people what they don't want to hear: Groupie (or ""band aid"") Penny Lane is informed that she is just being used and needs to wake up and smell the coffee. That the drugged up shouldn't take any more (hey, we have all been there or been on the end of that speech). That peeing infront of people is not polite.One problem with this movie is that plenty of gags are private references (David Crosby was reputed to have the best dope, hence ""I know this good stuff because Crosby gave it to me."") and how many young audience members knows that Peggy Sue was a Buddy Holly song? Or even how he died?All such movies have to avoid being Spinal Tap nowadays and we are getting close in the ""Aeroplane"", ""T-shirt"" and ""this is the man from the record company"" scenes; but all have the ring of truth.Fugit gets laid (by the groupies - who else!) and we are supposed to be pleased for him. Why? They are sleeping with everyone and we don't see any use of condoms - so how do we know he is not catching a dose? Would we have been pleased if the band had underage sex with a girl?In case you are worried, drugs are shown as not ""all of a good thing"" - but I'll not spoil it for those that haven't seen the film.Sadly this is just a superior made-for-TV movie that would collapse if it were not for the youthful sheen of Fugit and careful period detail.",Almost Famous

It establishes the dreams of a talented, young writer wanting to 'fit in' to the rock and roll crowd but understanding the importance of journalism and communication. It explores love and learning.) In the end, what makes this a good movie are the characters and their developments through the events in this film. Overall, it's a good film to watch, but it lacks in some elements to make it truly great. (Although the storyline is original, it seems to paint more of a picture of the characters and drags itself out to cover several ideas.

A really beautiful movie that everyone has come to love, which means it has incurred a backlash of serious film buffs calling it overrated. True, its no hard-edged drama, its quite soft around the edges, with many instances of broad characters and cheap playing for laughs, but the feeling of loss that accompanies the remembrance of things past is bound to make this a special experience.

101,EijnarAmadeus,A Personal Fav.,8,18 September 2004,"spoilers. ALMOST FAMOUS is a amazingly charming story about a young boy who hits the road with a rock'n'roll band in the early 70ties. The fine directing of Cameron Crowe and his brilliant script, makes this movie exactly to the rock-boy's everyday dream. William Miller thinks his 12, but is 11. His sister is a rebellious woman that listens to rock music and their mother is a bit weird. William is sat free when his sister gives him dozens of rock'n'roll albums to start listening too. Rock inspires William to write articles about groups. Having a huge talent for this, he gets a job in the magazine Creem. Starting his career with interviewing the band STILLWATER, he quickly gets into the rock business and gets to know people, among these he gets a close relationship to the charming Penny Lane and Stillwater's guitarist. But soon his talents are also discovered by Rolling Stones mag. and they offer him a job to write about Stillwater's tour..Frances McDormand is as usual absolutely fantastic, and they all together form this fabulous movie that is all about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.

102,RonellSowes,Energetic And Humorous Story,7,8 May 2021,"This semi-autobiographical film is mainly Cameron Crowe's way of displaying his love for classic rock'n roll. He uses his knowledge and experience from the era to create one fictitious band. Which represents all of the actual ones with many of the concurrent attributes. It also gives him dramatic liberties without the fear of legal action.Like the protagonist the film puts you squarely in the middle of a rock band and on a macro level, rock'n roll culture from the 70's. However, to give the film some structure and even a little more substance this is all rested on a love triangle and friendship story between William, the lead guitarist for the fictitious band and his muse.Almost Famous is an adventurous and wild tale that wants you to fall in love with classic rock music as much as Crowe did.

Cameron Crowe clearly infuses a personal flavor into the film which makes it's classic rock scenarios seem that much more authentic. Shot through the memory of a fond heart looking back, Crowe's warm memories of the days he tagged along with famous musicians before he was of any age to be doing so is an enjoyable, consistent homage to the classic days of rock music, but fails to truly pay homage to that spirit with a myriad of stereotypes and self-conscious film-making making the movie less engaging.Though the movie boasts an adept cast, spirited musical reverence, and seems to remain consistently entertaining throughout, I am almost shocked at the outpouring of perfect reviews given to Almost Famous at the time of it's release.

Jason Lee, Billy Crudup and Frances McDormand were all great in their roles, as was Patrick Fugit who was decent, and Zooey Deshchanel, whom i heard about but only see for the first time here. I thought Kate Hudson was good, although wasn't as great as everybody says (not nearly the best performance of the film), she was good though.

The whole time I was noting that the Kate Hudson character´s primary role was to show her abdomen and look ¨cute¨ and clueless. I am sorry if anyone found that role to be somehow compelling. Maybe it was realistic for a groupie to act in such a way, but I do not know why Kate Hudson should be singled out for special attention for that performance.More generally, I am sorry that our culture has descended to the level where anyone is capable of gushing over this creation.

110,Movie-12,"One of the year's best films, inspirational and engaging. **** (out of four)",9,26 September 2000,"ALMOST FAMOUS / (2000) **** (out of four)Finally a movie that accurately defines an era through atmosphere and characters instead of reckless stereotypes and over the top clichés. ""Almost Famous"" is a vivid portrayal of the 1970's with excellent performances and stylish direction. Based on director Cameron Crowe's real life exploits as a music critic working for Rolling Stone Magazine, the film captures the many complicated feelings of adolescence and takes us on a journey into the past, where we just began to go places, learn responsibilities, and confront our first romantic interest. This is an excellent movie that will undoubtedly appeal to our generation of teenagers.The film's main character is William Miller (Patrick Fugit), an intelligent adolescent growing up in the 1970's in a typical neighborhood with his overbearing mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand) and rebellious older sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel). When Will is eleven, his sister moves away to become a stewardess, leaving behind some riveting rock and roll music for him. His mother is a college professor who is against the potentially corrupting lyrics of rock and roll. Will is true to his emotions as well as honest with himself and his upbringing, therefore, when she screams ""Don't do drugs,"" he obeys to her words of wisdom.""Almost Famous"" provides Will with superior character development. The audience bonds with his subtle personality that is witty and full of charisma, which essentially carries the story throughout the film. Will is very well written, one of the most relatable, inspiring characters portrayed on the silver screen all year. Smaller roles contribute to the defining of Will, including a precise part of an experienced music critic portrayed with heartiness by Philip Seymour Hoffman.Through good fortune and talent, Will gets a job at age fifteen with Rolling Stone magazine and ends up following a rising rock band called Stillwater. The guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), befriends and provides him with informative interviews he requires to satisfy the cravings of his employers. Along the way he meets his first romantic interest and guild to his new world, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a groupie along with other backstage followers, including Polexia (Anna Paquin from ""Fly Away Home"") and Sapphire (Fairuza Balk).It is debatable whether Will follows the band's tour for the free-wheeling pleasure and to escape his nuisance mother, or if his heart really belongs home with his original family and is simply experimenting with following his dreams. Despite many complaints by her, he seldom obeys his mother's requests to keep her updated on his standings, although he seems loving, compassionate, and grateful towards her. And at the end of the production, when he is given a choice to travel anywhere he wants, his heart leads him back at the doorsteps of his home sweet home. This is the kind of movie that makes you question the character's motives.""Almost Famous"" contains superb performances, especially from the young star on the rise, Patrick Fugit, who handles the leading role with subtle heart and lively spirit. He offers inspiration and amazement, and will hopefully be remembered at Oscar time. Frances McDormand is great as the oppressive and worried mom, who realistically portrays a parent desperately attempting to shelter her children from the evils of the world in the 1970's. Reckless and emotional, Kate Hudson is also strong in an important supporting role. Billy Crudup is zesty and dashing in a part that seems as if he was born to play.It would be hard to watch ""Almost Famous"" without noticing several of its themes targeted towards teenagers. There are warm-hearted messages about friendships and fame, fortune and romance, faithfulness and arrogance, and drugs. There is a scene in an airplane experiencing difficulties that results not in death or disaster, but in truth telling and feelings being revealed; this is arguably the most important scene in the film.Cameron Crowe's previous credits include the Oscar nominated ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Say Anything."" With ""Almost Famous,"" he surpasses himself on more than one account. Not only is there a lot to get out of this film, but it also beautifully hits base with its target audience like few films do. ""Almost Famous"" is one of the best movies of the year; I recommend it highly.",Almost Famous
111,FlickJunkie-2,Raw and real look inside the rock revolution,9,25 March 2001,"Writer/Director Cameron Crowe (`Fast Times at Ridgemont High', `Jerry Maguire') has a knack for capturing the human condition in all its imperfect glory.  He is particularly insightful when he is writing from his own experiences.  To write `Fast Times', he went undercover at a high school posing as a student.  The result was an honest and genuine high school flick that was too real to be fiction.  He does the same with this film, drawing on his experience as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine when he toured with Led Zeppelin at age 16.  Though the band and the most of the people in this film are fictitious, many of the situations are based on real events and the characters are composites of real people.Some people have compared this film to `This is Spinal Tap', but other than the fact that it follows a rock group, there is little similarity.  `Tap' was a spoof documentary with its tongue firmly in cheek.  AF is raw and real with a believable plot (except perhaps the silly airplane confession scene) and affecting characters.  Crowe went to great lengths to capture the rock scene precisely, sending the actors to band camp to get them to the point where they could actually perform.  Stillwater is literally a rock band created out of actors.  While some of the vocals are dubbed, Jason Lee really sings lead on a couple of tracks, and Billy Crudup and the band are actually playing.  Crowe was quoted as saying it was a pity that the band had to break up after the film was produced, because they were actually a pretty good band.  Nancy Wilson and Peter Frampton wrote most of the band's original music to give the songs an authentic sound.  Crowe's direction is excellent.  Though the pacing of the film is a bit uneven, dragging at times, his ability to depict the feelings of the time through the performances of the actors is superb.  The sound track is rich in 1970's music that is enhanced by the use of the DTS format on the DVD. The DVD also has numerous fascinating behind-the-scenes segments, including a copy of the original articles written by Crowe when he wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine.The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  In keeping with the theme of the film, most of the actors are bright young talents who are almost famous.  Billy Crudup is the closest thing to a leading role actor, having starred in a few good but minor films (`Without Limits', `Waking the Dead'). Crudup's performance as the self-absorbed and brilliant guitarist who holds the band together is first rate.  Frances McDormand is fabulous as always as William's oppressive mother.  In a cast replete with fine performances, Kate Hudson stands out, giving a brilliant presentation of Penny Lane.  She brings enormous emotional power to a very demanding role that ranges from effervescent to suicidal. Newcomer Patrick Fugit finds the right balance between nerdy and wise as William.  Jason Lee is wonderfully turbulent as the temperamental lead singer.This film is a winner.  By capturing the emotions rather than just a series of rock events, it takes us behind the scenes of the rock revolution in a way that no documentary ever has.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is necessary viewing for rock fans young and old.",Almost Famous

He's not unknown, but you don't hear buzz on the street: `Hey, did you hear that Cameron Crowe' `I can't wait until the next Cameron Crow film!' That's pretty incidental, because his 2000 film Almost Famous is semiautobiographical. It's not the most famous film from 2000 (in fact, it's Almost Famous-I crack myself up), and it's not the best film from 2000, but it's a pretty good film from 2000.If there's a type of person I admire, it's directors who write for themselves. It shows that they're multi-talented and can do more than just one thing at a time. Crowe excels in both categories, although he doesn't have a definite style to his direction, and his script doesn't have any emotional punch; it's just there, and when this movie's done, nothing's learned (except rock stars can't be trusted, but we all already knew that), nothing's gained, but an enjoyable character study for two hours.Almost Famous is your typical boy-is-overshadowed-by-overprotective-mother-and-goes-on-tour-with-favorite-band-as-journalist story. The boy is William Miller (Patrick Fugit, in an impressive debut), fifteen, who writes for a semi-large magazine, and is called from Rolling Stone to write about his favorite up-and-coming band Stillwater. He gets more than he bargained for, including his love for a groupie (Kate Hudson), his inability to have a crucial interview with lead singer Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and constant badgering from his mother Elaine (Frances McDormand).I didn't find the premise of the rock band very interesting (I only bought it because it came with American Beauty), but it was well made, and gives a (what I could guess) accurate depiction of the drug-addled 70's, with sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Although there isn't much of the firs two, there are a lot of rock scenes, when Stillwater is performing, and they went on for too long.The best part of Almost Famous is the acting, especially McDormand, even though she was wasted. She's a great actress, but she never really has a chance to shine. Fugit does an impressive debut, and Crudup is good, and Jason Lee, who is also in the band, was very good. It's hard for Lee to act badly. Almost Famous is almost a great movie, but it's just good.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language, drug content, and brief nudity.",Almost Famous
114,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Powerful, accessible to non-music non-arty non-1960's types",10,7 May 2002,"I went into ""Almost Famous"" with three strikes against me. Sure, I like pop music, but I've never been a groupie. I'm too young to have nostalgia for the 1960s. And I avoid dramas -- usually too slow-paced for an action film buff like me, and chock full of melodrama and overly clever and subtle art bits.But I was totally blown away by ""Almost Famous"". Without being either preachy (anti-1960s) or glorifying (pro-1960s), we get a balanced view of the music culture that's riveting. The story is intelligent and well-paced. It's well-acted, introducing some unknowns: Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup, who do well. And it's easy to identify with the protagonist, who is an ""everyman"" stuggling with innocence and success in a world gone crazy with the sex and drugs of the 1960s. In a nutshell, I think the film is meant to perhaps symbolize how the entire world got caught up in that era.But it's not overblown or overdone. And there are some interesting plot twists. I especially liked the Mom character, who is hilarious. I'm quite anti-drug myself, but the drug use in this film doesn't glorify it so that wasn't a problem for me.Who should see this film:-- Everyone (except kids too young to see drug use on screen),even if you normally avoid dramas.

Thus, he takes advantage of a proposition from the bi-monthly Rolling Stone to follow the rock band Stillwater, on tour throughout the United States. He will gradually and ineluctably abandon the passivity and objectivity of his role of observer to participate in the life of the group. Until ... ... ...These secondary characters gravitate around William Miller: 1) Russell Hammond is one of the key members of Stillwater and perfectly symbolizes epicureanism and lightness. 2) Penny Lane is a carefree teenager who fills the void of her live with rock 'n roll, and she would probably have swallowed the blue pill within The Matrix (The Wachowski sisters, 1999). 3) Lester Bangs is a mentor and / or surrogate father for William. 4) Elaine Miller is a protective and moving mother. The actors play in a magisterial way, especially Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In general, the whole cast is awesome!My favorite quotes, in bulk: You have a message from your mother that freaked me out: do not use drugs. It's not too late for you to become a person of substance. Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid. Be honest and unmerciful. There is hope for you, yet. What kind of beer?",Almost Famous
120,SKG-2,Crowe knows what it is love some little piece of music so much that it hurts,10,5 October 2000,"There's a (by now) well-known scene early on in ALMOST FAMOUS when William Miller is poring through the records his older sister Anita has left behind for him since she ran off from home.  Inside the album cover of The Who's TOMMY, she leaves William a note, telling him to listen to this with a candle lit, and he'll be able to see his future.  He puts on the record, ""Sparks"" comes on, and the look on his face as he listens is the look every rock fan will recognize.There's been tons of stuff written about rock-n-roll music, from those who think, like William's mother Elaine, that it's a corrupting influence(or those who go even farther and consider it ""the devil's music""), to those who insist the music is meaningless and to take it seriously smacks of pretension, because it's ""only music.""  And then there are people like Cameron Crowe, who recognize rock-n-roll, and the music which came in its wake, is the shared experience of many people starting from the 1950's, in the way maybe that plays and earlier types of music were in centuries before.  Sure, there's television and movies as well, but rock music is shorter and more direct.  And sure, it can just be fun and a way to cut loose once in a while, but it's also something which can speak to what we love, what we long for, what we're afraid of, what we think, what wounds us inside, and so much more.Because Crowe is a fan, he's able to capture all of this in his movie.  It's not just in the obvious moments, like the people on the tour bus singing along to Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer,"" which lifts them out of their black mood, or singer Jeff Bebe leading everybody into singing ""On the Cover of Rolling Stone"" when he learns he and his fellow bandmates will be on the cover.  It's in the wild spirit of people like Sapphire, one of the Band-Aids(read: groupies) who follow the band Stillwater and others as they tour the U.S., or in the more tender spirit of someone like her sister Band-Aid Penny Lane, who believes she and the other Band-Aids serve as a muse to bands like Stillwater, and who soaks in all of her experiences like a sponge.  It's also in William, who tries(like Crowe did) to balance reporting with his very obvious love for the music.  And it's especially in the line I quoted from at the top, which Sapphire says to Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond late in the movie.  To be sure, the road of rock-n-roll isn't all covered in roses.  There's outrageous behavior(like how Russell treats Penny, or William losing his virginity to three of the groupies), drugs, excess, and yes, pretension(like when Jeff lectures Penny about the power of rock-n-roll and then adds, ""And the chicks are cool, right?""  But those who wanted this to be more like THIS IS SPINAL TAP are missing the point.  This isn't a movie about the obvious problems and silliness in rock music.  It's about what still draws people to it, and though Crowe acknowledges these people's faults, he still loves them for who they are.Of course, there's a lot more reasons why ALMOST FAMOUS is a great movie besides its love of rock-n-roll.  It's well acted across the board(in addition to all the performances mentioned several times, I'd like to highlight Fairuza Balk as Sapphire; not only does she get the best line in the movie(along with Frances McDormand's ""Don't take drugs!"" and ""Rock stars have kidnapped my son"") with that line about music(I also like what she and the other groupies yell as they're about to deflower William, ""Death to Opie!""), but she also captures the carefree spirit of the time.  She may not be important plot wise, but if you took her character out, the movie would be missing something), it's a terrific coming-of-age story, it's a bittersweet love story, the dialogue is great, and it looks terrific.  But it's Crowe's obvious love for the music, and for the people who love it, that makes ALMOST FAMOUS the best thing I've seen so far this year.",Almost Famous

The director's ""Untitled"" cut is sublime, rich and personal, it's like a double album, Cameron Crowe here still the master of creating compelling characters and blisteringly engaging and complex scenes amalgamated from his life. Patrick Fugit's lead character is delightful from start to finish, pure adolescence, his perfect part, he's sweet, odd, and real. And his evolution is natural and heartbreaking and beautiful.

It's not the story but the warm feeling, which is springing from every scene, that redeems the audience. A movie that leaves you with a sweet taste can't go wrong. All technical aspects are worked out very well and first-class music is playing throughout the film. There are some major scenario flaws though, especially the William Miller role. It was both badly written and miscast. I understand the part where the teens must identify with the protagonists since there is money to be made, but please. The whole concept of the teenage music reviewer was poorly thought out, let alone the disappointing performance of Patrick Fugit.

He always does the same thing. The beginning is very, very promising, the first half of the movie is highly entertaining and funny and his choice of actors is impecable, but after that first half the movie loses its pace and in the last quarter it just takes a dive and never quite reaches the surface. After Penny Lane discovers she was dumped by the love of her life the movie goes from a 9/10 to 7/10. I don't get it. And the exact same thing happened with Jerry Maguire.But I have to say that Crowe brings out the best in every single actor, well except Patrick Fugit, who looked and was kind of annoying and the scene where he tells Penny Lane the truth is terrible. Because of his acting.Anyway, Kate Hudson looks AMAZING, (as did Renee Zellweger in ""Maguire""), she looks like a different version of Anastacia.Since both movies are almost exactly the same in the way they were made......a 7/10.",Almost Famous

Well, it's not all that it seems. Cameron Crowe tells us in a wonderful journey through the eyes of a 15 year old.Almost Famous gives us an inside look at life on the road with an up and coming rock band in the 1970's. Newcomer Patrick Fugit is William Miller is the young star struck journalist who happens to write his way into attention of Rolling Stone Magazine. Although he isn't old enough to drive yet, he is learning more than any rock n' roll fanatic could comprehend in a lifetime.The band members at first are very skeptical of Will's goals for the story on their band. Calling him the ""enemy"" and such, you might think that an adolescent boy might cave in under the pressure. His fast approaching deadline and lack of a story are the least of his problems. His mother, played by Frances McDormand (Fargo), is constantly keeping tabs on his whereabouts and making sure he keeps up with his school work. Stillwater might be the name of the band but there are rough waters ahead. Lead guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup; Big Fish) and lead singer Jeff (Jason Lee; Vanilla Sky) clash at times, there are fun times to be had. The bands followers, the ""Band-Aids"", are lead by Penny Lane, the love interest for Will and Russell's lady on the side. Kate Hudson's stellar performance won her a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination.So what makes this such a great movie? With the exception of the award winning cast, it has got to be the writing. Crowe's other works include Say Anything, Jerry MaGuire, and Vanilla Sky. His creative style of telling a story is unparalleled by any other. He shows great character development in Will and even in Penny.It's a coming of age story with music being the one connection between all the characters. They all have had music be some form of influence in their lives. Writing it, playing it, reviewing it, and worshiping it. We all can connect with this as well. Growing up we've all had music in school, at home, on TV, and in our hearts. That's where this story starts from.Sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. The dream for some and what would be a harsh reality for others. We've all thought about it and have had wondered what it would be like. Money and the right ""people"" are ways of getting in. All Will needed was a notepad, a tape recorder, and a phone call. Living the dream can't be written downit has to be lived",Almost Famous

Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical tale of a nascent teenage music journalist's immersion in the world of rock anthems, groupies, and shifting group trajectories delivers rock's exalting highs and thudding lows in a way that lovingly honors the decadence and immersive mythology our biggest guitar-driven bands once manifested.Groupies, band ethos, and a shrewdly curated soundtrack sold this film, and it's those same reverent depictions that assure ""Almost Famous"" its place in the Pantheon of elite music films. - (Was this review of use to you?

127,hokeybutt,Why I Want To Hate Cameron Crowe...,7,2 April 2005,"ALMOST FAMOUS (3+ outta 5 stars) I really, really want to hate Cameron Crowe. I mean, come on... look at the guy's life! He was a writer at Rolling Stone when he was a teenager! He went around touring with rock bands when rock was COOL! He knew Lester Bangs! He wrote the book ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" after going undercover, pretending to be a high school kid when he was in his 20s! He married the blonde chick from Heart! What is NOT to hate about the guy? He has led a charmed life, too good to be believed! That is sort of the problem I have with this movie... his own personal recollection of what is what like to be young and in the midst of great things in the early-to-mid-70s... it all seems too good to be believed. Even though the fictitious rock stars depicted in this movie have their problems they still seem way too cute and cuddly. The groupies are way too sweet and wholesome. Even Lester Bangs seems to be a cleaned-up, white-washed version of himself. I don't believe this cleaned-up fairy tale version of the 70s for one second. And yet... somehow Cameron Crowe makes it seem almost real. I really want to hate him for making me go against what I believe and accepting HIS version of the way things were... but I can't. He has a movie-making GIFT and it can't be denied. The best scene from this movie isn't even IN the movie. It's a bonus deleted scene on the ""official bootleg"" DVD of the director's cut version of the movie dubbed ""Untitled"" (Crowe's preferred name for the film). This scene is not in the movie because Led Zeppelin wouldn't give him the rights to use ""Stairway To Heaven"". They can't even use the song on the DVD! What you have to do is, you have to play your own copy of the song at the right point during the scene (the DVD tells you when)... and then sit back and watch 8 minutes and 22 seconds of movie magic: trying to convince his mother of the validity of rock music as an artform, young William (Patrick Fugit) and a group of friends and teachers play ""Stairway to Heaven"" in its entirety... reacting to every note and nuance in an extraordinarily choreographed scene that makes you FEEL the song the way THEY feel it. Even if, like me, you are sick to death of that overplayed and overrated piece of 70s ""lite rock"", you can't help but be mesmerized by the way Crowe presents it here. I never thought it would be possible for me to listen to and enjoy ""Stairway to Heaven"" ever again! See? THAT's why I want to hate Cameron Crowe!",Almost Famous

It would be a genre, if its enthusiasts could spell or understand the word. ""Almost Famous"" sets a new standard for coming-of-age films, roady films and period films. The characters are genuine. The acting is engaging. The pace of the film hums along like a well maintained touring bus. It carries you gracefully over some of its own bumps. Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup manage their complex characters extremely well. Patrick Fugit, whose looks initially worried me into thinking he would be blandly cherubic in his role, manages to be funny and painfully sincere without being cutesy. Cameron Crowe's direction of his own script manages to keep the focus on William, Fugit's character, without stepping on the toes of the other remarkable characters in the story. I think Jason Lee put in an excellent performance as the band's lead singer. Philip Seymour Hoffman (always a treat) does an excellent tutoring demon on William's left shoulder, opposite Frances McDormand's angel of morality on his right shoulder. This film  entertained and delighted from start to finish.",Almost Famous

It is about a teenage boy who wants to become a reporter for the Rolling Stone, so he joins the tour of Stillwater, an up and coming rock band. He deals with rejection as well as acceptance, and he even ends up falling in love.I must say, this movie is really good. All of the performances are exceptionally good. Everybody does great in all of their roles. The film is written great. It really captures the heart of music and the music industry in the 1970's. This movie blends just the right amount of drama and humour. If you're a huge music buff, you'll be really pleased with how cram packed this movie is with references to bands and songs from the era.Almost Famous is one of those films that knows it's good, but doesn't flaunt it too much.

This flick does not show musical insight as much as the social scene surrounding them. The honesty, as portrayed by Billy Crudup as lead guitarist, and the self denial, as demonstrated by Kate Husdon as Miss Penny Lane, carry the film while our teenage writer travels from city to city having his interview delayed while the rock and roll cliché dramatically plays out.

With a rocky start getting back stage, William meets Penny Lane; a Band Aid and the band Still Water. Striking a cord with Penny and Still Water guitarist Russell, William is sucked into their world, traveling with the band across the country, yet finds his mother precautions was not empty advice.Almost Famous is one of the greatest films on rock n roll. Writer/Director Cameron Crowe, plainly shows his love for the music of the seventies, and does it in great style. Not over glorifying, nor degrading, Crowe honestly portrays the life of a struggling band; musically and emotionally, the fights between band members over recognition. Caught in the middle of the bands tensions, William coming of age, who's been sheltered his entire life is thrown into an unknown world, needing to emotionally act older than he is.Hitting all the notes and emotional cords perfectly, maybe to perfect, the soundtrack is a defining facet of Almost Famous. There is such a magical moment when the band sing Elton John's Tiny Dancer. The soundtrack highlights moments of the seventies music, where many bands were defining cornerstones of the rock movement, influencing musicians today.The cast are nothing short of outstanding. Patrick Fugit in his debut role is amazing, he shows much naivety in William in simple glances. Billy Crudup does one of his best performance as Russell. Frances McDormand is amazing as always, she is such a great actress. Jason Lee does his best dramatic performance, leaving the 'idiot' persona from the Kevin Smith films. Though in a small role, Zooey Deschanel is great as Anita. Shining above all is Kate Hudson as the incomparable Penny Lane.

""Almost Famous"" is excellent, and you're probably going to enjoy it.  This is a movie that is absolutely in love with music, and it brings a nostalgic look at an era when being a rock star ment living life as one big party.

I give the film an 8 out of 10.There was one vital ingredient that forces me to hold back from granting a perfect 10. In a movie that was ostensibly an ode to the unique quality of rock, no attempt was made to give Still Water ""a sound.""  William Miller discusses very little about particular lyrics, or use of bass, or percussion, or whatever that made him value or not value any particular song by Still Water.  Whilst we are told that the band girls appreciate the way he treats them as important human beings, we never see him probe their musical tastes and how Still Water satisfies them.

If any of these are combined and done well, then the result for me is phenomenal.Almost Famous, a film about a young kid touring with an up and coming rock band in the late 70's, captures the innocence of youth and growing up like no other film I have ever seen.This movie has great characters, a great story great acting and great cinematography (love the blue lighting for the concerts and some of the other road scenes, and my personal fav when Lady Jane is dancing by herself sliding on balloons in an empty gymnasium). Great soundtrack.I am not a fan of the 70's at all.  In 1973 I was in diapers.  I have a saying that 70% of everything that happened in the 70's I felt was bad, but this film made me feel otherwise.  I still like the other 30% and this movie captured all of that 30% for me.Another review I read about this film, the reviewer talked about how this movie is more than a story but there are moments you are not watching as a bystander, but that you are in the story yourself IDENTIFYING with it.  The reviewer talked about the scene where the young kid pulls the records out from under his bed after his sister leaves home.  For the reviewer that was the scene he identified with and it is a great scene, who doesn't remember the first time they started discovering their favourite music and bands.For me the scene was when the Led Zeppplin song Tangerine played (Can't remember the exact time, but it was in an important part in the story).  As soon as I heard it I remembered it, I hadn't heard it in YEARS!! and then all the memories flooded back, as I saw myself as a young kid playing it on my guitar OVER and OVER again.  That was when I saw myself on the screen.That's what this movie does to you.  Something happens so magical in this movie that it all clicks instantly.  Ironically I found that song from my sisters album collection too.  Movies like that are RARE.  They are pure magic.The other thing is that because this story is about Rock and Roll, there is an amazing amount of honesty in it without being dumb.  There is none of the cliched stereotypes such as rockers saying ""We have to do what's best for the band man"", ""I play for rock and roll"",  or emphasis on over drug use and chicks, the movie is about PEOPLE.Also there are 2 great prophetic lines (one about fax machines, the other about Mick Jagger) which are purely CLASSIC!Funny, touching, brilliant, inspiring, uplifting.  All words to describe this film.This film and 'High Fidelity' (which has a similar music theme), are the best films I have seen this year PERIOD!

139,GeorgeRoots,Never Really Gets Old.,9,22 September 2014,"""Almost Famous"", has kind of reached god-like status as being the penultimate of a ""Roadie"" movie, and in all honesty I can't blame it. At the age of 10 I remember seeing some 30 minutes of it, and becoming instantly hooked on it. Sadly you never really remember as much as you'd like to from your childhood years, and my musical tastes would not develop for another three. It was another 2 years until I finally managed to see it in its entirety. Funny enough I had never followed the music, and nowadays I couldn't imagine living without it.Based on director Cameron Crowe's teenage years of being a writer for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, his efforts definitely give a ""I would love to have been there"" effect. By setting up some groovy scenarios as well as some deeply well paced character development, you definitely end up seeing the world through the kids eyes and become more drawn into the movie. Thanks to the likes of Billy Crudup, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, Patrick Fugit and so many more, a fantastic soundtrack really helps build this unique, ""biographical"" coming of age story. Looking back, I find myself saying this was easily one of the best for the year 2000.Final Verdict: One of those movies that really feels like a farewell tribute to the classic bands of the 1970's. Through it's impressive leads, ""Almost Famous"" ends up becoming strong and clever cinematic poetry (Possibly they were ""hazy"" at the time). 9/10.",Almost Famous
140,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Almost Famous,8,16 March 2011,"A film that hits more real notes than just being famous Almost Famous is a fine film and a perfect example of how to make a movie about a band, a group, a young writer, a young female and people. Ultimately the film is about people, perhaps not who they are, but rather who they believe they are. Director Cameron Crowe hits all the right buttons in creating a movie that does not seem a tad manufactured and in fact more real than it should be. A ground breaking role of sorts from the then upcoming star Kate Hudson. In one scene, she showed almost the sort of potential that made her a star. When William tells her about the rock star true intentions, Hudson turns away with tears in her eyes and putting on a short brave smile. A classic bittersweet moment.What I liked about Almost Famous is not so such of its coming of age intention, but the way Crowe exposes the kid, William into the adult world of drugs, sex, jealousy, love, friendship and ultimately humanity. Ultimately, Almost Famous works because it is genuine. It is genuinely enjoyable, fascinating, funny, touching, lively and most important of all, a film filled with believable characters. At the end of the day, the film tells us that the truth hurts, but like the legendary veteran rock critic says: 'you need to remain honest and un-merciless"". Likewise, as Kate Hudson sums it up well: ""the truth just sounds different"". In all honestly, Almost Famous is a fine film...(Neo 2010) I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com",Almost Famous

The fictionalization of Crowe's days as a teenage reporter for Creem and Rolling Stone has all the well-written characters and wonderful ""movie moments"" that we expect from Crowe (Jerry Maguire), but the film has an intangible something extra--an insider's touch that will turn the film into the ode to '70s rock & roll for years to come. We are introduced to Crowe's alter ego, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), at home, where his progressive mom (Frances McDormand, just superb) has outlawed rock music and sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) has slipped him LPs that will ""set his mind free."" Following the wisdom of Creem's disheveled editor, Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman in an instant-classic performance), Miller gets on the inside with the up-and-coming band Stillwater (a fictionalized mixture of the Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin, and others). A simple visit with the band turns into a three-week, life-altering odyssey into the heyday of American rock. Of the characters he meets on the road, the two most important are groupie extraordinary Penny Lane (Kate Hudson in a star-making performance) and Stillwater's enigmatic lead guitarist (Billy Crudup), who keeps stringing Miller along for an interview.

That was the time when several little-known bands toured all over the country... accompanied mostly by drugs and groupies. Writer-director Cameron Crowe takes us to that infamous scene of sex, drugs and rock n' roll in the 1970's with this semi-autobiographical work, which is not only equipped with his brilliant direction and screenplay, but also by decent performances by some relatively lesser-known actors.Here the introduction of a not-too-famous band, an imaginary one called Stillwater, was important. In that sense, Stillwater is a perfect work by Crowe... with a volatile relationship between the vocalist and the guitarist, with a noncompetent manager and everything that comes with. There were also the groupies, who became a matter of substance in Crowe's point of view. But the most extraordinary thing that Crowe did is the image of himself as a 15-year-old writing prodigy, rock journalist William Miller. The viewers watch the movie through Miller's eyes. The character is extremely well-designed and reserved by Crowe. Miller's the one who becomes able to attach all the parts into a complete movie alone.Billy Crudup was probably the best among the actors as guitarist Russell Hammond. It's true his role was not a tough one, but he's the one who made it look so easy. Young Kate Hudson, as Penny Lane, is perfect and very adorable. She showed her potentials in this movie which seemed even better than her mother, Goldie Hawn. All she needs are decent roles in future. The other actors, namely Jason Lee as vocalist Jeff, Frances McDormand as Williams's over-protective mother and the other band-aids (with Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) performed also quite well. And newcomer Patrick Fugit, as Miller himself, is really brilliant. Gaining more screen time than anyone else, it was a tough test for Fugit and it is all praises for him.The soundtrack was very good with some fine original songs. There may be some minor flaws in the movie, like some unnecessary sequences, but all over this is a quite masterful work... a feast for the mind and soul, both for a hard rock n' roll fan and for casual viewers.",Almost Famous
144,luke-a-mcgowan,"A nostalgia driven film with specific fans, and its selection of great performances and memorable quotes can only appeal so far",8,15 June 2015,"Almost Famous is nostalgia porn for rock music, big moustaches and the 1970s. Its appeal does exist beyond that, but as a semi-autobiographical film for Cameron Crowe, I feel that a substantial portion of the wind has gone out of the sails for those who don't share his fond memories of the era.The story follows William (an impressively naive but determined Patrick Fugit) as he follows the band Stillwater around on tour, trying to get an interview for Rolling Stone magazine. He experiences their lifestyle and becomes enamoured with a young groupie called Penny (Kate Hudson, an endearing, mischievous, mysterious performance). The story I felt did drag in places, and I felt that William's character was not as well established or realistic as could be. His jump to Rolling Stone magazine happens to abruptly - for something that is supposed to be a big deal, it happens to quickly that they would have been better off just starting with him writing for them, instead of starting before that.Beyond Hudson and Fugit, Billy Crudup was a standout for me as the egotistical leading guitarist of Stillwater, Russell Hammond. During one scene on an acid high, Russell steals the entire movie. Jason Lee is also incredibly good. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is incredible as Lester Bangs, a rock journalist who becomes William's closest adviser and shoulder to lean on - he is out there and enthusiastic, but also tender, gentle and empathetic. The film's strongest asset however, was Frances McDormand as William's mother. Overprotective, driven and loving, she is a perfect embodiment of an interfering mother just shy of becoming a caricature. I empathised so much with William whenever his mother called him. See the ""I love you and I miss you"" scene on the payphone for the scene that should have won McDormand a second Oscar. She even blisters a kidding Russell into some sense of responsibility.What really ground my gears was the film's wasting of its other Oscar-winning actress, Anna Paquin. Relegated to around 8 minutes of screen time in a minor role, Crowe evidently had some problem with Paquin as he frequently directs the cameras to cut away from her whenever she arrived in a scene. She has perhaps one meaningful moment in the entire film (an expository line), the rest of which she is dismissed as ""slutty groupie #3"". I also felt that Jimmy Fallon played a completely unnecessary character, and Zooey Deschanel really didn't know what she was doing half the time.Crowe's screenplay, much like the performances he directs, has shining gems and less impressive scuffs. The scene in which William confides his hurt in Lester is one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen. Ditto the ""I love you and I miss you"" scene mentioned before. But at other times I felt the writing was cheesy - ""she's a bandaid!"" screams William, like that's supposed to mean something. Penny and her friends make such a big deal out of the fact that they do not sleep with the band at the start of the film, and then cut to a series of montages of Paquin and Hudson being groped and eaten by the band's members for the rest of the movie. Go figure. The band's ""selling"" of Penny and the bandaids to another band also felt like a plot point that was completely out of left field and was crammed in to try and set up later scenes.Almost Famous finishes beautifully, and I admire it for that. But I can't shake the feeling that this nostalgia-driven film has a specific target audience, and the selection of great performances and memorable quotes can only appeal so far.",Almost Famous
145,noahgibbobaker,Repulsive for personal reasons.,5,30 June 2021,"As a aspiring journalist, pessimistic by choice I say that 'Almost Famous' radiates an unrealistic optimism I loathe, I only hope nobody falls for Crowe' idealistic reality; it is exactly what its meant to be: a rock fans wet dream, and there's a place for that, but as it stands I can't stand it.Points for a good soundtrack, mainly for Cat Stevens and the uttering of ""Bob Dylan"" though.",Almost Famous

147,Shiva-11,How to make a film about Rock and Roll,8,13 September 2000,"Rock Star.  Dot-com billionaire.  Cowboy.  At some point in their life, everyone fantasizes about their dream job (in my case it's the seat opposite Ebert)   Unfortunately most people end up doing the ""sensible"" thing, take the safe job and spend the rest of their life wondering What if?  In 1973, William Miller determined he would never ask that question.William has it tough: fifteen years old, bright, awkward, and with no friends, he lives with a shrewish, domineering, anti-everything mother who is convinced that anyone who listens to rock music will become a drug addled sex fiend.  This doesn't make his aspirations to be a rock journalist any easier.  Not to be dissuaded from his goal, he continues to pound out articles on his trusty Smith Corona.  And then the unthinkable happens - the music editor for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, intrigued by William's fresh and novel style calls with an offer - William will go on tour with ""Stillwater"", an up and coming band, report on his experiences and get paid a princely sum.   Who needs the lottery?!?First, let me say that being born in the seventies (or god forbid sixties) is not a prerequisite to enjoying this movie. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, ""Almost Famous"" is a semi-autobiographical account of his first job with Rolling Stone in the seventies.    The Oscar-buzz began even before the movie was released and with good reason - Crowe writes great screenplays (""Say Anything"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" come to mine).  And this outing is no exception Crowe skillfully combines the coming-of-age and life-on-the-road elements of the story, with complex characterizations, well-scripted dialogue and a unique soundtrack, which enable him to accurately capture the spirit of the era.  The ""reality"" aspects of the film are further enhanced by the carefully choreographed concert sequences.   Thankfully casting was given as much consideration as the rest of the film. Billy Crudup should finally get the recognition he deserves with his portrayal of Russel, the enigmatic lead guitarist for the group, who shuns the spotlight and lives the music.  Crudup is able to balance detached passion, a keen comedic sense, confused sincerity and lighting swift mood shifts to create an almost Svengali-like character.   Newcomer Patrick Fugit shines as William the shy, ingenue who struggles to remain objective when thrust into a foreign world awash with temptation and you cringe as you await his abrupt crash back into reality.   Also, Kate Hudson, true to her lineage (Goldie Hawn is her mom) is both ditzy and worldly as Penny Lane, the leader of the Band-Aids (groupies with class and codes), who is able to convey multitudes with her knowing smile.  However, in spite of her worldly ways she betrays a guarded vulnerability that inspires pathos for her character.   Finally, the supporting cast -Kevin Smith regular Jason Lee (Clerks) and Philip Seymour Harris (The Talented Mr. Ripley)- also deliver top-notch performances.  My only quibble with the cast would have to be Frances McDormand whose over-the-top manic behavior is distracting and annoying.  Except for one especially ridiculous sequence near the end of the film (I can't reveal more without spoiling a key plot twist, but at least it is short-lived) this movie would be perfect.  But almost perfect is close enough.",Almost Famous
148,gitrich,Almost Famous is Almost Good,7,29 March 2001,"When I go to any movie, I look for believability. There is no doubt that the offstage scenes involving the band were realistic but how in the world could a 15 year old boy leave high school and join a rock band on tour as a journalist? While on tour, he even gets a contract from Rolling Stone magazine, no less, to do a piece on an unknown band trying to get known in the rock scene of the 70s. Also, the boys mother, played well by Francis McDormand , is over protective throughout the film  but still allows her son to go with and hang out with band members and underaged girls on drugs. Give me a break people!  The pace of the film is far too slow. The message is to stay away from drugs which is good. Sitting through it to get the message is a struggle. To its credit, it stays away from graphic sex and foul language. It also manages to throw in some nice humor at time. Young people will probably love it but this effort is average in my book.",Almost Famous
149,Mitch-38,ALMOST RARELY COUNTS...,7,10 April 2002,"Director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe's ode to the lifestyle, music and mindset of the American music scene (pre-Disco 1970's). This is told through the eyes of William Miller, a fifteen year old who travels with the band for Rolling Stone magazine. The characters, whether band members or groupies or hippies or yippies, et al, that he meets along the way make for an interesting film, but we never sense a relationship between the proverbial ""them"" and ""us"" (the audience). If most of us tell the truth, we don't have wild groupies running after us for rampant sex and drugs. That's if we're telling the truth that is. With he exception of Miller and Pennylane, we never see much in the way of complicated or multi-dimensional characters. What we're left with a fleeting vignettes of scenes that sparkle or liven up the proceedings, in a misty funk. The rest comes off terribly self indulgent on a visceral level. ALMOST FAMOUS isn't a flop, but it surely isn't for everyone. Those who came of age during this will appreciate the efforts.

151,Brogan,Oh my God.......,10,18 September 2000,"I have been watching movies for the twenty-two out of twenty-four years that I have been alive.  I have seen some movies that have made me laugh my head off.  I have also seen others that touched me very emotionally. And there are movies that take you out of the world that you live in, and bring you into the world that is showing on the screen. But it is so rare to find a film that is funny, touching, and brings out the imagination of the director and into the viewer.  And the new Cameron Crowe film, ALMOST FAMOUS succeeds! The story is a partial autobiography of Crowe's teenage years, when he was a writer for the magazine 'Rolling Stone.' The alter-ego of Crowe is William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a young man who is out of place with the world.  He's three years younger than most of his classmates, and he is always seen as a social outcast.  It isn't until his older sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel) is convinced after listening to the Simon & Garfunkle song 'America' that she needs to move out of her home and become a airline stewardess.  The protective mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand), who is very much like the mother described in the Roger Waters lyrics, objects to Anita's departure but does not stop her.  When Anita leaves, she tells her little brother that she has left something for him, it's her entire collection of rock and roll LP's.      A few years later, William becomes fascinated with rock music that he writes reviews for his high school newspaper.  It isn't until he befriends a small music magazine critic, Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that musicians and critics can never be friends, it's all business.  When Lester gives William a assignment to write a review of a Black Sabbath concert, he meets a group of ""Band-Aids"" girls who love the musicians, but do not sleep with them.  The leader of the 'Band-Aids' is the beautiful and mysterious Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  William is tansfixed by Penny's appearance and attitude, she is free minded and is very spiritual, which has William fallen in love with her.  Then William impresses the up and comimg popular rock band Stillwater.  William befriends Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup).  But the band's lead singer, Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) sees young William as the 'enemy' or a representative medium that has trashed 'Layla' and every Led Zepplin album. William is then offered by Rolling Stone magazine to write a article on Stillwater and their band members.  From there on, William doesn't only get a trip across America, but a trip into a new world that he only dreamed of going into. Cameron Crowe has a great batting average when it comes to making excellent movies.  SAY ANYTHING, SINGLES, and JERRY MAGUIRE are films that all stand on their own as great pieces of the American culture of the 1990's.  But for the millennium, Crowe has traveled back almost thirty years to tell his story. And for that, he hits a home run.      The acting by all of it's stars do a fantastic job!  They do not play characters on the screen, they play real people with real feelings.  I have seen Billy Crudup, Frances MCcDormand, Kate Hudson, and Jason Lee in several films before I saw this film.  And yet, when I was watching this film, I wasn't watching actors, but people with dreams, fear, and hopes for the future.  And Patrick Fugit does a outstanding job in his screen debut, perhaps the most impressive screen debut I have ever seen. I have always and still listen to the music of the '60's and 70's.  I prefer the music of Beatles and Pink Floyd to 90% of today's modern music. From watching this movie, it give me a feeling that the musicans that are considered to be 'dinosaur rock' today, were young musicians as well.  It shows me that the influence of rock music hasn't changed at all.  Music is not a medium for money and continious radio play, which most film directors today use it as.  No, Crowe has music come alive, to have a heart and feelings.  It's poetry from the musicians mind being played out to the world.  The 70's were the time when people had no limits to express themselves as the musicians expressed their beliefs through their music. But the limits ended when Pink Floyd built it's 'wall,' Paul McCartney getting arrested in Japan for marijuana, John Lennon was murdered, and the conservative views of Ronald Regan were born. But Cameron Crowe lets the viewers of today to realize that there was a time when people could say whatever they wanted through their music.  The time when music was at it's creative peak, and not to be slapped with ""censorship' labels, bubble gum pop rock, or how many copies does the album sell. There was indeed a time like that.  And ALMOST FAMOUS does show that in the film.  This is a film that has the intellect of AMERICAN BEAUTY and the charm of JERRY MAGUIRE.  And not since THE INSIDER have I seen a film that has just blown me away. I can't see this movie getting passed over for a Best Picture nomination, or even not getting Best Picture.  This is a film that filmmakers would only dream of making, and Cameron Crowe does it well.  Thank you very much Mr. Crowe, this film is one of the best films I have ever seen.  ***** (out of five)",Almost Famous
152,HelloTexas11,remember Stillwater?,8,19 April 2008,"Probably the hardest thing to accept in 'Almost Famous' is the apparent age of William Miller (Patrick Fugit), something of a teen prodigy who is fifteen, pretends to be eighteen, and looks like he's eleven. If you can get past that, you'll find a lot to like in this film. Will gets a huge break when Rolling Stone hires him to write a story about the rock band Stillwater; they've read some of his stuff and are impressed, and since everything is conducted over the phone, the editor has no idea of his real age. What commences then is a teen's wet dream, going on tour with a rock group, hanging out with them backstage and being taken in by them as a confidant. The movie captures a second-tier rock act's tour and all the excitement, chaos, and drug-fueled stupidity that engulfs and surrounds it brilliantly. The band members, their groupies, their manager, the roadies, and Will are all on the same crazy train ride, sucked into the ongoing insanity that was a rock and roll tour back in the seventies. Some things have changed since then, some haven't, but the enduring myths and realities of the rock lifestyle are painted vividly here. The fact that most people know or suspect what goes on behind the scenes doesn't diminish the drama and humor in 'Almost Famous.' It somehow manages to be both familiar and surprising. At times, it's like a believable version of 'This Is Spinal Tap.' And 'believable' is a good starting description for the fictional band Stillwater. It is to the actors' and director's credit that the group is portrayed so realistically, down to the last detail, that you'll swear you remember seeing them on tour with Foghat or Black Oak Arkansas. I know I did; the first time I saw 'Almost Famous' was with a group of friends and I actually said, ""Yeah, I think I remember these guys."" Which, of course, makes no sense since the movie is twenty-five years after the 'fact,' and not even the Rolling Stones have preserved that well. Stillwater's big hit in the movie, 'Fever Dog,' sounds like it could have come straight out of Molly Hatchet's songbook. There is an excruciatingly hilarious scene which takes place after one of their shows that is almost impossible to describe. The band's leader holds court in a bedroom like some kind of stoned messiah, groupies and fan boys hanging on his every chemically-altered word as if it were Biblical prophecy. It helps if you have actually been in such a situation before (as I have) but it's not absolutely necessary. And then there's the scene on the airplane where the band and everyone else on board are convinced they're about to crash and so the deathbed confessions come flying, fast and furious. You'll be catching your breath after that bit as well. A groupie (Kate Hudson) who goes by the name Penny Lane figures prominently into the proceedings and, you guessed it, young William falls in love with her which complicates matters that were pretty damn complicated to begin with. In the end, everything turns out fine; Will gets his story published in Rolling Stone, the band keeps touring and the principals involved are left, like the audience, shaking their heads and thinking, ""Whoa, did all that really happen?"" No, it didn't, but it sure seems like it did.",Almost Famous

And they pick up his bill as he goes on tour with the band? Come on! The other question I have is that if this movie is about the kid and his experience on the road, how is that Kate Hudson ends up on the cover of the movie poster? I can't speak on the reality of being behind the scenes with the band, because I've never been behind the scenes, myself, but it makes for a good movie and the actors blend very well to bring characters to life.

Almost Famous was definitely in the top 5 for the best though. I think the only movies ahead of it would have been the two drug movies-Requiem for a Dream and Traffic. Director-Writer Cameron Crowe knows how to make a good movie, take a look at Jerry Maguire.
The acting is a huge strength in this movie. Patrick Fugit is quite believable as the ""uncool"" journalist but he is also overshadowed by a number of the actors. Frances McDormand is perfect as an overprotective mother. Kate Hudson lights up every scene shes in, she is absolutely perfect as Penny Lane, and should have won the supporting Actress Oscar. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Lee are scene stealers. The only complaint I have about the acting is Billy Crudup, he gives an uneven performance, I think he is a bit too hard as Russell at times and makes the character hard to like at all, but he actually is quite effective and likable in the end. The rest of the cast is strong. The movie has a beautifully written screenplay. I think this film represents Cameron Crowe at his best, just edging out Jerry Maguire.

What was I thinking?Every now and then a movie grabs me, and I watch the DVD literally every day for a couple of months. Contact. L.A. Confidential. 54. That sort of thing. And now, Almost Famous. This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it. If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team. I read Creem Magazine all the time. It was like a sacrament. At last, I get to see the other side, the lives of not only the people who wrote those sacred words, but also the people they wrote them about.Although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles. There's no star baggage or hype. Even Kate Hudson, the archetypal Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable. The exception, of course, is Frances McDormand. As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe-like character angsting over the sudden maturity thrust upon her prodigal son.There are moments; the band on a bus singing ""Tiny Dancer"", the guitarist on the roof proclaiming ""I am a Golden God"" (once uttered in real life by Robert Plant), and just about every scene with Patrick Fugit, who is nothing short of amazing, where this movie transcends its medium, its message, and becomes something much more.

159,CMTiago,Life On The Road,9,9 May 2014,"Almost Famous is a complete journey into a time long gone, a time that is very much an illusion by today's generation. The passion and devotion to the music seems to be fading away in recent times and with this movie, the audience experience, above all else, music and its beauty. Of course it also highlights the inner difficulties that go into the process of exposing our feelings onto a song. In the end, I believe that you either cope with this and move on, or you acknowledge failure and start fresh.In terms of plot, AF is about a young boy that is assigned by Rolling Stone magazine to interview a touring band named Stillwater. All kind of trouble will ensue as he enters this party filled world of the 1970's Rock scene. Through his eyes, the viewer will watch a band trying to cope with their intimate demons and a sort of muse to the young journalist, in the form of a groupie known as Penny Lane reveal herself as a troubled girl.Performance wise, the movie is in extremely good hands with the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee and more giving convincing and likable performances. The main player in the movie, Patrick Fugit, handles the role very well and I'm kind of surprised I haven't seen him in anything else. Cameron Crowe's vision is one of raw and cynical beauty and a somewhat dark humorous atmosphere. It is a joy to view this film and feel as though you are a part of everything, but as our protagonists learns, nothing is what it seems in this environment. I strongly recommend the viewing of this emotional roller-coaster. It will be worth every minute.Rating 7,5/10",Almost Famous
160,Mickey Knox,Almost Perfect,9,19 October 2002,"For starters, let me tell you that I am pretty much like the lead character in this film. I'm also a journalist, I'm friends with a famous rock band, hang out with them on tours, concerts, etc. So you can imagine what impact this movie had on me. I was amazed, I really felt throughout the movie that I'm William, the main character. It's an awesome feeling.Almost Famous is a great movie, coming from a great director that already gave us Jerry Maguire, and who ""exercised"" his skills in creating love stories in a rock environment in his movie ""Singles"" (which features appearences from Eddie Vedder, Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell).This time, it's about a young reporter, hired by ""Rolling Stone"" to do a story about a growing rock band of the Seventies - a fictional band called Stillwater. He goes with them on tour, falls for a beautiful fan, and, of course, many other things happen as the plot develops.
Every aspect of this movie is created almost perfectly.
The screenplay, to begin with. It's a great story, that develops logically and beautifully, great characters, that you really get to care for. Sometimes touching, sometimes funny or even dramatic, it's a story that totally deserves its Academy Award.Then the acting. The movie doesn't have any stars, and the lead character is a totally unknown young man. But they all do a great job.
And then there's the music. True perfection. The movie manages to surprise everything about rock'n'roll, from its greatness to its bad moments, through the eyes of a young music lover that grew up in a ""No Environment"". It's a pleasure to listen to all these great songs and bands that changed music forever.I really can't describe the warmth and beauty of this movie. There's something about it that makes it so special. Maybe it's because this is, in many ways, the life story of director Cameron Crowe. Maybe that's the reason he wrote and directed this movie so carefully and with such a sensitivity.
All in all, Almost Famous is a movie I probably will never forget. If by any chance you missed it, you should do yourself a favor and rent it right now.

161,atzimo,"Great, but not without flaws",10,25 November 2002,"Cameron Crowe's 'Almost Famous' is the director's second attempt to create a rock'n'roll movie after the excellent 'Singles'. Let's not forget that 'Singles' helped the Seattle scene break out in the early 90s, so we are talking about a film maker who has a certain degree of rock'n'roll authority, compared to most of his peers.Although the movie is very interesting and the pace is great, there are some slightly annoying elements at some points. It is not very musically accurate and that would put off some of the fans and also the character development is not too thorough. Also the concerts didn't have the dynamics of the subsequent 'Rock Star', a movie with a somewhat similar theme that recreated in an astonishing way the rock concert sensation.Probably 'Almost Famous' needed a 2 and a half hour treatment, in order to create a less rushed feeling in the end. Early 70s rock, contains so many great stories that it's a shame that we don't have more movies about that era.On the other hand, it's great that someone had the will to make such a difficult movie and when that someone is Cameron Crowe the result is at least decent.9/10",Almost Famous

This could be described as phenomenal journey of a young kid in a world he may not be ready for. The acting is great and the whole environment does really well painting the time period it attempts to paint. The relationship between William and Russell is interesting and goes through much struggle only to succeed at the end. Penny's relationship with William is even more deeply thought out and somehow develops as not a romantic relationship but instead and almost familial type. My one issue that I have would be that the movie is too long; Luckily the movie even as it is too long, features several large scale events that keep the plot moving and the audience engaged.",Almost Famous

The things that happen in background in a rock-band. The over protective mom and her way of controlling life of her children. The outlaws, trust, friendship, truth, lies, secrets and regret. The effect in a band when one overshadows the rest. Band-aids and their meaning in rockstar world. Finally getting the dream?! Will she get hers?",Almost Famous
164,senortuffy,It's 1973 all over again.,8,17 July 2003,"This is a beautiful coming of age movie about a 15-year-old boy from San Diego who gets to live his fantasy when he lucks out and lands an assignment from Rolling Stone to tour with the band Sweetwater and write an article about them.William Miller, played by Patrick Fugit, is sweet and innocent and not at all like the band he's traveling with, but during the course of the film, he falls in love with one of the groupies, Penny Lane (played by Kate Hudson) and learns that the truth isn't always the easiest path out there.The cast is very good.  Billy Crudup plays Russell, the lead guitarist and member of the band closest to the young kid.  He's self-centered and oblivious to other people's feelings.  He coldly dumps Penny Lane when his wife shows up and puts William Miller off and almost ruins his story, but he's got a kind streak inside and redeems himself in the end.Kate Hudson shines out above all the other actors.  She's not a real groupie, at least not in her mind - she refers to herself as a ""band-aid"" or just a fan of the group.  She's sweet and fun-loving - I think her real life mom, Goldie Hawn, must have been jealous watching this film and did ""The Banger Sisters"" to try and match the vibe.  She also undergoes a maturing transformation by the end of the story.Anna Paquin plays another more worldy groupie, and Frances McDormand plays the young boy's mother.  Patrick Fugit isn't an accomplished actor but his character isn't polished either so his performance fits the role.The music from the era - early Seventies - is terrific, and the story of life on the road with an up-and-coming rock and roll band is fun and has a touch of reality to it.A very enjoyable film and one of my favorites.",Almost Famous
165,kergillian,"Another strong, solid Crowe effort.",8,14 May 2001,"I must admit, I'm always biased when watching one of Crowe's films. Say Anything is one of my favourite films of all time, and I met Mr. Crowe at the world premiere of Singles (another great one) at the Montreal World Film Festival and he was *really* nice, so it all ads up to me being very impressed with him and his work. So needless to say I was surprised when he did Jerry Maguire. Not only was I surprised by the type of film it was, but also because I wasn't too terribly impressed with it (cheeze factor aside, I'd even rate Fast Times higher).But I knew it wasn't permanent and Almost Famous proved it to me. Outside of Dazed and Confused, I can't think of another rock film in the last 15 years or so that I've enjoyed half as much. This film is just a good, fun, entertaining film. Which is not to say it doesn't have flaws: it does. But they are overcome by good acting, a fairly tight script, the all-important realism (which it *better* have as it's autobiographical) and the typical Cameron Crowe charm.Billy Crudup is alright in his role as Hammond, but he's overcome by *great* performances by the always-incredible Frances McDormand, Jason Lee (an interesting follow-up to Mallrats;), Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin, and Terry Chen playing the Rolling Stone honcho. Not to mention the stellar performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs (Scent of a Woman aside, does he *ever* choose a role that isn't simply magnificent...or should I say is it possible for him to *not* act amazingly in every film he does??? This, then State & Main...he just doesn't let up!)And then, the biggest surprise of all Kate Hudson actually seems to be able to act! And rather well at that! It was a pleasant surprise, and she did a magnificent job as groupie-er-*band-aid* Penny Lane. Expressive both in voice and body, she played her role to a tee.So what were the flaws? Well, I wasn't too fond of Patrick Fugit, he tended to whine a lot, and he *way* overplayed the naïve boy. He could've been schooled a bit more. And the dialogue was often *way* overly cheezy (then again, that's pretty much the same in all of Crowe's films...). And some of the scenes were overly generic and/or predictable (the Elton John scene on the tour bus being one example, the Topeka party scene another, and a lot of the scenes where Fugit takes center stage as well.)But that didn't deter this from being a solid film. The flaws are really quite minor and the film as a whole is very good.Look for Peter Frampton as Reg, and if you look really hard in the Topeka scene, you'll see Eric Stoltz reveling among the party people;)Overall: Fugit could've been better, perhaps Crudup as well, but they were helped by an extraordinary supporting cast. The script was perhaps a touch long, but tight nonetheless. Great soundtrack, and the film itself is quite charming. An easy 8/10.",Almost Famous
166,RIK-22,Very average fluffy story,5,12 May 2002,"I fail to see what anyone really sees in this film.The acting is fine, the film is reasonably well made and at least it's not another pointless Hollywood action movie, but the story so uninteresting. It's just a fluffy nice, unbelievable movie that has nothing new to say, it certainly doesn't shock and nothing really happens.An average support band, who argue a bit and have some relationships, are perused by some 15 year old reporter, who they seem to respect and treat like an adult.  Which I found unlikely.The movie, I suppose is about the love story (well infatuation ) of a teenager for a slightly older groupie.  Of course can anyone believe that a rock band and a bunch of groupies (people of hardly great integrity) would bother with the feelings of a 15 year old adolescent.Anyway, I didn't hate the film, just was very disappointed, I didn't relate to any of the characters and hence didn't really care about any of them. I'll give it a 5/10, just because it wasn't another Hollywood revenge movie, but the story was quite poor and uninteresting, as it had nothing to say.A shame as I thought Jerry Maguire was excellent.",Almost Famous

I was in my seventeens when it came out and was not the movie fanatic I am now, so I have to admit that I kind of missed it at the time. I had the opportunity to watch it lately and I was really really amazed.A really long movie for my taste but one that did not slug or drag even for a minute. Loved the story behind the ""band-aids"" and the acting by Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup. Patrick Fugit was also amazing in his acting, and being at his age more or less at the time, I am thankful that I didn't watch it back then cause I would have ended up some kind of reporter myself...! Philip Seymour Hoffman was iconic for one more time, leveling up the entire movie just with some short scenes after his lengthy appearance in the beginning. The movie depicts all the backstage stories of rock bands in the best way possible being soooo close to the real situation that it's amazing. It's a movie that does not hesitate to describe things as they happen and it gives the average person a really accurate view of how the industry of show business used to work at the time (or still does). The Jimmy Fallon appearance was also something that I was unaware about and I was thunderstruck by his amazing haircut! This was to die for!

169,FeverDog,Cameron Crowe: Renewing my faith in Hollywood *SPOILERS?*,10,13 December 2000,"What a wonderful movie.You know, a movie is released every coupla years that fills me with so much elation that I basically freak out afterwards in the lobby. (Past examples include Requiem For a Dream, Magnolia, Boogie Nights, Happiness, Trainspotting, Dazed and Confused, The Crying Game...) Now it's Almost Famous (I gotta stop calling it Almost Heroes).I cannot express my reaction and feelings after seeing this movie. So well written, acted, edited...so much joy - and judging by the reactions of everyone else in the (sold out) theatre, I am not alone; I cannot remember the last time I heard such a uproarious applause when the closing credits started rolling. I've been a fan of Mr. Crowe ever since I went to that Saturday matinee of Say Anything back in the day (I went since I really liked John Cusack in Better Off Dead & One Crazy Summer - hey, I was 15. And hey, if I had to pick a hero, it'd be Lloyd Dobler.) Singles was my first review for my college paper. And I was first in line at the Friday matinee the day Jerry Maguire opened. It just seems that each of Mr. Crowe's films are better than his last.And we're back to Almost Famous. Yeah, it's not perfect - what movie is?  Or maybe it is, but maybe I just can't believe that any film can be.  And Mr. Crowe seems to have dropped his signature touch - the average everyday object infused with unprecedented significance and meaning (the pen in Say Anything, the garage door opener in Singles, the goldfish in Jerry Maguire). I could be wrong and missed it this time; oh well, just another reason to see it again. But, oh, the goods are so good. From Ms. McDormand's terrific performance to the wonderfully realistic, acute, and perceptive dialogue (""What kind of beer?""), we better be seeing Ms. McDormand and Mr. Crowe again at the Oscars. What a pleasure to see a real film with real characters after a pretty putrid summer (let's see, there was Chicken Run and Chuck & Buck and, um, uh, well, not The Perfect Storm, which raped my memories of the novel, but that's another story). No guns, no explosions, nobody is killed. Are you listening, Hollywood? Come on, is it really that difficult? There's an underserved audience out here, you know, that squibs and stunt doubles and dynamite don't please...GO SEE THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY, with a bud, and head to the nearest Virgin afterwards to pick up the CD. But of course what self-respecting classic rock fan doesn't own all of Mr. Crowe's soundtracks? Almost Famous is gonna do for Elton John what Say Anything and Jerry McGuire did for Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen, respectively - capturing, commenting on and elevating a brilliant, heartfelt and human moment in a real relationship. And Stillwater rocked so much here that they should have their own album.Oh, another thing:  why is this movie rated R???  There's more sex, nudity, drugs, violence, and naughty language in Airplane! than anywhere near this film.Again.  What a wonderful movie.  I've seen Almost Famous only twice, but it still shares ""Best of 2000"" status with Requiem For a Dream (how can I possibly choose which is better?  They're completely different experiences). But what  really annoys most is that their total grosses combined do not approach what Charlie's Angels made during its opening weekend.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!?  To put it bluntly, Charlie's Angels is the most wretched blockbuster since The Bodyguard (and yes, I've seen Armageddon)...but I digress.Well, I've rambled enough. Lemme just say that I've cleared space on my mental mantle for Mr. Crowe's induction into the Movie Gods of Now. Make some room, Cronenburg, Coens, Solondz, Anderson, Aronofsky, Tarantino...I can't wait to see it again.  How many days until the DVD?10/10",Almost Famous

172,StevenKeys,Almost Famous,6,14 April 2021,"Patrick Fugit stars as a 70s teenager with journalistic ambitions who undertakes a campaign for employment that conceals his minor status, landing him a job with Rolling Stone magazine and a months long embedding with on-the-rise band, Stillwater.Based on events in the life of the movie's producer (+ Bryce), director and writer who'd go on to win the Oscar for original screenplay, this critic felt misled by Crowe, the early frames creating an expectation of watching a gifted youngster evolve into a professional scribe. What we get instead is a movie about a child who is atypically polite but typically conveys no special talent for, or interest in, writing, a skill that supposedly got him the prized gig in the first place. You'll see no creative struggles, no epiphanies, just this constant boyish grim on his cherub face as he forever grips a tape-recorder that he nearly never uses until the closing scene when he asks the band's befuddled star (Crudup), ""What do you love about music?"" Oy vey.This movie is really a Studio showcase of the film's two biggest names in Fargo's Frances McDormand (Mrs Miller) and Kate Hudson as #1 groupie, ""Penny Lane,"" using the director's unique story only as a means to get us all a backstage pass. But their performances are as pedestrian as the kid's query, mom relying on the telephone as a means of parenting, periodically pitching anger to quell her conscience, while it seems everybody's love interest Lane never has her breakthrough moment, including the drug overdose made unwatchable with a wholly inappropriate overlay of Stevie Wonder's signature My-Cherie-Amour. Two hours is too long to follow around a fifteen year old who uses his media credential to become a fan-boy and fall in love. Mister Crowe may've written that magazine cover piece, but we didn't see it in the movie, William more interested in the glamour and groupies than meeting his deadline, no more believable as a writer than that son of a glove-maker in Stratford-on-Avon (Shakspeare).Believable are supporting cast in Fairuza Balk (Sapphire), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Lester Bangs) and the band on the burgeon. Sapphire is #2 groupie and the film's sage, her by-chance phone chat with mom the best scene to that point, her late monologue in the commissary exactly what the aspiring writer SHOULD'VE been saying (""to truly love some silly little piece of music""). The band (Crudup Lee Fedevich Kozelek) and their quest for fame, each member trying to find their place in it, and that hairy-scary plane ride, are the meat of the movie. And Mr Hoffman as William's cynical mentor is terrific as always (Capote Boogie-Nights), his instructions terribly interesting, though, wrong on two points: 1) whether you're ""friends"" or not with the musicians is of no concern (gotta' stay on speaking terms), as long as you MEET YOUR DEADLINE, and 2) writers are not ""at home"" because they're ""uncool,"" they're at home because they WANT to be at home, compelled to do what they love and never finding enough time in the day to do it.Lacks the magic of Tootsie and Boogie-Nights, the two best films on the entertainment biz since A-Star-Is-Born (37), as well as their memorable scores, the latter's on par with compilation greats in Easy-Rider, American-Graffiti & GoodFellas. But Almost-Famous does have a certain something that, along with the believables, made me go the distance, which fairly makes it almost interesting (2.5/4).",Almost Famous

Many reviews saw this film as ""one of the greatest movies ever!"" It falls far short of a great movie.I remember when the movie came out, Steve King, Johnnie Putman, and Nick Digilio of WGN-Radio Chicago just raved, and raved about Almost Famous. I think their strong interests in 1960's-1970's music made the movie very special for them. In my view, the movie tries to be a big thing and wants viewers to be absorbed in it.The problem was, it just didn't do anything for me. However, the music soundtrack was excellent. I loved the ""Chipmunk Song"" in the beginning, and the attention to detail with the scratchy vinyl records. But William, the main character, was just too weak. He shows some backbone of the stress and aggravations that he experiences near the end of the movie. But throughout most of the film, I didn't care much about him, the people he followed, or with whom he associated.His Mother's worries and concerns should have been developed A LOT more. The pain, the stress, the frustrations of what this industry represents was just sugar-coated. The romantic interest with Penny was superficial and shallow. Scenes jump too quickly to get an everlasting impact with the viewer's relationship with the characters. This movie could have been a gem! However, it's just an average film. Nothing more, and a lot less than what I had expected.Almost Famous seems to have the outline to be a great film. Unfortunately, several ingredients seem to be missing, which prevent the movie from achieving greatness.

My special thanks to whoever had the good sense to re-introduce one of the Beach Boys all-time greats to a new audience. The sets (obviously stolen from ""That 70's Show) are right on the money as well.Considering the fact that Crowe could have gone the easy route and just strip-mined all the jokes from ""Tap"", he comes up with some great original takes. The airplane scene alone is worth the price of admission. And the love story never gets too hokey for its own good. The Band-Aids and Penny Lane (Plaster Casters and Pamela Des Barres?) are treated as on-the-road surrogate moms for the narrator instead of as out-and-out band bimbos.

Just like his hero (Played nobly by Patrick Fugit), he plays it honest, and it works.

One scene on the bus when everyone starts to sing ""Tiny Dancer"" tells you more about a generation then anything in the last twenty five years. They were into the music so much that it hurt, and it lets you see how a part of Americana stared to disappear into the hard reality of making money in the real world. The script was great and the acting was right on the money, more than that, the actors seemed to transcend their roles and become part of American history. The use of the sound tract was brilliant. To hold Led Zeppelin until the band had made it, to use The Allman Brothers for traveling on the bus and the use of Elton John's ""Spanish Harlem"" for when they were in New York City all shows a depth of understanding about music that has not been seen before. If you lived through this time the memories will start flooding back.

Guardians of the Galaxy is a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is not a lot of people's 'favorite movie of all time'. This is. I don't think I'll ever forget I saw this movie. It has an impact on me every time I see it.As I've said before, I'm a writer. I normally shoot for about 2000 words a day. Most times, I get it. The first time I watched this film, I sat down at my computer and wrote 1000 words in the course of one hour. That's how inspired I was. That's the effect this film has on people. It hits you in a very personal way.This is, at least partially, because the director had a deep and personal connection what happens in it. The main character is basically Cameron Crowe; he was a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Crowe is at his best when he is dealing pith his real experiences. It shows in Fast Times, and it most definitely shows here.Even if you never lived through this time period, it's easy to be sucked into Crowe's adaption of it. All the characters and plot lines are so rich and well-defined. What happened in this movie may not have happened to you, but it gives off the feeling that it happened to somebody. There are not a lot of movies I can say that for, including many that are based one-hundred-percent on true stories.As you can expect for a movie about music directed by the man who possibly gets more mileage out of pre-existing songs than any other working directors, the music here is phenomenal. I've heard about one-third this movie's entire budget went towards songs, and it shows. You look left, there's a song. You look right, there's a song. You look back, there's a song. You look forward, there's a song. In the hands of a lesser director, this would get extremely grating extremely grating. But under Crowe's direction, it's sweeping and atmospheric and everything you want to see from a film. There's a reason this is the first movie in decades Led Zeppelin has given the right to use their songs.The most famous scene of this film, a scene so powerful that many lesser movies, including the first Pitch Perfect, have tried to emulate, is when the entire bus sing Elton John's Tiny Dancer as they ride across the country. This is what I like to call the tonal highpoint of the film. If you had to sum up in three minutes the essence of the movie, you would do it with this one sequence.One of my favorite narrative tricks is, for lack of a better term, the dual era ending. The characters are at the end of an era they remember fondly, and the audience is looking fondly on the era of the characters. It's manipulative, but it's manipulative in a smart way, an evocative way, a way that takes skill and technique to pull off. When you fail, you fail miserably. But when you succeed, the payoff is more than worth it, as it is in this movie.The main character grew up listening to old rock and roll in secret. His sister- played by a young and very good Zooey Deschanel- has a falling out with their conservative mother and leaves home to become a flight attendant. But before she says goodbye, she gives her lil' bro all her rock and roll records, saying that they will 'Set him free.' So it is to his disappointment when he is repeatedly told that the golden age of rock and roll is over. The audience, provided they are around Crowe's age, remembers feeling that same sort of disappointment when rock and roll faded entirely, and they look back fondly on the 70's.My favorite theme explored in this movie is that of staying home and going traveling. His sister is a flight attendant. Penny, a young groupie, played by Kate Hudson in what is by far the best performance of her career, talks about wanting to go to Morocco, but has no real initiative to see them through. His mother wants him to come home, and she calls incessantly. The band is trying to find their home on the road. And in the middle of all this, as it should be, is our main.Everyone has a short list of movies that they will never get tired no matter how many times they watch them. This is on mine. It is everything I want to see from a movie like this, and far more. I don't know if any music movie will top this. None have yet. But even if one does, this will always hold a special place in my heart. It is a rolling, sunlit field of art.There are no 'almost's about that.",Almost Famous
185,Mulliga,"An excellent movie, but it may be too personal for some",9,31 March 2002,"""Almost Famous"" is almost an autobiography of Cameron Crowe's time on the road writing for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine. It is at once charming and real, but the middle part of the film sags, and the ending is not quite as tight as it could be. Despite these snags, it captures the mood and feel of the 1970s as well as any before it.",Almost Famous
186,Keyser Soze-12,"The best movie of 2000, not to mention one of the best rock movies ever",10,9 October 2000,"It has been so long since I have seen a decent movie over the summer.  Every movie this year worth seeing has been a big budget, `blow em up' action movie.  There has not been a movie all year worthy of being nominated for best picture, with the exception of Gladiator.  But that has all changed with Cameron Crowe's new film, Almost Famous. 	Almost Famous is about the last days of rock and roll set back in the early seventies. The movie is seen through the eyes of 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), the music critic for his high school newspaper who is obsessed with rock and roll.  He has mailed several articles out to different publications and is selected by Rolling Stone to go on tour with the fictional band Stillwater and write a profile on the band.  The trick is Rolling Stone does not know he is only 15. 	While on the road, Miller becomes best friends with the lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), who is more like a brother than a friend. Miller soon meets one of the groupies, an attractive young girl who calls herself Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who becomes his guide to this new world of rock n roll madness. Miller loves Lane, or thinks he does.  But Penny says she loves Russell, though the audience knows she really does not.  The movie doesn't focus on the love triangle between them like many romantic movies do.  The film finds equilibrium between the music, the comedy, and the romance. 	This movie is perfect.  I mean that; there is just nothing wrong with it. Best of all, it isn't reserved for music fans.  Most rock n roll movies contain tons of music facts, so anyone not familiar with the band being spoken about is lost.  Almost Famous deals more with the story than the music.  While the music is important to the plot, it appears like a secondary character instead of overpowering non-rock people.  Another great part of this film is that it can be enjoyed by multiple generations, not just our hippie parents.  Because this movie has no target audience, anyone from teenagers to adults can like this movie.This movie is funny, but it's filled with those touching moments that most blockbuster movies lack.  This is the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to be making more of.  The film's dialogue is amazing and simplistically honest.  The film is sort of an autobiography of Cameron Crowe, the writer, director, and producer of the film.  Some people may remember Crowe from his other films, which include Jerry McGuire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Crowe's Almost Famous is a work of genius that will leave you speechless. 
I loved this movie because, unlike so many other movies I have seen over the summer, I actually cared about the characters.  They are not just moving cardboard cut outs, they are real people in real situations.  The performances made me feel as if I really knew these people.  Each actor delivers a brilliant and honest performance, the best I have seen all year.Fugit is stunning in his portrayal of the youthfully awkward Miller, a boy thrust into the drugs-and-sex-charged world of rock n roll.  Frances McDormand turns in a stellar performance as Miller's neurotic mother. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy) as Jeff Bebe, the frontman of Stillwater, is a great Jim Morrison/Robert Plant mix. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Lester Bangs, a fellow rock critic who teaches Miller the basics of rock n roll life. And Crudup, as the quietly egotistical Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond, delivers a mellow but real performance.  I know none of you know who these actors are, but I did not either.  For most of them, this is their first major movie.But the best performance here is Kate Hudson as Penny Lane. There is one particular scene in which Miller and Lane confront the reality behind the circus atmosphere of being on a rock tour. Hudson displays such an intense range of emotions it's not only mesmerizing, but emotionally taxing on the audience, as well.For the music heads in the audience, the soundtrack rocks something fierce, featuring a classic of classic songs from the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Stooges, Yes, The Beach Boys, The Allman Brothers, Deep Purple, Neil Young, Lou Reed, Cat Stevens, Little Feat, Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan, and Sir Elton John.  My only complaint is that this movie is rated R.  There is nothing in this movie that could make a mother upset.  The film contains lots of drug use but does not endorse it.  One scene includes a very Pulp Fiction-esc scene with a drug overdose.  There is a short scene of nudity, but I've seen Disney movies with more skin than this.  There is no bad language or violence.  So why is it rated R?  Go ask the MPAA because I don't know.
Overall, this is a movie that I recommend to everyone.  From the movies I have seen so far this year, this will win best picture hands down. Whether you're a guy or a girl, whether your into music or not, whether you're a hippie or a square, I think you will love this movie.

So finally I hired it on DVD, and was amazed at how good it was. Cameron Crowe wrote almost an autobiographical script and it really made the movie almost deepm the fact that he got to experience that in his life...I really thought Patrick Fujit, Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were just amazing in this film, a cast that just connected.

188,Willie-12,Great Characters,8,14 March 2001,"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out because I read all the great reviews about it, and thought to myself ""surely everyone can't be wrong.""  However, I never got to the theatre to see it.  So I rented it on the day it came out on video.  All the great buzz I had heard was right on the money.  This is a great story about taking chances, friendships, betrayal, and many other things that make up a very good movie.  There is not alot of action, or high-tech special effects, and why would there be...this is a Cameron Crowe film, and indeed, is one of his best.  He does such a good job of creating characters that are strong and deep.  That is what this movie is, a character movie.  You don't need extraordinary action sequences to enjoy a movie like this.  The lives of the people are what matters, and in the end you feel like you have made some friends.  This movie reminded me of Beautiful Girls in a way.  Not in content, but in the way that the story moves along.  Slowly, and yet in a way that is very moving.  I only wish that the Academy voters would have nominated it for Best Picture, because it certainly was one of the five best movies of 2000.",Almost Famous
189,native_girl333,"""No more airplanes""",10,24 June 2006,"""Almost Famous"" is one of my all time favorite movies. The director Cameron Crowe has made fantastic movies (""Jerry Maguire"", ""Say Anything"" etc.) but ""Almost Famous"" is his most passionate film.The story is based Crowe's own life experiences as a young rock journalist who gets into suck of music business. Young fresh talent Patrick Fugit plays Crowe's alter ego gullible but smart William Miller who gets to spend time of his life touring with a rock band called Stillwater.Stillwater is still struggling with the problem of being just a little band. The band is good subject to study because it's not very known. Stillwater's headman the guitarist Russell Hammond (mouth-watering Billy Crudup) becomes a sort of father figure to young William. Their relationships key-factor is mysterious Penny Lane (brilliant Kate Hudson who got an Oscar-nominations for her role). Penny Lane and her friends are ""Band-Aiding"", they don't want to be called ""groupies"" because they love the band and their music.The film includes some of the most amazingly written characters. My favorite Philip Seymour Hoffman plays real life's legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs who was William's idol and mentor. Even the fact that Hoffman is in the film so little time his performance is fantastic. Nevertheless the movies dynamo is Frances McDormand's Mrs.Miller, William's over-protective mother. After watching the film McDormand became instantly one of my favorite actresses. There are some unforgettable scenes with Mrs.Miller. Like the scene where the mom is telling his son not to use drugs...The music plays the biggest role in the movie. ""Almost Famous"" includes one of history's greatest soundtracks (I just had to have it to my collection!) Superb artists and bands like David Bowie, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Elton John, The Who and Simon and Garfunkel takes the audience to a trip right back to seventies. Even if you weren't born in the 70's you can feel the powerful sounds of that era. ""Simple Man"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd just blew me away! It is simply beautiful. I am a old soul and a rock chick so this kind of music hits me like fast moving train.The soul of ""Almost Famous"" is Penny Lane. You cannot help at wonder did she really exist? I want to believe so. William loved her much but could not have her because he was so young. Penny Lane's heart belonged to Stillwater and especially to Russell Hammond. Aaw! What a great love story...""Almost Famous"" is a heart-warming story of rock'n'roll, friendships, loyalty and family. It is about discovering your true colors. It is a journey, a tour where you want to go back over and over again. Cameron Crowe has made and written truly touching romantic comedy of rock and relationships.

190,nixskits,Music hath powers to soothe the savage teen years,10,23 November 2009,"Cameron Crowe is one of the few directors who truly loves music. And it shows in this masterpiece, which is a writer's epic love poem to the spirit of the bands who have kept him going all his life. If you were young in the 70's, you have a different vantage point about your favourite tunes than a youngster who's growing up in the 21st century. But the desire to call something yours and not see and hear mom and/or dad enjoying it too is a lot harder than it used to be. The first rock and roll generation are grandparents now and their children's children have a much larger world of musical choices and cooler technology to store it on/play it than in previous decades.That said, this movie is about taking a needle and getting your fix, by hearing vinyl with all it's scratches and skips and imperfections. The Who, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and so many others were recording some of their best work in this late 60's/early 70's time period. I wish this movie was four hours long so we could really get into Crowe's cast and their character's lives even more deeply than we have already. What would Fairuza Balk's young lady listen to without the other band aids around? How would Jeff entertain himself without having an audience to perform for? How would William make out if he acted like the British guy Anna Paquin wanted him to be? What other interests does Jay Baruchel's Led Zep nut have besides following his number one band on tour?What Crowe has left us with is the best film about ending innocence on your terms and becoming an adult with some kind of value system. And no, this wouldn't have been a better movie with ""Stairway To Heaven"" in it!",Almost Famous

Crowe also proves that a good movie depend on a very good script(and his Oscar is deserved).The period of the 70's is used well as a backdrop and is very effective.The cast is excellent ,with no exception, and work as an ensemble(and yes, if you close your eyes you can almost believe that Kate Hudson is actually Goldie Hawn)Simply go and see",Almost Famous

My father being of a different generation did not understand the music of the 60's changed the world,people came from the stuffy 50's with their short haircuts and somewhat boring music into the free love of the 60's and early 70's and the music soared,anyone that has listened to Jimi Hendrix knows the chill you get when you hear those first cords of purple haze,that is the way I feel about almost famous,it takes you back to the time eagles Hotel California was your favorite album and most prized possession,it takes you to the place you always wanted to be on stage playing guitar with a rock band while people scream your name. Almost famous takes you back stage where you always wanted to be partying with your idol rock star. Almost famous shows the good of rock and roll which is the music and it shows the bad said of rock which is the drugs and the booze and the disregard they had for girls and in the end themselves,it shows how lonely and screwed up a person could get being on the road. Patrick Fugit is great as the wonderfully innocent William H. Miller,his sweetness and big eyed looks as the girls are deflowering him are pure cinema. Billy Crudup as the golden god rock star Russell Hammond makes you love him then hate him then love him again. The band aids Sapphire,Polexia and of course the lovely miss Penny Lane are the real stars of the movie,they are lovely and funny and sexy and sad all at the same time,Kate Hudson is a pure gem as Penny,she pretends love does not matter just being with the band and loving the music but we know it is not true, Kate Hudson has wonderfully beautiful wild eyes and a soft pixie quality that makes her irresistible.

His recent projects, including Jerry Maguire which was an interesting and original romantic comedy, and Vanilla Sky which also had some great and original ideas, have been something to look out for. But nothing he has done yet is a patch on this hilarious, heart-warming rock n' roll tale.It tells the story of a wannabe rock journalist, played brilliantly by Patrick Fugit, who manages to break his way into the world of rock n' roll when he is given a chance to accompany the band Stillwater on tour while writing an article for Rolling Stone magazine. But this is not what the film is really about.Introduce Penny Lane, a band-aide portrayed by the gorgeous Kate Hudson, and Russell Hammond, Stillwater's emotional guitarist, and a back-story for the kid journalist including his overbearing mother and rebellious sister, and what we have is a well-structured, evocative and emotional coming-of-age love story.But the fact that this film is ranked in IMDb's top 250 says it all.

The story was unrealistic; I don't buy Mom letting her 15 year old go on tour with a so-called rock band unless he ran away, in which case he wouldn't be calling home and the police would be looking for him. None of it was realistic and the characters were just boring and flat. Maybe it was just really bad acting but I didn't like or care about anybody. And maybe my eyes are going bad but it seemed like it was filmed with a dirty camera lens; it just looked grimy and old. I've heard everyone raving about this film but I just don't get it. I turned it off during the scene in the tour bus where they were all singing ""Tiny Dancer"". Seriously? I'll buy people mass singing Bohemian Rhapsody any day (I've seen it happen) but Tiny Dancer?

His work finally pays off and he gets the chance of his life: an offer from Rolling Stone magazine to go on tour with a rock & roll band called `Stillwater' to write an article about the group.
There are many reasons why I like the movie: 1) it is about Rock music and the era when Rock music basically ruled 2) I found the story of a 15 years-old going on tour with a rock-roll band quite original 3) acting is very good, everybody in that movie puts outstanding acting performances 4) but most of all, it is a movie which depicts the basic human emotions in a good cinema language.There are many memorable scenes in the movie. I especially liked the scene on the airplane where they get caught by a thunderstorm and everybody spits out their feelings in a heat of confessions. I also liked the scene where the singer Russell grabs the phone from William, who is speaking to his mother, to have fun with her but gets the lecture of his life instead.

197,teejayniles2345,"""Famously"" nostalgic tale of a Classic Rock critic",10,28 June 2001,"This film is well worth seeing two or three times.  The semi-autobiographical ""memoir"" unveils a highly personal expression of a creative writer/fan of 70's rock.  The director/screenwriter/co-producer is Cameron Crowe (Oscar for writing this year).  The plot has been reviewed by other User Comments on this site, so I'll review what has stuck with me that was so memorable.  I enjoyed this feature film immensely for its use of background music and original songs.  There is a great blend of quiet and loud bands/singers interspersed for great effect: Elton John (""Tiny Dancer""), Simon and Garfunkel, Cat Stevens, among others plus Beach Boys and Stillwater, the fictional band's rock repertoire.  The film also gives proper credit to teens who persistently keep after some goal and passion.  I personally don't feel that the ""band-aids"" should have been such examples of free love; but the hero also in his own way is quite reckless and oblivious of what he allows to become a prolonged hedonistic jaunt.  I don't recommend the movie therefore to anyone who's under 18 since ""chucking"" all one's responsibilities tends not to turn out so consequence-free as the plot seems to conclude.  I noticed several plot developments that seemed to be ""connected"" with other great films [for example, the medical assistance that revives the heroine who overdosed on drugs as in THE APARTMENT (1960: Billy Wilder, director-screenwriter)] and I found the minor character, Reg, amusing since it was a classic rocker of that very era (Peter Frampton).

203,segacs,One of my favourite movies of all-time,10,5 February 2005,"Finally, a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar, it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie ""Penny Lane"", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater's lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.The plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!",Almost Famous

Apparently after Jerry Maguire no one wanted totell Cameron Crowe to make some cuts, so it runs quite long. Too long.But, that being said, it has one of the best sound tracks of the last 10years. An okay film, but not a great one..",Almost Famous
207,raymond_chandler,WAY Overrated,5,1 August 2001,"The inexplicably high IMDB rating for ""Almost Famous"" just serves to illustrate how unbearably wretched most Hollywood movies are these days. People go to see something which does not insult their intelligence, has competent acting by a good-looking cast, and is entertaining for most of its running time - BINGO! It gets a ""10"". Once upon a time, films like ""Almost Famous"" were the minimum you could expect from a major release. Now, it shines like a lighthouse beacon on a rocky shore. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this flick, but there is nothing particularly memorable or outstanding about it. I was in high school during the era depicted, and it does a good job of evoking the flavor and fashions of those times. It is a nostalgic look back at a period when rock music was still fresh and not yet being used to sell beer and cars. But the plot was thoroughly predictable, and everyone was so NICE that I almost fell asleep. Gotta love that Dream Team of 'band-aids' though - Fairuza Balk has never been hotter!!",Almost Famous
208,renofhate,"The heart and soul of rock 'n' roll in movie form, Almost Famous is the greatest film ever made!",10,17 September 2016,"Now, it took me quite sometime to get together my all time top ten favorite movies list, but the outcome was a joint-favorite, so, therefore, two movies both reached the number one spot - and rightfully so. And this right here, is one of them for sure! Almost Famous! What a film this is. It's so enjoyable, lovable, quotable, hell it can even be somewhat relatable.The film is very, very well made, and has so many awesome, likable characters, it's almost unreal. The acting is a high point of this movie as well, because everyone plays their role perfectly. I love the chemistry between the actors too. I find Patrick Fugit's performance to be really good - particularly mentioning that because he's the main star, well, alongside Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson. But all three give wonderful performances. There were so many great performances overall.The dialogue in exchange between the actors in this film is terrific. One very noticeable thing which stands out is the fact that it's set in the year 1973. I think they made it work really, really well and it makes the film awesome. I believe it's made to feel just like a seventies movie even if the film was made in 2000.With heartfelt moments, so many great quotes, fantastic chemistry, and basically the perfect cast, Almost Famous is one of those unique movies, in which I can watch at any time and enjoy it. I never get bored of this film in particular.10/10",Almost Famous

We share a lot of background, and were both dopey-looking teens in the dopey-looking seventies. So maybe I'm a little prejudiced when I say Almost Famous is near perfect. A great reflection on the Rock World of the time, filled with the music we all listened to, showing an end of the Business most of us only dreamed of infiltrating.

210,paul-nemecek,"Almost Famous, Almost Perfect",10,1 July 2018,"Almost Famous is the story of a fifteen-year old boy who becomes a writer for Rolling Stone magazine. This may seem like a pretty farfetched premise, but this film is, in part, the story of writer-director Cameron Crowe who was the youngest writer Rolling Stone ever had. The film, set in the early 70's, is a coming-of-age film about independence, maturation, principles, and compromise.Newcomer Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, the 15-year old who stumbles into the opportunity of a lifetime when the editor of Rolling Stone asks him to do a story on Stillwater, an up-and-coming band. Along the way William meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who describes herself as a band-aide. In the most predictable development in the plot, William falls in love with Penny while Penny falls in love with lead guitarist Russell (played by Billy Crudup). As the story unfolds, William is thrown into the world that Janis Joplin described with the anthem ""drugs, sex, and rock and roll.""While William is clearly a babe in the woods (and a lamb among wolves), as he struggles to find his way we discover that he is the only person on the scene with a functioning moral compass. William does lose his way at points, but in many ways he becomes the moral center of the Stillwater entourage. Frances McDormand--the Oscar-winning actress who plays William's mother--provides some of the more charming moments in the film. She is the anchor that keeps William connected and grounded. She is also over-the-edge with anxiety and occasionally lectures various members of the Stillwater entourage.In Crowe's previous blockbuster, Jerry Maguire, Crowe gave us a vivid portrait of a sports agent who had become jaded and wanted to recapture some of the innocence he had lost. The moral dimensions and ethical dilemmas are similar here, but in Almost Famous the portrait is of the innocent before the fall. For this kind of portrayal, casting is critical, and newcomer Fugit does not disappoint. Perhaps because this is his first major role it is easy for him to show us the wide-eyed wonder and fear of the émigré from Eden who becomes a babe in Babylon.It is the depiction of Babylon that gets this film its R rating. But the message at the core of the film is G through and through. When William finds his way he finds his voice, and challenges the shallowness and superficiality of the lives of those around him. In so doing, he calls them to a more authentic form of existence, and some of the lives he has touched begin to change for the better. This film has many of the common features of coming-of-age films, but excellent writing, a unique plot line, and excellent performances put this one a bit above the rest.",Almost Famous

214,Juni78ukr,One of the best of the year  and easily one of the best of the decade,10,17 May 2004,"I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it because it has never been released in theaters in my own country, so Almost Famous is almost unfamous movie here. For me the only reason why decided to buy it was because this movie has been positioned on the IMDb top 250 chart. Finally last summer I bought the tape and watched it with my friend. We both know nothing about it and didn't expect too much from it but the movie has exceeded our highest hopes and expectations. From any point of view Almost Famous is a terrific movie and it easily became one of my all-time favorites. It is so great, sincere and heartfelt that I simply have no enough words to describe it's beauty. Despite its R rating without a doubt it's one of the sweetest movies ever made and I believe it's the sweetest movie with such a rating. This masterpiece was written and directed by Cameron Crowe (only the second his work after another also excellent Jerry Maguire) who not only won well deserved Academy award for best screenplay but he definitely also deserved award for best director in that year. His directing is outstanding, every scene in his picture, every shot is meaningful, full of life, magically captured feelings and emotions. He created perfectly real and authentic partly based on his own experience atmosphere of the fascinating world of music when it wasn't entirely commercialized, the world of music from heart and for heart. Sadly, this time is lost forever. Now the industry of entertainment wisely called by one of the movie's characters industry of cool brings to us thousands commercial rock and pop-stars which fight for top place on different charts and sing mostly for enormous fees. Almost Famous is a story of William Miller, a talented 15 years old kid, who as a rock journalist took a tour through the all country with a rock band called Stillwater. During this travel he gets the opportunity to learn this world of music from inside so we can take a look with him, from his innocent and bright view. The band is looking incredibly real and believable, with all characters perfectly written and developed. With terrific performances of Billy Crudup, who plays the band charismatic leader and all other actors who played the band members Stillwater become so familiar and close to us that it's almost impossible think that this band never existed. Patrick Fugit who plays William also did an excellent job as young writer, whose innocence, honesty and cleverness gave him an opportunity not to lose yourself and even finally change people around him. Kate Hudson was so beautiful as Penny Lane, one of band aids (I can't believe that she didn't win best supporting actress award, but Academy nearly every year made weird choices). Last but not least among supporting casts is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs, a really existed character, clever and rock-writer, who tried to teach young William how to act in this fascinating but sometimes insane world of music. Every single word of this character is clever and quotable. Almost Famous is sometimes funny, sometimes said but always beautiful, sincere and poignant. The movie's soundtrack consist of excellent and charming music from 60-s and early 70-s. The perfect and stunning Tiny Dancer scene is undoubtedly the best music scene in the movies ever made. Almost Famous is a movie mainly about music and people related with music but it would be completely wrong to say that it's a movie only about a music. It's about so many things beyond that. Can anyone want more from the movie? I believe not. Now I have seen in more than ten times with several my friends. All of them share my opinion. For me Almost Famous become better and better with every time when I see it again.Not almost, but absolutely perfect. 10 out of 10.

216,lucianomarzo92,Great Drama,6,22 August 2009,"This is one of my favorite dramas. I loved the way it tied in music to its plot. Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, the Protagonist. William is an outcast interested in journalism, who is given the opportunity to interview a popular band (who is almost famous) for the Rolling Stone. He ultimately gets to travel with the band, and their groupies, and manages to form a bond with them despite their differences. It had a beautiful soundtrack. Almost famous has two beautifully arranged acoustic led zeppelin songs: That's the Way, and Tangerine, in addition to some of their hard rock songs.I saw this movie at a time when no other singer but Robert Plant could do a whole lot for me. The movie also played the perfect songs for certain scenes. This movie had great characters; I could relate to just about all of them- they all reminded me of people in my life. Kate Hudson was perfect in this movie as the female lead. Francies McDormand was amazing at her role as a hysterical overprotective mother. This is a very touching movie.

It conveys a pleasant atmosphere with a strong soundtrack and colourful cinematography. It's also nice to see the music business shown from both sides. We're not made to believe it's all glitter and glamour.

Regrettably, they weren't met.There's plenty of good here, but unfortunately there's even more so-so. Overall, ""Almost Famous"" comes across as a 2-hour sitcom. A pretty decent one, to be fair, but I simply never bought into the genuineness of this band, its people and their emotions. Even their fights play like something out of 'That '70s Show' and the big 'revelation' plane scene is embarrassingly hammy, all of which makes it really difficult to take this as an organic story. Too many times it seems like a high budget, major studio dress-up.",Almost Famous
220,Supachewy,Almost Famous Makes Me Almost Want to Leave Halfway Through the Film,5,2 September 2010,"The dramedy Almost Famous is directed by Cameron Crowe and stars Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, and Kate Hudson. It takes place between 1969 to 1974 all around the United States.The film starts off in 1969 when William Miller (Fugit) discovers that he is only eleven instead of thirteen because his mother has been telling him he is older instead of telling him how she pushed him through certain grade levels. Then William's older sister, Anita (Deschanel), tells their mother, Elaine (McDormand), that she is leaving because her mother is such a control freak. Before Anita leaves she tells William how she left something that will change his life under her bed and when William goes to look he finds records of all the famous rock bands. The film cuts to a few years later when William is fifteen and wants to be a music critic. He goes to meet with a successful music critic, Lester Bangs (Hoffman), who gives him advice on how to become great and they talk about rock and roll. Then William goes to a concert that takes him on the journey of a life time...The screenplay for this film won an Oscar and I do not really understand why. Every single character is a stock character. William is a nerdy kid with big dreams, Elaine is an obsessive mother, all the rock stars are stereotypical rock stars, and band aids are stereotypical groupies besides maybe Penny Lane. Along with that there is really no plot which I understand works well in some movies because it is supposed to be a journey, but this one seemed very repetitive the whole way through. It was always William loves Penny Lane, Russell loves Penny Lane, no one really says much about it. And the whole time William is just trying to get an interview from Russell but there is always some little distraction I mean I'm pretty sure they could have made time for an interview even if it was on the long bus rides they had to take. Overall I thought the screenplay was weak and I know a lot of people are going to be against on this one because this is a beloved movie for a reason most likely due to the music and the time period.The direction of film by Crowe was fine. I understand this film is very important to Crowe because he traveled with a band when he was a young kid. Crowe is quite good at working with actors but in this film it was somewhat mixed performances that he got out of them. Some of the supporting roles were really strong while I felt every single other one was quite weak. There was nothing really special shot wise I mean there were some good ones in it but nothing that blew me away. Crowe is a fine director, but I think Jerry Maguire is what he will always be remembered for.The acting in this film was on both ends of the spectrum. If your names are Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, or Philip Seymour Hoffman you gave a solid performance that kept me interested in the film. If your name is Billy Crudup or Patrick Fugit you should probably never act again. If you are someone in the film that I didn't mention, then you're not worth mentioning. McDormand played a stock character but played it to the max the role could be possibly played and I don't necessarily think she deserved the Oscar nomination but she was definitely very good. Hudson played a groupie with mystery and depth and gave the best performance of her career. She was interesting and really made the film worth watching. Hoffman had a small role but he played it very well being very smart and creative. Fugit was William and all he did was basically read the lines looking concerned. It seemed like it was his first time acting. Crudup I feel like I was supposed to have an emotional connection to but I never did and he never really made me want him to get through all his problems. Like I said the acting is at both ends of the spectrum on this one.Overall I give this film a 5/10, I would of gave lower if there was not the few memorable performances. I know this is a beloved film but I just did not enjoy it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock and roll, the sixties and early seventies, and Cameron Crowe.",Almost Famous
221,mercury-26,Cameron Crowe: The luckiest man alive,9,25 September 2000,"What is Cameron Crowe's best film?  All four are solid. Having established himself as a director after the first three (""Say Anything..."", ""Singles,"" ""Jerry Maguire""), Crowe bought himself the freedom to make whatever kind of film he wanted, in the form of studio money--lots of studio money. What's most astonishing is how he got himself into this position in the first place. Many directors had to do a low risk commercial movie (such as ""Jerry Maguire"") guaranteed to deliver an audience and make the studio a lot of money: Crowe did that AND saw his movie achieve several Oscar nominations. He'd get to make his labor of love-and he didn't even have to sell his soul to get there. Problem is, the resulting movie seems so personal to Crowe, it almost fails to engage the audience.Almost. What does engage you is Crowe's shameless adoration for the music and the time he was lucky enough to experience. The whole movie is a tribute to the time that made him what he is today. He has tunnel vision throughout, focusing on the music and how it made people feel. But even if you're not a music person,' you'll still dig this movie. Crowe creates his usual cast of loveable characters and gives them souls. The characters are based on real people in Crowe's life, himself included, so it's hard to know whether this task was more or less difficult than his other films.Music is the soul of ""Almost Famous"" and to its characters, a religion. Crowe paints a portrait of a young man, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who's being sucked into a world he doesn't think he belongs in, the world of Rock and Roll. What the film really represents is a Malkovichian portal into the director's mind. What we see is something like the way Crowe remembers himself as a young man. We see what happened, untainted, with the wisdom of the years thrown into the mix.Crowe travelled with many bands during his Rolling Stone years, and the band at the center of the film's semi-fictional universe is a four-headed beast called Stillwater. Crowe makes them an amalgam of the bands of that (or really any) time. This is one of a few things that disappointed me about ""Almost Famous"": Stillwater is too typical. They bicker like we envision a rock and roll band doing. They party and do drugs. Their lead singer is a loudmouthed, although charismatic, jerk. Their manager is a weaselly guy with a British/Australian accent. Their lead guitarist is an egomaniac. They're merely symbols of rock stars, the kind we'd expect and nothing more. The one that emerges and becomes a character, though barely, is the lead guitarist Russell Hammond (played convincingly by Billy Crudup). For the length of the film, Will's mission is to get an interview with Hammond, only to be thwarted each time. Hammond is Will's hero, a job the musician doesn't want. When the two develop a kind of big brother/little brother relationship, Crowe starts having fun, and so do we.It's also a shame there isn't more music in ""Almost Famous."" This may have been intentional, as Crowe may have wanted to concentrate on the nomadic lifestyle built around the music and not the music itself. It's almost like he's questioning whether these people were really about the music at all. We hear plenty of music on the soundtrack (and a great one it is), people talk endlessly about music, but as for music actually being played--it's lacking. More footage of live performances by Stillwater would have grounded it more as a music film. As it is, it's a coming-of-age, boy-meets-world film and little more. Not that the scant concert footage we see isn't great. Crowe stages it like a man who's been right there should. You really get a feel for what it's like to be up there with the noise and the lights, with thousands of adoring eyes on you.This is not Cameron Crowe's `masterpiece.' His best film is still ""Jerry Maguire."" Heck, I even like ""Say Anything..."" better than this. What I'm really saying is that I think his best is yet to come. He has the rare gift of being a great writer AND director. When we look back on the era we live in, I think Cameron Crowe will stand out as one of the great filmmakers of our time.Grade: A-",Almost Famous
222,FilmCreature,Well-Acted and Entertaining!,9,5 July 2007,"I was entertained by Almost Famous for (almost) the entire running time.

He fakes his age to write for Rolling Stone magazine, and tries to fool his mother (McDormand) at the same time.

However, even if I could detach myself from that, I would still find this film incredible.  The love story is complex, and the side story of the band is interesting as well.  The whole feel of the movie is created by those stories and the songs they played over the action.  I particularly like the ""Rocket Man"" singalong on the bus.  The film is great because of your inevitable connection to Fugit's character.  This movie rocked, and it will be remembered for years to come.  10/10Also, can anyone tell me how Philip Seymour Hoffman gets into some of the best movies in this period of film.  Magnolia, Happiness, Almost Famous, Boogie Nights, Red Dragon?  This guy has a feel for what's gonna go over well.  If I hear he's in a movie, I'll go see it.  Same with Tom Hanks and Pacino.

The cost of syncing some of the most iconic classic rock songs must have cost investors a pretty penny - it was money well-spent, as the film thrives on one of the best soundtrack syncs in movie history.Almost Famous is classic Cameron Crowe - a semi-autobiographical film that pulls from his own experiences as a young journalist with Rolling Stone magazine in its glory daze of the early 1970's. Yes, most of the events in the movie (including the airplane scene) really DID happen with Crowe there to witness (albeit being an amalgam of different bands and circumstances Cameron covered as a rock journalist).You care about the characters who are developed and illuminated throughout the film. Crowe's spot-on casting and ""actors' director"" prowess serves as a catalyst for the actors, inspiring the cast to draw out the intimate feelings and thoughts of each character without crossing into melodrama - The result is an acting ensemble tour de force.Almost Famous is a must-see for both classic-rock fans and movie lovers at large.You get to witness several breakout early-career performances including Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschannel, Billy Crudup, and yes, even Jimmy Fallon.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Francis McDormand are as usual, nearly flawless.Get a back-stage pass to this fabulous movie - a loving ode to the early 70's twilight days of the classic rock era.",Almost Famous

226,SpaaceMonkee,Belongs in Your Collection,9,23 December 2020,"This is one of those movies that risks getting forgotten as the years pass. Two decades later, Almost Famous holds up as great period piece that masterfully blends drama and comedy.The movie follows William Miller in 1973 as he poses as a rock journalist with the band Stillwater. Along the way he meets Penny Lane - a so-called Band Aid, a unit supposedly operating at a level above the mere groupie - and deals with his overprotective mother - a masterful performance by Frances McDormand - who attempts to keep tabs on her son amid the social upheaval, drugs, and free-love culture of the sixties, the distance notwithstanding. While dealing with those obstacles, William tries to deliver on a commitment to produce a feature-length article of rock journalism...without his attachments to the band or Penny interfering with the honesty of his story.It's easy to think of a movie with a plotline like this being overly sentimental or cliched, but the film excels at delivering a steady plot, with great writing, that keeps you engaged throughout.

I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with it. The story is nothing special although comes across as fairly authentic, the script is average and the performances are too, except for Patrick Fugit who did make a charming lead and Frances McDormand who was pretty good as his mother. God knows how Kate Hudson got a nomination - perhaps because of the perceived depth to her character at the end of the movie?? I can't think of any other reason. There is little in this movie that is new or exciting or original - we've seen it all before - maybe you had to be American to really appreciate it because I thought it was in the mediocre range of average.",Almost Famous

A disappointing film with horrendous acting, awkward dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. How this film won for Best Writing Original Screenplay, is truly a mystery. Crowe's writing was far superior in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. The dialogue was fresh and exciting. None of that could be found in Almost Famous. Sidenote: I continue seeing professional reviews that state: ""Stillwater was based on Led Zeppelin."" How so when the fictional band in the film makes mention of them?

238,Wwmbrd,Almost Biographical for Cameron Crowe,7,20 September 2021,"Almost Famous is an (almost) biographical flick by Cameron Crowe, of both literary and cinematographic fame.Crowe was a guy who really did live the charmed life, having become a cover-story writer for Rolling Stone magazine at age 15, marrying his rock star idol wife, Nancy Wilson (half of the multi-platinum 70s/80s rock duo Heart), creating a filmography most directors not listed in {insert country here}'s Film Institute list would be envious of, and eventually winning an academy award for screenwriting his own biography- Almost Famous.With such credits as Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, and Vanilla Sky in his list, Crowe's writing skills have been on display for a long time, and made for an industrious career in cinema.Crowe's story in Almost Famous covers a period of Rock N Roll history well chronicled throughout the ages, but none so authentically. In the film, Crowe's stand in character Billy Miller follows a rock band that is believed to be an amalgam of several groups the real life Crowe followed as a teenage beat writer for Rolling Stone magazine. Stillwater, as the band is known, is an opener for Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath in 1973 when Billy first happens upon them, and his starstruck fandom coupled with his desire to take a risk for the music he lives for leads him backstage for the first time, and he's immediately enamoured with the devil-may-care drug and booze fueled rockstar lifestyle. Billy agrees to follow the band on a tour in order to get a real scoop for the magazine, much to the chagrin of his hilariously overbearing hover-parent mother who seems straight out of 2005 with her hypochondriasis and status as an uber liberal college professor.It is believed also, that the guitarist of Stillwater, Russell Hammond, is based upon Gregg Allman, of the Allman Brothers band- the first band that Crowe wrote a cover piece on. Feeling disrespected and a bit overshadowed by the success of the band, Russell is the true musical talent of the group, though he's put upon by the diva frontman Jeff, played wonderfully by Jason Lee. A similar situation happened with Allman in 1975- his brother had died in 1971 from a motorcycle wreck, and the band, now rich and famous by this time, was descending into drug addiction and mediocrity. Gregg Allman was also married to pop star Cher at the time, and ascended to a new level of stardom at that time, which was certainly covered in detail by Crowe.Kate Hudson plays the charismatic Penny Lane, a real life groupie/promoter for rock bands of the era who was the leader of a group known as the Flying Garter Girls, a real world groupie pack who consorted with many famous bands of the era. Her debaucherous behavior turns out to be a corrupting influence on the young Billy, but it's not without care- as Penny becomes the closest thing to a mother Billy has on the road with the band.All told, Almost Famous is a nice period piece with biographical origins, and watches almost like a dramatized documentary of bands of the 70s arena rock era. A nice look inside the life of an interesting man.7.75/10.",Almost Famous
239,emvan,Director's Cut Rules!,10,17 December 2001,"If you loved this movie -- and a lot of people did -- run, do not walk, and get the 2-DVD set with the 40-minute longer director's cut (which Crowe is calling ""Untitled."")  As is usually the case with Hollywood, the DC is a much better movie.  There wasn't a moment where I said to myself ""well, this could have been cut.""  Much of what was restored adds resonance and depth. I found Kate Hudson's performance much more affecting.  And the DC answers the question ""why bother casting Anna Paquin in such a bit role?"" -- she has a couple of brief but telling scenes and comes off as much more of a fleshed-out character, rather than just one of the two Band-aids who aren't Penny Lane.Be sure to also check out the ""Stairway"" deleted scene, on disc 2, which I think is only omitted from the DC because they would have needed to get rights to use all of ""Stairway to Heaven.""Finally, I find the criticism leveled at this movie almost frightening in what it says about the relationship between reality and the media.  A lot of people have slammed the film for downplaying the sleazy, sordid side of rock 'n' roll, for taking a Polyanna look at its subject matter. All of these people, of course, know what they know about the subject matter from having read about, seen it on TV, or watched at it the movies.  I can guarantee you that not one of them ever spent a second of their lives hanging out backstage (as I did, as a rock critic from 1972 to 1986).  In other words, they're willing to say that what they know from watching TV is more accurate than what Cameron Crowe knows from having lived it.In fact, the whole point of the portrayal here is that it's an accurate one that refuses to cater to the Hollywood bias towards showing us just the sleazy and sordid parts (if a musician spends 10% of their career struggling with drugs, ""Behind the Music"" will of course give that 90% of the air time).  We've heard endlessly about the dark side of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.  ALMOST FAMOUS is an unabashed, acutely observed, and long-overdue valentine to what was wonderful about it.",Almost Famous
240,adam-may-bower,Almost Perfect,9,2 June 2018,"'Almost Famous' is an almost-perfect film, with its suitable cast and pumping soundtrack. Director Cameron Crowe loosely based this film on his own experience as a journalist for Rolling Stone at the young age of sixteen and results in a film that is essentially a tribute to the rock-and-roll era of the 1970's. Full of tracks from musical icons in the 70's, such as David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and Elton Job, and a great costume design, this film succeeds in its portrayal of the 70's, and will appeal to not only those who lived in that era, but also those who came into this world long after it. However, it's through the acting that this movie really shines. Every cast member does a great job in their roles, with the clear standouts being Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup, but it's definitely Frances McDormand who steals every scene she is in and is the best part of this film. Crowe's screenplay is another highlight of the film and is well deserving of its Academy Award win in 2001. The only flaw in this film is that at times, it can be quite unrealistic with its lack of emotional complexity in some characters - particularly the protagonist. Thankfully, this is not to the film's demise as it's nothing more than a feel-good movie with great music and an engaging story.",Almost Famous
241,diztorted,life on the road,9,29 March 2001,"When i saw the preview of the film i thought it was just another hippies-on-acid like movie. But when i saw it it was completely different. Cameron Crowe showed us in his previous film Jerry Maguire his ability to portrait human relations and emotions without being completely corny or worse...kind of ""teen hollywood"" like thing. This film gets you since the first shot and never lets go, it grabs you in a slight and funny manner that becomes a delight to watch, it is difficult not to be taken by the mood and stop smiling and even crying.

This movie is full of sex, drugs and rock and roll, taking place in the wild decade of the 70's.  I enjoyed the story, the music, the acting and the laughs...the story follows the rise of one rock band, the coming of age of one reporter, and the emotional and physical turmoil which occurs between the rock band, the reporter and the ""band-aids"" which are obsessed with the band.  Great movie, 10 out of 10.",Almost Famous
243,pseawrig,A Masterwork,9,2 April 2021,"This movie perfectly captures the freewheeling ambience of the early seventies, with a tinge of sadness for how that laid-back world has all but disappeared. At the same time, it has the charm and focus of a Classical Hollywood movie. The story, which is based on Crowes's real life experience, centers on a fifteen year old boy, who lands an opportunity to be a rock journalist. We see the early seventies world of rock bands, roadies, and groupies through his eyes- first with wonder and excitement, then with disappointment as he watches people he admires treat each other badly, and finally with love as he learns to accept these people on their own terms. It's amazing how much life Crowe packs into this story. There are so many characters, yet they all feel intensely real. And the tone of this movie is pitch perfect. We are always one step back from what is going on, which is just the right distance to feel what is happening in the lives of characters who so freely show their emotions. I briefly fell in love with at least six of these characters, including a band follower played by Faruza Balk, who couldn't have had more than five minutes of screen time.

244,BratBoy-2,Best of the year,10,13 October 2000,"""Almost Famous"" is a simple movie. It's not about explosions or flashy action scenes. It's not concerned with how ""hip"" it is and it doesn't exist to capitalize on any given trend. This movie is about real people, and that's what makes it so good. The story is an old one, about a young boy who goes on a journey and learns about himself and about life. It's almost a modern day ""Huckleberry Finn,"" but this movie does not rely on cliches.The characters are all three dimensional people that do not exist solely to move the plot along, nor are they given long speeches to explain the ""point"" of the movie. The director Cameron Crowe lets the movie speak for itself. All the performances are great. We can see why William loves Penny, yet we can see how Penny is destroying herself. Kate Hudson does a great job with a great character who brings to mind a combination of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and her own mother, Goldie Hawn. Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, and Billy Crudup are all great as well, but Hudson is the real find here. This is the fourth movie that Crowe has directed. He hasn't made a bad one yet, but ""Almost Famous"" is his best. Crowe always makes the characters real and believable and pays attention to the details lurking around edges of the movie. The stories he writes never follow the conventional formula. He always gets great performances from his actors, just look at John Cusack in ""Say Anything"" and Tom Cruise in ""Jerry Maguire.""

I am so sick of hearing the 70's referred to as the Age of Disco.  Some of the best music ever made was created in the early and middle part of that decade, and it is shattering to realise how much of it has been forgotten.

After watching the film, I looked over it as a really solid and strangely comforting film. Every time you watch Almost Famous, its like returning to your family at Christmas, comforting yet quixotic and constantly entertaining, especially if you're a fan of rock music and/or grew up in the era.

249,AW_McGOWAN,A Rock-N-Roll Movie Hangover,7,8 December 2020,"Patrick Fugit plays fifteen-year-old journalist William Miller in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous."" After one of his pieces in the local paper gets attention from Rolling Stone magazine, the boy is tasked with writing a piece for the renowned publication about an up-and-coming band called Stillwater. Courtesy of Rolling Stone, he accompanies the band on tour to get a firsthand account of the rock-star lifestyle and how it can make or break a group's success.Along the way, Miller also deals his own anxieties, as he builds friendships with the band's inner circle, falls for a girl known as Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and forges a sense of independence apart from his domineeringly conservative mother, portrayed by Frances McDormand.""Almost Famous"" is therefore a coming of age movie, but it simultaneously emulates (or rather modifies) the rock-n-roll pictures from the nineteen eighties. The movie both celebrates and deconstructs the myth of being a rock-star. On the one hand, it looks frightfully fun, with beautiful women, stimulating narcotics, and non-stop partying all around. On the other, however, ""Almost Famous"" digs deeper and shows Stillwater struggling to maintain morale midway through the tour and arguing about things like t-shirt designs and managerial decisions.The movie is like a fictionalized version of a VH1 ""Behind The Music"" documentary, but in its realistic aim, it also lends time to depicting the band as a business as well as a group of people dealing with their own petty vices while trying to make it big. It illustrates how the rock-star lifestyle is not as utterly wild of a good time as conventional movies and media make it out to be. For every party, there is a hangover; for every memory, a requiem.Cameron Crowe conveys this through a strong premise and enticing characters. William Miller might be a bit of a blank-page protagonist, but he is effective as an ordinary kid caught up in this extreme world. The band and everyone involved are all unique, yet believable, and the tour-structure allows ""Almost Famous"" to be a captivating road-trip movie as much as a bildungsroman.Kate Hudson has received much praise (and one Golden Globe) for her work in the film, but I believe Frances McDormand gives the strongest performance. Even though she is not on camera nearly as often as many of her co-stars, McDormand steals the scene whenever she appears. Meanwhile, Billy Crudup's portrayal of Stillwater's lead guitarist is overlooked. Crudup plays the film's most dynamic and challenging character, a man struggling with budding stardom and personal integrity, and he does it quite well.Also, Philip Seymour Hoffman has a small, somewhat unattached role as Miller's mentor in music journalism. His character, named Lester Bangs, appears sporadically to give Miller advice over the phone. Like Wolfman Jack in ""American Graffiti,"" Bangs provides unruffled sagacity beneath the main story. He is probably the movie's coolest character, and Hoffman of course brings a degree of unmatchable talent to the role.For all the commendation, though, there are a couple things in ""Almost Famous"" that I don't love or at least haven't aged well. Most importantly, the movie severely downplays pedophilia. As mentioned above, Miller is fifteen, and yet he seems to lose his virginity to adult women in the film (non-consensually, no less). These are the same women that the band frequently sleeps with, so in the event that they are actually not adults but fellow minors, then the band is the one committing the heinous crime. Perhaps this is an unfortunately true aspect of the rock-n-roll livelihood, but it's one that the film gives a perverse pass to.Still, the movie at least treats many of its female characters with dignity, revising the groupie archetype and criticizing much of the toxic masculinity that rock stars indulge in. For this, it deserves kudos and Crowe deserves credit for writing and directing a movie that is funny, engaging, and thought provoking in its commentary on popular culture.",Almost Famous
250,bama1111,Almost Perfect,10,29 September 2000,"Nothing is perfect but this movie comes pretty close. If Cameron Crowe's experience as a young journalist was anything like this movie portrayed he has my eternal envy. Having the opportunity to get ""up close and personal"" to the rock'n roll gods of the era and everything that goes with that is truly enviable. But to be able to tell the story on the screen, and have so many talented people create so many wonderful performances in the telling is so special. Kate Hudson is so real as Penny Lane, with the dreams and the expectations and the disappointments. When she is on the screen you can't take your eyes off of her. And Patrick Fugit as William Miller, so naive and so in love with the music and the people who perform it. And he's so much his mother's son. And Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup and the rest of this terrific cast enhance this excellent film. I've been a firm believer that you cannot be disappointed by a Rob Reiner film and now I'll add Cameron Crowe to that small list.Being a child of the 60's I have to say there is nothing that beats the music of that period, but this story is a tribute to everyone who has helped, for better or worse, to make rock 'n roll music what it has become.

252,nived84,'Almost Famous' is almost perfect,9,26 May 2006,"Almost Famous is a touching, well made comedy/drama from director Cameron Crowe, who previously wrote and directed Jerry Maguire. The film captures a strong vibe and energy of the rock n' roll scene during the early 70's, and tells the story of one young die-hard fan/music journalist getting the job of a lifetime working for Rolling Stone magazine to follow an up-and-coming rock band as they travel on the road. The film is very well cast, and it comes through with a number of really great performances, including Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Noah Taylor and newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays the young journalist that gets swept away in a world that the doesn't belong in, and his performance is the real heart of the picture. Almost Famous was nominated for four Academy Awards, and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, but unfortunately it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture, which I certainly think it should have at least got a nomination.The film starts out with a young Will Miller growing up in a house with his strict mother, Elaine, played well by Frances McDormand and his rebellious older sister, Anita, played by Zooey Deschanel, who has a passion for rock music that their mother doesn't approve of because of it's potentially ""harmful"" lyrics about sex and drugs. Anita decides to move out on her own when she's eighteen because she can't handle living at home any longer, but before she leaves she stashes a collection of rock albums under his bed, telling him that they'll ""set him free"", and it does, in a big way. Will works for a small music newspaper and is kind of taken under the wing of Lester Bangs, rock music critic and magazine editor, played well by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, which eventually lands Will a gig working for Rolling Stone to pick a band and follow along with them on the road and write an interview for the popular music magazine.Along his trip with the band he becomes friends with the band and falls in love with one of the group's ""band aids"", a cute blonde that goes by the name of Penny Lane (yeah, just like The Beatles song) played with a tender touch and free spirit by Kate Hudson. As the trip goes along Will has a hard time trying to write his article, and watches the bands ups and downs, and while he's away his mother can't help but worry constantly about Will's safety and reminds him numerous times not to do drugs, which everybody but Will seems to be taking. The film is a bittersweet journey; one that's not entirely a comedy, nor is it an uptight drama or a full fledged romance. I loved watching Almost Famous, not just because it's a very well made film, but also for all the great rock songs that are played nearly back-to-back continuously throughout the entire film. And I'm already a big fan of Led Zeppelin, so this film certainly put a big smile across my face from beginning to end. At times the film reminded me of another really good movie; Lost in Translation, which is another film about getting lost and carried away in a place where you obviously don't fit in. But the experience of getting to go out on the road and spend some time with ""the band"" is quite a fun and enjoyable time, and that's exactly what Almost Famous is; fun and enjoyable, and in my opinion Crowe's best film to date.",Almost Famous

His character, William Miller, is a 15 year old, who is hired by Rolling Stone to tour with an up and coming band and write a feature on them in 1973. Sounded good to me, I couldn't wait..Unfortunately, although I still enjoyed the film, it disappointed me somehow.  I could not quite feel involved with the main character's plight, he usually just stared blankly with a goofy smile, when it could have been made more obvious what he must be going through. Why was this nerd so readily accepted by the rock band and the groupies?  Why did anyone possibly believe that he was a journalist? Why were the groupies, who all seemed likable, groupies?  The character of the overprotective mother (Frances McDormand) was entirely inconsistent.  The characterization was pretty vague in general. This movie could have been very heavy and meaningful and instead it was light and in some ways failed to make a point, despite having two hours and ten minutes to do so.  Perhaps the hype spoiled it for me, but I left feeling like something was missing and that the film was somewhat overrated.

These, as well as Almost Famous are great entertainment and surely that is what we watch movies for?The cast is close to faultless - with the possible exception of Frances McDormand, who probably should not be  blamed for her over-the-top character - it is probably more in the writing than in the enactment. Many of her scenes just do not ring true, likewise the totally unbelievable airplane sequence, which, although amusing and very enlightening, was so amateurish in execution that it spoiled in some ways an otherwise excellent movie.These carps aside, Almost Famous gives us the type of escapism that most of us dream of - a 15 year old, able to live his dream, with the assistance of Penny Lane - and a load of good luck.  Add to that a fairytale ending - some laughs and a few tears, the perfect formula for a night's entertainment. Highly recommended.",Almost Famous
258,wrvisser-leusden-nl,early seventies well reflected,8,19 March 2004,"Above all this movie excellently reflects the early seventies-pop music scene: flat, boring and uninspiring. Back then the whirlwinds of the Sixties had petered out, and Punk was yet to come. Quite in line with this spirit, the story of Almost Famous does not press itself too much on you. It's about everything we all know when it comes to pop music: the glitter, the fame, the money, the booze and the dope, the fans and the groupies, and the merciless dropping of those who aren't up to the latest trends.  Really, I think this movie very balanced and well made. It's name is Almost Famous, it deals with the time when pop music was almost good.",Almost Famous

No, it's not the absolutely BEST film I'd ever seen but it's easily close to the best I've seen all year (what a HORRID summer)and it's a wonderful film.  The cast, the story, the music, and the whole feel to the film was fantastic. You really could get the feeling of being a band groupie in the 70's.Everyone was brilliant and played their parts well. It's hard for me to pick out any stand outs since I pretty much enjoyed everyone.  The story was unique and seemed, for lack of better words, REAL.  I just wish this film had been better marketed.  Not nearly the number of people who would have seen this film  saw it since it was put on such limited release its first few weeks.  The first couple of weeks it was released it had the highest audience ration per theatre. After the distributors released it wide, other movies had opened and people unfortunately forgot the favorable reviews this film had received.  Big mistake since this film should have done so much better.  Not that it should matter - still a great film.Highly recommended.",Almost Famous
260,travinitrav,Better than I remember.,8,27 December 2020,"When I first saw Almost Famous I was 21 and in the middle of a turbulent career. I had just come back from Kosovo and had a lot of dark cynical ideas flowing through my head about how the world was and how it should be and how I could change it. I wasn't in the mood for lazy whiny self-entitled kids pissing away their lives with drugs and music and nothing of substance.
Went back today and watched it again with a much different mindset. I see a lot more today than I used to. The truth is it's actually a phenomenal coming of age story, it has little to do with music or the music industry, despite so much of it in the background. Its about people, how they define themselves (mostly through music), how they relate to each other, and most importantly how they grow and change.10/10, with no reservations. Every American and every kid on earth needs to watch this at least once. And for reference this time around I watched the longer directors cut. I don't recall the differences because its been 20 years, but I suspect its absolutely worth the extra time investment. Go see it now, alone or with people you love.

Probably.I don't know, those girls who say they aren't groupies. Say they don't have sex with the band they hang out with. Isn't that exactly what they do? What are we supposed to learn from this? Some people lie? Me, I'm already familiar with that one. Some people can't write scripts? I got offended. Especially considering how young these girls are supposed to be.I think the depiction of the 70's was nice, but walking out from the movie it felt like it was all rather pointless. I really don't understand why people think this movie is so great. Is it because Cameron Crowe used to be like the main character person in this movie, and then he grew up to make it big and be able to make a movie of it? Well, that's nice. I guess.

This film brought back so many fond memories to me. The movie was wonderful, not only with its' terrific sound track and amazingly authentic fashion, but its' finite attention to detail made me feel I was back in the seventies again. I say bravo to Kate Hudson who portrayed the part of ""Penny Lane"" to perfection, and to Billy Crudup as ""Russell Hammond"" who may very well receive an Oscar nomination for his role. In the supporting role of ""Lester Bangs"" Philip Seymour Hoffman really added that extra something to this fine film. It was so nice to take a two hour journey back to the fun-loving seventies.

The girls were dirty skanks. Penny Lane was a brainless doofus that for some reason I have not figured out everyone worshipped, including the nominating committee at the Academy. And the whole 2 hours we're supposed to glorify this crap. The only person in this entire movie who wasn't an a-hole was Patrick Fugit who was so painfully out of place. I guess if you are into celebrity worship you might identify with it, but again, Stillwater's music was so bad, I was left wondering why there was any worship to begin with.

While a little on the long side, the storyline is just as witty and interesting as the characters. The mother, played by Frances McDormand (sp?), was such a kick! I love her. :) Her phone conversation with Billy Crudup's character was so funny.All in all, this movie is a sweet, poignant, quick-of-wit story about the days of love, sex, and music.

265,Art Snob,As good as mainstream GETS these days,9,22 September 2000,"I took in ALMOST FAMOUS at the Toronto International Film Festival shortly before its theatrical release, and you can certainly add my voice to the chorus of approval for this fine film. It's a definite cross-generational bulls-eye, with an extremely likeable and sympathetic young protagonist for younger viewers to identify with, and plenty of refreshingly *non-overused* cultural signposts & music selections for boomers to remember fondly.  Set between 1969 and 1974 (with most of the story taking place in 1973), Crowe has obviously drawn heavily upon his own personal life story and rock expertise in creating this fictional film -- it has a much richer texture and more authentic period ""feel"" than any Hollywood hack could ever possibly come up with in creating a similar story.  Newcomers Patrick Fugit (Crowe's alter-ego, William Miller) and Kate Hudson head a stellar ensemble cast.  The movie has no shortage of great one-liners, many of them involving famous music stars.  (My personal favorites: the one where Miller's mother, played  by Frances McDormand, explains why she doesn't want him listening to Simon & Garfunkle, and another where someone makes a killer comment about the Rolling Stones.)  The soundtrack may be the first one covering this time period that DOESN'T include ""For What It's Worth,"" ""Born to be Wild,"" or ""Purple Haze,"" and it should be a big seller.ALMOST FAMOUS is ""mainstream"" for sure, but it's as good, smart and entertaining as mainstream gets these days.  Just SEE it.  It's superior in every respect to Crowe's last hit, JERRY MAGUIRE, and I'll be recommending it to just about everyone I have any regular movie discourse with.",Almost Famous
266,stefanbe,A film that literally rocks.,9,5 July 2007,"Rock music has been completely embedded into our culture and it will be remembered long after all of the boy bands have swept off of the earth. The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin's music are listened by every generation and everyone knows who they are. Murials are painted about them, books are written about them and new edition CDs keep getting released each year. Is there no surprise that their work keeps getting downloaded and downloaded by teenagers almost everyday. Back in the 1970's, Cameron Crowe (the director and writer of Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky)was one of those teenagers who would constantly listen to their LPs and idealise them for all they are worth. He became a writer for Rolling Stone magazine and would parade around with all the rockers. He decided to create a film about those adventures to inspire future journalists (such as myself).William Miller is a rock music fan who wants to grow up to become a rock music critic like his hero Lester Bangs. Lester gives him some advice saying that he should never become friends with the rock stars, because it will slant his writing. With permission from his very protective mother, William goes on a cross-country with Stillwater, a band whose biggest hit is called ""Fever Dog."" He has managed to get everyone to give him an interview, except for the bandleader Russell Hammond. That is what he attempts to do throughout the rest of the film. Meanwhile, William makes friends with Penny Lane, who is not a groupie, but what she calls a Band Aid. Unfortunately, he doesn't follow Lester's advice and does in fact become friends with the rock stars.As a budding critic, Almost Famous speaks to me on so many levels. I understand the character of William and when he types on his typewriter, I am reminded of when I type on my computer word processor. The role of the critic is to be ""honest and unmerciful"" and trust me, I have not become friends with Cameron Crowe. This is a terrific film and I must recommend it. The heart of Almost Famous is of course, Patrick Fugit who plays William. He portrays that character as an innocent in a world filled with famous people and drug addicts. His mother tells him a lot to not take drugs and he obeys that rule, because he knows when not to cross the line. Kate Hudson's work as Penny Lane shows that she is a equal if not better actress than her mother. Billy Crudup's nuanced performance makes Russell the most likable member of the band with Jason Lee proving once again that he is one of the best character actors in the business. Frances McDormand as William's mother also shows that she can play someone other than Sourthern policewomen. Philip Seymour Hoffman has always amazed me and his work as Lester Bangs is so great that I believe he deserved to win an Oscar for it. Cameron Crowe is an outstanding filmmaker and his life story is much more interesting than those of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.He can't beat Charles Chaplin and Kevin Smith, though.",Almost Famous
267,MikeK1987,My favorite movie of all time.,10,25 November 2009,"This movie couldn't have come at a better time in my life. It was a time in my life when I was alienated from everyone else because of the music I liked, because I didn't listen to what was considered hip and cool. Thanks to the influence of my parents, I listened to mostly classic rock; bands like, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, & Yes. A time when my age group listened to Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Creed, & Eminem; music that I felt no connection with emotionally, music that didn't appeal to me as a teenager, or even a human being, it was a life changing experience for me to see a movie that featured and paid tribute to the music that I liked. It felt like coming home to somewhere that I never knew. The soundtrack was top notch, hearing cuts by some of my favorite bands; Yes, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, The Who, The Allman Brothers Band, and also helped turn me on to Rod Stewart, Joni Mitchell, Elton John, The Seeds, Thunderclap Newman, The Beach Boys, and Simon & Garfunkel (surprisingly, I had heard Yes's version of ""America"" long before I heard Simon & Garfunkel's original, and I was absolutely floored when I first heard it in this film). I loved Nancy Wilson's acoustic baroque-folk-rockesque score. The instrumental bits held up against the classic songs perfectly. I was a bit annoyed when only 1 short piece of the score ended up being released on the soundtrack album, but beggars can't be choosers. If you don't already have the music featured in this film in your collection, I highly recommend buying the soundtrack album, and then going out and buying the original albums by all of the bands on the soundtrack, because every artist on this soundtrack is worth more than 1 song. (In the case of Nancy Wilson, I recommend Heart's 70's albums and the Elizabethtown score.)Although, this film does have one shortcoming. Kate Hudson. She's not a bad actress. In fact, I still attest that this is her best film and film performance, to date. But the slew of bad films and terrible performances that she's done since 'Almost Famous', in a way, hurts her performance in this film, retroactively.The biggest part of this film that I connected with was the character William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit). His shortcomings, the disrespect from his peers at school, his naivety, his overbearing mother. These were all problems that were put into perspective real quick after seeing this film. Everybody, at one time or another, went through what I was going through, and here's good a lesson presented in a way that appeals to me. Of course, I wish that I could've been there to experience it first hand in the late 60's-early 70's, but then again, as Robin Williams once said, ""If you remember the 60's, you weren't there"". Being born in 1987, I don't remember the 60's. Maybe I was there. Who knows? Either way, at least I have the music and this film as tributes to that great era of counterculture to look back on, and hopefully I, and all of us who appreciate the music, can take the music and the lessons of that era with us in the decades and centuries to come.Oh, and I do recommend that everybody seek out the ""Untitled"" version of the DVD.",Almost Famous

William befriends rock journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who gives him an assignment and some important advice: if you're going to write about rock bands, don't make friends with them.
After seeing some of his work, Rolling Stone magazine, whose editor doesn't know how young he is, gives him an assignment of doing a tour with the up and coming Stillwater, despite the misgivings of his mother (Frances McDormand), and he soon finds himself attracted to Band Aide, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Almost Famous is a semi-autobiographical account of writer/director Cameron Crowe's life which is funny, painful, clever, naive, wonderful and insightful. It's a tag that I would prefer not to use, but it manages to explain the crux of this film - it's a coming of age flick.  But it's not just William, who undergoes a transformation - it's all the cast - from Elaine, to Stillwater.Delightful characters pop up in this warm film, including Noah Taylor (young David Helfgott in Shine) as Stillwater's Manager, Dick, Anna Paquin (The Piano) as Polexia Aphrodesia and a host of others.

Through a charming tone, the film succeeds in exploring themes of personal discovery and fulfillment, as well as the innocence and anxiety of young adulthood. Inspired by a unique past experience of the writer and director Cameron Crowe, who as a teenager wrote for Rolling Stone magazine, the film works as a very useful lens into the world of rock and roll music and the lifestyle that it dictates. The film's terrific soundtrack helps shape the atmosphere of the period it portrays, and due to its nostalgic look at the 70s, Almost Famous can perhaps above all else be considered as the director's heartfelt tribute to rock and roll.",Almost Famous

As a result I completely missed the point. Almost Famous is a mix of different film types but its mixed so brilliantly that the sum becomes greater then its parts.Its funny, tragic and heartwarming all at once. You could tell it was a real labour of love for all involved. The love triangle between Penny Lane, William and Russell was brilliantly done, especially the part she learns she has been ""sold"" to another band for beer. ""What kind of beer?"" she smiles with tears streaming down her face. The film is full of fantastic scenes like that, brought to life by the fantastic performances especially Kate Hudson's.Its also very funny and contains a lot more laughs then so called dedicated ""comedies"" but such is the excellence of the drama and relationships its often overlooked. The speech Russell is giving to the drunk kid at the party, the drummers revelation on the plane, not only funny but impeccably timed to raise the spirits just when things may start getting too heavy.And thats why its so great I think.

As far as some of the comments that the film is to unbelievable to be true, they are merely ignorant and lacking in imagination. At nearly the same age as William Miller, I found myself face to face with some of the most exalted legends of rock and roll backstage at Woodstock. I 'gods'. HBO has been showing this film quite often and it easily stands up to repeated viewings, showing nuances missed previously. I give will never forget riding the stage elevator with Jimi Hendrix and his manager and driving them to the helicopter in a rented Plymouth, as well as driving the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane when they arrived at the festival. Being part of the stage crew gave me the chance to have a long talk with Marty Scorsese while he filmed the the opening sequences of the festival, long before he was a cinema icon. I was a a budding photographer and journalist, magnetically and magically drawn to occupy a catbird seat at this defining  moment- and yet I was treated with kindness and respect by these rock 'gods.

276,natw,"Simply put, ""Almost Famous"" rocks",10,4 April 2012,"""Almost Famous"" is nearly perfect as a film about the glory days of rock 'n' roll, when we thought our music just might change the world. But this is not an expose on the dangers, debauchery and shallowness of rock's practitioners. It is an achingly sweet coming-of-age tale that explores issues faced by musicians of the rock era, their fans and all those on the sidelines. The protagonist, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), is a precocious, fresh-faced 15-year-old who has been infused with the magic of rock by his older sister, a wonderful Zooey Deschanel, who has had enough of her domineering, protective mother (played with relish by Frances McDormand) and leaves home to become a stewardess. She bequeaths to William her precious treasure trove of albums. Young rock writer William is mentored by Creem magazine editor Lester Bangs (the magnificent Phillip Seymour Hoffman. ""Be honest and unmerciful,"" Bangs advises) and gets a plumb assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to cover an up-and-coming band, Stillwater. He ends up on the road with the group, precariously balancing a fan's exuberance with a sense of professionalism. William is befriended - and protected in a strange way - by another teen, Penny Lane, a groupie (no, ""band-aid,"" she declares) who uses William to get close to Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell, played by Billy Crudup. Kate Hudson, as Penny Lane, is simply astonishing, lending depth to a role that could easily have become a cliché. Every scene in which she appears seems to take on a luminous quality, partly because of her angelic appearance and bubbly personality. William falls for Penny (who wouldn't?) but his love is unrequited, as she wants desperately for Russell to love her back. There are many things going on here, but director Cameron Crowe handles them all with aplomb, bringing the plot to an unexpected but satisfying conclusion. As one who personally experienced rock's golden age, the movie touches me in a very personal way. But even for those who had the misfortune of being born after Zeppelin rocked the arenas, ""Almost Famous"" delivers an emotional wallop. I saw this movie shortly after its release in 2000, and I have revisited it many times since, which is as rewarding as listening to old records again and again.

Cameron Crowe somehow manages to make the concert scene of the early 70's look boring, and then tries to fill in the lameness with horribly spliced clips from the great Led Zeppelin, whose fans will surely be outraged by this butchery (made even worse by the fact that Crowe toured with Zeppelin at their invitation, providing the basis for this movie).Much of the ""acting,"" by Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit, seems to consist entirely of annoying brats making sleepy moon-faces at each other.

Just once I would like to see even a hint of ambiguity at the conclusion and not have everything wrapped up so nicely and neatly.  The formula really wore thin for me with this movie, and I grew actively restless and irritated with it midway through.  Crowe got the look and feel of the 70's rock milieu down quite well, but I was never wholly convinced by any of the action in his story.  The cast all performed well, but I thought Fairuza Balk particularly lit up the screen in her small but juicy role as the garrulous groupie, Sapphire.

279,kdryan,Coming of age movie? **(Spoilers)**,9,26 July 2001,"It's usually pretty hard to tell the exact moment I fall in love with a movie.  In 'Almost Famous' it was easy.  It's right when William Miller tells Penny Lane she has been traded to Humble Pie for $50 and a case of beer.  She looks crushed for a moment, a couple of tears run down her face and then (in the best tradition of jilted lovers everywhere) smiles and asks what kind of beer it was.I grew up in the 70's.  I caught Rock & Roll at the tail end that Lester Bangs speaks of.  It was the point where people stopped being interested in making Rock for the sake of the music, and started to turn into the hair metal bands like Loverboy and Night Ranger.  The movie's Stillwater, while being totally fictional, would make a nice fit between Creedence and early Bad Company with a little Lynyrd Skynyrd thrown in.  I don't know how to put it other than this movie FEELS like the 70's.  Everything is right.  It was like remembering listening to the radio as a teenager and experiencing a pure moment of happiness when The Eagles came on.As a coming of age flick (I never that that at pushing 40, a COA flick would impress me) this one rules.  But it's not just William that grows up here. Pennny, Russell, and everyone in the band, and both his mother and sister come out of this movie a little older and wiser than when they started.

But the few dates turn into many cities, he misses school and graduation, she complains to the students she teaches that her son has been kidnapped by a rock bank and she still does nothing.

I cannot truthfully say that this movie did a wonderful job of portraying the frenzied, sweetly doped up world of the early '70s because I wasn't alive to know that era, but it is incredibly well-written and well-acted (the entire cast is outstanding-- when's the last time THAT happened). You must go see this amazing film. Cameron Crowe rocks!!!",Almost Famous
284,sean_36,crowe's best film to date,9,10 December 2001,"Almost Famous is loosely based on the life of the film's writer/director Cameron Crowe. Who, as a teenager was somehow lucky enough to get the job as a writer for Rolling Stone magazine and went on the road, interviewing bands.  Even though names have been changed, situations altered and other stuff just plain made up, Almost Famous still carries the feel of a biography and gives you the distinct feeling that you are watching someone's life play out on screen.  This is part of what makes Almost Famous such a great movie.  Adding to this is the great performance from Kate Hudson as groupie Penny Lane, the hilarious Jason Lee as a member of the fictional band Stillwater, and the whole sex, drugs, rock and roll atmosphere of the time period.  AF is one of those rare movies that works on several different levels. It's a touching drama, a road movie, a comedy, and a coming of age story all in one.  It's a shame it didn't get nominated for an Oscar (but then how can you trust an association stupid enough to nominate Chocolat) because this is one of the year's best movies.",Almost Famous
285,forecastmazy,"Fairfield, CT",10,20 June 2003,"Almost Famous is another amazing Cameron Crowe film. The evolution of this director is amazing, this movie, a semi-auto-biographical film on the director is true to the director's core which is a love for music.
William Miller is a little boy. He's two years ahead of his grade, was lied to about his age and now wants to be a rock journalist. He meets Lester Bangs, the infamous rock critic from the 70s. The fact that all of this really happened once again confirms that I missed the golden age of music before anger and gangster rap and fashion obsession in the scene. When music was truly music. Before THEY took over. Cameron Crowe, or William Miller, goes on tour with Stillwater to review them and falls in love, sees the truth behind the rock scene and continues to love every minute of it while going through a self liberation through the repression that living in suburbia can cause one. This film is absolutely amazing. Every piece of this film has a piece of my soul in it. The glances William gives to Penny, the very existence of Penny, the way he innocently looses his virginity and even the title sequence has a true feeling to it. The second this movie started I felt my heart move and knew I was on the true path in being a part of the world of cinema.
The love story intertwines with the theme of the band which threads into the main theme of the corporations taking hold of rock and manipulating them from their pure root of music, taking buses on the road and making love to groupies (or, BAND AIDS) and turning them into cheezy expensive rock-stars. From watching this film you see where music went right... where it went wrong... and how we got the 80s hair band cheeze out of the whole deal.. than you can see how the 90s sprung true music.. and then if you really care you could take a closer look and realize how we got to the rehashed fake-music worshipping age of MTV that we live in today. (This is all a sidenote on rock music but the director has a very true link to the music itself that strikes my heart. Not being a fan of rap music at all and growing up to live and love classic rock every piece of nostalgia from Cameron Crowe's childhood is a trinket I myself wish I owned. If you listen to the director's commentary on the DVD you really fall in love.)
Words cannot explain the amazingness of this movie. Almost Famous is an experience. This is a movie I will never get sick of. It is pure.
Almost Famous is the reason movies were made. The growth this director has gone through since his beginnings in writing Fast Times At Ridgemont High is simply amazing. I suggest you also watch his other films, besides FTARH, Singles and Vanilla Sky are also equally amazing films with similar dynamics. Cameron Crowe is the most interesting and honest director to come to the face of American cinema. See this movie unless you have no soul.",Almost Famous

Finally, it ends in a most generic, unsatisfying way.

And the best part that it takes place in a generation when rock still meant something.The movie is also helped by it's great cast. The rockers are real. Even though I have seen the main 2 (Crudup and Lee) in films before, after the first few minutes they were on screen, I forgot they were themselves. They transformed themselves into the prototypical rockers. Sullen and aloof. The kid is great too. The fact that they got a geeky kind of kid instead of the usual goodlooking-made-to-look-dorky-kid really helps the viewers eyes to accept him.When you get the time, check out this film.

But the plot is never what a Crowe movie is really about.They're about finding your place in the world, making mistakes, getting advice and learning to be happy with who you are, and no film he's made does a better job exemplifying Crowe's best traits as a writer than this one. He, almost alone among major Hollywood screenwriters, can generate serious, sustained conflict without a real antagonist-- you care about everyone in his films, not just a generic hero. I deeply value all of his movies(even Fast Times at Ridgemont High, even though I dislike parts of it), but this one is that rare work of art that's a genuine masterpiece without ever seeming as if it's trying to be one.

Crowe sets up a world of rock 'n roll that, aside from a little bit of groupie sex and a minimal amount of drugs and alcohol (portrayed in negative, didactic ways) seems pure and wholesome and a place where the magic of love can work its wonders. Everything about it seems false, from the talents of the band (a hard-working, rising cross between Blue Oyster Cult and The Allman Brothers Band) to the film's climax, meant to be revelatory but ends up being little more than a parody of an episode of ""Seinfeld"". It all has an adverse effect on the central love story; but even then, how can you take a film seriously when the hero declares his love while his intended is in a drug-induced coma? Only Philip Seymour Hoffman, as late rock critic Lester Bangs, really has something to say about the surroundings; unfortunately, Crowe tends to ignore Bangs' admonishments and instead focuses on having everyone be friends. The soundtrack is the film's redeeming asset: it makes you appreciate Jimmy Page's subtle guitar and one even comes away with a fondness for Yes.",Almost Famous

This is a nicely done and mostly funny story due primarily to the winsome characters and well done musical selections. Especially memorable performances include Patrick Fugit as the kid (William) and Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, the ""band aid.""

302,kls13,Don't believe the hype!,6,24 September 2000,"I must be missing something, because when the audience started applauding as the closing credits for Almost Famous hit the screen, I couldn't believe it. I had been waiting for the movie to end for well over an hour and thought about walking out more than once.  This movie has been touted as `the best reviewed film so far this year' (which, in a lackluster year of movies really isn't saying much).  Don't be fooled--this movie isn't a coming of age tale-it's a two hour episode of Behind the Music that isn't nearly as exciting as what VH-1 can put together.Rumor has it that Cameron Crowe has been trying to get his story' made for years now, and after watching what the story is, I can see why.  It starts out fairly well, but once William hooks up with Stillwater it gets flat out boring.  Every scene seems to drag on forever, and the movie simply does not move along well.  There is virtually no character development, no explanation as to why Stillwater and the groupies would want to hang out with this total dork who doesn't have a clue about anything.  Therefore, the characters were extremely one dimensional, very surface level stereotypes of rock stars and groupies.  Nothing new going on here.  The lowest point of the movie for me was the group singalong to Tiny Dancer.'  Sorry Cameron, P.T. Anderson can pull it off.  You can't.  The climax (if you want to call it that) is virtually nonexistent, a faint blip in what is already a very dull movie.  Add to that extremely cheesy dialogue (I can already see that `I need to go home.'  `You're already home.' Will be the next `You complete me.'  Cringeworthy, definitely), and you've got a nothing special film here.
Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman steal the show in the scenes that they are in, perhaps the only saving grace of this movie for me. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee do a good job as well.  I had a problem with Kate Hudson (can you say bland?) and Patrick Fugit.  He looks like a deer in headlights during the entire movie, and his dopey smile gets quite annoying.Personally, you couldn't pay me to sit through this movie again.  But, since so many people seem to love it, you should probably go see it and decide for yourself if you like it or not.  All I have to say is that if this gets nominated for Best Picture, I will never watch the Academy Awards again.6/10",Almost Famous

304,TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom,I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!!! (some spoilers),8,26 June 2002,"In one sentence, ""Almost Famous"" deserved its Best Writing Oscar to a T. It also deserved its Best Supporting Actress nominations for Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand. I totally believed both of them--Hudson as the beautiful, mysterious Penny Lane and McDormand as Elaine Miller, the overprotective but loving mom. But it also should have been recognized for other actors as well. Jason Lee and Billy Crudup were amazing as members of Stillwater, Patrick Fugit was great as William Miller, and Zooey Deschanel was awesome in her almost cameo role as Anita. Also, Cameron Crowe should have been nominated for Best Director. Truthfully, I think ""Almost Famous"" deserved at least a nomination for Best Picture. The gist: 15-year-old William Miller (Fugit) gets to write for Rolling Stone and travel with Stillwater. Along with them travel sexy groupies known as Band-Aids. Among them is Penny Lane (Hudson), a pretty but secretive teen who uses the name from a famous Beatles song to avoid her real name. As William gets to know this young woman way out of his league, he starts to fall for her. Unfortunately, she won't tell him how old she is, and Russell Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater's guitarist, also wants to be with her. To complicate things further, both the Band-Aids and Stillwater use drugs and do many other obscene things (including ""deflowering"" William)--many of them while he's on the phone with his mom (McDormand)--and William can never get a second alone with anyone of Stillwater to interview them.
My favorite scenes are the ""Tiny Dancer"" scene, the scene where they think the plane is going to crash, the scene where the sister comes home, and when Penny Lane sends Russell to William's house instead of hers. The deflowering scene is also great because you can feel the electrifying chemistry between William and Penny as they stare at each other. I think the scene that really reflects Kate Hudson's role is when she tries to commit suicide and William literally has to hold her up. Patrick Fugit hasn't been in many films, but since this, he's probably wanted for many more. And Kate Hudson was originally cast as Anita, but wanted to read for Penny Lane. I think she, Fugit, Jason Lee, Billy Crudup, and Frances McDormand are the glue that holds this masterpiece together, not to mention the spectacular directing job by Crowe.

I can't wait for this movie to be released all over the world so everyone will see what being young in America is all about. Even though it takes place in the 70's it is not a  70's movie, and can be enjoyed no matter when you were a teenager.

306,Lucian-3,I loved it AND it made me re-examine myself,9,26 September 2000,"To me this film is a modern day Pinocchio story.  The twist is every character is simultaneously Pinocchio (full of dreams, wanting to be real, but making very big mistakes along the way) and Jimminey Cricket (an imperfect conscience driven to help  a friend).  The star they wish on is stardom, either directly or by association, and it's not always all that magical.This is not a perfect film.  It is the best film so far in 2000 (which is not saying much) and it does show Crowe to have truly arrived.  I think we'll see Cameron making a lot of solid films for years to come.The cast...well the cast is superb.  Every time I see Phillip Seymour Hoffman I want to see him again and Frances McDormand deserves a supporting actress nomination with on possibly going to Kate Hudson as lead (though this is because there seems like so little competition this year outside of Joan Allen in The Contender).As for the soundtrack.  I bought it.  It's solid but there REALLY should have been a copy of ""Cover of the Rolling Stone"" included, it's one of the most evocative songs of the desires and adjustments of fame for a rock musician there is and its oversight is nearly criminal.Yes the film wimps out a bit on the drug angle but this isn't a documentary and it's as much a modern look at the time (witness the numerous jokes that are only funny looking backwards) as a look from within it.I saw this film while visiting another city with no one to talk to and it resonated for days.

307,mreisman,Almost Really Good,7,15 September 2000,"Yet another case of a pretty good movie not living up to its sizeable hype. This was a smart, engaging, entertaining movie with some big laughs, and some nice little moments, but ultimately, it's a shallow film that leaves you when you leave the theater.While 15-year-old William is struggling with whether he should write a fluff piece or a hard-hitting article about the band he's become friends with on the road, director Cameron Crowe himself has no such quandary.  He's happy to be completely reverent, not necessarily about the band, but about the whole rock world of the '70s.  The entire movie has this glow of nostalgic reverence, and this is the best and worst thing about Almost Famous.  The best, because all of the detail in the costumes, sets, characterizations and attitudes are so rich and specific; but the worst because Crowe is afraid to show us anything truly controversial.  It seems that Crowe wants to show the effects of living in the insular bubble of a rock tour, but he's not questioning it; he's rarely willing to go outside it because it is too fun, and mostly harmless fun at that.  The scenes in which we see jealous infighting among the band members seem trivial, because we know that the characters are too happy where they are to think about giving it up.  The closeups of the wife Billy Crudup cheats on, and the frantic Frances McDormand's lectures as an unbelievably overbearing Mom, aren't quite enough to make this story compelling.So in comparing this movie with Jerry Maguire and Say Anything, I have to prefer the older ones.  Maybe this is just a matter of personal taste, but Crowe seems to be at his sharpest when his heroes rise up from adversity: Jerry Maguire's need to be ethical in a world where ethics don't seem to matter anymore; Lloyd Dobbler's devotion to a girl he should never have gotten to be with, and her own struggle with what is right.  Even the screenplay of Fast Times at Ridgemont High has these teenagers searching for something real in a shallow mall culture.  But in Almost Famous, William is dealt such a great hand -- incredible intelligence and a week of Rock Star partying -- that the growing pains he endures aren't much more than any 15-year-old would would feel.  The arc of the story is mostly smooth sailing.But like I said, it's an enjoyable if not very bumpy ride.  And all of the performances are good, especially Philip S. Hoffman as Lester Bangs -- frame for frame, line for line, no one packs nearly as much humor and depth into their role.  Patrick Fugit is always engaging, but he never really hits the highs and lows you want as William -- he's mostly a gee-whiz witness to the mayhem around him.",Almost Famous
308,Tresy,Almost Interesting,3,25 September 2000,"When you have a cast that includes the dependable Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as the celebrated film critic Lester Bangs) and Frances McDormand, you are off to a good start. Throw in a promising plot about a young teen who lucks into his fantasy as an on-the-road rock critic during the heyday of sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, and things look even better. Make that plot autobiographical and have it directed by the subject, Cameron Crowe, and you have to wonder, what can go wrong?Well, quite a bit actually.First, the main characters are uninteresting and cliched. As Russell, lead singer for a Spinal Tap-esque band, ""Stillwater,"" Billy Crudup exudes sex appeal but little else. He's basically a stick-figure rocker with an ego the size of Kansas and an arrested case of sexual development. Kate Hudson, as his groupie girlfriend Penny Lane, is an updated version of the hooker with the heart of gold; she looks like Jodie Foster's character in Taxi Driver, only with a better wardrobe. Finally, Patrick Fugit, as the Cameron Crowe standin William Miller, is perfect so long as he is required merely to stand around with a ""wow-I-can't-believe-I'm-with-a-rock-band"" look on his face; when he is required to do more, however--when he has to make a profession of love, for example--he's a flop. His delivery has all the awkwardness of the callow youth he portrays, but none of the emotional conviction. It just comes across as bad acting.Second, the environment is dishonestly portrayed. Even though Hoffman's Lester Bangs repeatedly admonishes little William to be ""merciless"" in his journalism and to resist the seductions of life on the road, the film itself is pretty much a big wet kiss for a period that Bangs himself saw as the nadir of rock music. Drugs are shown, but they are largely soft; cocaine and heroin are nowhere to be found. The few episodes of drug abuse are hardly as shocking as anything one has seen at a typical suburban kegger. Even the music is dreadful, including the soundtrack. If Lester Bangs knew he was going to be portrayed posthumously in a movie that apotheosized Elton John music without irony, he would have p***ed on young Cameron's head and kicked him out on his sorry butt.The bigger dishonesty is in the movie's stance towards its subject. While the plot pretends to be about ""keeping it real"" and staying true to yourself, the movie is little more than an ego trip for Cameron Crowe. This is Portrait  of the Artist as a Celebrity Wannabe. He wants our jealousy, not our respect or admiration. At one point the Penny Lane character states, without irony, that she hangs with rock bands (even a mediocre one like Stillwater) because celebrities are more interesting than ordinary people. Little in the movie suggests that Crowe feels any differently; after all, it ends happily with his alter ego embarking on his career as a rock critic. Yet if any acquaintance with Leno, Letterman or your random Rolling Stone interview didn't disabuse one of this idea a long time ago, this movie should, as the characters have absolutely nothing memorable to say. ""What do you like about music?"" William asks Russell in the movie's penultimate line. ""Well, everything, for starters..."" replies Russell, as the movie fades out.Wow, man. Heavy.",Almost Famous

Watch the performances VERY CLOSELY, or you WILL miss quite a bit. pay attention to the soundtrack as well-not just for the fact that it enhances, as well as helping to convey the story, but for the reason that it is of the utmost quality, not something associated much with the 70's music scene, which, as this film shows, is both a blessing & regrettable. perhaps the most wonderful thing about this film is that there is something in it for everyone, from teenagers to the very elderly.

As she takes the album away, Anita lists off a few things that Elaine has banned from their house (sugar, then butter, white flour, then rock-'n-roll albums, and of course ""then it was celebrating Christmas on a day in September when you knew it wouldn't be commercialized...""), and ultimately ""swears"" (she says feck) at Elaine, expressing Anita's extreme hatred of her. Later on, Elaine--after being pushed by Anita--confesses to William that he's actually 11, as opposed to his assumption of being 12--she put him in grade 1 when he was 5, and he skipped 5th grade. William gets upset at Elaine.Anita eventually leaves home, and says to her mother that the song ""America"" by Simon and Garfunkel will explain why she's leaving to become a stewardess. Before she departs, she says to William, ""One day, you'll be cool....""(in his ear)""Look under your bed; it'll set you free."" What he finds under the bed are all of Anita's music records that she stashed. Among them are Led Zeppelin II, The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Joni Mitchell's Blue, and the most focused record in this scene, The Who's Tommy. A note reads, ""Play Tommy with a candle burning, and you'll be able to see your entire future."" He does so, and plays ""Sparks."" At that point, he gets really into music.1973 - William (now played by Patrick Fugit) goes to a radio station and finds Lester Bangs, writer for Creem Magazine; William goes and talks to him. They talk for a while about music, and how rock is basically dead. Lester gives William an assignment: 1000 words on Black Sabbath. Reluctantly, Elaine gives him a ride to Black Sabbath's concert. William feels a bit embarrassed and leaves for the concert--if your mother yells to you, ""Don't take drugs!"", when almost everyone around you is high, wouldn't you feel embarrassed? As he attempts to get in, the bouncer doesn't let him in. This is when he first meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and the Band-Aids. The Band-Aids are girls who are there for the music, not to try and sleep with the band, unlike groupies. As he waits around hopelessly, he comes upon Sabbath's opening band, Stillwater. He tries to get an interview, but as they see that he's a journalist (they call him ""The Enemy""), they don't let him. However, he talks to them about how he loves their band, and says how he loves ""Fever Dog"", which is the first song that the band plays on stage. This brings him into a bit of a friendship with the band. William finds Penny again, and tells her that he's only 15. He asks her for her real name, with no success--it's a question he'll ask every now and then in the movie. Eventually, Stillwater asks him to come along with them on their tour, on their bus ""Doris."" William gets a job offer from Ben Fong-Torres, from Rolling Stone magazine, who's under the assumption that William is much older. William doesn't disillusion Ben and accepts the offer. Elaine is very reluctant, but she eventually accepts it. She doesn't want William to miss more than 1 test. That promise will be broken a couple of times. Most of the movie shows William, Penny, and Stillwater and their adventures across America together.There's more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie, see what you think of it. I can't say whether or not you won't be disappointed, but you can be the judge on that.",Almost Famous
311,theblacksuit3,Long live Rock n' Roll,10,29 October 2012,"This is what film making is all about. Mr. Crowe has done something amazing with his very personal story, and touched many people with this work of art representing ambition, humanity and the negative results of the music spotlight. It harnesses the subject of sex, drugs, and rock and roll with absolute mastery by telling the story of a young journalist who gets a chance that is nearly impossible to get at the age of 15, even if you are eligible to graduate at the time. His ambitions and talent get him a chance to write an article on one of his favorite bands for a very popular Rock magazine, I'll let you guess which one. In doing this he sees the truth about the band, not just what he's read.The now star studded cast gives a fully honest and beautiful set of performances, the most noted and celebrated being from Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand. However, the real highlight that goes overlooked is Patrick Fugit in his first lead, and breakthrough role. The fact that his billing is a bit down the list can be a bit misleading to those who haven't seen it, but he really does steal the show from everyone. Kate Hudson shows her free spirit in a very true performance that I still can't help but feel is a bit overrated. Being nominated in the best supporting actress category in basically every award show for 2001, I feel like she had everything she needed except for the substantial character that she was so desperately trying to create. Now I haven't seen the extended ""bootleg edition"" so i have not seen all there is to see, therefore this is based solely on the theatrical version. Let's also not forget Jason Lee, the usual comedy man who takes a bit of a turn as a disgruntled lead singer who is ironically the one getting overshadowed by the guitarist.This movie is a new personal favorite of mine, and I definitely plan on buying the extended version when I get the chance. I recommend it to anyone who takes the time to read this as the perfect film embodiment of the 70's rock scene. So watch, enjoy, cherish, and long live rock n' roll!",Almost Famous

Mom, the roll call at graduation, the little house in the suburbs, a honorable profession, are part of the ""right"" world. Pretty much anything else is part of the ""wrong"" world (including, apparently, pursuing a career as a stewardess, maybe because spending nights in hotels far away from mom's eyes can provide occasions for--gasp!--casual sex).Only the puritan 90's could produce this petit-bourgeois film, and only the puritan 90's could decide to set it in the 70's (the decade that all the good newborn christian guys love to hate) to send an oblique message to the promiscuous teens of the 90's (what subtlety! what mastery of rhetorical devices! to set a movie in the 70's to talk to teens in the 90's).The film's little rampages against the ""establishment"" are just the icing sprinkled lightly to lure today's teens into acknowledging that the real enemies today are Hip Hop (thinly disguised as 70's Rock 'n' Roll), casual sex, and, in general, any bohemian and alternative kind of life.

I really liked it and I think most people liked it more than they thought they would before watching it.It's like a bittersweet rollercoaster of emotions which at the same time is really well made.
The reason for this is probably that this movie is auto-biographical, and therefore Cameron Crowe put a lot of passion and effort into it.He wrote wonderful characters, very charismatic and relatable. For example Kate Hudson, this was one of Kate Hudson's first, and to my mind best, roles. She was mesmerizing in the same tough, broken, little-girl way of so many tragic Hollywood women of the past.This led to a very emotional, entertaining, enjoyable and relatable movie.Cameron Crowe perfectly portrayed and expressed his love for music.This movie is the clear example that when you love what you do and you put effort and passion into it, good things will come out.",Almost Famous

Taking every booking that I could, up to working for Live Nation as a promoter, snd the memories are what I cherish most from the experience.I share this, because watching this movie, is like explaining the experiences of touring, better than I could ever in my own stories. There is a feeling amongst the bands who are struggling and trying to reach the top. Those were the bands I most loved promoting and just watching the people I loved, making the music I loved, and touching those in the crowds. The vigor and sometimes violence behind the scenes, all culminating in that 30-45 minutes where they were on stage and everything came together.I never achieved what Cameron did, but the feeling and magic is there in his story, he may have changed some names and homogulated many people into his characters, but he still capture everything that needed to be.This movie failed in the box office, and later so many have realized exactly what they missed out on. Making it the deserving classic film that it was always meant to be.If you haven't seen this film. I highly recommend it.

319,havana-2,A Masterpiece,10,22 September 2000,"Most artists offer their self-portrait as an introspective look into themselves.  Cameron Crowe is an artist, and this film not only proves it, it screams it aloud.  He showed what a marvelous observer he was of high schools- Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Say Anything, of Being Twentysomething - Singles, and of Sport Agenting- Jerry Macguire.  Now, he goes back- instead of forward and shows us what it is like to be the observer.  He offers an introspective view on what it is like to be 15 years old and tour with bands like Black Sabbath and Lynrd Skynrd and Led Zeppelin.  He was there when Rock and Roll was at its full glory. When drugs and sex and rock and roll were not only synonomyous, but prolific.  And as a teen, he didn't succumb to any of it, he abided by his role and observed and worked as a journalist and his view, the view that will last- because of this movie and his work for magazines like Rolling Stone- is as ""unmerciful"" as the work he did as a journalist. It is honest and it is brilliant. Additionally, Kate Hudson, Philip Seymour-Hoffman, Billy Crudup and Patrick Fulgit offer excellent performances. The soundtrack is inspiring and the score by Crowe's wife Nancy Wilson of Heart is perfect as well. This is my vote for the 2000 Oscar, I know it is early, but I predict this will take the cake.

320,James.S.Davies,Alm' Fam' is Ab' Fab',7,11 October 2000,"However much this film may seemingly portray itself as a deconstruction of the rock'n'roll myth it is pretty much the stuff of nostalgia and fairytale from beginning to end, and all the more funny and emotionally engaging for it!Already a child prodigy in academic terms, young Billy Miller (Michael Angarano) begins a journey of rock'n'roll self discovery after inheriting his sister's (Zooey Deschanel) entire record collection when she manages to sever herself from her mother's (Frances MacDormand) domineering conservativeness, running off to San Fransisco to become an air hostess. The collection reads like a who's who of the golden age of guitar based psychadelic pop music from The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' to The Who's 'Tommy'.By the age of 15 with his mother's ""don't do Drugs"" moto still ringing in his ears, Billy (now played by Patrick Fugit)gatecrashes his frist gig, gaining access backstage with the help of an army of ""non-groupies"" headed by the beautiful and promiscuous Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  Armed only with a tape recorder and a few words of wisdom bestowed on him from his local mentor, real-life music-journo legend Lester Bangs, he embarks on an assignment for Rolling Stone magazine covering the haphazard breakthrough tour of Rock's latest grear white no-hopers 'Stillwater'.During the coarse of this tour, which gives Almost Famous its road movie credential, Billy be-friends the band's pin-up guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup), the charismatic Jim Morrison wannabe of the band, and more importantly the man who uses Penny as his part-time squeeze.  Throughout events young Billy is torn between the extremities of liberal decadence of the music scene and the conservative matriarchal and still dominant figure of his mother back home in San Diego.  As in his previous work 'Jerry Macguire' Cameron Crowe's message is neither clearly left or right wing. While seemingly offering an acceptance of the conflicting ideologies; conservative matriarchy versus free-living rock'n'roll, the film highlights the destructiveness of both sides.  While in 'Jerry Macguire' such political ambiguities may have seemed wishy-washy, they are a more welcome treatment for this subject matter.Frances MacDormand (of Oscar Winning fame for Fargo) is perfectly freaksome as Billy's mother, who constantly condemns the evils of the decadent lifestyle, ably ""freaking out"" even the most notorious of rock cronies through just one phone call, and delivering arguably the film's best line, ""rock stars have kidnapped my son"".  However, like any film with a child as its central protagonist, its success hinges on the casting of Billy, and Patrick Fugit, as awkward and geeky as he is charming and intellectual, and as un-cool as he is an anomaly, certainly doesn't let proceedings down here.Whether or not you understand the in-jokes and references that relate to this period of the ""death of rock'n'roll"" (as Bangs refers to it) in early 1970s America, there are still enough humorous moments for even the most novice of music lovers to enjoy.  Although admittedly you will get even more out of it the more knowledge you come to the film with.  Needless to say one can imagine some aging crinkly haired rocker sitting in a cinema somewhere complaining about its lack of true authenticity (Peter Frampton was used as a technical consultant as well as having a cameo role so it should be pretty close to the real deal!).  Despite such predictable quibbles, it's an original concept for a major Hollywood studio movie, and a brave one too, and for this it should be applauded.",Almost Famous

More attention should have been paid to the Band Aids.  Even the pivotal character Penny Lane is left without any personal history, which just left me wondering if she was anything more than a plot device and a cheap nipple shot. 
The focus of the film is the fantasy fulfillment of 15 year old boys.  Like such fantasies their is not much substance - the writer doesn't spend any time writing, and we hear none of his prose which is raved about so much in the script, the kid gets ""deflowered"" by three nymphets who ""rape"" him.The script is more or less a series of one liners and punch line situation comedy episodes - the terrifying plane journey, the acid trip party etc etc.I am sure many will compare this to Boogie Nights, as it has the same episodic pacing.

I currently have voted for 909 titles, and have only given out 25 10's.)  If you get the opportunity to see the directors cut of this movie, do yourself a great favor and do so.  It adds incredible depth to the characters.   When I saw this originally, I found Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) to be one of the least interesting characters in it, however the directors cut gives her character much needed depth.  She comes across as someone who truly wants to escape her ""persona"" of Penny, and just return to a normal life.  She is unable to do so, as the pulls of peer pressure and love keep her going.Many of the other performances in this movie are as good as they get. Patrick Fugit has a breakout performance as William, the lead character. It is interesting to watch his evolution from a little boy to a man.  Watch for the transformation in his character's mood after the scene, about halfway through the movie, where he loses his virginity.  Wonderfully performed, as was his conflict to do the right thing, while still learning.Frances McDormand pulls off a near-perfect performance as Williams over-protective and over-bearing mother, who goes through the turmoil of realizing that her children have grown beyond her care.  Don't overlook Jason Lee, whose turn as lead singer Jeff Bebe is well played as well.Cameron Crowe, the director, controls the mood of this movie in such a way that you are always interested.  Humor and drama are well-woven.  For every valley, there is an accompanying peak that pulls you along.

332,lil_mexx31,Classic. Great Blend of music and storytelling!!!,10,19 February 2010,"""Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous"" holds a special place in my film collection. With memorable performances and a kick-ass soundtrack, Almost Famous is a perfect blend of music and storytelling.Anytime you have Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin on a soundtrack, its always going to be good. However any film can have good music, but if the plot is crap (""Feel The Noise"") then the film as a whole is shi**y. ""Almost Famous"" is NOT. The plot is about a high school boy who is given the chance to write a story for Rolling Stone Magazine about an up-and-coming rock band as he accompanies it on their concert tour. It sounds simple, but nonetheless original. With a director like Cameron Crowe you know its good, in this case, Its a classic and perhaps one of the best films of that decade.The cast as a whole did a great job in adapting to their characters. All were very convincing and honest. Roles such as the ""groupies"" could have easily been over-exaggerated and vague but were handled very well, among them, Kate Hudson. Kate's performance as the wildly entertaining groupie ""Penny Lane"" is probably the greatest of her career. She was Charismatic, Sexy and Vulnerable all in one. Other memorable performances come from Patrick Fugit who plays the films main protagonist William Miller or should i say, ""The Enemy"". All in all a spectacular job by the cast as a whole. This film has been a huge part of my life.I first saw this film back in 2001 when i was 12. Was a huge fan of music, especially hiphop. However after watching ""Almost Famous"", instantly i became a fan of music from the 60s/70s era. As a 12 year old then, i never knew the likes of Black Sabbath, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Brenton Wood, Smokey Robinson or even Led Zeppelin. Never knew how MUCH BETTER music was in that golden era. This film completely changed my perspective on music. Im a still a hiphop fan, but none of that compares to Jimi's Purple Haze entrance. Since this film, my whole mindset has been on producing music. Today, im in my sophomore year at University studying music theory, composition and production. That is how much impact this film has had on me. Overall, its probably my favourite movie.",Almost Famous
333,naun,Almost,7,24 March 2001,"This is an appealing film, and the main source of its appeal is, I suspect, nostalgia for the period it depicts on the part of people who were there. But I think there's a conflict between this rose-tinted view of the past and the film's artistic aims. The tagline gives it away: ""Experience it. Enjoy it. Just don't fall for it."" It's obvious that, in addition to reliving the good times, the director also wants to depict the moral and artistic compromise his characters slide into. But the film pulls its punches here. (** SPOILER ALERT **) Take the scene where a record company rep makes a pitch to the group and tells them they need new management. For a moment it looks as if they are going to have to choose between their new management and their existing manager, who is one of the group. But then, in one easy sentence, the film dodges the issue: the rep tells them they don't have to ditch him. (** END SPOILER ALERT **)There are other key scenes, notably another act of betrayal late in the film involving several of the main characters, which just don't make the emotional gut impact that they should.You could argue that such serious sentiments would be out of place in what is, after all, a comedy. The trouble is, the film does raise them, and then it looks the other way. I would like to think that the film's comedy could have been sharper if it had also been more honest. In a way, it comes across as a comfortable middle-aged view of youth, not exactly forgetful of its torments and wildness but recollecting them in tranquillity.
Part of the problem is that Billy Crudup, as the group's leader, doesn't really succeed in bringing out the conflict in his character. I'm not sure that he managed to do more than veer between middle-class niceness and sheepishness. Good as she is, I don't find Kate Hudson's to be quite the starmaking performance that her supporters say it is either. Perhaps the comparison is unfair, but my mind went back to what Liza Minnelli did with an in some ways similar role in Cabaret. There's a lot to enjoy in the smaller roles and incidental scenes.

It was the age of rock music. A young man (15), that is brought up in a good family (here and there life has its own surprises), sees the world through clear glasses. This honesty he wants to use in his writing for Rolling Stone magazine. The soundtrack bombards us with Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple. The bands that still inspire rock to exist. The cast is just superb. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a few more minutes on the Director's Cut of Almost Famous that's titled: Untitled. See that one and then judge yourselves. Just love the way Crowe directed the movie and Jason Lee (Mall rats) played the lead singer of Stillwater. There's no way you can explain rock... Maybe Pete Townsend. But that's ok.",Almost Famous
337,Queen_of_Convenience,"Bravo, Mr. Crowe",10,8 June 2002,"Wow. It takes a wonderful director to make possibly 2 of the best films I've ever seen (the other is Vanilla Sky). Cameron Crowe is a genius in my eyes. It takes a world of talent to do what he's done. Not only do I love this movie because it had a great plot, but it's about the one thing my life revolves around - rock & roll. When I saw this movie for the first time in the theater, October 7, 2000, I stared in awe at the records young William pulled out from under his bed. Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, the Who, all of these wonderful bands that rocked my world also rocked William's world. I feel that choosing Patrick Fugit to play William was a smart move. He has a boyish appearance, yet he's very mature for his age. Now, I realized something later on after I'd seen both Vanilla Sky and this film - Noah Taylor, who plays Edmund Ventura in Vanilla Sky, also plays the band's manager. Going from a crude, wordy manager to the mysterious Ventura proves that Taylor is an extrordinary actor. I think he's one of the best I've seen. I recommend this film to anyone willing to have a good time and hear some good music.",Almost Famous

Yes, there are some tense scenes before the movie arrives at its deeply satisfying (and happy) conclusion but the way everything is presented just kept alive this warm fuzzy feeling I had throughout while following the band on their tour.The contrast between the innocent teenager William (aspiring writer for a music mag) and the Rock Stars (plus the not so innocent teenager Penny) is stark but William seems to stand all tests by following his instincts and believing in his ideals. I found watching this extremely intriguing.I also liked the plot twists that _really_ caught me off guard. There is a scene in an airplane that might seem a little bit over the top with its strong overacting and shameless use as a plot device but I found it so effective (and quite unique) that I thought a film that can get away with a scene like this is obviously very well made.Overall, this gets points for good acting, music and presentation, and above all for the pleasant, lasting afterglow it left.8/10",Almost Famous

344,Tomrad,How autobiographical is it?,8,14 March 2001,"I'm just curious, as the buzz-word seems to be ""semi-autobiographical"".
This film seems to be a mish-mash of realistic scenes and stuff just chucked in for a laugh. Since the lines between the two are so blurred, it makes me doubt the possibility of a lot of it happening.Just because it's ""semi-autobiographical"", does that give Cameron Crowe the right to make a rambling film? It doesn't know whether it's a documentary, a romance, or a comedy and is unable to merge any of them successfully so we get a scene or two of each all the way along.
Having said that, there are some very witty parts - good enough to get my sparsely populated auditorium echoing with laughter and some very touching moments - though not usually romantic ones.A high point is Kate Hudson's deservedly Oscar-nominated performance as well as the fact that she's possibly the most beautiful thing ever to walk this earth.
My rating: 8/10:Worth seeing, but definitely not worth the #53 spot (correct at time of writing) it currently occupies.

Avoiding the main contemporary conventions of too-bitter irony and too-sweet treacle, he presents a semi-autobiographical story that works on every level.Crowe's interviews with the great Billie Wilder are presenting a remarkable return on time invested; every rule of strong screenwriting that they came up with is put into practice here. (And making the debt plain to see, a key late scene of the movie  is a clear homage to The Apartment, Crowe's favourite Wilder flick.)A deep knowledge of rock and roll may enrich the experience of this movie, but isn't a prerequisite. Rock geeks, however, who adore critics as much as the bands they write about will love this movie, especially seeing Lester Bangs brought to life as a sloppy, ranting, mad genius.Excellent acting all around, unwavering direction and a superbly crafted screenplay.

347,jfmvp,"""Almost"" is More Than Enough for Me",10,25 March 2009,"Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" is a truly delightful film. The performances are strong, the direction is outstanding, and it makes us feel. It makes us care. About the characters, about the story, and life in general.The glistening gem of the movie is Kate Hudson, in what is easily the best role of her up-and-down, somewhat disappointing acting career. Hudson's Penny Lane is at times simply cute, at other times downright sexy -- but above all, she's ceaselessly intriguing. We fall in love with her as the film progresses, just as William Miller does, and Russell Hammond already has.The band at the heart of the story, Stillwater, is a blast to keep up with. As time progresses, we follow, laugh at, and make note of their exploits...just as William does. There's the entertaining leading man controversy, the drama with the so-called ""Band-Aids,"" and William's repeated attempts to get Russell to sit down for a one-on-one interview. Our hero fails to do so, until it really matters.This is the best work of Crowe's career. I'm certainly a fan of ""Jerry Maguire,"" another film of his with heart and a soul-stroking conclusion, but ""Almost Famous"" is a full step above. There are a number of memorable scenes and sequences in this lovable film, but two, in particular, stand out above the rest: (1) When William tells Penny that Russell sold her to Humble Pie for $50 and a case of beer.Here, Hudson shines, physically (in the light) and metaphorically. Crowe sets the scene on a beautiful day, a day in which Penny and William are strolling arm-and-arm through the park. When William hits her with the potentially earth-shattering news, Crowe shows why he's exceptional -- he builds the emotion of the moment with lighting, until we see a tear drip from Penny's eye at exactly the right moment...It's at that point, we see an angel. We know what Crowe is going for, and he executes it perfectly. Penny manages to remain cute and graceful in a time of intense internal turmoil.And (2) When William and Penny part ways at the airport.It's a scene we've seen a million times before in a million other movies, but here, it's masterfully done. It's a perfect sequence.Our stomach turns for William, who is forced to watch his first love fly away from him...maybe forever. Those of us who have been through similar circumstances feel that sinking feeling in our bellies.The music is spot-on. Each chord strikes at exactly the right time. All we can think is...""Damn. Why couldn't I direct a movie this good?"" Oh well. Having had the pleasure to see ""Almost Famous,"" I'm happy enough. What an uplifting experience.",Almost Famous
348,teacherlogan,A Wonderful Journey of Classic Rock and Classic Film Making,10,20 February 2007,"Almost Famous is a semi-autobiographical work by Cameron Crowe. It follows a young boy, living out his dream to cover a rock band on the road for Rolling Stone magazine. Being raised by a conservative mother, he watches his defiant older sister leave home. He is drawn to his sister's music and out of that medium; he becomes a conisurer and critic. His experience, like the film, is a magical mystery tour of sight and sound that grips us from the first moment and does not let go. William's role as a music writer becomes the central theme of the film. Upon joining the band, Stillwater, William must struggle with a developing friendship with the musicians (and Band Aids) and his responsibility to be truthful to the project. He is, after all, ""the enemy"". At some points, we forget that. Of course, that's the point. That gray area provides the conflict, mostly internal. Can he write an accurate account of the life of a band on the road? Imagine the exploits of a rock band on the road and his dilemma is easily understood.As with all Cameron Crowe's films, the music is as important to the development of the story as any of its characters. The classic rock songs that are integrated into the fabric of the film add ambiance and passion to scenes. They make you remember moments as clearly as the characters' dialog and actions. Elton John's Tiny Dancer becomes the theme song for reconciliation. I, personally, will never hear that song again without remembering the tour bus scene. It is at that moment that William becomes a part of their family. The line between journalism and groupie is crossed. The song Tiny Dancer leads the way.Almost Famous succeeds in creating a web of minor characters around the protagonist, William. The best of these is Lester Bangs, a retired(?) music critic. He teaches William words like ""think piece"" to keep his editors interested. He has been in the music business a long time. He is encouraging, yet real. He does not sugar coat what the music world is like, or what it takes to be a successful critic. I think that Phillip Seymour Hoffman is one of the most talented actors working today. Rarely is he the central character in films; Capote notwithstanding. Nevertheless, his role is never forgotten. In poor films, he can steal the scenes. In great films like Almost Famous, he adds just what is needed. In Almost Famous, William needs someone to push him to follow his dream. He doesn't get that at home from his mother and there is no father figure. Lester Bangs will never be confused with a father figure, but he doesn't need to be. He is the person William needs to tell him it's alright to be a music critic; as long as he stays a critic. Hoffman delivers this role with delicacy and power.Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand received Oscar nominations. Well deserved. Billy Crudup has never been better. Every other peripheral character was crucial. But the film does not function unless Patrick Fugit can convince the audience that, behind William's youth and innocence, there exists a true and honest journalist. He is a prodigy. We don't expect someone of his age to be able to handle the life of a band on the road. We know he's book smart; he graduates high school without attending class for the final few months. But the music world is a cut-throat business. He will learn things on the road that no text book or class room can teach him. Can he withstand the influences of sex,drugs and alcohol and emerge the idealistic young writer he was when he started this journey? We root for him, because he is still a kid. He is innocent in a world that is not. He is principled in a world that is debased. How he will emerge keeps us watching to the end. And then, once the credits have rolled, we watch again. Not to see how it ends, but this time, to appreciate the journey. And it is a wonderful journey.",Almost Famous

However Cameron Crowe turned his interesting youth experiences in a nostalgic sugary, family film. Which would be expected from a dreamworks picture. Ironic to see that the commercialisation of rock music in the film turned out to be OK. While for the film itself it isn't.

The film is filled with amazing performances from a young cast. Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup (in a role intended for Brad Pitt) are particularly memorable as they channel unbelievable energy and meaning to Crowe's words. I can't say enough about Crowe's film-making... It's so real and personal. He has absolute affection for all of his characters and it shows through in the writing. There is a disarming innocence to this film (despite all the turbulence and decadence surrounding its setting) that can't be placed.

352,bhicks-2,perhaps not what some are expecting,10,13 October 2000,"Alot of the negative reviews for this movie are accusing ALMOST FAMOUS for sugar-coating what goes on behind the scenes of rock concerts and not showing more explicit and ugly use of drugs and groupies or ""band aids"" or whatever you define the young rock mistresses. This is true, the movie does. Why? Because that wasn't the point of the movie to begin with.    We've all heard the stories before, thanks to VH1. And I think Cameron Crowe's point was clearly set in the beginning, that this setting was taken place in the decline of rock and roll, where mammoth egos and publicity billings have gotten in the way of the music. It's one long party now, a self-manifested fantasy, and only a very few individuals (like Lester Bangs) can see through that.Besides, do we honestly expect graphic realism from a director like Cameron Crowe? The creator of FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH? Not to mention the guy who gave us SINGLES, SAY ANYTHING, and, oh God yes, the catch-phrase movie of all time JERRY MAGUIRE. I can honestly say I don't want to. That's all for another movie and another director. I loved this movie. And I'm planning to see it again. Why?

354,bunny_hater66,A Happy Ending?,9,7 October 2008,"I did like the film but it does have its moments that you also want to take an overdose. When ever I take into account something about the film it gets lower, screenplay excellent, music great, direction good, acting average and finally that immediate feeling after watching a film that you will remember  bad. Although it does gleam underneath its fairly average acting like the beautifully and original storyline that has probably influenced other music orientated film apart that aren't musicals. Although the acting was average Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup stole the show. Frances McDormand is amazing and well-cast as Elaine the Mom, someone so wrapped up in creating a safe, healthy environment she drives both her children far away from home. Billy Crudup & Kate Hudson create the tension filled romance that drives the story along; both did a great job & were adroitly evocative of those fast times in the rock & roll fantasy land of the 70's. Billy, as Russell Hammond, teeters on the edge of fame, not wanting to leave his long-suffering band mates behind. He carries William through the whirlwind of emotions and music along with him, showing him a world that is desperate and lonely. The dialogue is slightly memorable such as 'You are home.' Which makes your believe that William will stay on the bus for good Seeing that the film is supposed to be rock 'n' roll why didn't sex and drugs appear a lot, although the censorship is a 15 and would probably of been given a higher certificate if what I feel should have been involved a lot more, sure not everyone wants too see two people in wigs humping but at least have more drugs in it maybe actually showing the drugs being used instead of just the after effects, 'I'm a golden god.' With the film I felt like nearly scene would have been a great ending such as Little Dancer bus singing with the line' You are home', the overdose scene would have been a great ending as the audience wouldn't know what happens to Lane and even the chasing of the plane. Although these would have been a great endings there would still be a lot unsolved but every time I thought it would end I actually didn't care what would happen to William and his Rolling Stones feature. I was disappointed about the ending but at least everything was sweet and perfect the film had quite a dark side that evaporated after Russell lying to Rolling Stone about what really happened. But Lanes dream comes true 'One flight to Morocco please.' And forgetting her glasses was a great scene the framing and shot angle. And even though fame is supposed to bring you joy and your dreams, a girl who is not famous feels the joys of life and her dream happening. Almost Famous does have its overdose of blandness but is an all round good film and a very good feel good movie.",Almost Famous
355,ezr2061,"Growing Up is Hard, Even for Rock Stars",7,2 July 2013,"I really did love this movie when it first came out. Maybe it was because the soundtrack is comprised of some of my all time favorite music. Or maybe it's because it played so directly, so nakedly at that semisecret part of me that desperately longed to be included in the beautiful, hip, happening crowd - to be famous. A couple years later I watched it again on video and I was surprised at how it now seemed somewhat glib and shallow and even smug - not nearly as genuine or sincere as when I had first encountered it. And now it's nearly a decade later and I just caught it on late night TV, and yes, I did again find it to be emphatically melodramatic and undeniably manipulative and almost sickly sweet at key moments, but it also somehow still managed to be very fun, and heartwarming, and absolutely irresistible. Though this musical morality tale may at times be a bit maudlin for my tastes there are enough admirable, clever, wonderful elements to make it well worth recommending. The acting is all consistently above average, with Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond, the charismatic guitarist of a rock band on the cusp of fame. Crudup projects a potently serene if inscrutable presence which nicely compliments the more emotionally transparent energy of Jason Lee as Jeff Bebe, the proud front man who grows increasingly insecure at the prospect of being eclipsed by Russell's rapidly ascending star status. The lovely and luminous Kate Hudson is adorable and even believable as a blissfully carefree, faithful, self deluding groupie. Witnessing all the backstage depravity and shenanigans is a wide eyed, ridiculously prepubescent, aspiring Rolling Stone journalist, William Miller, whose cherubic face unexpectedly works to his advantage in opening doors and gaining confidences. A young but sophisticated Zooey Deschanel appears briefly as William's caring older sister. Francis McDormand as William's comically protective mother perhaps steals the show. She is a force of nature able to flatten any and all opposition as she fiercely battles to preserve her sweet boy's innocence. The film is based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's personal experience as a teenage reporter on assignment for the preeminent music magazine when he traveled for a time with the then monstrously out sized and now fabled Led Zeppelin tour. The subject of this film is not so much the well documented, much hyped excesses of the rock star lifestyle - though the debauched, lurid recklessness is prominently on display - but more so the often difficult and painful process by which exuberant, naive youth passes into subdued, cynical maturity. Russel Crowe explores the curious phenomenon of our culture where the artists whose music so compellingly expresses the pain and regret and sorrow of our maturation are so often the people who for myriad reasons are the least equipped or willing to face this natural challenge. Pop musician are trapped in a state of arrested development, their rejection of traditional social behaviors and their intense self obsession is highly rewarded, and their impulsive momentary pleasures dominate their life choices. It's a devious irony that these revered cultural icons are frequently the ones who least benefit from their own insights, and by prolonging their own adolescences they often imperil their own well being, sometimes mortally. Crowe is fascinated by the curious paradox whereby the art and entertainment and music which we embrace in our youth is so often created by people with whom we, in fact, share very little in common.But the music is what it's all about, or at least it should be. Music transcends time and space, and expresses everything so much more beautifully and deeply and directly than any other medium, even a film. As captivating or hypnotic or mesmerizing as a film may be a film invariably is an inferior experience to great music, and sadly the compelling soundtrack is too often overwhelmed or obliterated by the artifice of the film's cinematic devices. The pure integrity of the music is undermined by the dramatic scene cutting and intrusive editing which repeatedly decapitates and lacerates fantastic background songs. Sometimes the most formidable barrier to a film's excellence is the director's own ego fueled impulses. If this film had depended more confidently on the sublime power of its evocative musical score and resisted the temptation to overplay the drama it would absolutely have been a considerably more profound and satisfying experience. Russel Crowe certainly understands that great music may compel us to want to intently examine the private lives of the musical artists - to want to dissect so clinically that with which we are so enthralled - but at least Crowe wisely refrains from attempting to define and label all of the mysterious, peculiar, vague emotions that the film explores. William's confused, conflicted, unresolved feelings for the supremely attractive people who inhabit the bizarre, depraved, exhilarating music world are very much our own confused, conflicted, unresolved feelings. Ultimately William's (and Crowe's) privileged position as an intimately trusted, precocious voyeur is what informs nearly every scene with a bittersweet, gentle, sad truth. Almost Famous, in the end, redeems itself. If in adulthood we can somehow preserve even a scrap of our childhood enthusiasms then that truly is a victory of epic proportions deserving of our highest accolades. And if we manage this rare and special achievement with something like our dignity or possibly even our ideals intact, well, are we then anything less than Golden Gods?",Almost Famous

My biggest issue with the movie is that its characters, excluding the boy, aren't very likable. Therefore, it's hard to care about what happens to them or what they care about as the characters.

Almost Famous pushed my romantic vision of my parents' era over the top. It took more time and several more viewings over the years for me to fully appreciate how sweet the movie really is. It's not only a part of Cameron Crowe's life, but it's also a love letter to a time and more importantly, to music.Yes, some of the melodramatic pontificating about the ""power of music"" can come across as sappy or cheesy. But if you really, really love music, I think the sentiment is all that matters. It's a story of youth, artistic freedom, ego, family, music and innocence.Main points:
1. Incredible soundtrack
2. Superb acting from the entire (ensemble) cast. There's not a weak performance, younger or older.
3. Billy Crudup convincingly plays guitar - bad pantomiming in movies always makes me uncomfortable. Kinda like if you've ever cursed yourself with a cigarette addiction and you see someone who clearly doesn't smoke, not inhale in a movie. How dare you pretend to do something I've practiced for several years.I love this movie and I revisit it often.",Almost Famous

What am I missing? I'm an old rock and roller from the 60's and still live in the past always playing and collecting 50's, 60's, 70's and some 80's rock and roll, but this movie doesn't get it for me. It's cheesy, predictable and boring. I feel like stopping it halfway through, but I'll tough it out and see what's so great. Don't judge me harshly, for I dig movies about rock and its history, but this...? I just don't get it. Enlighten me, please. The ""rock stars"" are flat, the decadence of rockers, the mom and son relationship are all stereotyped and, of course, the drugs, booze and sex are gratuitous, but I guess what else can I expect from a movie about ""rock and roll."" Maybe I'm a dinosaur because I don't subscribe to Rolling Stone magazine anymore, either. I think I'll watch ""Backbeat."" The past has passed me by.",Almost Famous

I also love when less known actors get to star in a big movie.  Nice.  However when I saw the film finally, I was disappointed, even bored at parts.  The acting is very good and the movie is very beautiful at times, I felt that even though it was based on a true story, it was lacking real emotion in the writing.  I may be wrong too, I have a habit for getting myself psyched up over movies and then being disappointed, such as what happened to everyone with SW Episode One.  The ending of the film is very predictable and seemed out of balance with the rest of the film.  I won't spoil it for those that want to waste money on such a mediocre film.

It is without a doubt the best film that I have seen all year and I write this at the end of September. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.  It has without a doubt the best screenplay of the year, simply because everything rings true, every word, every scene. Cameron Crowe has succeeded in making long hair, drug loving rock stars, into people that you would want to meet and get to know.  Having just seen the film perhaps is not the best time to write this, simply because there is too much Almost Famous running through my brain, but seriously I can't think of one moment that wasn't worth sitting through, because this is exactly the sort of film that makes the movie going experience all worth while. An inexperienced youth travels the road with an up and coming band, who are really lambs in wolf's clothing, and along the way we meet people that we really get to like.  None of them come off as phony or stuck up, perhaps because it was all set before the stuck up era that we now live in, and that is the absolute forte of Almost Famous.  It's set in a time when we all remember (who are of age) as being innocent and fun. Congratulations.",Almost Famous

The actors do a superb job, and the story is beautifully told, and just funny enough to keep it from being over-emotional. Jason Lee, Billy Crudup and Frances McDormand are magnificent, and Kate Hudson is stunning. Even the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jimmy Fallon excel in what would normally seem to be simply sidekick roles. If you're old, you'll love the music. If you're young, you'll love the music.

368,vdecaire,Another one that's from the heart.,8,26 March 2008,"There are few music-based films that really strike the right chord with me. But there is something about Cameron Crowe's magnificent (And Oscar-winning) screenplay, the performances from the four leads-Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the two Academy Award nominated supporting characters Frances Mcdormand and Kate Hudson.The plot is simple yet complex. A young boy named Will Miller (Patrick Fugit) who has aspirations higher then contended by his over-protective mother, to write about music for the Rolling Stone magazine. He was raised in a little suburbia that was home to him and his mother for his entire life, and when the sister left, she obviously left behind some of her music-loving necessities behind. Prior sending reviews on music to several magazines, his mentor and friend Lester Bangs (Hoffman) teaches him the art of appreciating music and teaching him what it really is and what the significance of it is. Rolling Stone magazine gets ear of the articles held in high acclaim by their magazines, and decides to get the writer to work for them. Without ever meeting the fifteen-year-old boy, they send him with an objective to a concert to write about a new band: ""Stillwater"", led by the guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). After meeting a cute girl (Hudson) that seems to like him, she gets him backstage to meet with the band, and find out that him and the group of gals are invited on the road to go on tour. There he faces the drama and consequences of music and the downfalls of being young, and surrounded by people physically and mentally older then you. The boy is shy as it is, and considering the group he's with, who frequently party, smoke pot and hassle Will when he is on the phone with his concerned mother, their plans keep changing and avoiding the interview with Will at all costs. But a trip with a rowdy group actually turns into an odyssey of enlightenment and discovery for young Will. And when he is not being snubbed by the band-accept from Russell- he is losing the battle for the girl who he grows rather fond of. Will discovers many things about a lot of things, but he really discovers that the group he is with, only does their work because of their love for music, and nothing else. And Russell is a better person then he appears, as he learns as the story progresses. What I really like is the hassle that it is for the band to take Will seriously. The scene in which the band believes that their plane is going down, and they apologize to each other is touching, and when one of them admits that he is gay, and that very second the plane levels out, that is funny. Cameron Crowe scored with the screenplay for this and Jerry Maguire, but the autobiographical rock music style of the film makes it a wonder for fans of that genre, and a delight for people who would appreciate the potent and exuberant tellings of this tale of the 70's at it's wildest, and then at it's most benevolent. Funny.",Almost Famous
369,PennyLANE77,"Not almost, but completely perfect",10,23 June 2003,"Cameron Crowe sets out to recapture the times of his youth with this semi-biographical movie. The result is a perfect hit with script, actors, sets and soundtrack just reaching an out-of-this-world level. This is coming from someone who wasn't even alive in the 1970's but still has this weird feeling that Almost Famous is the closest anyone can come to reliving or experiencing it. Unlike other rock n' roll road movies like Spinal Tap, it's obvious that Crowe hasn't made a comedy. The film is to be taken dead seriously as a coming of age story and a sincere homage to the rock music of the day. The soundtrack alone makes the film worth seeing. It's a who's who of 70's rock that attaches itself to the heart of your inner musical catalog.",Almost Famous
370,The_BIGGEST_Critic,yaaaawwwwwnnn,3,23 May 2002,"You people MUST be kidding.This movie was a snore-a-thon! I heard so much about it so I decided to rent it on DVD. Patrick Fugit was a good lead for this movie, but he spent most of his time just looking at everything with the same look of ""wonder"", whether it be a pretty girl or a plate of food...not the greatest acting.Kate Hudson was serviceable, but the director spent an AWFUL lot of time in the first half of the movie doing close-up face shots of Patrick and Kate instead of advancing the story...I guess he was fascinated by these two actors.The atmosphere of the movie was great. Having lived in a rock-and-roll environment in the early 70's it was kinda fun to be taken back to that era.
However, in the end, that's not enough reason to give the film such high marks as it's gotten. It was very slow to develop, too much time was spent on atmosphere and not enough on story. The movie was only watchable from the ""airplane incident"" on.Sheesh, people sure are quick to jump on a bandwagon and give a very mediocre film undeserved credit.I'd give this one a pass.James",Almost Famous

It is worse than bad, it is disturbing. This movie represents everything that is wrong with society. And No, i'm not talking about the sex, drugs and rock and roll element. Lets look at the bigger picture by first of all reviewing the basic plot. A youth dreams of being a writer and following around a rock band. This dream comes true which brings about  encounters with roadies,sex with roadies, drugs with roadies and rock and roll with roadies. Now, to the logical mind, this plot would sound like something you would find in a hollywood trash can. But, to the macdonalds eating, nike wearing, gap buying corporate brainwashed citizens of the Americas, this sounds like ""the best movie ever made."" I don't mean to insult anybody but I do expect people to start thinking on a higher level. With a let down ending, a sappy, meaningless story, (that caters to people who think nsync is great music)Crowe manages to create an unheroic and inferior movie which is perfect for a society that doesn't bother looking for anything better.Almost Famous, Almost Friends, Almost Britney Spears, call it what you will but I call it a cataract.Maybe these comments don't sit well with people, but do keep in mind they were well thought out and have a right to be seen.",Almost Famous

The petty squabbles, the drinking, the bitching, the drinking, the trying to get laid without your girlfriend finding out.A rights of passage tale with a fifteen year old hanging around with a rock band who behave with less maturity than he does and a number of groupies his age who have the trials of stardom etched into their actions without the celebrity or fame.Patrick Fugit is great as the intelligent but naive youngster who scores the big break of writing the cover article for Rolling Stone and the reliable Jason Lee is once again reliable as the ego-craving-often-snubbed lead singer.Its a feel good movie that does the job. A comedy that gets the laughs.",Almost Famous
375,Brodie_500,"Soft-centred, but in a good way",7,12 November 2001,"'Almost Famous' is supposed to be writer-director Cameron Crowe's pet project. Crowe had a great love and respect for 60s rock'n'roll, and as a 15-year-old boy, he began writing for 'Rolling Stone' magazine, and thus meeting many stars and bands of rock'n'roll. In 'Almost Famous', we follow William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit), who, in trying to get a story for Rolling Stone, meets rock band 'Stillwater' - a band that are themselves 'almost famous'. He strikes a strong friendship with good-looking guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup), but is less popular with the jealous lead singer (Jason Lee). William also meets radiant 'band-aid' Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and her group of colourful friends (including Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin), who take William under their wing and introduce him to the rock'n'roll lifestyle. As days go by, he still hasn't got an interview, despite having toured with the band and the girls through many different states, all the while his protective but loving mother (Frances McDormand) worries herself silly, in the belief that her son 'has been kidnapped by rock stars'.'Almost Famous' is a fine example of 'a feel-good film'. That is a tag that many directors and writers will probably dread, as it has connotations of cloying sentimentality and little else. Crowe, however, should take it a different way. He steers clear of such mawkishness (well... he slips a little near the end, but not too much), and while his personal love for the project is blindingly obvious, it is never a problem. It is self-indulgent, but not in a masturbatory way. It's self-indulgence that can still be indulged in by many others. There are a number of strengths in this film. The soundtrack is what first comes to mind. Excellent songs that are perfectly suited to the scenes they are in - and I'm way to young too like them in a nostalgic way. Another key strength is the acting. Crowe has got an excellent ensemble here. The main four all shone: Billy Crudup was very engaging as Russell, Frances McDormand was perfect (as she most often is), Kate Hudson's performance was eloquent and bright (if a little overrated) and Patrick Fugit's inexperience was apparent but suited his character -he has potential, and is very reminiscent to Tobey Maguire in this. Another impressive (although small) performance was Zooey Deschanel as Patrick sister; she made her reunion with her mother very funny. Everyone else was good value too, most notably Fairuza Balk and Philip Seymour Hoffman as William's 'uncool' music-critic mentor. As far as direction goes, there is nothing very remarkable in Crowe's direction, but it is still a solid and well-crafted piece. His writing is very witty and the narrative flows well, and Crowe creates some strong characters. A lot of people will find 'Almost Famous' too cosy and cute, and if you dislike nice neat happy endings, you should stay away. Having said that, the main romance does not follow that which is typical to such warm-hearted films - there is certainly no tragedy, but it didn't fall into my expectations.In conclusion, 'Almost Famous' is a warm, uplifting movie, with bright acting and a funny script. Catch it in the right mood and you'll like it a lot. 8/10",Almost Famous
376,mojojojoap,Very rewarding to the viewer,10,25 December 2001,"I'll bet you're wondering how a film could possibly be rewarding to a viewer.  Well, I'll tell you how.  This film is so surreal, but if you know anything about it, you should know that it is loosely based on experiences had by Cameron Crowe as a boy. This fact in itself gives the movie enough plausibility for acceptance.  For women, it encourages reassurances that there are still good men out there. THey may be too young at the moment, but they're there. For everyone, at this low point in movie history, it allows us to see that there are still great movies being processed today.

It was easy to tell that Billy Crudup was likely sleeping on set half the time; his glazed over expression was predominant throughout.  Patrick Fugit was the only worthwhile part of the whole film.

379,blakelogsdon1,I was almost famous but Jake Gyllenhaal blew me off,8,1 January 2015,"Almost Famous is an awe-inspiring story about a young high school boy who goes on a long trek with an up-and-coming rock band to write a story on them for Rolling Stone magazine. The film is full of emotion, fantastic music, and rich pop culture references. Although the main character hangs out with the cool and gnarly rock band, occasionally scoring mad chicks and such, he quickly learns that he will never be one of them. He picks up on this important lesson because he knows in his heart that he is not cool and never will be cool.This lesson was very relatable to a certain point in my life. I was about 22 years old, living in Montana working as a gas station clerk. Suddenly one day, this hot bodacious male makes his way up to the counter and begins to flirt with me. He looked familiar, but I just assumed he was one of the guys I had made out with in my various black out drunken escapades at the local homosexual bar in town. This dude was really coming on to me, though, and I was hitting the ball back to him. He invited me to meet him in the gas station bathroom, so I told my boss I was taking my lunch break and went to join him. It got hot and heavy immediately. We had no time for formalities. I only had 20 minutes for my lunch, and I was going to get it. About 10 minutes into it, I could tell he was hooked. Then again, no man hasn't been after he got a helping of my sweet sexual nectar. He whispered in my ear that he loved me. I told him that was ridiculous; we didn't even know each other's names. Then the words that ultimately had the power to change my life were uttered from his mouth. He replied, ""My name's Jake Gyllenhaal. What's yours?"" After I heard those words, everything clicked. That was why he was so familiar. He was the leading man in such flicks as Donnie Darko, Jarhead, Zodiac, and the ultimate crap storm The Day After Tomorrow. Also remember him in that movie Brokeback Mountain. Well, he made out with me with more intensity than all of the scenes with him and Heath Ledger together combined. Once I learned he was an A-list actor in Hollywood, I quickly jumped at the opportunity to tell him my name. If it was anyone else, I would have used my fake alternate identity of Dick Lopez that I give to strangers. I wanted him to take me away, show me off to his famous and hot Hollywood actor friends, and maybe get my acting career started (I played the main rat Remy in a theater production of the film Ratatouille at my high school). I told him we should move to California and get hitched immediately. When I said that though, his face changed. It went from like aroused and intense to just slightly aroused and somewhat panicked. He said, ""Um yeah sure. That'll definitely happen."" There was something different in his voice, though. I could tell he was hiding something. There's nothing my man could keep secret from me. But I decided to let it go because I realized my break time was over.I told him I had to get back to my clerk job, but I gave him my home phone number for him to use to contact me. I told him that we should meet up at the local barbecue joint for a nice date when I got off of my shift. He said that was a lovely idea, and that he would meet me there. I felt elated. I had finally reeled in a rich, handsome actor fiancé. Once I finished my shift, I made my way over to Big Bubba's Belly Bustin' Barbecue Bliss. Jakey wasn't there yet, though, so I waited for him to make it. After the first hour, I just assumed he was busy and running late. After the second hour, I became scared, believing something horrible must have happened to him. After the third hour, I was still scared. After the fourth hour, though, I realized that he had stood me up.How could I even think that Jake Gyllenhaal could be proud of me? He never truly loved me. He just wanted me for my hot bod. He was no different than all of the other guys. That day is the day I learned the same lesson the main character of Almost Famous learns. Even though I was making out with a sexy Hollywood actor in a smelly gas station bathroom, I would never be on his level. He was better than me in every way, and everyone knew it from the beginning except me. How could I be so foolish?I'm sorry to end this review on a sad note, but who should really be to blame is Jake Gyllenhaal. Oh, but um, this movie is a fantastic film. Really transports you to a different place. Just like Jake could have if he had agreed to marry me.Sincerely, Your friendly IMDb user blakelogsdon1",Almost Famous

The result is his best movie to date, with superb storytelling and memorable characters.As with Jerry McGuire, Crowe wisely chose a cast of mostly then-unknowns, who did a fine job of inhabiting their roles while keeping the focus on the plot. He deftly serves up sharp perceptions of both his generation and their parents without puncturing the sweetly nostalgic feel. Don't miss Billy Crudup and Patrick Fugit as the protagonists, Frances McDormand as the panicky professor-mother who suspects her rock journalist-son might be on drugs, or the terminally adorable Kate Hudson as the plot's little girl lost, Penny Lane.",Almost Famous

On his journey William (Patrick Fugit) finds love, laughter, friendship and a key to his future. Surrounded by such talent as Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Fugit plays well to their expertise.Some of McDormand's lines are most memorable with quotes from Guerta and lines such as ""I can't go on...Rockstars have kidnapped my son.""

It'sthe story of a kid (Crowe) who actually got to meet, hang out with,and write about his gods.  But it's also the story of the adult lookingback on that youth and pinching himself, unable to believe howlucky he was.The movie never comes out and shows us the adult looking back: it never moves beyond the ""present"" of the fifteen-year-old kid.  Butevery so often the action kind of fades away and the camerazeroes in on the kid's eyes, with their expression of wonder,passion, joy, and sadness, and in those moments it's as if thecamera speaks for the grown man, saying, good grief, I actuallymet these guys, I actually saw these things.  Could I have beenany more fortunate?It's that sense of joy, of exultation in the naive but still powerfulrock'n'roll ideal of limitless freedom and fun, that makes this filmso good.  If you've never felt about rock music the way Wayne,Garth, and Cameron Crowe feel, you might have a hard time withthis movie.  It kind of softpedals the addiction, greed, and overallnastiness of the rock business;  it tells its story completely andunapologetically within a milieu that's often ridiculed these days.But if you have felt that way, then you'll find the movie full ofmoments that ring true:  the adolescent dropping the needle onTommy for the first time, a bus full of people getting misty-eyedsinging along to an Elton John song, a rebellious teenagerthinking the lyrics of a song she loves can explain her to hermother, even Lester Bangs' insistence that the music is dying-- which really springs from a desperate belief in the life the musicrepresents.Some people used to say we should send a poet to the moon,somebody who could express the wonder we know we'd feel if wegot to go, but better than we could express it.

Page responded: ""Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time and I guess we did it with 'Stairway' . . . I don't think there are too many people who are capable of it. Maybe one. Joni Mitchell . . . she's able to look at something that's happened to her, draw back and crystallize the whole situation, then write about it."" Crowe, the writer and director of ""Almost Famous,"" finally created his own ""Stairway."" While, early in his screen writing career, he wrote a handful of quality scripts, such as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Say Anything,"" and ""Jerry Maguire,"" 25 years went by between his genesis as a professional writer and the release of his masterpiece. And, in order to create it, he referred to something Jimmy Page once told him about Joni Mitchell. Just as Page hailed Mitchell's songwriting ability, Crowe looked at something that happened to him, drew back and crystallized the whole situation with beauty, humor, and emotion.Patrick Fugit stars as William Miller, a fictionalized version of Crowe himself at the age of 15, in the early 1970s. His overbearing mother struggles to guide him into the field of law, but his passion for music and assistance from a successful rock journalist leads him down a very different path. Soon, he is hired by Ben Fong-Torres, an editor for Rolling Stone, to follow an up-and-coming band called Stillwater. William proceeds to, just as Crowe did, lose his virginity, hang out with celebrities, and fall in love while being initiated into the world of rock and roll.Fugit delivers a fantastic performance. It is remarkable that a teenager was able to pull of a performance of this caliber. His character comes off as an intelligent, likable young man and a role model surrounded by new temptations. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee deliver strong performances as two members of Stillwater, with Lee's character, Jeff, losing a battle to prevent Crudup's character, Russel, from taking over as star of the band. Meanwhile, Russel has a fling with the lovable but naive groupie (Kate Hudson) who goes by the name Penny Lane.At its core, ""Almost Famous"" is a story about the battle between two worlds. Penny frequently refers to ""the real world,"" and makes it quite clear that the world she currently inhabits isn't anything close to real. Each character has their own battle with accepting one world or the other, and this is an extremely important element in Crowe's portrait of society in the 1970s. The country is learning a new way of thinking, a new way of speaking, a new way of living. As a viewer, you are thrown into this world with the sights and sounds of the 70s. The music is fantastic, and while rock and roll is dominant, Crowe threw in Simon and Garfunkel as well as Cat Stevens.When the film is over, you are left with a feeling of elation but also remorse. ""Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle and a way of thinking,"" Jeff says, ""and it's not about money and popularity. Although, some money would be nice. But it's a voice that says, 'Here I am... and f*** you if you can't understand me.' And one of these people is gonna save the world. And that means that rock 'n' roll can save the world... all of us together. And the chicks are great."" The great irony is that Crowe spent most of his career writing about other people's lives. His masterpiece was achieved by writing about himself. I recommend this movie for anybody with a passion for music or film making. It could change your life. Almost.",Almost Famous
386,Jockey1,Great film...buy the Director's Cut DVD!,9,26 December 2003,"There are two things that make this film one of the best made in the last few years- characters and music.  I am personally not a big fan of 70s music, but it is used very well in this film, most of my favourite scenes are made all the more memorable by the music, which includes America (Simon & Garfunkel), Tiny Dancer, Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters (both Elton John), River (Joni Mitchell) Paranoid (Black Sabbath) and Feel Flows (The Beach Boys) Most of the actors and actresses in this film give the performance of their lives, Frances McDormand being especially comical as William's mother, and many of the best moments are all hers.  William himself has an endearing quality about him to the audience, and I'm surprised I haven't seen Patrick Fugit in any other films since this one. A great film, and the Directors Cut DVD is well worth the money, especially for those of you (like me) who had previously only watched the UK version.",Almost Famous

The dialogue, the story and the the music are individually excellent and added together ... sublime! The tiny dancer ( don't know it ....???

I could waffle on about all the film's great points, yet only by watching it will it actually mean what it is meant to.Fabulous script! - Amazing cast! Perfect .. watch it ... you will be amazed!! You will be loved......and you will love........Cameron Crowe, the one Hollywood director who seems to have a map of the human heart, has turned out some great films but this will be hard to top.

Never have I seen a movie that is so satisfying. The characters are amazing, especially Penny(Kate Hudson) and Elaine(Frances McDormand). It captures your attention until the credits are over. The best features of the film are the excellent directing by Crowe, the outstanding acting which is in my opinion the best ensemble cast in any movie, and the music. Any fan of great movies, cult classics, and 70's music will love this with all their hearts.What makes it different is how some parts are funny, some serious, and some touch your heart.

I can't find any flaws in this film, as everything rang true, for me. I was a subscriber to Trouser Press, Rolling Stone and Creem music magazines, back then. The acting is great, and we get great insight to the groupies...oops... I meant 'band-aids' and how they were treated. Peter Frampton did a great job as a consultant.

390,Wild Wil,Coming of Age - Mine wasn't this good,8,8 September 2000,"I love Cameron Crowe's movies.  Every one of them appeals to me on some level, so when I saw the trailers for this one, I was, naturally, excited. My only fear was that Almost Famous would be TOO auto-biographical. It's Not.Starting off in early 70's San Diego Almost Famous follows William Miller across the country as he travels with the ""hard working, above average"" rock band Stillwater, fronted by Jason Lee (late of every Kevin Smith movie), as the lead singer and Bill Crudup as the lead guitarist.  The trials and tribulations of a working rock band provide the background for a coming of age story that really works.  Kate Hudson is LUCIOUS as ""Penny Lane"", not a groupie, a ""Band-Aid"".  Anna Paquin is gorgeous and Fariuza Balk is properly white trash as fellow band aids.Not only do Stillwater's original songs shine, but the soundtrack, full of Elton John and the Who, and designed by Heart's Nancy Wilson (also Mrs. Crowe), is excellent.My recommendation - Go see it, you'll be glad you did.",Almost Famous
391,Jod-z,Cameron I love your love letter,10,21 February 2001,"Frances McDormand almost said it all when she told Cameron Crowe she liked his love letter.What a joy to see this movie. I laughed and I cried while I sang along.Cameron Crowe, in addition to inviting us into his life, and along on the dream journey of every rock fan, has written strong female characters brought brilliantly to life by the wonderful Frances McDormand and the mercurial Kate Hudson. The strength of the women does not detract from the wonderful portrayals of William, the band and the other male characters.Takes me back to repeat play on the record player and posters on the wall, can't wait to play it again.",Almost Famous
392,pgoggins,Love story,8,2 October 2000,"To me, the film was a love letter to the now dead spirit of rock and roll. There was a time when there was a certain romance to living dangerously and immorally.  Now our entertainers must pass the same moral litmus tests that our politicians are forced to endure.In the opening scenes, Lester Bangs tells the Crowe character that ""its over.""  He was right.  The film documents the period when rock and roll became a business.  Shows became concerts.  Tours went from theaters to stadiums.  Sony stepped in and Chet Helms stepped out.In 1973, though, there was still hope for rock and roll.  You could see that hope fade, though, in the eyes of the Duane Allman character.  Yes, rock is dead, but sometimes its worth putting a love letter on the tombstone.",Almost Famous
393,ayelver,Something to Crowe about,9,14 September 2000,"Once upon a time a teenager with dreams of becoming a journalist went on the road with The Allman Brothers Band as a correspondent for Rolling Stone Magazine.  He then went on to write and direct Say Anything and Jerry Maguire.  That young man was Cameron Crowe and now he offers the fictionalized story of his beginnings in his new film `Almost Famous.'  In this story William Miller (perfectly realized by Patrick Fugit) grows up with an over protective mother who doesn't allow him to eat meat, listen to rock and roll or celebrate Christmas.  Strangely she is not a religious nut but rather a college professor who wants her child to be extraordinary.  So Miller sits in his room between his pictures of Jimmi Hendrix and Abraham Lincoln and listens to his cache of illicit rock albums, racy stuff like Simon and Garfunkle, Bob Dylan, and Cream.  Miller's writing gets noticed by an editor at Rolling Stone who doesn't know Miller is only 15.  Miller is soon on the road covering an up and coming rock band called Stillwater whose member's look like The Eagles and sound like Bad Company.  Miller is there for their big break and so are we. So there is the set up.  A lesser director would have handed us a film about how the repressed boy goes out in the real world, has some sex, does a few drugs, and through the power of rock n' roll becomes a complete person. The protective mother would have been the villain, the worldly band members the heroes and the music would have made a difference.  Crowe, however, offers much more. This isn't really an expose of the rock lifestyle (I am sure the people were much rougher and the drug use and sex more raw) but it is not a dreamy nostalgia trip either.  This is a film about a boy's first taste of the real world and how truth guides him through.  On the road Miller is immediately surrounded by temptation but he is more interested in writing his article.  He tries not to get close to the band.  He has been cautioned by his mentor Lester Bangs (a fantastic Phillip Seymour Hoffman) an independent publisher to remain objective and not be used by the band. Miller does his best but he falls for the Penny Lane a 16 year-old groupie in love with the bands enigmatic by design guitarist.   Who would not fall for Lane as played by Kate Hudson?  She is all beauty and naivete shot in soft light.  Miller does his best to understand the band and the fans as they travel from one minor venue to another.  Stillwater is not a great band.  In many ways they just ape other acts. They reminded me a lot of Spinal Tap in their calculated attempts to become stars.  They are in rock for sex, drugs, and the freedom from the real world. They call this life the circus and they never want to go home.  They ride around in a bus, play loud music and sleep with girls who just got their driver's licenses. Stillwater's groupies are embodied by actors who look the age they are playing (Anna Paquin, Fairzu Balk, and Kate Hudson) and this makes the actions of the band  appear all the more pathetic.  The girls pretend to be 18 and sport aliases like Aphrodisia and Saphire but they are only fooling themselves.   Crowe shows the disdain with which the band treats these girls and the damage it causes.As the film progresses we also get to know Miller's mother (played wonderfully by Oscar winner Frances McDormand).  She is not a one-dimensional movie parent.  She hovers and nags but there is a lot of truth in her words and they along with the words of Lester Bangs hold the center of this film.  All together this is great movie.  The performances are dead on especially those by Fugit, Hudson, and McDormand.  The dialog is crisp and funny and the period details are excellent. No one does movie romance better than Crowe (rent `Say Anything' again) and here he captures perfectly the aching a young man feels when he loves someone out of reach. The movie is a little too long and the wrap up scene on board the plane does not ring true to rest of the film.  Overall, however, Crowe satisfies as he dissects rock the way he did professional sports in Jerry Maguire.  In the end it is just men playing guitars or throwing a ball.  What is really important is how the stars and their handlers live in the real world.  Crowe again celebrates virtues like commitment, truth, and love.   Of course that dose not mean there is no value in the game or in rock.  On the contrary there is real joy when you look past the trappings and focus on the thrill of playing the music or catching the ball.  Crowe does not feed us as much of a Hollywood ending as I expected and you may be surprised where Miller ends up.",Almost Famous
394,kubrick69,The best film of 2000,10,17 September 2000,"""Almost Famous"" is a sprawling, brilliant coming of age story of a young man who lands an assignment following a fictional band during the early 1970s. Crowe's autobiographical script and direction is the stuff of legends. During the film's two hour length, it's hard to imagine a story more enjoyable.  It's amazing how Crowe can build organic relationships and three dimensional characters.  The humor is always touching; the melodrama dead on.  The cast is enough to make you cheer; especially Frances McDormand as the boy's caring mother (""Don't take drugs!"").  Anyone who's ever lived is bound to love this movie.",Almost Famous
395,bobbie-12,disappointing--not true to 1973,3,3 June 2001,"Dear young people, I hope you don't think this treacley teen movie is an accurate portrait of 1973; it captures neither the details nor the spirit of the 1970s. The times were much wilder, weirder, rougher, grittier, and unpredictable--a roller coaster ride of the thrilling and the terrifying. Penny Lane is beautiful, and her makeup and mannerisms are perfect--for 1995. Both she and Russell are as clean cut, scrubbed and color-coordinated as a couple of models in a J.Crew catalog--when they should look like R.Crumb characters. This movie is NOT what the 70s were like at all. In 1973, everybody looked funky and raunchy: I walked around in a black leather coat, a pink stretch top, green suede hotpants, and thigh-high boots--and I was a college professor, so you can imagine how rock stars and groupies dressed and acted.(Lester Bangs, the mom and the sister are closer to accurate.) Fashion details, especially on the leads, are a litmus test of the moviemaker's courage; are they telling a story about the past, or are they just boxoffice brownnoses afraid of offending the contemporary teen audience who can't handle historical realities? And of course, the fashion failure is only a symptom of this movie's general saccharine timidity: Where is Vietnam, Watergate, Cambodia, Kent and Jackson State, the murders of King and the Kennedys, and the Days of Rage? Not that these political events have to be seen or talked about, but they have to be present in the characters, the way they move, talk, sing, and think. Only a person who was comatose or unborn in 1973 could enjoy Almost Famous as a picture about the 70s. Jacob's Ladder, Boogie Nights, and the Tina Turner story are much better if you want to know what it was like. Or look in the attic for your parents' R.Crumb comics.",Almost Famous
396,dayglo-raven,Mark Kozelek,6,27 July 2019,I'm an avid fan of Mr. Kozelek. I loved hearing him sing Tiny Dancer on the bus. That was a terrific scene and made the movie for me. This is probably the only movie by Mr. Crowe that I enjoyed. Bill Crudup is a nice guy whom I met in person once. Really sweet and smart. Some of the scenes drag while others are frenetically cut and that kind of unbalanced pacing makes me nauseous. Excellent soundtrack for sure though.,Almost Famous
397,FightingIrish,The most magnificent film of the decade,10,20 August 2001,"Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous is a joyous voyage back into the 70s, during the early years of true rock 'n roll. The story starts out in San Diego, but by the end of the movie, has ventured across the entire country. It is a wonderful tale of one boy's personal journey as he rebels against his single mother(Frances McDormand), and decides to tour with the band Stillwater, as a reporter for Rolling Stone. What makes this movie so great, other than the extremely well-written script and the heartfelt acting, is the overall humor that truly makes this movie a comedy.(There are plenty of monster laughs which, however, I'm not going to spoil for you.)You MUST see this film. No matter what. I honestly don't care if you're not allowed to see R-rated pictures. You MUST see it. Right now. If you don't, however, you'll be missing out on one of the best films ever made, in any genre.

I have never experienced a rock and roll movie this intimate before and this is truly a unique film. I  highly recommend the Almost Famous ""Untitled"" DVD bootleg version that was just released a couple weeks ago. There are many great extras on both discs and the Directors Cut of almost famous is an even better movie with the 35 minutes of extra footage that has been restored to the movie. It is a must have for all film students and DVD collectors alike.",Almost Famous
399,Chadderbox041277,Brilliant and Bittersweet,8,4 January 2002,"I have to admit I didn't have much interest in this film when I first heard about it. I've admired Cameron Crowe as both a writer and director since he helmed the romantic comedy-drama Jerry Maguire but I had no idea what I was in store for. He makes what could have just another cruise down memory lane, a brilliant and bittersweet love song to rock music. The music is great as is the recreation of the times. The performances though are what really make this film stand out above most others released in 2000. Frances McDormand, as usual, gives one of the most honest and believable performances of a mother I have ever witnessed. She's forthright, honest and loving without becoming a classic stereotype we've all grown use to. She takes it up a couple of notches. Kate Hudson has really come into her own as an actress. I think after this film, she will no longer be known as just Goldie Hawn's daughter. This is her stepping out film. (I think she should've won the Oscar too!) And what a find in Patrick Fudgit. He gives soul and substance to what could've been another boring clad quiet person cum hero. If you want a really good film with really great writing, directing, music and acting, definatly check this one out.",Almost Famous
400,macca7174,the songs are too modern,6,4 July 2003,"Crowe's love of grunge is apparent in the songs in this film. They are far too nineties. they sound more like Pearl Jam, or better-still, Creed. They do not sound like the workings of a seventies rock group. This however, is my only complaint, and I understand how it must be difficult to write songs for a seventies rock group, without actualy being a seventies rock group. 9/10",Almost Famous

402,songbirdn,The Best Rock Movie I've Ever Seen,10,20 January 2013,"I absolutely loved this film. I just recently saw it and I am now completely obsessed. Taking place in the 1970's, this film was able to do something that most rock movies struggle to do-maintain a level of sincerity that balances out with the glamorous stories of rock stars. The film is about a boy named William Miller that is soon to graduate high school at the age of fifteen, and dreams of becoming a music journalist. After a piece he wrote for an underground magazine catches the attention of Rolling Stone magazine, he is sent on a trip to travel with one of the next big rock bands, Stillwater (a fictional band created for the purposes of the movie). William is plunged into a world of sex, drugs, and of course, some of the best music in history.I think the reason why this film did an incredible job of not seeming totally contrived was because this is actually based off of a true story. The film is the semi-autobiography of the writer/director, Cameron Crowe. Also, the actors were phenomenal, especially Kate Hudson as groupie Penny Layne and Patrick Fugit as William.And of course, the soundtrack was perfection, comprised of songs by The Who, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, and other great 70's rock bands. I thought Cameron Crowe did an excellent job with this film and I know this will remain one of my favorites.",Almost Famous
403,kingmattress,Greatest Rock Movie Ever,10,31 March 2004,"I can honestly say Almost Famous is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  It's the semi-autobiographical story of the film's creator, Cameron Crowe.  It's truly a rock & roll movie, but can be loved by everyone.It tells the story of young William, an aspiring 15 year old music journalist with an extremely neurotic mother.  When he gets his first assignment, he misses the band he's supposed to interview, but is introduced to fictional band Stillwater (rumored to loosely be based around Led Zeppelin) and the enigmatic and charismatic Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson.  Through a series of fortunate events, William gets an assignment from Rolling Stone itself and goes out on tour with Stillwater to report. The movie follows what happens with William, Stillwater, Penny Lane, and her band of groupies (known as Band Aids).This movie is incredible.  It really shows the group becoming a large family while the band falls apart and the members of the traveling troupe begin to disperse.  In one incredible scene, everyone on the tour bus begins singing Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" and Penny tells William that while he claims to need to go home, he's already there.  Everyone on the tour bus affects everyone else, and it actually all works out.  Roger Ebert claimed it was the best movie of 2000.  It's a travesty that it wasn't nominated for virtually every Academy Award out there.  It's the greatest movies ever.",Almost Famous

Like the mom.. I mean, yea, she sorta gives the movie ""something"" but I mean her role could've been played by someone else that wasn't that... freak. I didn't see her character very useful and I can't find the relationship about that the sister and the mother stopped talking to each other and the boys life. I mean the movie is all about this boy and the other people are just part of it in many ways but not all of them as important as I'd like them to be.

406,sgauss,"Funny, joyful, sad, wonderful music",9,23 October 2000,"Semi-autobiographical, Cameron Crowe condensed his experiences as a very young Rolling Stone correspondent down into a great script.  I was surprised how funny this movie was at times, without losing its sense of reality. Crowe also shows why he's a good, maybe great director, with the performances he got from a cast of (at the time) relative unknowns. Everyone in this movie will go on to good roles.  But, it's the music that is the biggest star in this movie, and I think that's what Crowe intended. A great collection of music accompanies the movie, fitting and shaping the mood of different scenes.  The last movie I saw that did this so well was ""Forrest Gump"".Unfortunately, this movie will all too quickly disappear from the movie theaters, and probably won't get any of the big awards this year either. That's more of a sad commentary about how movies are promoted in the US than anything else, though.

408,Qale-2,Almost Famous is Absolutely Perfect,10,16 September 2000,"Cameron Crowe.  Unfamilar with the name?  He showed a film studio 'the money' when he brought filmgoers the award winning ""Jerry Maguire"" a few years back.  Now, he's finished directing a rather biopic film called ""Almost Famous"" and it is making many critics including this one very happy it heralds a hopefully better season ahead in the box office.Patrick Fugit is obviously my fave in this film jam packed with delicious 70's style performances by Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, and Anna Paquin.  Fugit plays a young music critic who eventually lands a piece with ""Rolling Stone"" magazine.  He, at 15, goes on tour with a band called Stillwater and discovers exactly what is up with this ""poetry for the drugged and sexually promiscuous"" despite his mother's best attempts to keep him sheltered. Also particularly good is Philip Seymor Hoffman as Lester Bangs who periodically gives Fugit's character advice.A bit ""Detriot Rock City"" and a little ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Almost Famous"" has only one flaw in my eyes:  While we all can *see* Fugit and Hudson are young, the picture seems to prostitute this fact to us more often than necessary.  Instead of repeating this fact, there could be a further development of their characters beyond the single demention.  The band's performers get three dementions, why not the young stars? Still, I don't think this minor point is strong enough to deduct.Locations are vivid, songs are enthralling, and there are probably enough sound bytes in ""Almost Famous"" to outshadow ""Maguire's"" 'Show me the money' and 'You had me at hello.'  In any event, I'll be going back to the theatre to relive this coming of age tale a second time and that's rare for a movie critic.Almost Famous Grade A+",Almost Famous

First off, there's something called ""suspension of disbelief"" that you're supposed to have when you watch movies.  Since when is everything supposed to be real?

410,danielsan128,Like listening to the Eagles. YOU DECIDE.,4,19 September 2001,"A friend of mind told me this was a very good film, so when it became available in the video store I rented it. I finished watching it about a half hour ago. My initial reaction was to say that I didn't like it. The first problem with this film is that it is overlong. The second problem is the performance (or non-performance) of Kate Hudson. How on earth did she get nominated for an Oscar? The third and most serious flaw of the movie is the time period in which it is set. I know that after Jerry Macguire Cameron Crowe could pretty much do whatever he wanted, but for God's sake! Some of you out there may be fans of The Eagles or Crosby, Stills & Nash, and if you are, great! You'll enjoy this. If, like me, you think that almost every American record not made by Iggy Pop c.1971 - 1974 SUCKED BIG TIME, avoid this film. It resembles the music made by those bands; it thinks it is striving towards some great profound truth, when it is really bombastic, insincere and boring.The one thing that saves Almost Famous from being total garbage is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The man livens up every scene he's in, and gets the message of the film across in his few brief appearances; don't meet your heroes, you'll only end up disappointed.

However during my mid-teen years for some reason I formed a love for all things 70's and maybe my love of these things makes me love this film all the more.This film is very unusual. It isn't your everyday movie. It doesnt really fit into the arty-type movie category because it's a fun movie a big no-no for arty movies. It certainly isn't a summer blockbuster, with a largely unknown cast and zero special effects. It's not so much a drama because there are too many comical moments but neither is it a full-blown comedy because it has it's feet stuck in the real world. It's hard to actually think about just what demographic this film is aimed at. It seems to fit all and at the same time fit none.Almost Famous in the end is just a movie that is hard to describe. I find it hard to tell people just what I like about it. What I can say about the film though is that it is brilliant. Like Ebert(someone I hardly ever agree with) said this film was the best film of 2000 and it is a shame (and testament to the Academy's ever increasing lack of relevance) that it was largely ignored at the Oscars. It's not so surprising though. I find this film a lot more romantic than films like Titanic and Shakespeare in Love. Why? Because with this film the romance feels realistic. It all works out at the end the way it probably would in real life rather than the silly fairy-tale shows we see in most Hollywood romances. And like in real life, the romance is hidden. Many people watch this film without realising that the true story being told is not that of ""a mid-level band"" trying to make it while in the ""harsh face"" of stardom, but really that of Penny Lane and two men that love her and the subtle ways they show it and well..just go see the movie.The plot? Well it really deals with this 15 yr old kid, William Miller, who manages to get a job at Rolling Stone to interview Stillwater, an up and coming rock band in 1973. The film deals with young Miller's misadventures with the various members of the band, their road crew and most importantly their band-aides(groupies) including Penny Lane who William falls for.The acting? With the exception of a couple of extras, the acting is all top notch with exceptional performances by Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson.All in all, Almost Famous is not really a film about which much can be written.

412,madman31619,Great movie for music lovers..... And movie lovers,8,13 March 2008,"Almost FamousBy Daniel Rosado Directed: Cameron Crowe Cast: Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand,Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Zooey Deschanel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Liz Stauber, Bijou Phillips 4 out of 5 stars Almost Famous is a film about a young boy named William (Patrick Fugit) getting the experience of a lifetime. He gets to travel with an up and coming rock band, Still Water, and write about them for Rolling Stone magazine. William meets new people during this journey, and becomes a little more mature when it's all over. The movie is based on a similar experience o f the director, Cameron Crowe (""Jerry Maguire""). When Crowe was younger, he traveled along with Peter Frampton. William grew up as part of a strange family, he didn't find out his real age until he was eleven, because his mother (Frances McDormand) wanted him to start school early and skip a grade. His mother is known for ""freaking people out"". Such as his sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel), who leaves home to become a flight attendant. She leaves William a bunch of rock records, hidden under his bed, in a box. Because of these albums he grows a love for music. Four years later he becomes a rock journalist, and is told by a legend in the business, Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), not to make friends with the rock stars, because they'll just try to use him. Shortly after this William meets the Band-Aids (not groupies), and their leader Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He quickly falls for Penny, but she's in love with somebody else, the guitarist for Still Water, Russel Hammond (Billy Crudup). William's new assignment is to travel with Still Water and write about them for Rolling Stone. William is there through Still Water's good times and bad times. He learned a lot about the band, himself, and the music business. He saw when the band almost broke up, when they got back together. He also saw the lead guitarist go to some fan's house, climb up on the roof, then scream ""I'm on drugs!!!"", right before jumping into a pool. I thought Almost Famous was a great movie. It had great actors, it was wonderfully cast. I feel that the actors played very convincing roles. They were perfect for the parts they were playing. Whenever you look at Patrick Fugit you really do think of him as being this innocent gullible kid. I also feel that Jason Lee was awesome as Jeff Bebe (Still Water's lead singer). His character was jealous of Billy Crudup's character, Russel Hammond. Bebe felt that he should be more known and famous than Hammond because he was the singer, and Hammond was just supposed to be the ""mysterious"" guitarist. I also liked the idea of the Band-Aids. Even though they said they weren't, they basically were groupies. But they weren't like average groupies, they were girls that really liked and cared about the music, rather than the musicians. I feel that the movie was such a success because it was based on an experience that the director got to have during his lifetime. He felt that it made such an impact on his life that he had to make a movie about it. And more importantly this movie showed how music means a lot to everyone.",Almost Famous
413,kingcooger,A Masterpiece,10,21 October 2002,"I wish that my petty comments could do this movie justice but they can't. I'll try to tell you why I like this movie and hope that if you have seen it, you will see it again; and if you haven't seen it, that you will go see it.First of all we'll talk about the story.  This is a primarily character based tale.  Most of the comedy results from who the things are happening too or who is saying what.  It also helps to know the music of the time (though you can still enjoy it without this knowledge).  The characters are well drawn and their sayings and conversations are priceless.  There are those who claim that this story is unreal but they obviously don't realize that this happened to Cameron Crowe (the writer and director for those of you who didn't know).Second we will look at the acting.  The actors in this film is very well cast.  Patrick Fugit (a first timer to acting) carries the film on his shoulders and convincingly plays the person inside of us all.  Kate Hudson is gorgeous as a band aide that follows groups for the music.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are perfect as the rock stars we all strive to be.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays his role to so well its almost scary (if you have the Special Edition check out the Lester Bangs interviews).  Finally Frances McDormand rounds out the main cast as the mother who warns her son of the dangers of blending into the rock and roll scene.  There are many supporting actors (Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk, Zooey Deschanel, Noah Taylor, and Jimmy Fallon) that play all their parts amazingly well.The movie is based on music and so the soundtrack is really strong.  If you like this movie I suggest you buy the soundtrack to accompany it.There is a deeper meaning behind this movie, for those who care to look for it.  It is a struggle between staying real among fakes (Patrick Fugit's character) and trying to become real (Billy Crudup's character).I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good film or just feels like a loser sometimes.",Almost Famous
414,sweet_lady_genevieve,My favourite film to watch over and over,10,8 April 2009,"""The film's about a band, a girl, a motherall these people realising that they've reached one person – William."" (Cameron Crowe – director and winner of the Best Screenplay Oscar for this film)* 'Almost Famous' follows the story of 15 year-old music fanatic, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), growing up in the 70's. His love of music leads him to his ultimate ambition, to be a music journalist. This is much to the disapproval of his overbearing, widowed mother (Frances McDormand), whose neurotic ways have already driven his older sister away to become a stewardess. One day William is fortunate enough to meet Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a successful journalist and editor of 'Creem' magazine, who sees William's passion and offers him $35 to write his first article on Black Sabbath. Having no pass, William can't even meet the band, but it is here that famous band aid, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) and 'Stillwater', an up-and-coming rock band, enter his life. Then, William (posing as an 18 year old) gets the golden opportunity to write for Rolling Stone magazine about Stillwater. He is told firmly by Lester, ""do not make friends with the rock stars"", but the experiences he shares with them throughout the film give William some of his most valuable lessons on life, although by no means do things go as he would have expected. William's innocence and naivety make him a lovable character and easy to identify with, an excellent performance given by Fugit in his film debut. In the film, the band represents a change from the hippie, peace-loving lifestyle of the 60's to the beginnings of the money-making, fame-hungry music industry we know today. They constantly profess that it is ""all about the music"", but behind this is a bitter quest for fame between the band members. This is shown through their disregard for William and also through the relationship between the guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup) and Penny Lane. Penny is brilliantly played by Hudson as a beautiful, carefree young woman, the object of every man's affection (including William), but beneath this ""cool"" demeanour, the 16 year old Penny is just as naive and vulnerable as him. All of these mixed, negative emotions in the film contrast with the cinematography, which encapsulates a warm, dreamlike quality of nostalgia surrounding the 70's rock music scene. When you watch the film it almost makes you want to be back there, experiencing it for yourself.What makes Almost Famous intriguing is that it is a semi-autobiographical film, with William playing a young Cameron Crowe – who is the youngest journalist to write for the renowned Rolling Stone magazine. The fictional band ""Stillwater"" replaces a few of the famous musicians interviewed by Crowe in real-life; Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Lynard Skynardan impressive list for anyone, let alone someone so young.The best thing I could do to sum up the film would be to play you the soundtrack, which would tell you everything you need to know. A quote from Patrick Fugit describes perfectly why you should watch it:""You can tell it's a Cameron Crowe movie, because you can't really put it in a category of comedy, dramait has a certain quality that you just like tofall in love with and watch the movie over and over.""**Taken from interviews on the DVD's extra features.",Almost Famous
415,occamsrazor1969,"Not perfect, but perfect entertainment",9,19 October 2014,"Let me start by saying that this is one of my all time favourite movies. It hits the mark in so many different ways. From the soundtrack, to the casting, the wardrobe to the acting. Every roll is perfectly cast. Try to think of a replacement actor for any of the rolls and I'll bet you come up short. The movie moves along at a very even pace, and the story it tells, growing up in the early seventies with rock and roll at the core of entertainment and politics. The fact that this is also partly autobiographical makes it that much better. If you love music, this movie is a must see. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. And, Philip Seymour Hoffman rocks in this, this may well be his single best roll.",Almost Famous
416,KV1204,"What a long, dull trip it's been",3,11 December 2019,"""What a long, dull trip it's been"" should've been the afterword (That's an old hippie reference in case you didn't know). The story goes wherever the boy goes, and everywhere he goes is the same...a crowd. There isn't much variation for a movie of this length. The film is wholly focused on the characters, though they're not memorable or interesting enough to make me care. Their conversations are mundane. There's the protagonist, the boy (Patrick Fugit). He's a newbie rock journalist trying to get a story. But he's 15-yrs-old. Apparently he can just leave school and hit the road on a bus tour with some band. I guess truancy didn't exist then. This adventurous idea was suggested by his new groupie friend (Kate Hudson), who's pretty much a drifting character. Anyhow, I don't think there's anything wrong with the boy. He's honest, humble, patient, kind-faced...which is why he doesn't fit into that scene, and why I find the character annoying. He's like the little brother you had to drag along with you on a date in high school-a third wheel-or the young sibling at someone's house party. You just want to tell him to go hang out with kids his own age. Maybe when he's a bit older and more forthright, he can stick around. A journalist should to be assertive, especially a budding one. The band he follows around are the cliched rock group...always butting heads. You get tired of their drama.The kid's hyperbolic mother is annoying too. She calls her son almost every day to make sure he's not doing drugs. Even a narc officer isn't that persistent.What I don't like most of all about this movie is that characters are stereotypical and dialogue is contrived, as if based on what someone thought the era was like. (I know it's supposedly a true story from the director's life, but maybe he wanted to conventionalize it for the screen). I also cringed when they sang ""Tiny Dancer"" on the bus. Lester Bangs may have been onto something when he said rock music was on its way out by then.",Almost Famous

How can it be if it's a semi autobiographical retelling of director and screenwriter, Cameron Crowe's life? He really did graduate from high school at 15 because his mom lied to him about his real age. He really was hired by Rolling Stone magazine at 16, and shortly after assigned to go on tour with The Allman Brothers to write a cover story about them (''Then-senior editor Ben Fong-Torres also said of Crowe: ""He was the guy we sent out after some difficult customers. He covered the bands that hated Rolling Stone.""'')

The performances were good, with Kate Hudson being the brightest, but the story is just a candy coated shell with little underneath.  I unfortunately feel that with this film Crowe has gone off the deep end with injecting too many artificially sweetened moments into a good framework and solid premise.

Everyone wants to be part of the in crowd, but once you are in there - is it all worth it? Are the relationships real enough? Do they have longevity? Probably no to both, but yet even knowing that it is hard to resist.On the one hand you could just come down on the side that it is all vapid and you should turn your back on it.

And the brilliant Frances McDormand brings the perfect amount of comic understatement to her role as the paranoid mother.

The fictional band Stillwater fits into this world perfectly and its members were such believable rock gods that I found myself wondering how it was possible that this was not a real band!!! Jason Lee and Billy Crudup were mesmerizing and convincing as two talented musicians vying for the coveted role of Stillwater's ""golden god""--the fan favorite. The internal struggles facing the band were unapologetically honest and obviously based upon the reality of Cameron Crowe's experience with famous musicians. Crowe's brilliant use of music (for example, Led Zeppelin's ""That's the Way"" and Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"") made the story all the more powerful and engrossing. This seems to be his strong point as a director--(remember Lloyd, the radio, and ""In Your Eyes?"")

431,HHoffman-2,A film with a lot of heart.,10,26 September 2006,"It probably goes without saying that Cameron Crowe is one of the most original and talented screenwriters of the 21st century. Now I normally don't say that about a director whose work I've seen is limited to Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. Even less frequently do I say this when I don't like one of the two films. Yet somehow this film manages to make me type that first statement of this review. Almost Famous made me a believer.Cameron Crowe directed and wrote the screenplay and used his own adolescent experiences to bring realism to the film. The dialog is often witty, dramatic, insightful, and many times all three. It's one of the best screenplays written in the last ten years. The main character of William Miller is a quiet, idealistic boy with a passion for writing who happens to make friends with people who are totally the opposite; they are loud, arrogant, foul-mouthed individuals who aren't against lying to preserve their reputation. But Crowe is able to make the audience believe in this friendship. Even more commendable is that he can make us LIKE these people. We feel for them and understand why they are the way they are.Of course this could also be attributed to the casting of the film. Patrick Fugit, a relatively new performer at the time of production, shows a great deal of acting prowess when playing the film's protagonist. He captures the innocence and fascination of a young man who has fallen in love with music. It's this particular trait that connects him with the characters. Because all of the characters share this love (and realistically), the friendships are that much more tangible. From an avid follower to a frustrated musician to a fellow journalist, we see how William Miller touches their lives and how they touched his.Kate Hudson plays the aforementioned follower, a ""band-aid"" called Penny Lane. Her smile and seemingly-innocent disposition serves as a mask for her lonely, yearning, and depressed identity, which slowly starts to fall apart through the course of the film. Hudson, arguably the star of the film, gives a charming and lovable performance, one that should of given her an Oscar. The scene showing a disillusioned William Miller telling Penny, ""I have to go home,"" is countered with the equally-powerful reply, ""You are home."" The acting is phenomenal. So much so that I could write a review just on the performances alone and it probably wouldn't put a dent in the amount of actors in the film.The film's subject matter of rock journalism is complimented well by Nancy Wilson's acoustic score and the many different rock songs of the 60's and 70's. It truly captures the heart of many scenes, particularly the well-known bus scene and even the end credits.Almost Famous is what great film is about; that is, capturing the audience and allowing them to love the characters and want to be with them.

433,hendrix-lives,You Won't Be Disappointed,9,28 August 2005,"Fantastic Film.This film showcases rock life in the late sixties and early seventies. The Vietnam War and The Beatles have just ended and so has rock and roll, for most writers at least. The movie also displays the experience of being in a rock band. The crisis, drugs, sex, booze, and spotlight. It brilliantly displays the effect from such bands as Led Zeppelin and The Allman Brothers. Two of the bands Cameron Crowe(the director and writer of the film.) interviewed as a teenager. The atmosphere around young William shows what was huge in that day and age. Dark Side of the Moon, Bowie, Alice Cooper, Band Aids, LSD, Free love.The films plot is how William Miller begins writing for Rolling Stone and touring with a band named Stillwater. This film revolves around the story of his life but also Stillwater's. It's not just about how Stillwater made it big, but also how William did. How he learned to free himself and escape the bars that jailed him. How he was frustrated in the position the band put him in. How he hated that they threw away Band Aids(""All she did was love your music. You guys always talk about the fans well she was your biggest fan and you threw away"")and how he fell in love with one.It explodes with many emotions. The film is very witty in many different, it does not try to be because it actually happened and apparently that's what it's like. It is dramatic because you feel sympathy for William in a frustrated position. You see his childhood also in a frustrated position and his sister ditching her mother. The film also lets out many different emotions in one scene like the plane confession or the meeting with Lester Bangs in the restaurant.The movie explores a variety of different music. It was what Cameron Crowe was listening to at the time. An acoustic selection by Led Zeppelin and Thunder Clap Newman. Stevie Wonder, Lynard Skynard, The Allman Brothers, The Beach Boys, Elton John and Joni Mitchell. Normally in films they use orchestral scores in Almost Famous, rock music listened to at the time displayed the emotional value and atmosphere.The film contained underrated acting. Frances McDormand steals the movie in my favorite role as William's paranoid mother. Afraid of drugs and rock and roll she showed that she could make speeches and monologue like the teacher she was and make it believable. Kate Hudson plays the free souled Band Aid. Who is loved by William and is in the film to show what women were in that age. Jason Lee and Billy Crudup play the singer with finesse and the guitarist with mystique. Thogh very different characters both share a distinct similarity between them: Wanting to be at the top and played the role excellently.After watching Almost Famous I watched the untitled version. I thought it was great but not as good as the original. I found the new one was too long. It took too long before we saw William on the road. Many of the scenes on the road should have been put in the movie. Jimmy Fallon's extended speech, an extended ""Russel on acid scene"", an extended concert, Penny's birthday, and other scenes that were too long. The original remains the best but that's all opinion.Cameron Crowe wrote the film very well mostly because he lived it. Being a narc to being cool to being betrayed.

Second, Cameron Crowe crafted an amazing script and pulled great performances out of the actors. Given that the script is semi-autobiographical, the movie gives a great peak both at the journalist life and the life of a band on the road. The dialogue is wonderfully written with several quotable moments. The triangle between Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, and Kate Hudson interplays so well.

438,staggeredgenius7,Talk about the biggest Oscar Snub in History,10,13 February 2001,"Why is it that in recent years the Oscars have boiled down to who spends the most on their ad campaign?  Here we have the best film by far of the year 2000, which has strengths in all areas, and it gets totally shut out in two major categories.  ""Almost Famous"" is a tale from the heart, with a genuine sense of humanity.  The screenplay was written from blood, sweat, and tears, to produce the best coming of age story ever.  Every performance felt 100% real from Patrick Fugit's portrayal of the naive William Miller to Frances McDormand's loving yet overprotective mother, to Kate Hudson's sexy yet lacking self confidence interpretation of Penny Lane, to the always underappreciated yet brilliant Jason Lee.  The success of the film lies not in the hands of one actor (ala Erin Brokovich), but in the ensemble cast. Cameron Crowe's direction allows the viewer to revel in the 70's haze. Probably since the story is autobiographical.  So let us get this straight, a man who directs a movie based on his actual life and creates such a sense of reality isn't worthy of a Best Director nomination?      The biggest irony about ""Almost Famous"" is that it is the most truly American film made in a number of years, and it takes the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to award it a Best Picture win.  No wonder the country is in such a state of dying patriotism.  We nominate 5 pictures: one from China, one takes place in France, half of one takes place in Mexico, one centers around ancient Romans, and the other could have happened anywhere. While all these films were above average, each had their own flaws, ""Gladiator""'s bug budget mentality, ""Chocolat""'s cliche's plot and characters (well thank God for Mirimax and its publicity pushes or this would not be nominated.  Money over art the true mantra of Hollywood), ""Crouching Tiger"" and its trite script (an action flick, albeit a beautiful one), ""Brokovich"" was Julia and all Julia, and ""Traffic's"" style over substance.  Crowe's picture spoke from the heart with no gimmicks and it will continue to speak with my heart for years to come.",Almost Famous

Mark my words.If you love rock 'n' roll -- TRULY love rock 'n' roll -- then you will love this movie. In fact, if you are a music journalist, or even have aspirations to be one (like myself) then you will love this movie even more. Besides, in what other rock 'n' roll movie (that is, one not made by Cameron Crowe) can a mother quote Goethe to her son, and still be so authentically rock 'n' roll? There is no other movie that can pull that off.

441,antoniohardeman,'Almost Famous' should be MORE famous than it is now...,10,27 March 2003,"""Almost Famous"" is one of my personal all-time favorites. If you ask me it's Cameron Crowe's best by far. 'Fast Times' only has cult status nowadays and ""Jerry Maguire"" was just a nice feel-good movie for a quiet saturday afternoon. Almost Famous has that same kind of feel-good feeling but now serving a much better story of passion and heartbreaking. The band-scene in the early 70's provides a stunning background. It has the most powerful ""zeitgeist"" (timespirit) I have ever seen mostly because of the music and costume design. The actors and especially the actresses deliver stand-out performances. Kate Hudson gives one of the best and most memorable performances by an actress in decades as the beautiful and lovely band-aid Penny Lane. She fills the screen with a kind of grandure; a charismatic talent that is rarely seen since the days of Monroe or Hepburn. She is definitely the highlight of the movie. But that doesn't mean the rest is crap. On the contrary; I've never seen a movie with more characters played by the perfect actor/actress for the role. The casting choices are optimal. Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, Frances Mc.Dormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman are all at their best in a film that is one of the most enjoyable films of all time. Although with 4 Academy Award nominations and one win for Best Screenplay I still feel it has been ignored too much by the Academy.

Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, and Billy Crudup are predictably great, but the real joy is newcomer Patrick Fugit, whose winsome, innocent portrayal of a teen coming of age is pitch perfect.The plot is gripping and unpredictable.  The subject matter is intimately familiar for anyone over the age of 25 or so, but younger folks will also identify with the characters' love for music.But the real strength, as with all of Crowe's work, is the *writing*. Good writing is rare in movies of any sort, particularly this summer's blockbuster sludge, but Crowe nails all the details of dialogue, characterization, and pacing with unparalleled skill.  You will laugh out loud, repeatedly, and cry too, many times simultaneously.  Every time he makes a film he renews my faith in the medium.I'm not one to gush over films, usually, but this touching, honest gem is worth losing the cynicism for a while.

Jason Lee was excellent as the lead singer that was somewhat paranoid about what was going on with the direction of the band. Frances McDormand played a good nutty and worried mother (""Don't take drugs!"").  The groupies (Kate Hudson, Anna Paquin...) may have been a little tame by groupie standards, but they did say they were ""Band Aids"" not groupies.The only thing that some folks might not like is the portrayal of drug use, but we are portraying 70's Rock here. It certainly has less of that than say Pulp Fiction or Scarface.I've gotta get the soundtrack from this movie. It looks to be a must have for anyone that hails back to the early 70's.

Anyway she gave me a look and said we had to watch it that moment. She put it on and let me tell you, this movie changed my life.

This is definitely one of my favorite movies and it always will be. It is an excellent view on teenage life, rock music, the 70's and the rest of life in general. Every actor/actress in this fantastic ensemble cast brings their A game and the only complaint that I have is that this movie isn't 4 hours long.

I wanted William to ask Russell to be Best Man at his wedding or something.William, at age 15, was the most mature person in the movie. He ""baby-sat"" Russell in the Topeka party. He saved Penny's life. He never tried drugs (which the others respected). And he stayed on focus to the task at hand (interviewing the band members for Rolling Stone). Even when he woke and realized that he was no longer a virgin, his first thought was ""My god, I have a 4,000 word article to write.""My favorite part was the stomach-pumping scene. Watch the movie again and pay close attention to this scene. You can see the thrill in his eyes and the love in his thin smile. He was thrilled to be there at that moment to save her life -- he had never had been this significant at any point in his life.Russell was a good guy. He included William in the pre-show huddles; he told William's mom what a good kid Will was; he was even gracious when he realized that he was in the wrong house at the end (so this is where the enemy sleeps :) -- and then he realized that this was, in fact, the place that he wanted/needed to be.",Almost Famous

463,Fledermaus34,"Wildly overrated, and Kate Hudson makes me want to rip my hair out.",5,15 June 2003,"Attractive movie stars, pseudo-sagacious dialogue, and enough hype to choke on have all conspired to blow this Cameron Crowe movie's reputation way out of proportion. Contrary to popular opinion, viewing this film will not be a life-altering experience; it will not blow anyone's mind or provide an existential revelation. It won't even entertain them much. Unfortunately, ""Almost Famous"" is crushingly average.It isn't an awful movie. It has a few good moments, mostly when it doesn't try to be anything more than a wacky period comedy. Most of the time, though, its overblown pretentiousness sinks it into the ground. It's hard to tell if the grandiose mythologizing of rock-and-roll as a way of life is tongue-in-cheek or not; either way, it doesn't make it look like an appealing way of life at all, or even a decadent one--messy and dull is more like it.The cast must be charismatic for a movie like this to work, but it is sadly inconsistent. Billy Crudup, as Hudson's would-be lover, seems to saunter through the film as though trying to be as handsome as possible, forgetting that he is supposed to act as well. But the most grating aspect of ""Almost Famous"" is everyone's favorite little ray of sunshine, the irrepressible Kate Hudson. Though nominated by the Acadamy as a supporting actress, Hudson takes up so much screen time she's all you'll remember by the time the end credits begin to roll (with her smiling golden face in the background). Crowe films her as though he can't tear her eyes away from her, and points out her beauty with every shot and musical cue, rather than letting the audience discover it for themselves. Gorgeously attired and carefully coifed, she has the appearance of a pampered starlet rather than that of the scrappy groupie she is supposedly playing. Only at one point does she stop smiling so angelically to let a forced frown and ""teary"" eye scream out, ""Look at me! I'm acting!"" (helped along by yet another extreme closeup from Crowe). After such a horrendous overdose, I don't think I ever want to see Kate Hudson in any movie again.There are a few bright spots in ""Almost Famous."" Zooey Deschanel is brilliant and tragically underused as always, but she remains one of those actresses who can steal a scene with the tiniest gesture and stay in the viewer's memory forever. Frances McDormand, of course, delivers a properly intense, nuanced, and hilarious performance, but even she doesn't crop up enough. Patrick Fugit, though a rather obvious actor, at least looks the part, and it's a delight to see Anna Paquin in anything, though her role is thankless and nearly lineless. She should have played Hudson's part; Paquin has more sensitivity and vulnerability in her brief cameos than Hudson manufactures throughout the entire movie. Jason Lee plays the oblivous blowhard as well as ever, and Fairuza Balk has a few great moments.See ""Almost Famous"" for the first ten minutes, which have virtually nothing to do with the rest of the movie but are brilliantly scripted and acted.

So they go at him, one at a time.In the next scene, William is shown sitting alone, weeping, with his face in his hands.The first time I saw the movie I didn't fully understand why the tears.I've just realized that he is crying because he was raped -- worse than raped, gang-banged.I know a lot of people will think this is crazy. We live in a society that believes it's impossible for a male to be raped by a female. After all, males are always willing, aren't they? Doesn't the presence of an erection prove it?

Penny Lane, even though she's supposed to be the most down-to-earth of all the band-aids/groupies, is actually the most hypocritical since she was screwing the guitarist the whole time. Also, she's one of those hot girls that knows she's hot and uses it to her advantage instead of being a genuine person. Which she is pretending to be in the first place.

People on here seem to either adore this movie with all of their heart, calling it ""My favourite film to watch over and over"" or they find that the movie was ""Almost Watchable"" or left them ""Almost Nauseous"". Normally I wouldn't even give a movie like Almost Famous a chance. I'd just skip past it while I skimmed for other choices. I wouldn't say that this movie has become one of my favourites, but I did enjoy it.The humour was down to earth and relatable, one prime example being when Dick hauls Russell out of that house party after he's jumped off the roof of said house into a pool while screaming priceless lines such as ""I'M ON DRUGS!"". The moment they have afterwards when a (more or less) sober manager tries to pull his lead guitarist's head out of a rosebush left me laughing because it is something I have experienced. I haven't pulled my friends out of strangers' house parties because they did so many drugs they couldn't see straight, but I have experienced the same relationship dynamic the semi-cautious manager and the rest of the band share. Dick Roswell is like an uncle who's been left with his sister's children for the week while she goes to Maui with her boyfriend. He's single, has zero experience with children, and is just doing his best, but he wants to do his best to let his sister have a break. So he watches the children like a hawk, but a teenage hawk. Or a drunk hawk. He seems like the type who would never say no unless it was guaranteed that his ""children"" would die in a very public and painful way. Most likely, he'd join the kids in their shenanigans because he is after all, a cool uncle. I enjoyed how the writers kept things simple, so that even if you started watching the movie from the middle (like I did) you would still be able to catch up and understand quite quickly. The characters seemed very human, although they were all childish in their own way, which contributed to the plot in great ways. I thought all of the acting was spot on (when I saw Frances McDormand I almost screamed). For the most part, it didn't feel like I was watching a bunch of people try to act like rock stars while they recite lines; I was transported into the film. I was kind of sketchy about the main character (Will) at first simply because I couldn't quite find myself emotionally engaged. But when I watched the movie a second time, the kid grew on me. He's just doing his best.The aesthetic and soundtrack were both very pleasing for me (I mean, come on, we had Simon & Garfunkel, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, etc). No complaints from me in that department. The story for the most part was predictable, but the little twist at the end saved it from turning a happy ending into a disturbingly pleasant one. So I would say, ""Almost Famous? More like ""Almost Far- Fetched.""",Almost Famous

However, there isn't one interesting shot in the whole movie and the director refuses to say something interesting, instead opting for the sacharine hollywood comedy-romance which is a failure nonetheless.  The viewer doesn't care about any of the characters, especially not Kate Hudson, who provides the side story.  With such great music to work with, the director instead opts to show us endless concert footage of a fictitious 60s band fronted by Jason Lee.  What a dumb idea.  The movie takes about an hour to tie up all the idiotic and unneccesary side stories since, you know, there aren't unhappy endings or chaos in real life, especially not in rock and roll.

I was of the same age as the character William Miller (way back) in 1973/74, and this flick feels so real.And Kate Hudson, wow, she is truly intoxicating as her role of the 'Band-Aid', Penny Lane.

481,jcarreonjc,"This is more of a critique about rock music, than a film review",7,2 April 2021,"Is it about the love for the music or is it about being loved? That is the question(s) I have in my head after watching this film. Rock musicians, who play in front of large audiences, have no doubt worked hard to get where they are. I believe that burning passion for their love for music glows very brightly. Cameron Crowe's script, which is understood to be a strong love affection about 70s rock music, illustrates that rock musicians have a burning desire to be loved just as much as for their love/passion for music. The band Stillwater, the primary fictitious rock band in Almost Famous, want more than anything to be loved by the general public. Jason Lee's character really illustrates this well during the film. Many musicians believe they are brilliant and their art is really important, but the band Stilllwater seem very cold and dark deep down. That is where I actually respect the ""enemy"" of rock bands, which is the rock journalists, at least an independent rock journalists. Critics are needed in our world. As Philip Seymour Hoffman, who portrayed music critic Lester Bangs, said ""We are the smarter ones"".I will rate this film at a 7 out of 10. I hated this band Stillwater after watching this film. I'm not sure if that was what Cameron Crowe was going for, but that is my feeling about this band after watching Almost Famous. The band's charisma really wore away pretty quickly. There was nothing brilliant about them, even though they believed themselves to be brilliant. I think Cameron Crowe wanted the audience to love this band and to think this era was music was fantastic. It had the opposite effect.Frances McDormand was absolutely at her best in this film. A loving, over-the-top mother, who is critical about everything, but critical and her actions make complete sense to the viewer. McDormand, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and to a lesser degree, but still effective, Jimmy Fallon, who was on point in his character as the high profile manager, were gems in this film. Unlike the draining self-indulgence band, Kate Hudson's Penny Lane character stayed pretty strong throughout the film. The whole film seems to be going at 100 M. P. H., but when Hudson is on the screen, the film slows down and the audience is able to breath and focus. The character even makes an overdose look poetic. Though Hudson is mysterious and doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense most of the time, her expressions say plenty and in turn make her a likeable character. She is almost like the Paul Simon in this world that is filled with Mick Jaggers and Roger Daltreys. As Paul Simon says, ""I don't want any part of this crazy love."" I think Penny Lane finally learns this at the end. Who knows, maybe Penny Lane bought Paul Simon's ""Graceland"" a decade later. The album is much better than any of those early 70s Rock albums that Cameron Crowe plays too much.",Almost Famous

This movie has a great combination of characters, plot, and story line which sucks you in and holds you to the end. The writer/director is kind to the inhabitants of this world -- my memories of the time contain much more back-biting, meanness, exploitation and more victims who were ""out of their element"" with the hard-core drugs. But it's a love story, not a documentary, so forget the vérité stuff -- I can't wait to watch it again.

It has an autobiographical basis which Cameron Crowe drew from his childhood / adolescence, when he used to be a huge rock fan and write for the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine. The story is about William, a 15 year old kid who leaves with the members of the rock band Stillwater to write an article about them while their tour: this trip will introduce him to a whole new world and - obviously - will change his life. There's nothing more, nothing less: ""Almost Famous"" is quite funny, it has a brilliant screenplay that works just fine, and everyone who was 20 and a rock 'n' roll maniac in the 70s will find it really entertaining. That's all. Patrick Fugit doesn't look like he's in total control of his character, but the rest of the cast is very good, especially Kate Hudson who looks really natural and appealing.

This is another story were it isn't about the story and is more about the characters and the journey.Patrick fugit is amazing as william an impressionable young boy who is flung in to this world of free love, music, sayings and nicknames on a tour that you wish will never end.Frances Mcdorman is so funny as williams strict mother who is a teacher and proclaims to her class rockstars have kidnapped my son before running out the room. And also a great performance from Zooey Deschanel as williams sister Anita.Billy Crudup, Jason lee are part of the band stillwater who are the up and coming rock band on the brink of stardom but as they get closer the fractures in their band start to appear and rivalries become apparent.Noah Taylor as Dick the bands manager is also funny .He has been with them since the beginning.
Also got to mention Jimmy Fallon for his character who takes over the band from Dick.Now my favourite characters are the band aides;
Kate Hudson as miss Penny Lane the funniest, free spirited groupie, she fell in love with music and never went home.
Anna Paquin as Polexia Aphrodisia is a sort of mysterious character we really don't find much about her but i am drawn to her.

He has to follow this fictional band called ""Stillwater"" and basically try and write an article on them. Half way through, he finds out that the stuff he's been exposed to is larger than even a cover story.Crowe masterfully blends a coming of age story along with his own experiences with the real world under the glitz and glamor that was ""Rock N' Roll"".A movie that's worth your time.

There may be other movies dealing with the same theme but this one manages to show everything in a very heartwarming and natural way. Perhaps the physical charms of two main characters (Russell and Penny, played by Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson) also say their words here.

With his character, I feel the films way of portraying teenagers is fairly accurate, because I can relate to being an uncomfortable and shy kid discovering music and all that it has to offer. The cinematography and art direction in Almost Famous was also fantastic, each and every shot was beautiful, and looked like it really was filmed in 1973. The music and script were great, the shots and costumes were perfect; Almost Famous is a must see film that really gives one a look into one of the greatest times of the 20th century.",Almost Famous
492,fyona-03838,I thought this movie was really good.,8,10 March 2016,"I personally really liked this movie; I thought it had multiple aspects that made it a really good movie. I thought the soundtrack had a very big impact on the movie and the soundtrack is one major reason why I enjoyed this film. I listen to bands like pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Police, Rolling Stones, and more; so I really enjoyed the soundtrack. I thought that it had many characters that had multiple layers. The guitarist; you think he is just a guy who cares about sex, drugs, parties, and being famous; but, in the end he allows William to write his article for Rolling Stone and telling the truth about the band ""stillwater"". Penny Lane, a ""bandaid"" that is having sex with the lead guitarist and ends up developing feelings for him is able to forget about Russell and the band and fulfil her dream by moving to Morocco. And Finally, William, a innocent 15 year old who starts the film viewing the members of ""stillwater"" just as celebrities, but in the end he is in love with Penny Lane and has become a friend of Russell. I think another reason why I, and many others, enjoy this film is because of the ending. Not all movies need to have a happy ending, some movies are better because of a tragic event; Titanic, Romeo and Juliette, and more. But, the happy ending in this movie leaves you with a positive opinion on Russell, you witness Penny picking a Friend (William) over a lover (Russell). The ending makes all the experiences and everything William had to sacrifice worth it. I think this film was really good, and I would be interested watching another movie like it.",Almost Famous

His sister is sick of their mom and William saw a chance to do whatever he wanted to do. William Miller is a 15 year old music writer in the 1970s. Given the dream assignment of going on the road with band Stillwater for a Rolling Stone feature, he was looking forward to going to the trip, although his mom didn't want to. Once he was on the road, he finds his life changing forever. He lived a life that no every kid could have. He knows the famous people and he becomes friends with them. There is a really nice part of the movie when all of them but Penny Lane are in the plane and they think that they are going to die. They started saying all the things they wanted to say before truly, they didn't die actually. One of them let William write about them, about all the things they do.

This isn't the kind of movie that has you on the edge of your seat, it's the kind that makes you sit back and smile as you appreciate the simple story that takes you back in time to one of the best decades of Rock and Roll. Almost Famous is a movie that follows the life of a young 15 year old boy, William Miller. We watch as he is introduced to the world of Rock and Roll and we fall in love with him as he falls in love with the music. When William meets music journalist, critic, and author, Lester Bangs, he is sent on a journey way out of his comfort zone. He embarks on a quest to interview the rock band Stillwater with the hopes of getting them on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. He gets the chance of a lifetime where he is able to experience firsthand the lives of rock stars behind the scenes.I've found that a lot of people find the movie to be rather boring because of its ""dull"" and ""uncomplicated"" main character. What I don't think they realize is that the movie is about so much more than just one person. It's about the culture and the music of the time period. It's about the relationship of the band members and their love of music. It's about Penny Lane, the girl with the astonishing goddess like looks that never fail to attract anyone and everyone that dare step into her path. William Miller is merely the eyes through which we are able to gaze into past and the lives of the characters as they thrive in the vibrant environment they call home.What I love so much about the movie is its simplicity. While the uncomplicated and straightforward story pushes some people away, it draws people like me in. The music is great, the characters are lovable, and the humour is relatable and level headed, but I think the biggest reason why this movie is one of my all-time favourites is the fact that it's so laid back, easy, and just plain fun to watch.",Almost Famous

I also liked the story line and to me it had plot twists and things that totally blew my mind and I didn't imagine happening. My favourite part of the movie was either when the plane was crashing and they all started to fight. Or when Russell ended up going to Williams house instead of Penny Lanes. I believe the director was trying to set a Happy mood. I believe this because there were struggles along the way for William not getting his article done for the Rolling Stone in time. When he did get it done everyone said it wasn't true what he wrote. But in the end his article made the cover and he was reconnected with Russell. I believe this film is targeted towards later teenager to early twenties. I think this because I feel it gives a ""hard work will pay off"" kind of setting. This is a movie.

Actually, it's not. There isn't really anything about his actual writing process. Or how he progresses getting jobs based on his writing. There are a couple vaguely comical telephone calls he has with an editor at Rolling Stone who hands him everything on a silver platter and that's about it. It's not about writing\being a critic\journalism, nor about a young person conning\proving himself to others.This movie is about rock music. Actually, even though the movie is about him covering ONE main band, there is virtually no performance scenes. There is no song-writing\practicing. There isn't much about music to be honest. The film starts with Hoffmann being a ROCK rock critic all about music etc. for whom its never too early to play Search and Destroy by Iggy and the Stooges. There is also montage of the main character going through a lot of rock albums. During the movie, the most heard song probably is Elton John's TINY DANCER! The movie is not about rock music, it is not about a band (interactions between band members? most of them are barely characters in the film), and it's not really about music in general.What is the movie about?

THEN came Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous.Regardless, this movie is filled with emotion and subtlety. The scene where Penny Lane learns that she was sold for a case of beer and $50 made my heart stop. Katie Holmes is that rarest of Hollywood actors.

One of the few justices dispensed by the academy was not nominating this film for the much hoped for best picture award. I feel that this movie was one of the most overrated films of 2000. First, I cannot fathom Kate Hudson's appeal as an actress. She looks great on screen, but I couldn't bring myself to believe anything she did or said. And Fugit was not only boring and lifeless but it felt like he himself had no idea what he was doing on the screen. Now on the reverse side, Crudup was fantastic, projecting the air of a charismatic but tortured rock star perfectly. Frances McDormand was brilliant once again, and brought much humor to her small role. And Philip Seymour Hoffman proved his utter dominance of any role by chameleon-like slipping himself into the skin of Miller's mentor, a music magazine editor. In conclusion, the movie's tag line fits more aptly as a self-descriptive warning than towards the rock-star life.

518,JMBasquiat,A beautiful love-letter to the 1970s and rock from a director who was really there...,10,14 November 2005,"Inspired by Cameron Crowe's real-life experiences as a unusually young rock journalist in the 1970s, ""Almost Famous"" is the tale of fifteen-year-old William Miller (Fugit in his debut) who, through an odd, funny yet believable chain of events, finds himself on tour with fictional up-and-coming rock act Stillwater - much to the disapproval of his over-bearing but caring mother (McDormand).Having got a position writing for underground magazine Creem under the wing of legendary critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman who makes great things of a small but important role) William gets an offer to work for the big boys at Rolling Stone who are unaware of his age, assuming from the maturity of his writing he's in his twenties.Taking to the road with Stillwater, William find himself caught in the tension of inter-band politics, making friends with guitarist Russell Hammond (Crudup), meeting the beautiful and fascinating groupies (or band-aids as they prefer to call themselves) who follow the band, Penny Lane (Hudson) in particular. Falling under the spell of charisma these 'cool' people (who he has come to idolise have) William's journalistic integrity is put to the test.Simply put, Almost Famous is a joy to experience, especially for fans of music of the era. This is very clearly an extremely personal piece for Crowe and every frame radiates love and nostalgia.I could not highlight any performance for being sub-par, in fact most are remarkably good. Fugit portrays William's intelligent but naive character wonderfully and Kate Hudson seems born to play Penny (a young, beautiful, confident young woman who is in love with a rock star being played by the daughter of Hollywood royalty? A perfect choice) and she does a great job.Unsurprisingly the music is also wonderful - a typical feature on Crowe's films. Both the soundtrack and the incidental music are fabulous.Watch it and enjoy! The ""Untitled"" Director's Cut with 35 minutes of extra footage is highly recommended!",Almost Famous

523,bhuttu,"Great script, but the rest is not up to it",6,20 January 2006,"When one talks about this movie, it is absolutely necessary to have a quick run through the 70's in his own vision, and then compare it to that of the movie. For me, the 70's mean the real birth of rock music and at the same time, the decade with the best music so far. So for that only, I was thrilled when I heard mentioned names like Led Zeppelin, Humble Pie, Iggy Pop, The Doors and so on... A great character is Vic, the greatest Led Zeppelin fan. And a great idea is to have him say ""They're here! Led Zeppelin are in this hotel!"". It gives a feeling of authenticity hard to get by other means.The facts and lifestyle depicted are the exact copy of what we think about the 70's now, but I'm sure that those that lived through that period will find some slight exaggerations here and there.The script is definitely a great one, and my personal opinion is that the movie itself is not up to it.The cinematography sometimes gives a feeling of sloppiness, but that could well be intended that way. The concert scene really looks like a 70's rock concert shot with the 70's cinematographic means. I'm not into it, but I'm not saying that this approach is not a good one.Unlike most people, I found the acting performances of the lead characters not very good. Kate Hudson is not a good actress, and this shows once again. Her character has a very strong depiction and some great lines, but she's not up to it.Same goes for Billy Crudup, starring here as Russell Hammond, the guitarist and lead performer of the band which the movie talks about, Stillwater (a made up name). The whole plot is wrapped around his character, and Billy Crudup made me believe he can't carry on with it.But there are really some really good performances of the supporting cast. William Miller, the kid whose eyes we're witnessing the action with, is embodied in an absolutely fantastic manner. Phlip Seymour Hoffman as the never-accomplished journalist, Jason Lee as the lead singer of the band and Noah Taylor as band's first manager are all great, despite their small roles.As a conclusion, I liked the movie, but mainly because I like 70's music. I don't think its success is deserved.",Almost Famous

525,adriana_nav,rock n roll diaries,8,27 November 2007,"Almost Famous The classic story of many rock bands to date, film follows a band named Stillwater from their humble beginnings through their road to stardom. The film is seen in the eyes of a very intelligent young boy who's love of Rock and Roll was started by his older sister. His sister who's rebellious ways caused her to leave her strict household was always somewhat of a role model to him. Williams mother was very strict and very much set on her ways but having her daughter leave her really opened her eyes and made her raise William somewhat more leniently.He is a very intelligent young man who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to write for Rolling Stone. He gets to follow an up an coming band in their road to stardom and on the way meets a self titled ""Band-aid"" named Penny Lane. She is a free spirited groupie who refuses such a title and instead calls herself a fan of the music. It is Penny who introduces William to this wild life of Rock and Roll. His assignment is to go on tour with the band for a couple of days, but the band members are such party animals that they are always putting off any type of actual interview. This gets to be a problem for William since in Journalism it always helps to have actual quotes from the source the worst part of it all is that he actually becomes friends with the band so when it comes down to actually writing his story and revealing the groups downfalls he can't do it.Media in those days was different from today in the sense that before there was less available press time for bands as opposed to now where there are way too many media outlets for an upcoming band or singer. The many media outlets however don't mean that it is easy for a band to get press there is just a lot more of it. Now in days there are even celebrities who have gotten famous of sites like Myspace.com. Lilly Allen for example is a star from the UK who started posting her music on myspace, a talent agent heard it and now she's relatively famous and is signed to a major record label. Our growing media source however has changed negatively when it comes to celebrities privacy. In the movie William is reluctant to publish any negative remarks about the band so because of his reluctance the world may or may not find out exactly what went on behind the scenes. Now in days that would never happen because someone would leak the story to US weekly or some other tabloid and the story would be everywhere within hours.",Almost Famous
526,devildevine,Almost Famous? Almost Perfect.,10,1 August 2003,"(Caution! Slight (very slight) spoilers ahead, read at own risk!)Being born in the late 80's I didn't really have an appreciation for the music before my time. I considered it a boring slush of guitar with long-haired men in tight pants. Not until I saw Almost Famous, listened to real music, did I have an appreciation for it. Almost Famous is the critically acclaimed film from Director Cameron Crowe (the guy who brought us Jerry Maguire). Mr. Crowe hits all the right notes, giving us Drama and Comedy in a light-hearted blend that lets us sit back and enjoy. Almost Famous is the story of a young boy (William Miller), who with great luck gets a chance to go on the road and interview a rock band, Stillwater. The movie shows all of his trials and tribulations as he tries to prove that he is old enough to be part of the Rock 'n Roll crowd, and we watch as he grows into a responsible young man. On the way, William (played by Patrick Fugit), meets many interesting and captivating people including Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), Miss Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and is trailed relentlessly by his over-protective mother whose motto is ""Don't Do Drugs!""The movie takes us into the Rock 'n Roll industry, but that is not the core of the film. We are given the story of a young boy trying to make it in a world full of big people, and Patrick Fugit plays the role of William very well. He's smart, honest, trustworthy and naive; something that Lester Bangs warns him about. One of the greatest assets to the film is the acting. Patrick Fugit, as previously mentioned, has an incredible breakthrough role as William. Phillip Seymour Hoffman never fails to disappoint as Lester Bangs the world famous rock critic. Billy Crudup is great as guitarist of Stillwater Russell Hammond, and Frances McDormand shows once again how talented as an actress she is. One actor I have yet to mention particularly stole the show, and I am indeed talking about Kate Hudson as the enchanting Penny Lane. Hudson slips into the role perfectly, and I'll be damned if she wasn't Penny Lane in a past life. She's sexy, enchanting, mesmerizing, bubbly, and is able to get the attention of a room by just stepping through the door. One scene particularly stands out when William says, ""Somebody who sold you to Humble Pie for 50 bucks and a case of beer?"", and Penny replies ""What kind of beer?"" The way that Hudson acted that scene was absolutely breathtaking and I personally feel that she was robbed of an Oscar. But this movie, aside from having the great costume design, set design, amazing screenplay, and brilliant acting, does have flaws. The flaws, though so small they are, are to be mentioned. I think that one scene involving a plane crash is not needed, but the second time seeing it I found it mildly comical.In conclusion, I feel that Almost Famous is an amazing movie that picked me up and took me on the ride of a lifetime. The screenplay, acting, filming, directing, everything was so well done that I had to get nitpicky. The most lovable things are never perfect, nothing ever is; but Almost Famous?

Ang Lee's masterpiece, ""The Ice Storm"" is certainly one. ""Almost Famous"", which takes place the in same year,(1973), accomplishes this with such personal grace, it is astounding. As someone who photographed rock stars in concert about that time, I found myself wonderfully back in that moment. Mr. Crowe's flawless directing and John Toll, ASC's radiant, flowing cinematography touch the soul without calling attention to themselves. This is the essence of narrative movie-making.

His mother was also a key character in making the movie more fun to watch, as she arouses tension and inner conflict within our main character because he had to pick over staying with Stillwater or coming right back home to attend his graduation as his mother wishes. Of course I also have to say something about music, as music is a main pillar of the movie- the use of music was excellent; it portrayed both the time period and the story of the movie, although I didn't think it was the 100% 'perfect' song for this movie.",Almost Famous

531,danielparkinsisawanker,Good movie with well written characters,8,11 March 2016,Almost Famous was the story about a guy who gets the chance to be a rock and roll journalist and gets to hang out with rock stars much to his mothers displeasure. The characters mostly feel very dynamic and round like our protagonist William who while excited to do this is also very nervous and dose not want to get into all the trouble that's happening around him. I feel that Kate Hudson's character penny lane helped move the story forward and is really responsible for William getting into this whole adventure. I feel like the singer Russel impeded the film a bit for me since it didn't seem that he had any meaningful growth or change. I believe The Director was trying to set an upbeat mood but one that wasn't afraid to go into serious moments and issues. I believe this movie is targeted to rock and roll fans those who grew up with it and those who know it because of their parents. I believe this is a film because while being entertaining it has some real messages about what the music industry is like and what it does to people.

532,kylorenawakens,"Real, man. Real.",10,7 July 2018,"Almost Famous is my favourite movie in the world. It has been my personal favourite for almost two years now. In fact, at the time of writing this review, it's a week before the two years in which I've been saying it's my favourite film. This and The Breakfast Club. Anyway, what makes this my particular favourite? Here are some reasons:The seemingly endless brilliant moments. The over-abundance of laughs. The brilliant, stand-out performances. On-screen chemistry between actors/actresses. The film's beginning; and its ending. The characters and their stories (particularly William, Penny Lane, and Russell). The music/soundtrack. I could go on and on, manRussell Hammond is so cool by the way.Here's the review. 
[insight:]So William Miller's your above-average-IQ sorta kid whose expertise lies in Journalism. He's given the opportunity to get out on the road with an upcoming rock band called 'Stillwater.' He's given a shot at writing for Rolling Stone Magazine. Crazy. It's beautifully written, it's compelling and it's so hilarious. So many scenes have you laughing or just entertained. But there's more serious than there is funny, which is astounding given the amount of great laughs that are showcased throughout the film. One scene in particular is the scene where Russell and William go to a very-70's styled house party. I won't say what happens but it's pretty damn funny, and oddly heart-warming (more so towards the end of the scene). It's just fantastic. The acting is all-round superb and I love the film as a whole. Terrific directing from Cameron Crowe too.

536,maureenvreeburg-18726,A personal favourite!,10,8 September 2018,"I have watched Almost Famous quite a few times. It was recommended to me by a fellow music lover. 
The reason I fell in love with this movie is very personal I think. I am the kind of person who would do nothing rather than being part of the music world, just like William. As a music photographer I have a similar dream as William to go on the road with bands. I can see a lot of myself in William, although he is quite a bit younger. It is also so easy for music fans to idealize their favourite musicians and a lot of people fantasize about befriending their idols. Can't say I haven't! This movie shows the tough parts about the music world. I think it is a very honest movie. This is not just another movie about the life of musicians. It shows a complete other side, the perspective of a young guy with a dream to become a music journalist and be part of that world, and the perspective of a diehard fan, Penny Lane. This is what makes the movie so interesting to me.
This film tells the truth about how hard it is to actually become one of them, instead of the bands just wanting something from you, like William had. They just wanted good publicity. It's so hard for William, also how they call the press 'The Enemy'. It also really got to me how Lester Bangs kept saying you can't become friends with them. To them he was just a fan and a writer and nothing more. Just like Penny Lane, it was almost too easy for Russel to ditch Penny Lane. I also really think the performance of Patrick Fugit was amazing. How he portrayed the character of William, being awkward and insecure, it's brilliant. Also Kate Hudson does an amazing job, I found it so easy to empathize with her.",Almost Famous

Even though the story has been done before (what story hasn't) I think the one thing this movie has going for it is the main character William. I can remember how it was to be the one in school who was the outcast and William was just that type. Anyone who has been like him knows that they would feel the same way he did, from being the outcast to being with the hero's of music. This movie conveyed that feeling of being suddenly special along with being the mirror for not just a band but the part of success that tests friendships and being able to stay with the purity of your dreams.",Almost Famous
539,elduderno,best feel good movie of the 21st century,10,4 September 2006,"Almost Famous is a feel good movie about a young teen, William Miller, who wants to be a rock journalist during the 1970's. William is soon sucked into the rock world and assigned to do a piece on emerging hot band Stillwater.The movie has so many terrific scenes. Some that I think are up there with the best in cinema history. If you don't love this movie I don't think you have a pulse. The acting is tremendous from Frances McDormand to Kate Hudson to a underrated performance from Jason Lee. Patrick Fugit is good as Miller. But the two best acts go to Phillip Seymour Hoffman as rock and roll junkie Lester Biggs and Billy Crudup as lead guitarist Russell Hammond. The writing for the two characters are unbelievable and the dialouge the share with Miller is brilliant. It's a shame neither of them got an award for there role. The character's like Anita, Sapphire, Dick, and Jeff Bebe are not noticeable if you watch it just watch the movie only once, but if you watch it again and again you'll see the are just as good as the other's. Crowe deffently deserved the written Oscar for this one, because it is truly heartwarming.Every time I see it I laugh and just flat out enjoy it. This is the most touching movie since Forrest Gump I believe. It is a movie for any music fan and anybody that enjoys a good movie about growing up and finding your place in the world.",Almost Famous
540,brenhow,an impressive coming-of-age story that ranks with Crowe's best work,10,8 September 2000,"Rolling Stone held an advance screening of Cameron Crowe's newest film in Boston and I was among the lucky few who were able to attend. Crowe's ""Say Anything..."" is my favorite movie of all time, so I feared that it may suffer by comparison. While ""Singles"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" are both worthy efforts, they didn't hit me in the gut. ""Almost Famous"" delivered the goods. Anyone who ever had a rock 'n' roll fantasy should see this movie.Drawing from his own experiences as a teenage rock critic for Rolling Stone, Crowe has essentially crafted a road movie where our hero (Patrick Fugit) is struggling to get an interview with a rock star so he can fly back to his nervous mother and finish high school. Fugit, a newcomer who carries the weight of the film on his shoulders, shines alongside old pros like Billy Crudup and Frances McDormand. All three created multidimensional characters that will linger in my memory for a long time. The character roles by Jason Lee, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kate Hudson and others are just as rich. You will fall in love with everyone who hits the screen, and you will laugh like crazy as a result.The sharp dialogue in Cameron Crowe's screenplays has led him to be described as a filmmaker for writers. That label disregards his talent for drawing great performances from actors: most of the ""Almost Famous"" cast turned in the best work of their career. My high regard for ""Say Anything"" notwithstanding, I'm starting to believe that Crowe did the same.",Almost Famous
541,Pessimisticynic,This move shines!,10,17 September 2000,"I've always been a huge fan of Cameron Crowe but I was a bit skeptical of his latest effort, ""Almost Famous.""  Having been based on his adolescence, I didn't expect much but once again, this movie reaffirmed in my mind that Cameron Crowe can make little moments so touching.  Crowe's writing and the subtle(and sometimes loud) performances by an all around wonderful cast make ""Almost Famous"" a pleasure to watch and soak in.  This is definitely the best movie of the year and deserves all the praise it has been given. Oh, and keep an eye out for Billy Crudup in a STAR-making role as Russell.  He steals the show....****stars",Almost Famous

I kept saying, ""Let's go folks, I'm not getting any younger!"" as it dragged in parts. It could have easily been cut to an hour and a half and kept the audience more involved.

And I would have to say this is Cameron Crowe's best work, he even wrote some of the songs sung by the band Stillwater! Kate Hudson, playing the part of Penny Lane, what a performance. Billy Crudup another great performance. I am going to keep this short, go see this work of art.

Honestly, the whole cast is amazing and even though I don't exactly care for some of the actors, I didn't mind them in this film. Jason Lee was wonderful, as always, but this time in a different sort of character than I've seen him play in the past.. which is good, being diverse is always an asset to an actor. His singing voice is beautiful and he and Billy Crudup have great rock star attitude. Kate Hudson was amazing, I'd only see her in 200 Cigarettes and so was shocked to see her play a much more deep and sad role. This movie was funny, touching, sweet, and believable.",Almost Famous

The film comes out officially in two days--and I hope everyone realizes what a terrific movie this is and goes out to see it.  I've been looking forward to this film ever since I saw the trailers, and I was NOT disappointed in the least.  Fugit was fantastic, considering his relative lack of experience. Francis McDormand was great as his nagging mom...pretty much everyone was great.  Cameron Crowe scores another hit--and one that is apparently 97% autobiographical, he says.  They had a live feed talk-back session from NYU with him after the screening...This movie is seriously about stuff he did when he was 15...How cool is that?Anyway, I hope everyone goes to see this movie..I'm sure you will be as pleased with it as I am...I'll probably even go to see it again on Friday!",Almost Famous
547,SpamfishHanso,Almost Perfect,10,30 November 2000,"AT the end of Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical piece the question is asked `What do you like about music?' So I ask you this `What do you like about films?' If your answer is action, sex and fart jokes, this is a movie to stay well away from.  If, however, you like films about growing up, tasting life and finding your place in the world, this is one you should not miss.The story tells the tale of William Miller, a 15-year-old aspiring journalist who finds himself working for Rolling Stone, covering the 1973 tour of an almost famous band called Stillwater.  Clutching seemingly forever onto a notebook and pen, William immerses himself into the culture of the rock star, and ultimately finds out as much about himself than the feuding rock band he is sent to expose. Whilst getting down on paper just exactly what makes a rock band tick, William has to struggle with his first experiences of love, rejection, fitting in and being cool.The major strong point is the universally superb acting.  Patrick Fugit as the young writer holds the screen with striking authority without falling into over acting, reminiscent of John Cusack in one of Crowe's earlier films, Say Anything.  He is aptly supported by Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's daughter, as the object of William's affection, whose character has arguably the finest scene in the film.  Frances McDormand is excellent as the over-bearing mother whose constant protection of her children ultimately drives them away from home in search of there own answers to life's questions.  Billy Cudrup and Jason Lee shine as the bickering wannabe rock superstars, neither of them happy with their positions within the band and finding it all too easy to complain about each other's falterings. However, the star of the show is Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Williams mentor Lester Bangs, a man who has an opinion on all facets of the music world. His lyrical waxings are the core of Williams's journey, from  `Hey, I met you. You are not cool.' to `If you wanna be a true journalist, you cannot make friends with the rockstar.'The film itself has a sumptuous look, complimented by an almost painless attention to detail.  The script is fabulous, with lines to make you laugh, cry and most importantly, think as the story charts the ups and downs of the fictional rock band.  This, however, is the source of my only gripe as the story tends towards the formulaic, with the ending that the film seems to be avoiding coming true in the last moments.  But this flaw is more than compensated by Crowe's deft direction, and his ability to pull together all the loose strands already mentioned into one cohesive whole.Better than Crowes' previous effort, Jerry Maguire, yet not quite achieving the same iconic status as Say Anything, Almost Famous is nonetheless a film that I urge you to see.  It sure makes a welcome break from films only concerned with being as gross or as violent as the censors will allow.",Almost Famous
548,SlickDaddy,"A fine, fine film",10,18 September 2000,"ALMOST FAMOUS is another fine work from Cameron Crowe.  Part rock fable, period piece, road picture, family drama, and love story, this film works best as three intertwined coming-of-age stories: those of young journalist William Miller (Patrick Fugit), rock guitarist and uncertain star Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and ethereal groupie (sorry; ""Band Aid"") Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).Tremendous performances from Hudson, Crudup and Fugit are backed by strong supporting efforts from Frances McDormand (as William's fretful mother), Jason Lee (as lead singer Jeff Bebe) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as legendary rock critic Lester Bangs).Fugit, in his first major feature, exhibits great talent for reacting to his surroundings in an appealing, interesting way; you almost always know what he's feeling, just from a look, and you can often begin to feel right along with him.Kate Hudson's performance will surely be remembered come award season.  Her ability to shift the mood of a scene through one long close-up (see the ""case of beer"" scene with William near the end of the film for the best example) is a prime indicator of the talent she is just beginning to unveil for the film world; look for even greater things from her in the future.",Almost Famous

""Saving Private Ryan"" showed the horrors of war without leaving any stone unturned, and gave me a better understanding of it,its realism made the movie great. And thats what makes ""Almost Famous"" one of the best movies of the year, its realism. ""Almost Famous"" is one of the most heartfelt, funny and entertaining movies of the year and Cameron Crowe never misses a point and is at the top of his game with this one, which also shows his movies just get better and better everytime.In short I would love to recommend this movie to anybody who loves movies and on a side note, if this movie is passed up for best picture it will be the biggest upset since ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to ""Shakespere in Love"".",Almost Famous

This movie offered up many things, not just a good cast, with good acting, but wait a good story? Is this out of Hollywood? Yes it is! Not only that, kudos to the boys and girls up at Dreamwork's on the soundtrack! Its a literal Who's Who (sorry couldn't resist the pun) of 70's rock bands!You don't have to be a rock fan of 70's music (it does help though) you don't even have to understand the 70's music movement in America to enjoy this film. What you will get is a good solid movie.  Plain and simple entertainment, telling a good story. I give it a 9 out of 10 stars, lacking only a closing tempo towards the ending.

551,Gaberiel-2,Incindiary... absolutely wonderful...,10,8 July 2003,"One of the best ever made.Having seen this film several times I find myself falling in love with it over and over again. Living in the Netherlands I read about this movie long before it was released over here. and to be honest. I didn't know what to think of it. Could a story about an upcoming band really be worth my time.?? Was I wrong to doubt it.After seeing Jerry Maguire (I liked it, didn't love it). I became curious about Cameron Crowe. then when I heard he based this film his own coming of age story I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. booked me some theatre tickets and set out for an evening at the movies.A short outline.A young boy (Patrick Fugit) dreams of becoming a music journalist. All of a sudden he gets a phone call from Rolling Stone magazine giving him an assignment, not knowing he's only a boy. William goes on tour with upcoming band Stillwater to write the story for rolling stone. On his journey to write the story he learns about love and life in general. resulting in his coming of age. and having to decide between his new found friends and his integrity as an aspiring writer.I have to hand it to Crowe. I haven't seen many movies that felt so true to everything. The setting was perfect as was the casting. with mostly unknown actors (aside from Frances McDormand) Crowe brought an almost forgotten era back to life. Patrick Fugit is perfect as  the shy inexperienced young man going out to meet the world, Frances McDormand is wonderful as the overprotective mother, Billy Crudup is incendiary as the cool but sometimes troubled Russell Hammond; leader of Stillwater and Kate Hudson is magical as beautiful Band-Aid Penny Lane.The script is witty written. it's funny when it has to be yet never loses its serious (in a light way) undertone. It's full of memorable lines. my favorite would be a line by Philip Seymour Hoffman's character (Lester Bangs): `The only true currency in this bankrupt world...is what you share with someone else when you're uncool'.  And there are many more like it.The biggest praise however has to go to the brilliant soundtrack. From the very first moment when William's sister plays `America' by Simon and Garfunkel until the very end credits the movie is filled with nostalgic and wonderful music.Minor Spoilers.I just have to go into my favorite scene in the movie. The bus scene. When William and Russell get on the bus after Russell and the band had a fight. As they drive off `Tiny Dancer' by Elton John begins to play. And without saying anything the differences are resolved simply by singing along to Tiny Dancer. I get goose bumps even thinking about it.End Minor Spoilers.All in all it's a brilliant movie with an amazing soundtrack. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who knows what it feels like to grow up. and the choices that have to be made. Definitely in my top 10 movies ever.10/10.",Almost Famous

It has wonderful acting, great cinematography, and really excellent writing. It is full of moments of hilarity as well as depth, and also moments of pure exhilaration (the concert scenes had me groovin' in my seat, the music felt like heat pumping through my veins). The pacing and the ups and downs of the scenes kept me captivated the whole time. This is truly a balanced, well rounded movie.I saw this movie with my father and we both loved it.

Billy Crudup has Oscar written all over his performance, and this should finally be his breakthrough film.

The acting, cinematography, music...everything about this film is truly ""entertaining"" which is what going to the movies used to be about.  The brief displays of nudity are tasteful and appropriate, as is the language etc.  Unlike other movies of this type (i.e. The Commitments, That Thing You Do), this is not just another band movie. The wide gamut of rock and roll is exemplified and the music selections are wonderful. The movie allows viewers to gain not only insight into the music industry, but more importantly, the role that industry played (and continues to) in the lives of an entire generation. The acting is phenomenal.  Billy Cudrup IS Russell Hammond. This movie creates not only a band (Stillwater) but an entire world.

556,swindsnes,Q: How does a great film get better? A: Read on...,10,19 December 2001,"Let me begin by saying that when I first saw this movie my first response was ""I can't wait to see that again!""  When the DVD first released I relished the opportunity to watch it at my leisure.  But now with the Director's Cut available, I honestly don't know how any movie will compare.The theatrical edition is wonderful in its sweet and innocent take on the rock and roll life style.  The affection that Cameron Crowe holds for the woman Penny Lane is based on is remarkable.  For intellectuals everywhere this movie is inspiring in the belief that you can be cool.Everything great about the original version is amplified in the director's cut.  While basically the same movie you walk away with a far better understanding of every single character and why they were important to young William Miller.  You also walk away far more attached to each character. Characters that were mere extras in the original version shine and truly impact the film.  Anna Paquin and Jimmy Fallon in particular become increasingly visible and important.  I felt that Jason Lee's performance was enhanced and would have been Oscar worthy in its entirety.Fans of Almost Famous are doing themself a great disservice not buying the new DVD.  People who were mixed about the film, give it a try in the new version.  For those who haven't seen the picture, well I can't recommend it enough.  Do yourself a favor and see any version of this film you can.",Almost Famous
557,Gid-8,Impossible not to enjoy,10,8 March 2001,"This film is both a eulogy for a bygone age (the mid 70s) and an intimate portrait of aspiring journalist William Miller's coming of age, as he follows up-and-coming rock band Stillwater around the USA.  The young cast is excellent - Patrick Fugit shoulders the pivotal role with unassuming ease, Billy Crudup is a convincing guitar hero, Jason Lee is engaging as ever and Kate Hudson sparkles as the head ""Band Aid"".
Many scenes in the film are wish fulfillment writ large - the tourbus, the backstage parties, the hotel rooms and the groupies.  However, the moments of abandon are tempered with displacement and loneliness for William as he tries to shake off his sheltered upbringing.  Watching this process is often funny and sometimes painful, but even in its darker moments the film is shot through with warmth and affection.An immaculate soundtrack complements the action perfectly.  From the very beginning the music works with the sets, clothes and haircuts, to transport the viewer back to the 1970s.  This is the most unashamedly enjoyable film I have seen in a long time.  Stellar script, soundtrack, performances, and direction will make you feel 18....well, 17....OK - 16 again.",Almost Famous
558,gokari,Almost Famous is almost perfect,10,16 March 2001,"Cameron Crowe's graceful elegy to his rock music roots is that rare gem which never falters. Beautifully cast, shot and directed, it's as close to perfect as movies get.""Almost Famous"" centers around William Miller, an earnest, honest 15-year-old kid with an overprotective mother. Miller is a budding rock journalist who gets noticed by an editor at Rolling Stone magazine. Before long he finds himself on assignment touring with the fictional band ""Stillwater."" Hounded by his mother's admonishments to avoid drugs, William tries to maintain his journalistic integrity even as he is drawn into the lives of the band members and their extended family.Guiding William is his mentor, legendary music critic Lester Bangs, whose observations bring the times clearly into focus: ""You are coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll."" Music is about to collide with money, and America's idealism will be washed away.""Almost Famous"" seems relatively untouched by that loss of idealism: it is fresh, funny, touching and ultimately redeeming. This is a coming of age story set to music, and in that way it is reminiscent of Crowe's earlier films. In this one, however, Crowe goes deeper and the result is much stronger, honest movie. I found myself laughing out loud and crying painfully in more than one scene. By the end, my heart felt lighter, happier and younger.Remarkable performances by Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kate Hudson anchor the film, and a great score and soundtrack move it along perfectly.Some marketing snafu kept this film from finding its audience at the theater - hopefully that will be remedied as people find this film and embrace it.

All you kids out there, the 70's weren't like this! There was some great music, and bands like we will never see again. But the drug use was still heavy. And the drinking.

It deals with the inner workings of complex relationships at a time when popular culture was diversifying in small town America.Based on a true story Crowe brings the detail of experience into a narrative about the rock bands of the 1970's and the people attached to them.One of the strongest points in the film is to note that without the 'fan', the band is nothing. In tis case the fans are what keeps the band going and pushes them further in spirit than they themselves can predict.The visuals are strong - especially the concert scenes. The musical score accompanying the visuals is the kind of mood enhancement that tingles - see the bus ride scene with Elton John's Tiny Dancer being sung. Beautiful, Engaging, and happy.The actors are very good in this film too. Working well together they make the film believable and acceptable.This film was obviously made by a group of people ready to share emotion and empathy for a time in history not too long ago that we all know a bit about.

568,puebloknockers3,All I have to say is that this movie is awesome.,10,3 December 2002,"Almost Famous is one of my most favorite movies and I do not understand how someone can not like it.  There is so much to it that you can't get off saying the acting is bad.  I think Frances McDormond does the best in this film, followed by Philip Seymour Hoffman and then the new comer, Patrick Fugit.  Their characters contribute to the movie in their own little ways that make it great.Who better to play an insane headcase of a mother than Frances McDormond?  She does an excellent job and literally does ""freak me out"" as felt by more than one character in the film.  But like William says, ""She means well.""  She is a perfect adult figure in the movie because she is practically the only one.Philip Seymour Hoffman is just great.  Even if he did not have the most lines because of the flu, his character makes William feel a part of something.  He gives him so much great advice and is funny on top of that.  He is just great as the drugged up rock critic and I praise his work on this film.This being his first major role in a movie, I give Patrick Fugit the most credit for doing so well.  It is imperative that the fans of Almost Famous see Untitled, the director's original cut of the film, because it shows so much more about the characters and who they are.  The viewer gets a deeper look into Penny Lane's situation and just adds minor details that clear a lot of things up.The soundtrack is awesome as well.  I absolutely love this type of music because it is true and pure rock and roll.  I wish I had lived through the seventies just to experience The Who, Led Zeppelin, Styx, Bob Dylan, and everyone else who contributed to the making of the band Stillwater.And finally, I believe that many people should look passed the small quirks of the movie.  They are not just stuck in there for no reason; I am sure Crowe knew what he was doing.

571,Rick_McAuner,Great film brings an aspiring journalist into his element.,9,6 December 2007,"Almost Famous tells the story of a young aspiring journalist who got a chance to write for Rolling Stone and experiences first hand what rock and roll, and life, is really about.The film portrayed popular music of that era, the 1970's, as a whole culture. There were fans, groupies, bands, their managers and enough drama to prevent this movie from going stale. The phrase “sex, drugs and rock & roll” comes to mind with this film, having been the center which the story revolves.Rolling Stone magazine plays a big role in the main character's life. William is blessed, and simultaneously cursed, with the the opportunity to write for the esteemed publication. He learns more about life and himself than most would at his age. His honesty and good character are the attributes of his personality that get him through the often difficult and frustrating journey.William experiences the band's ups and downs, he sees what normally no one would. Even though he is called “the enemy” by the band, they open up to him. He meets one of the band's groupies, known as Band-Aides. She gives him his initial introduction the the world of rock and roll in person.Though it may seem glamorous and awe-inspiring, the truth behind 70's rock isn't all that it seems. In the end it turns out that everyone is human, even rock stars, or those who aspire to be stars. This film tells a story and tells it very well: it demonstrates the love and frustration of music and the adventure of a lifetime for a young journalist. Even though William was “the enemy,” he was more than that to the band in reality.",Almost Famous
572,rbarba23,Definition of Character Development,10,10 March 2008,"Aside from the more than entertaining plot line, I think this movie is really more about the development of each of the major characters. The lead, William, is young and ready to experience life after an upbringing involving an over protective mother and misunderstood educational life. After finally being able to sort of let go, William's mother lets her son set out to explore his passion of writing and rock and roll. Over the course of the film, William develops a relationship with a rock and roll band and a groupie/""band aid"" that needs help in finding themselves and their path in life. Russel Hammond, William, his sister, and his mother all have lots to learn about their individual lives as well as their personal and family lives. The addition of the more than provocative character Penny Lane makes this move a pure definition of character development. Everyone learns and grows as a person, add the perfect plot and music that comes with the movie, and it's a piece of pure genius. Any rock and roll fan will enjoy this movie, but any fan of slightly more complex film than a simple action movie will really find this to be a real enjoyable piece of art that will be cherished no matter how many times you watch. I highly advise it and I give it the top rating, something I never do unless it is one of my personal favorites.

With great acting and superior directing, the movie has made me a fan of rock and roll! This movie is perfect for audiences that desire to learn the history of rock and roll. Though mild sex scenes, drug use, and vulgar language contributed to it being rated R, I believe this can be shown to 16 year olds due to the fact that it contains key history moments.

578,hammed_del,Watch Again,8,23 September 2016,"The kid is named William Miller in the movie; he's played by Patrick Fugit as a boy shaped by the fierce values of his mother, who drives him to the concert that will change his life, and drops him off with the mantra ""Don't do drugs!"" The character and the story are based on the life of Cameron Crowe, the film's writer-director, who indeed was a teenage Rolling Stone writer, and who knows how lucky he was. Crowe grew up to write and direct ""Say Anything"" (1989), one of the best movies ever made about teenagers; in this movie, he surpasses himself.The movie is not just about William Miller. It's about the time, and the band, and the early 1970s, when idealism collided with commerce. The band he hooks up with is named Stillwater. He talks his way backstage in San Diego by knowing the band members' names and hurling accurate compliments at them as they hurry into the arena. William wins the sympathy of Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), the guitarist, who lets him in. Backstage, he meets his guide to this new world, a girl who says her name is Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). She is not a groupie, she explains indignantly, but a Band Aide. She is, of course, a groupie but has so much theory about her role, it's almost as if sex for her is a philosophical exercise.William's mom, Elaine (Frances McDormand), is a college professor who believes in vegetarianism, progressive politics and the corrupting influence of rock music. Banning the rock albums of her older daughter Anita (Zooey Deschanel), she holds up an album cover and asks her to look at the telltale signs in Simon and Garfunkel's eyes: ""Pot!"" Anita leaves, bequeathing her albums to William, who finds a note in one of them: ""This song explains why I'm leaving home to become a stewardess."" Its lyrics are: ""I walked out to look for America."" That's what William does. He intends to be away from school for only a few days. But as Russell and the rest of Stillwater grow accustomed to his presence, he finds himself on the bus and driving far into the Southwest. Along the way, he observes the tension between Russell and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), the lead singer, who thinks Russell is getting more attention than his role definition deserves: ""I'm the lead singer, and you're the guitarist with mystique."" William has two guardian angels to watch over him. One is Penny Lane, who is almost as young as he is, but lies about her age. William loves her, or thinks he does, but she loves Russell, or says she does, and William admires Russell, too, and Russell maintains a reserve that makes it hard to know what he thinks. He has the scowl and the facial hair of a rock star, but is still only in his early 20s, and one of the best moments in the movie comes when William's mom lectures him over the phone about the dangers to her son: ""Do I make myself clear?"" ""Yes, ma'am,"" he says, reverting to childhood.William's other angel is the legendary rock critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), then the editor of Creem: ""So you're the kid who's been sending me those articles from your school paper."" He ignores the kid's age, trusts his talent and shares his credo: ""Be honest and unmerciful."" During moments of crisis on the road, William calls Bangs for advice.Lester Bangs was a real person, and so are Ben Fong-Torres and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone, played by look-alike actors. The movie's sense of time and place is so acute it's possible to believe Stillwater was a real band. As William watches, the band members get a hit record, a hotshot producer tries to take over from the guy who's always managed them, they switch from a bus to an airplane, and there are ego wars, not least when a T-shirt photo places Russell in the foreground and has the other band members out of focus (there's a little ""This Is Spinal Tap"" here).""Almost Famous"" is about the world of rock, but it's not a rock film, it's a coming-of-age film, about an idealistic kid who sees the real world, witnesses its cruelties and heartbreaks, and yet finds much room for hope. The Penny Lane character is written with particular delicacy, as she tries to justify her existence and explain her values (in a milieu that seems to have none). It breaks William's heart to see how the married Russell mistreats her. But Penny denies being hurt. Kate Hudson has one scene so well-acted, it takes her character to another level. William tells her, ""He sold you to Humble Pie for 50 bucks and a case of beer."" Watch the silence, the brave smile, the tear and the precise spin she puts on the words, ""What kind of beer?"" It's not an easy laugh. It's a whole world of insight.What thrums beneath ""Almost Famous"" is Cameron Crowe's gratitude. His William Miller is not an alienated bore, but a kid who had the good fortune to have a wonderful mother and great sister, to meet the right rock star in Russell (there would have been wrong ones), and to have the kind of love for Penny Lane that will arm him for the future and give him a deeper understanding of the mysteries of women. Looking at William--earnestly grasping his tape recorder, trying to get an interview, desperately going to Bangs for advice, terrified as Ben Fong-Torres rails about deadlines, crushed when it looks as if his story will be rejected--we know we're looking at a kid who has the right stuff and will go far. Someday he might even direct a movie like ""Almost Famous."" Note: Why did they give an R rating to a movie perfect for teenagers?",Almost Famous
579,JacksRagingHormones,My Favourite Movie,10,3 September 2003,"I first saw this movie shortly after last christmas when I recieved the bootleg untitled dvd (very rare in the UK) and within 2 and a half hours it had filled me with so much passion for life that I felt that I could really be anything, but really that no-one really appreciates what they have till its going.IMO thats what Almost Famous quantifies, everyone in the film is meandering through life and the only thing thats keeping everybody alive, that makes everyone feel is the music.I never give spoilers (well try not!) so I'll basically just say that this film is superbly written, outstandingly soundtracked and that the cast, Particularly Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup and the still underrated Jason Lee were all outstanding and seemed to give there all and really understand what this movie was all about.Some users have problems with Patrick Fugit, but any shortcomings in his performance can be overlooked easilly and as for his ""constant joy"" expression, that is true, but I think part of what makes almost famous so beautiful is that we see things from such innocent eyes.I cannot recommend this film enough, and judging by other comments, very few people could.",Almost Famous
580,teh_scarlet,Epic disappointment,2,3 February 2014,"When I saw trailer for the movie I was really excited to see it. And I can not believe how this movie is very far from what I have expected.There is no rock'n'roll freedom feeling to it. The main thing that bothered me is how Stillwater as a uprising band is all about the publicity and how to look cool, though they say ""It is all about the fans"" but on the other hand the most terrifying thing is that ""The enemy"" would have them look uncool..seriously?I guess the greatest concern is what do other people think of your band. Hmm, well in that case you must be epic uncool.I know many bands who are trying to make it through, but there was never mainly about the publicity or ""oh we want to be on the cover of a magazine so bad"".It is about making music that you love, sharing it with others and not just caring for being publicly promoted everywhere. The point is your music and sharing it with people you love and the people who love your music. The fame may come or not, either way is about making music and feeling good about it. With this of course comes having the best parties while touring. But in the movie parties on the tour road are not very imaginative or fun, so yeah I guess people who made this movie were never a part of rock'n'roll culture in any way.And we all know the Pennie Lane legend and this could give a major spice up to the movie if the character would not have been so pathetically portrayed. With slow motion scenes that are far away from cute or magical and constant quote ""It is all about the music"", then act like it is. There really should not be the melodramatic love scene in the end. After all, come on, those are suppose to be the groupies.Althrough my score is 2/10",Almost Famous

A true life journey for a young journalist who has the opportunity of a lifetime to follow Stillwater, an up and coming band in 1973. It seems to capture the cyclic life of rock stars and their followers in a charming way, with some great visual and sonic moments. Along the way our lead character meets all the aspects of a 70's rock life, witnessing the fragile balance and euphoric moments that touch the viewer and encapsulated the 70's world and life of rock and touring bands. A charming look back to the days where the battle was to please the fans, make the cover of a magazine and conquer the world .. well as least make the end of the tour in one piece.

582,deboramedeiroslima,"Real, well-written, outstanding",10,9 March 2016,"Have you ever feel the need to be alive at the 70's? Or have you lived in the 70's and wanted to just go back in time? That is the feeling you get during the whole movie. It is impossible not to surrender to the rock and roll vibe. A movie directed by Cameron Crowe, who made the main character based on his life, when he was a journalist at Rolling Stone magazine. It is a story about a boy named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who has always felt out of place, especially by the fact that he skipped two grades, revealing that he is ahead of his time, when he was only a child his world was completely changed by his older sister, Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel, 500 days of Summer), when she decided to leave home and left him her vinyl collection. He discovered himself by listening to the albums and the way they showed his evolution, every moment in the movie, including this, is followed by the perfect song to match the scene, which they followed by showing him, a few years later, with fifteen years old, ready to graduate from High School, now with his life passion: rock and roll. And also to write about rock and roll.The precocious boy made a decision to follow his dream, so he took part on a mission: go on a tour with a band named Still Water and go deep in the rock and roll business, see how they behave and to write an article about them for the prestigious Rolling Stone magazine. Still Water wasn't that famous and they still had a long way to the top, they were still trying to find themselves and also their sound, that is why they have misunderstandings and they are arguing all the time, and always with William close to see how messed up they actually were, trying to pass the imagine that they were ""cool"". During this tour, he becomes friend of the band and also falls in love with one of the so called groupies, named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson)The movie portraits clearly the intimacy of those who are devotedly passionate about music. It shows us the relationship between an idol and a fan with such maturity, sending us a message that both sides are important to success. The backstage stressful situations, the party with drugs and alcohol were well shown. One of the reasons that makes this movie, I personally think we can call, a masterpiece is the soundtrack. Led Zeppelin, Elton John, The Who, David Bowie, Black Sabbath and even the references were gold. My favourite scene of all times is the Tiny Dancer scene. Every time I see it, the first thing that comes to my mind is: ""This scene is one of the reasons why I love cinema."" For instance Russell's (Billy Crudup) scene at the roof screaming ""I am a golden god"" was a clear example of a Led Zeppelin reference. ""One day will you be cool"" was also one of the most remarkable quotes from the movie, pointing out the fact that rock and roll, sex, drugs, alcohol, make you look cool. Make you look powerful and invincible. And at the same time Crowe could capture the real soul of his characters, his flaws and his insecurities, made they look human. Some examples are the subtleties in the development of the own maturity of William, as in the scene which he loses his virginity in a natural way and even with a certain level of innocence, establishing a magnificent character development, nevertheless keeping his true personality traits. Along with Penny Lane's plot with Russell, she loved him, but she actually could never had him, because he was married. She may be wild and nuts, but she constantly gives herself so selflessly to him, who she cares deeply and she was just begging for that back, of course, all of that she didn't showed to him, it was too painful and it seemed like he was only using her, even in their last conversation he still didn't get it. One of my favourite things about the ending, was the fact she was done with him, because he could never give her that, but she was also saying to him, by giving Russell, Willam's address, you can do this with him, you two have a special connection that me and you don't have. You still have a chance to make it up with him, following the scene where she goes by herself to Marrocos, it was just perfect, because she shows her independence and that was the moment we could see that she have the world. She doesn't need a man. There are certainly no doubts that Cameron's emotional connection with the material made highly difference in the production and the ending, there is a famous quote that my Film & TV teacher made in class ""Write what you know!"" and boy, did Crowe knew. And even though the narrative was impeccable and the acting was leaded masterfully, the movies ends up touching the viewer's heart and soul, something increasingly absent in movies nowadays. You can actually feel every frame of his work dedication. The music packs the film with cinematic perfection. And the casting also made a big and important part of the reasons why Almost Famous it was so remarkable, Laster Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman, who passed away in 2014) the broadcaster and owner of a disco store, the lead singer, Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) who people can identify a lot, because he was always jealous of Russell's, not only success, but he also liked his wife.",Almost Famous
583,nakul-gaur,A very tight screenplay and an even tighter soundtrack!,10,29 June 2017,"It's really a piece of art. I'd place it in same category as contemporary period dramas like Forrest Gump - a rich and detailed story line accentuated by its characteristic soundtrack. The plot is based on golden age of rock 'n roll - early 70s. The story line works on parallels: much like the music of that time, the young protagonist also faces some moral dilemmas early on during his adolescence - should he continue to remain a mama's boy and do as told or should he give in to the temptation of experimenting and temptation of drugs. And the movie very carefully shows us two-three parallel journeys of realization: first one, the young and fascinated teen who realizes that best place to be is at home; second one, a rock star who reconciles to reality that true companionship is most important and third, the fan girl who decides to move on in life (well, there were more but these are the top three).

Literally (and figuratively, of course). This film intrigues me, I imagine, for a different reason than it does it's audience born before 1970 -- I missed the sex, drugs, and rock-n- roll revolution by much more than a decade, and this story is an incredibly enjoyable depiction of a time I'll only ever know through here-say.Writer and director Cameron Crowe certainly chose to stick to a more happy-go-lucky depiction of a time in American history that was not only exciting and expressive, but also characterized by severely questionable decision-making and intravenous drug use. Nevertheless, this film succeeded in connecting with me on and emotional and physical level -- I laughed a lot and I really feel good.I was specifically impressed with Jason Lee's performance.

There's really something special about it. I can't really put my finger on it, but there's something that makes it really different; it gives off a certain mood that I've never before experienced in film. Maybe it's the music, which is incredible and perfectly sets the tone and the mood in each given scene. Maybe it's Kate Hudson's incomparable Penny Lane, who is not only a joy to watch on the screen but also a surprisingly complex and even tragic character, a truly amazing performance by Hudson in this role.The fact is, pretty much everything about this film is stellar. It flawlessly encompasses an era.The casting is brilliant, and pretty much every actor delivers a solid performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is remarkable as always and steals every scene he's in. It's also quite a fun movie, and some of the scenes with the band members got me laughing pretty hard. The script is very sharp and relatable. It's surprisingly lengthy, but it always felt light; I never felt bored or uninterested at any point.It has it's flaws, as all movies do, but not many are too noticeable. I think the biggest problem is that the whole thing is just so incredibly sweet that it's almost too much so. It can't really help it though. It's just so touching in so many different ways. I actually kind of wanted to hug someone while watching it, and that doesn't happen often from watching a movie.Overall, a very heartwarming and memorable film.

The mostly autobiographical film follows a band and even has a someone who has not lived during the time you can really get a good feeling and the movie gives a very good illustration of the time. Personally I liked the music used in the different kinds of scenes and perfectly synchronized to the story. It perfectly underlines the emotions in the story and helps understanding the characters. The movie also had a lot of interesting shots and transition which I really liked because I never got bored watching this movie. The deep message about the culture of Rock and about the whole lifestyle was very interesting to me. I really liked that the movie is autobiographical because it helps understanding the characters and makes the audience able to develop a connection to them. Also what really appeared to me in the movie was the different kinds of lighting or colors. The stage and the parties were more likely darker and mysterious but whenever interesting conversation and important talks occurred the movie cleared up and this also underlined the story. In my opinion the story of a movie can be great in theory but if the director of film doesn't do a good job creating the right atmosphere the film would still be bad and not as interesting as Almost Famous. All in all I think this film did a very good job in expressing and illustrating the time. It also is a stand out film for having a great story and great music or visuals.

Although many of the characters were well done I believe that William (Patrick Fugit) saved the film because he was a round character and constantly changing his attributes. For example at the beginning of the movie he was very timid but as time progressed he got continuously more courageous. Personally I thought that the character that impeded the film was Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) because his role was a very static character. It felt as if he was holding back the band. I really liked the music that was played through the movie because it got me very intrigued in what was going on throughout the film. Personally I liked all aspects of the film and can't think of one thing that I didn't like. In the film I thought that the director was trying to set a happy mood because it highlighted what its like to go on a road trip with a rock and roll band and I thought that they did a good job about setting the mood.

But I am not a young American girl and the only response I had to my first screening of Almost Famous was -- forgettable. I must confess now, almost a decade after the theatrical release of this film, I happened upon it again and my reaction to it was very surprising. Cameron Crowe's passion for music is undeniable and his short filmography reveals his hesitance to make ""forgettable"" movies. Almost Famous is a strong, necessary addition to the American film library, because of Crowe's love for the story and characters within this film. I wish that I had seen his passion before, but honestly, having missed the core of Almost Famous the first time around, made the surprise now that much more effective. How often does a director's precise and driven affection for the story surface above the movie itself? Hardly ever. But my second viewing of Almost Famous was uplifting and reminding me that behind every great story is a passionate storyteller, and whether or not the audience can connect or relate to the story being told, the fact that we (the audience) have that choice is what making movies is all about.",Almost Famous
594,SarahVB,A round of applause!,10,15 September 2000,"I saw ""Almost Famous"" tonight and I cannot remember the last time a movie ended with enthusiastic applause from the audience. I left wanting to hug Cameron Crowe for making such a funny, wise, life-affirming film! Frances McDormand, Patrick Fugit, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the inimitable Lester Bangs gave wonderful performances, and it's no small feat that Crowe has been able to take a band full of men dressed in the styles of the 70s -- long hair, lots of mustaches, boots and bell-bottoms -- and make them seem not silly but attractive and magnetic. And the soundtrack just kicks ass; I guess being Cameron Crowe and being married to Nancy Wilson gets you access to incredible songs by the Who, Yes, and Led Zeppelin that other filmmakers can only dream of. There is a pure core inside each of us that music helps us reach. This movie reminded me that once, each of us was teenage fan helplessly in thrall to rock and roll, and for that, I thank the director.",Almost Famous
595,delgiudc,"Fantastic film. Real, personal, beautiful.....",10,16 September 2000,"Period dramas don't get much better then this, go see it twice. It feels real to the last minute.

596,BigOr,Best Movie I've Seen this Year!,10,16 September 2000,"Cameron Crowe accomplishes a rare feat in movie making.  He is able to take us back to a time when rock and roll was the true outlet of expression for people.  In Almost Famous, Crowe uses classic songs in ways that express the true nature of the moment.  The moment in the bus, where the whole band begins to sing ""Tiny Dancer"" is definitely one of the most dramatic sequences of the movie, and the most moving.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee give great performances as the rock stars of Stillwater.  Kate Hudson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and the young man who plays Cameron Crowe as a youth round out the wonderfully cast movie.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching a movie that integrates so many wonderful ideas. I'm sure will be seeing more of this movie come Oscar time!",Almost Famous
597,AJ-31,Cameron Crowe at his best (No spoilers),10,25 September 2000,"I'll say it right off the bat, Almost Famous is the best film I've seen this year, and one of the best ever. It's often said that Cameron Crowe doesn't direct bad movies, but he outdid himself this time. Everything about the film is wonderful: Story, Casting, Performances, Cinematography, and especially the Music. Every actor in the film is perfectly chosen for his/her particular role, with the standouts being Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor (who was perfect as the typical Road Manager.) The effort that the actors put into their performances shines brightly, you really believe that the boys of Stillwater could strap on those instruments for a reunion show at any time.
Favorite scenes - Lee at the rest stop, Crudup in the Miller house (I love that bewildered look on his face, classic!)For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet (Counting the sneak preview last weekend, I've now seen it 3 times in 9 days,) GO! It's a guaranteed lock that you won't be disappointed.Adam",Almost Famous

Also, the situations and the dialogs are often quite funny.Note: this movie can be watched on a small screen (eg: on a plane) you won't loose much. ;) However, the soundtrack is very good (Hendrix, Rolling Stones, etc), so it's better to have good sound. ;)",Almost Famous
599,hawk-46,This years best!,10,1 October 2000,"This movie made me laugh, cry, tap my feet to the music. Kate Hudson is superb as Penny Lane, every time she smiles it makes you smile too.

600,Moskie,Nothing but Fluff,5,24 September 2000,"This movie is so crowded with random ideas, that in the end, it says nothing. Was it trying to make a point about love? Youth? Family? Rock and roll? The movie pretends to be making a statement about all of the above, but instead just presents these themes without any sort of conclusion.
The story had many oppurtunities to pull itself together to form something coherent, but it never does. As the subject states, the movie just keeps presenting the viewer with fluff and never gets around to saying anything with substance.

601,Mike-916,"A solid movie, but I expected more.",7,9 October 2000,"I was very excited to see ""Almost Famous"" and, for the most part it was a very solid movie with an original storyline.  I was not, however, as dazzled as I expected to be.  Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson were solid, but unspectacular. This story could have gone a lot further. I was constantly in anticipation of a pick up in the plot, but I was never quite taken enough with the characters to get too emotionally attached.  Frances McDormand was brilliant, as per her usual.",Almost Famous

603,gpres1,The most overall well-done movie I have ever seen,10,23 September 2000,"I had been looking forward to this film for months and when I saw it, it met every single expectation I had.  Like American Beauty, it is for everyone. People who just watch films solely for entertainment purposes will love its humor and heart-felt story.  Technical enthusiasts will recognize that it is almost perfect.  It is so well done that almost every scene is memorable. I don't even like rock music and I loved this film!!!!!",Almost Famous
604,harry-136,Where did it all go...,8,24 January 2001,"I felt robbed watching this film.  Why?  I was 5 or 6 when this film was based, and at the time, music was something I heard if my parents were listening to 50's music or if they had the radio on.  Now that I am older (and considered old by the record industry) all I have is electronic/sampled music or pre-packed mimers. Is mimers a word?  It should be.  I can't help but wonder what life would have been like to be an observer to a 'proper' rock band.  And this film shows it from that observers point of view - and what a view.This film was just so coooool from start to finish.  The music, the atmosphere, the characters were so how I would have imagined it all to be. The music especially made me want to search my dad's record collection to see if he had any 'cool' records.  He didnt.I'll have to get the soundtrack to this film - it can't help but rock!I'd give this film 8 out of 10 just for the music alone - but the story is just as good, the acting is excellent, the casting is brilliant, and even the comedy element of the film worked.  I heard most of the audience laugh when I did, and many of them (the ones who must have been around at the time I suspect!) laughed at stuff I didn't see...Go see it, and enjoy!",Almost Famous
605,bstupay,Famous is Perfect,10,18 September 2000,"This has got to be the finest film released this year, as well as one of the best of the past ten years. I loved everything about this movie. It is one of those heart-warming, comical films that you want to take home with you and wrap yourself up in, like an old blanket. The film centers around a 15 year old journalist in 1973 who gets his big break when Rolling Stone Magazine recruits him to write about the ""ready-to-break"" band Stillwater. He joins the band on the road, runs into a few adventures, falls in love, and wins the hearts of the band members. There are over 50 songs from the era used in the film. All of them, just like the movie, are classic. Almost Famous will bring back memories for those who grew up at that time. And for those who didn't...it will make you wish you had.",Almost Famous
606,thoman8r,another great Crowe effort,8,13 October 2000,"Almost Famous is yet another great Cameron Crowe movie, although I thought it was just average for him.  I'd place it ahead of Singles, but way behind Say Anything and Jerry Maguire. Still, this partly autobiographical coming of age story is light years ahead of 90% of the c**p Hollywood's calling movies these days.  Crowe's use of music in his films is routinely great. Almost Famous, in particular, has one of the best film soundtracks I've heard in a long time. (PT Anderson's ""Magnolia"" is another good example.) Also, Crowe continues to write some of the best--and most real-- characters in cinema today.  A warning to those with short attention spans: this is a character-driven movie, rather than a plot-driven one (as are all of his films).  The bottom line is, if you like Cameron Crowe or are just a film-lover in general, you'll like this film. 8 out of 10",Almost Famous
607,terry-119,"Great movie, even for non-rock fans!",8,18 March 2001,"I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of many of the groups on the soundtrack (Led Zeppelin, Yes, The Who, Elton John, etc.), so I didn't expect to like this movie.  But I was very pleasantly surprised at the music:  besides the above groups, they had everything from Alvin and the Chipmunks through Simon and Garfunkel to Black Sabbath.  And virtually all the music was great!And the movie itself was very funny, intelligent, and avoided many of the cliches and easy-outs that most pictures fall into.Not a lot of sex, not a lot of drugs, but lots of rock and roll!",Almost Famous

""Go see it"" No contest...it's the very Best movie of the year, so far.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe's true personal story at 15 years old is brilliantly told, directed, and acted....The relatively unknown cast is wonderful, perfect.  There will be innumerable Oscar nominations, and almost definitely winners, perhaps several.Although there's a splattering of ""f"" words and some brief sexual situations, but no onscreen sex, it seems acceptable (in my opinion) for 10-12 year olds, depending on maturity.Think American Graffiti but 27 years later, contemporary & better.

This movie is genius, and no one is better that Crowe at incorporating music so fluidly into a film that it can't survive without it  I will continue to be fascinated by Crowe, his life, and his films that reflect everything he has experienced--this in particular is a film, yes film, not movie, that exemplifies everything a film can be, it inspired me to sit down and write this after all.

I found it boring and offensive but thought Goldie's daughter did a great job! The film just wasn't near as glorious as ""Hollywood"" portrayed it to be and I just really hate it when a film gets so much fanfare and turns out to be an actor fest instead, much like American Beauty which I also didn't care for, but yes, Kevin Spacey was great.",Almost Famous

It ended up being a totally enjoyable experience. The writing and direction were very good, but it is the cast that makes the film worth seeing. Kate Hudson is wonderful,as well as Patrick Fugit portraying the starry -eyed, sometimes overwhelmed journalist. They both bring out their characters' sweetness, vulnerabilities, playfulness and the chemistry between them is genuine. Anyone who is interested in not only Rock & Roll, the '70's, but catching rising talent should not miss this film.",Almost Famous

613,us0jpc,Not as good as led to believe,7,27 September 2000,"I liked the movie, but it wasn't what I was led to believe.  The reviews I'd read touted it as 'true to life'.  I've lived close to the rock & roll lifestyle and there wasn't nearly enough sweat, blood, booze, sex and drugs as in the real music scene. Plus the ending was too 'pat', everything fell neatly into place.  In the real rock & roll scene, the plane more likely crashes or the band breaks up.  Still, some of it was hilarious.  Thanks for the laughs.",Almost Famous

An outstanding job was done by the entire cast and again Cameron Crowe has produced a great movie.  It never lagged, the plot was enjoyable, Kate Hudson was awesome, and Jason Lee was comical as usual.  The one main thing that caught my attention though was the choice of music for the whole movie....WOW what a soundtrack that'll make.  All in all it was a very touching movie that allowed me to truly understand the power of music, and I believe it couldn't be better portrayed than in the scene on the bus where they all came together again with the music of Elton John's song ""Tiny Dancer"".  Great movie, worth seeing 20 or so more times again, and thats just in the theater.",Almost Famous

620,davidlizerbram,Full disclosure: gushing review follows,10,20 September 2000,"I see a lot of movies.  But ""Almost Famous"" isn't ""a movie"".  It's ""the movie"".  People talk about film or cinema, because they sound more sophisticated than ""the movies"".  ""Oh, I'm a film buff.""  ""I'm studying cinema.""  I've been there, I've even been that guy. But people don't really love film or cinema.  You can't fall in love with film--it's just the plastic stuff you put in a camera.  You don't fall in love with the cinema--that's the place you go and they rip you off for old popcorn.  But just like young William Miller (aka Cameron Crowe) in ""Almost Famous fell for music, we can fall in love with the movies.  I don't know why but they just grab some of us when we're too young to know better and they never let go.  You know who you are.  There's something so seductive about the movies.  Maybe you're being lied to but you don't care.  I think that's why we're so upset walking out of a bad movie--it's not really the $9, or the 2 hours you're not getting back.  It's a betrayal.  And it happens too often.But once in a while there's the movie that makes it all worth it.  ""Almost Famous"" is that movie.  If I had to I'd sit through a thousand years of the worst, most unpleasant & dullest movies to see ""Almost Famous"" again one more time.  Hell, if there was a midnight show I'd be there right now.I'm not going to go into a plot synopsis or technical breakdown--others have already done so, much better than I could.  I just want to say that if you should run into someone who doesn't fall in love with ""Almost Famous"", feel sorry for him or her.  There will always be haters.  Who knows, maybe Lester himself would have thought ""Almost Famous"" sucked; he trashed Bob Marley after all.  It doesn't matter.  This movie is a gift and Mr. Crowe has my gratitude forever.",Almost Famous
621,tim-411,Disappointing...again,2,20 September 2000,"Cameron Crowe delivers another lackluster film with Almost Famous. This one, like his previous work, fails to delve into the emotions of any of it's characters beyond surface level. Who are the characters in Almost Famous? I have no idea. The film is what they call a feel good movie.Hey, I enjoyed the movie but couldn't help feeling disappointed and cheated out of what could have been a moving experience. Unfortunately, Crowe cannot have anything bad happen in his films without resolving it cheerfully two minutes later. Forget reality (this was his story, right?) as long as the audience leaves smiling. Isn't that what T.V. is for?Crowe is a smart, funny man, but if he'd only dare to push his work a little farther, I'd final feel justified in doling out my $9.50. Unless you're a die hard Crowe fan, skip this teeny-bopper flick.",Almost Famous
622,Meg-67,I had almost lost faith in the movie industry...,10,20 September 2000,"This is easily the best film I've seen this year, if not in the past five years.  Crowe managed to tell a coming-of-age story that wasn't applicable to only adolescents; rather, we see truthful progressions of character that are neither sappy, unrealistic, nor too tragic.Newcomer Fugit pulls off the naive William Miller beautifully with a constant wide-eyed expression of excitement and awe in spite of his abilities as a top-notch rock journalist.Kate Hudson, who was terrific in 200 Cigarettes, really shows her range as an actress in this one.  As the innocent-but-not-innocent Penny Lane, Hudson is the mix of vulnerability and strength that is nearly impossible to pull off (Note Drew Barrymore's unsuccessful attempts to do this).Jason Lee is the supporting character who, though interesting and captivating during all on-screen time, does not overpower--a feat not easily done and which I appreciate.Finally, Billy Crudup seems to have finally found his character.  After a promising role in Sleepers, his Russell Hammond is right on and not overboard. The perpetually elusive and introspective rock guitarist, Hammond could have been easily played as a stereotype.  Thankfully, Crudup turns in a performance that makes us forget that Hammond is not a real person.This is a movie on which to go spend $7.  Don't wait for the discount movie. Don't wait for it to come out for rental. Crowe has made the first Oscar-worthy movie of the year.",Almost Famous
623,JML-7,This year's American Beauty,10,22 September 2000,"It has become unusual for a film to be both, well made and timeless. A piece of art that is as relevant and enjoyable  today as it is in five years, or would have been five years ago. Almost Famous is such a film.It is made with great detail in respect to the time it is set in. The acting is superb, as is the score. Script and direction manage to balance effortlessly between art and commerce. There are few (comedic) scenes this film could do without and that were probably added to give the drama a comedic touch, yet even they fit surprisingly well into the plot and add to the overall feeling of uncertainty that the main characters are experiencing.Almost Famous is timeless because the main themes - change, challenge and development - are predominant in the film. Plot dominates over setting. A 70ies flick? Yes, but change the clothing, rename the band and the film could take place anytime.To put it short: Almost Famous is this year's American Beauty.",Almost Famous

626,rick11,My vote for best film of the year (so far),10,25 September 2000,"Some of you people are rough on a movie...This was a great film. To me the biggest themes were: ""who is using who?"" and ""what is the difference between being cool and being a jerk?"".I found every element of the film to be excellent. From cast and acting, to the music and sound, to the characters and even the story itself. There were no loose threads. It was funny at times and painful in others. There were times during the movie I felt ""I was on the bus"" or ""at the party"" or ""watching the concert"" and the feeling of being part of a ""music scene"" that was just about to ""happen"" was really there for me (which is as close to that form of success as I will ever get to be in my lifetime - and that is another side effect of a great movie. It temporarily puts a majority of people somewhere they won't ever be). And that type of ""suspension of disbelief"" takes tremendous effort by a lot of people to accomplish.Yes, there was drug abuse and misogyny; yes, there was greed and ambition; yes, there were parasites who sometimes turned 'hanging on' into an art form - and there were artists who sometimes devolved into parasites.Some may say the film sugar coated too much or wasn't real enough for them. (I say to them: go make your own movie and see if enough people like it that you are able to make a living at it. Lots of luck.)I was very happy to pay to see this film. I think we will all make out if everyone who worked on this film continues to do such fine work in the future.",Almost Famous
627,dave-943,"Heart-wrenching, honest, clever; everything I like in a film",10,27 September 2000,"I've seen a few coming-of-age films, and a few prodigy-cum-genius type films, and of course more than my share of romantic comedy stuff.  This film skirts between the lines of all those possibilities and somehow manages to find its way to the viewer intact, deftly and with a whole lot of old-fashioned charisma.The acting was honest, true to how people behave without getting schmaltzy or over-dramatic.  Cameron Crowe gets these actors to all project a belief in themselves and bring that across in a way that we care about what happens to them.  I particularly liked the rendition of William Miller by Patrick Fugit, who steals the show as the precocious rock-n-roll journalist.  He evokes visions of a young Matthew Broderick or a wide-eyed Michael J. Fox without ever getting corraled into being the ""cute but troubled young kid"".Frances McDormand is amazing and well-cast as Elaine the Mom, someone so wrapped up in creating a safe, healthy environment she drives both her children far away from home.Billy Crudup & Kate Hudson create the tension filled romance that drives the story along; both did a great job & were adroitly evocative of those fast times in the rock & roll fantasyland of the 70's.  Billy, as Russell Hammond, teeters on the edge of fame, not wanting to leave his long-suffering bandmates behind but being courted as the band's star by the record company, is palpably torn.  He carries William through the whirlwind of emotions and music along with him, showing him a world that is desperate and lonely, even with the whole world seemingly vying for his attention. His casting is also very clever, seeing as how Billy Crudup also sits on the brink of his own stardom & acclaim in real life.Lester Bangs is William's 'guru', played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  A walking oxymoron, he exudes a callous arrogance and at the same time expresses genuine affection for the up-and-comer, sometimes giving William the exact advice he needs to get him through the toughest moments as a rock critic & dealing with the love/hate relationships they seem to engender with everyone in their world of music.I can't say enough about the awesome casting job, as well as the very detailed set design, costuming & realism to the times.  Period pieces are usually difficult to do well; Mr. Crowe did this one genuine and good.A truly great film, one that I'd heartily recommend to all but the most jaded rock critics.",Almost Famous
628,john-794,"Be truthful to yourself, and follow your dreams.",10,27 September 2000,"As I walked out of theater last night a feeling of being a ""sell out"" overwhelmed me. Almost Famous had reached inside me and pulled something out I didn't even know was there. Something inside me saying I didn't always follow my dreams, and that's what this movie is about. The movie was brilliantly acted will stellar performances from Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, with special note to Patrick Fugit. I don't think there could have been a better choice than Patrick for the part. You can't fake the `babe in the woods' quality that he has in the movie, and that is part of what makes it such a great performance. The story was written and directed with what we've come to expect from Cameron Crowe. With most movies being 2+ hours now, a lot of directors are using this as a standard, whether or not they've got 2+ hours of solid material, and I think that this is hurting a lot of movies over that past year or so. There wasn't a moment in this movie that dragged, every part had meaning and relevance to the story being told. There's something for everyone in this movie, amazing music, great acting, terrific sets and locations, and above all a message. Be truthful to yourself, and follow your dreams.",Almost Famous
629,FadingOut,A Profound Experience,10,30 September 2000,"I had heard that this movie was good...possibly the best of the year.  I had read reviews of people who had gone in with high expectations and had their expectations surpassed.  So when I finally got my chance to see this movie I had high expectations myself.  But I knew that alot had been cut from the movie and it may suffer as a result.  I had also heard that it was missing something...something that would have caused the viewer to get swept up in it...a bite that it needed and didn't have.  I got swept up into this movie and I felt the bite.I'm sure by now you know what the movie is about, so I'll be brief.  William Miller is a 15 year old boy who loves rock 'n roll.  He gets a job with Rolling Stone Magazine to tour with an up-and-coming band named Stillwater and write an article.  That's all you need to know.The performances, ofcourse, are perfect.  Kate Hudson as the ""band-aid"" Penny Lane is amazingly beautiful and should get an oscar nod for her star making performance.  Patrick Fugit as William Miller has a couple of clumsy lines, but is nearly perfect as a wide-eyed boy who finds himself in the middle of a world he had only dreamed of ever seeing.  Penny: ""We should get together sometime.  We live in the same city.""  Patrick: ""I think we live in different worlds.""  All the other actors do an amazing job.What made this movie so wonderful for me is, as I was watching this movie (as corny and stupid as this may sound) I BECAME William.  He took me from my seat and into the screen.  I could see myself as him, doing just what he was doing and saying exactly what he was saying.  This is something that rarely happens to me when watching a movie, but when it does, when you can feel that you are living a characters life, you know this isn't just any ordinary movie.SPOILERS BEGIN--- The scene that hit me the hardest comes near the end of the movie. William has departed from Stillwater at the airport after the plane almost crashed. He goes to Rolling Stone and is told that Stillwater has denied almost everything he wrote in his article...even though it is all true.  William is sitting in an airport, head down, looking like absolute c**p.  His sister sees him sitting there.  She says to him, ""You like c**p.  But that's great! You're LIVING your LIFE.""  How true.  I would have given anything to be William right then and there.  Sure, he was depressed, feeling awful, and devastated about losing Penny.  But he was living his life.

631,rick.thorne,Best of two worlds,10,20 October 2000,"""Almost Famous"" has that rare ability to touch from two completely different angles.  First, it's the best rock n' roll movie I've ever seen.  It presents the dirty underside of the business - including the distractions of sex, drugs, and the media in a very personal way.  It also shows the futility and disappointment of aspiring to music greatness - how the industry itself saps its artists of energy and creativity.  It's also the best coming of age movie I've ever seen, easily rivaling ""Stand by Me"" and ""The Year my Voice Broke.""  It's got it all.",Almost Famous

Although I love seeing a lot of blockbusters at the cheap movie theater, I'm usually more of an art-flick girl, but this movie was entertaining, almost moving and interesting.

I liked Anna Paquin for her acting in ""Fly Away Home"" and ""X-Men"". Kate Hudson which I had never seen her in movies but heard about her a lot because of this movie. ""Almost Famous"" started with a bang of good music story related to Rolling Stones Magazine and the end which is the best ever in music movies. I really fell for this movie not because of music but how music apply to our life. Kate Hudson is very wonderful actress and I give her big credit for making this movie a real ""Almost Famous"".

640,gademis1,DOES ANYBODY REMEMBER LAUGHTER?,10,28 April 2001,"What can you say really, about a film that could be about your life? Even if it is a life you never lived? Yep, that's right,  it's those good ol`times again, namely the70`s. Those of you unlucky (?)  enough to have been born in the latter half of the 70`s, yet still fallen in love with the likes of the sensational Zeppelin, Sabbath and Purple, must surely understand me when I say I feel «robbed» at times, of the chance to have lived firsthand the heyday of those groups. I feel nostalgic about a decade I never lived (6 months of it don't really count)  and today's  heavy metal scene, splendid as it is, doesn't  seem good enough. But is it really so? Well, things indicate the opposite actually. For example Black Sabbath were underrated at the time, Led Zep were thrashed by the music press that so adores them today and rock was as commercialized as it has ever been since. Yet we look back on it fondly, and despite the above rightly so, because when all the T-shirts are sold what remains is music-bloody good music!!! That's just me though. What does a man that actually got to live the era has to say about it? Director Cameron Crowe is that man and he got to live the «rock fever» up, close and personal .At the age of 15 he got to tour alongside such names as Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin , as a reporter for The Rolling Stones magazine. Robert Plant actually has to say about the film :``It's probably quite near what it was like at that time because Cameron's first tour was with us. And it was funny. Hee hee. Naive. Tricky. A bit twisted. And, um, I can remember it when I want to...'(Classic Rock magazine). Not bad recommendations, huh? ``Almost Famous' then, is a film about a 15 year old kid (surprise, surprise) that lands a job as a journalist for The Rolling Stone magazine and gets to travel with an upcoming band named Allm... um, sorry, Stillwater. Fiction and reality intertwine as the boy is introduced  to rock'n'roll (and love) following the band on tour. It's not the mention of illustrious rock legends of the time, the ever present music (apparently a splendid soundtrack with the likes of The Who, Purple, Free, Sabbath, Zep, Skynyrd to name but a few (?) or even the seemingly countless references to events, persons and quotes of the time (``Does anybody remember laughter?') that make this movie special. Well, it's not JUST the above, anyway. The whole deal is seen through the eyes of a kid (William, Cameron's alter ego) thus it comes across as something very sweet and innocent. Even more so, his love for fierce groupie Penny Lane for whom he never becomes judgmental. William (Patrick Fugit) has a constantly inquiring look throughout the film. He is a Watcher, a terminally uncool guy who can't fit in with the rest, yet genuinely admires, and most importantly, loves them. It's really our prying look from the sidelines, a look on that era that passing years have rendered precious, a look on the ``cool' people of this world and a look at unreturned love, doomed at its birth. William is not just Cameron Crowe, he's us. His look remains steadily innocent (although he gets, um, deflowered, at some point) even when the reality of rock-and again, life- fails him. His innocence is what saves him-and us. It doesn't matter if the movie is not about the ``mean' rock stars or a criticism of whatever. There is that too, but that's not the point. It's a subjective look at rock through our eyes, the eyes of a fun that writes band names on his notebook, collects all his favorite bands' records (even the lame ones) and looks the girl beside him in the eyes, not her tits. If you're a rock/metal fun you will live the movie. If you like punk or think Oasis are a rock group, then probably you shouldn't bother going.Oh well, at least I got to see Robert Plant live- maybe I wasn't born too late after all!!! And there's always the next Iron Maiden tour to wait for; now, where did I put that pen for the autographs?...",Almost Famous

To see the time period that shaped"" Velvet Underground, Beach Boys, David Bowie, and Iggy Pop, in such lavish detail is mesmerizing. For me, it was all about the music, and it was wonderful.This is also essentially Cameron Crowe's life story so it is told with an unfailing sense of authenticity. I found the insane numbers of references to musicians to be a challenging as it allowed me the opportunity to expand my own musical taste. Even though the band Stillwater has never existed, i found myself wanting a t-shirt when the movie was over. Heck i could have even gone for a Stillwater album at this point.

The characters interact with great timing and natural charm. While the movie takes its time to find it feet, once on them it runs with a groupie (band aid), Vs rock star, Vs music writer triangle that for most avoids stereotypes and clichés. Cameron Crowe's writing is thoughtful, warm and very funny and he's direction is of equal standards. The sound track is somewhat non-invasive but sets the mood of the time, while snippets of the fictitious band (still water) onstage are long enough to convey the style of the band but they are not over long as to bore us with unknown music. Also worth a mention are the performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman (Lester Bangs) and Anna Paquin (Polexia Aphrodesia).",Almost Famous

As someone who missed out on being there (I was 2 at the time the movie is set), I reveled in the evocation of the era.  In the same way that William is seduced by the rock scene, I longed to have been part of it all too.But it is not just the depiction of the times and the music that win you over.  For me the movie resonates because of the frailties of the characters and the intelligent way in which each is played by a truly wonderful cast. You believe in each of them, mixing convincingly as they do such varying traits as naivety, narcissism, a parent's protectiveness and loneliness. Each character is looking for something and you want them to find it.  And the best part is that, in the end, though not quite as you may have first desired, they get it.

Crowe's script is exquisite, weaving more than half a dozen storylines together into one seamless whole, and the performances he gets from his cast, especially newcomer Patrick Fugit as the wide-eyed Crowe surrogate William Miller.  He also gets a fabulous cameo performance by superb character actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  The soundtrack is superb, and the fictitious band Stillwater suits not only the sound of the seventies but the look and style, that many people have asked me if Stillwater was a real band.

648,andyman1348,Always Fatuous,1,18 March 2001,"`Almost Famous' is the most overrated movie of the year if not the history of film criticism. If only Lester Bangs could come back from the grave and trash this movie, which converts the music he was so passionate about into slick Hollywood crap.The fictional band Stillwater embodies none of the qualities that drew people to the rocks stars of the late sixties and early seventies: they are self-centered, hedonistic, inarticulate, brain dead hacks, whereas real rock stars of the period such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and the Rolling Stones may have been self-centered and hedonistic, but they were so brilliant musically and conceptually and so charismatic that they were almost worthy of the idolatry the characters in the movie lavish (with no sense of irony on the filmmaker's part) on the idiots in Stillwater.Why Rolling Stone would have any interest in Stillwater, the dullest band (either real or fictional) in history, let alone want to put them on the cover, is beyond me. And I'd like to think that magazine editors actually meet writers before they hire them and don't assign cover stories to 15-year-olds they've never met over the phone. How thrilled Ben-Fong Torres is when he reads William's `warts and all' article is the movie's most jaw dropping moment of many bad ones. To think that rock stars took drugs and had sex with groupies! That news really would have turned the world upside down in 1973.Kate Hudson seems far too wholesome to be convincing as an experienced groupie, and the acclaim she's received for this role is inexplicable. Plus, her character is an utter ditz. The poor thing is actually in love with the guitar player and crushed that he doesn't feel the same way. To think that rock stars thought of groupies just as sex objects! Another earth shattering revelation from Cameron Crowe! The fact that groupies' attraction to rock stars' money and fame is just as superficial as rock stars' attraction to groupies' bodies is somehow beyond Crowe's grasp.Frances McDormand's character was shrill and one note, the sex was unsexy and I would say that the situations the rock stars were in were cliched but they didn't even rise to the level of cliché. This movie was even worse than `Jerry  Maguire', another meandering fiasco without a single original idea, and is the last Cameron Crowe movie I will ever see.",Almost Famous

651,royjones_therd,Almost Nauseous,3,10 July 2006,"On his fourth outing as Director/Writer/Producer, and with Jerry Maguire under his belt, Cameron Crowe attempts to casually produce another instant-classic. Though it's bound to be popular amongst teenagers and young adults who wear t-shirts that say ""Clapton is God"", and have Led Zeppelin IV on high rotation, Almost Famous will not be remembered as Mr. Crowe's best work.Almost Famous is Crowe's bloated, self-indulgent portrayal of the beginning of his career as a young journalist on the music scene in the early 1970's. Patrick Fugit makes his feature film debut as William Miller, Crowe's autobiographical pseudonym, who is struggling to come to terms with not only the seedy, immoral culture of Rock'n'Roll, but with his professional and personal integrity as well. Kate Hudson provides a sickeningly clichéd performance as the ""troubled girl with the beautiful soul"", Penny Lane (200 Cigarettes, About Adam), touring America with an imploding band named Stillwater. The film attempts to capture the vibe of the times, to emulate the spirit of the 70's, to demonstrate the power of a cultural revolution in full bloom - it fails.There are however, several delightful moments in this film. At one point we see an otherwise preposterously cast Billy Crudup (Sleepers) as rock star Russell Hammond, tripping on Acid on the roof of a stranger's house screaming ""I am a golden God!"" This one comes off, but Cameron Crowe tries so hard to stuff this film with other memorable quotes and an obvious, cheesy soundtrack, that it will be hard for some viewers to keep a straight face.This film is a classic example of a wonderful idea, poisoned by ego and self-importance. It's recommended for those who could sit through 122 uneven minutes of Kate Hudson saying things like ""You're too sweet for Rock'n'Roll"", and ""We inspire the music!"" without vomiting on themselves.",Almost Famous

He has done more in his lifetime than many of us could only dream and for him to share some of this very personal subject with the audiences of the world is not only gracious, it is also highly commendable.

Set in 1973, this coming of age film is all about finding yourself.The story focuses on William Miller (Patrick Fugit) an aspiring rock journalist. With the guidance of his mentor, legendary rock critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) William is given an assignment to write an article for Creem magazine and this is the beginning of his journey. Recognised by Rolling Stone magazine, William soon defies his overbearing mother (Frances McDormand) and goes on tour with up and coming band 'Stillwater' writing for Rolling Stone. Despite being 'the enemy- a rock critic', William slips into the inner circle.Star of the band Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) is the fast living, disillusioned rock star on the edge of fame who carries William with him on his emotional journey, giving him a glimpse into the lonely world of rock and roll. Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) is the free spirited leader of the 'Band-Aids', the group of girls who refuse to be called groupies because of their dedication to specific bands and the music. It is between these two characters that we see the romance of the narrative. However, William becomes infatuated with Penny Lane and a bond develops between them.Crowe admitted to struggling when writing this piece, confessing his ambivalence of what the main focus on the narrative should be. The competing story lines and relationships between William and his mother, William and Penny, Penny and Russell and much more suggest he couldn't resolve this yet it still seems to work.With such unforgettable lines as ""My son has been kidnapped by rock stars"" to ""I am a golden god"", combined with masterful performance, and a heart-warming story, this film is a stunning success that I would recommend to all.",Almost Famous

Months later when at a local movie rental store I decided to give it a chance, I was blown away.  It was so good I immediately watched it again.

Those who labeled the odd choice as merely cheap gimmickry must not have been aware of the film's glorious spell; the song single-handedly mirrors William's growing adoration, with all its earnest innocence, while also poetically contrasting the horror and obscenity of drug overdose. In short, I was floored. I was enchanted. Almost Famous has since become one of those magical movies that I refuse to watch more than once per year, just so that I can savor its taste.Again, those critics who dare criticize the script's character development are miles off the mark. What establishes Almost Famous in the leagues of great films is its vibe. The sex, drugs, and rock and roll are all accounted for, but conveyed with a tender honesty and an eye for the humanity that is inevitably involved. This is realism in its noblest degree: there is no over dramatizing; The aforementioned drug overdose, in all it's sad beauty, is the only one to be found in the entire movie, and though this isn't akin to a documentary, the film resists the urge to let all its guts hang out for cheap shock value.See this film.

Without a doubt this is my favourite movie of 2000 (and of the 2001-2s that I've seen so far), with very honourable mentions going out to Wonder Boys, Gosford Park, Amelie, Crouching Tiger, Traffic etc.  I have to draw a distinction though between what I label as my favourite movies and what I give best movie title to.  My favourite movies are the ones that I can see over and over and they get better every time. They are the must haves for the DVD collection.  The best movies are the ones that blow you away on the first few viewings but tend to bore if seen to often.  These are the movies that I would vote for if I was on the acadamy, while the favourite movies are the ones I secretly root for when I'm watching the Oscars.  For example, in 1999 I would give the best picture nod to American Beauty, an incredibly deep, emotional and intelligent movie.  But, from that year, I have watched no movie more than Magnolia, so I give it my favourite movie of the year distinction.  For 2000, the best movie was Traffic. Traffic was objective and truthful (other than the witness asassination scene) account of the American drug problem, but at the same time was passionate and artistic. However, I would rate it as my 3rd favourite movie of the year behind Wonder Boys (#2) and Cameron Crowe's masterpiece, Almost Famous.  The movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Cameron's unbelievable exploits as a teenage music critic for Rolling Stone Magazine. Looking at what he did at the age of 15 makes me want to leave home and go out on an adventure, experience the world.  This of course is a major theme in this movie.  William (played superbly by first time actor Patrick Fugit) leaves his loving mother (played by one of the best actors in Hollywood today- Frances McDormand), leaves in the middle of his graduating year at high school, and experiences the world of sex, drugs and rock and roll. Some of my love for this movie comes from my recent discovery of the amazing music that was created during the late 60's and early 70's.  Some of the great bands are given a great tribute in this movie, including Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Guess Who, Bowie, Yes, Neil Young, Black Sabath just to name a few.  This was a time when people's lives revolved around the those brilliant bands and the music that makes the drivel that is produced today sound like the crap it is.  The love of the music (and the love of the time in general) is displayed perfectly by the ""band-aids"", with the soon to be superstar Kate Hudson at the head.  Crowe takes us seemlessly in and out of moments of pure laughter, heartbreaking lows and those of complete joy.  I could only imagine that this was what life could have been like for many of the lucky ones that grew up during this time. Anyways, I guess I rambling on, what I want to get across is that should all go out and buy a copy of Almost Famous because this one is a gem.  If you haven't seen it, go immediately to your local video store and rent it out, if you've already seen it, do the exact same thing.  **** out of four.",Almost Famous
665,420dank,Totally annoying rubbish,1,23 March 2002,"It is a complete joke that this film is in the top 250 and has such a high rating. I have always thought the ratings on here to be VERY accurate and reliable. When this abortion of a movie was about to play on cable I looked it up on the IMDB to see if it was worth my time and when I saw the rating I knew for sure I had to see it. Boy was I wrong... it is total drivel. I also am a huge Frances McDormand fan and her small part in this is lame and not believable at all. There is very little about this story that is believable in fact. It started off fairly promising but quickly disintegrated into awfulness. I have been on the road with a fairly successful rock band and worked for some other smaller bands and this portrayal is nonsense. The groupies, the writers and magazine people are so contrived and cliche, as are the members of Stillwater. The girl who OD's and the whole OD scene is terrible and total fluff. Oh, and the ending totally bites too. I can go on and on but I will close by repeating how offended I am by the score this movie recieves and the reviews I have read praising this pathetic load of horse manure. Hopefully, people who know what a good film is will get on here and vote this mess out of the top 250.1 out of 10",Almost Famous
666,cat1881,Praise about such a great film!,10,23 February 2002,"This is my all time favorite movie. The music, the actors, the director...it all comes together to form an amazing film like no other. The fact that is a semi autobiographical (Cameron Crowe's story) makes it even more unbelievable...and amazing. The music in the movie was perfectly chosen and Cameron Crowe puts each song in the right place. It is also the first time Led Zeppelin has approved the use of their songs in a movie, which is a great step. There is nothing I would change about this movie!",Almost Famous
667,jsdavidson,amazing,8,27 March 2006,"tells of not only the life of a rock star in a true light, but is a history lesson of the early 70's story is great tells of sex, drug,rock n roll,love, jealously, and fear of people knowing who your really are. this is story that defines a decade in a true light. It does not glorify or denounce the lifestyle of a rock star or a groupie or a journalist. As a musician this story has inspired me to keep on playing when I just get tired of it all. On another note if you like classic rock. This movie is loaded with great music. From bands such as black sabbath, Iggy pop, led zeppelin, and Elton john. the music in this movie is incorporated in an interesting way. which you will must see for yourself",Almost Famous

671,O_Henry,Offers a glimpse into the world of Rock n Roll,9,7 April 2002,"This film offers a detailed glimpse into the great and insane world of rock. It covers most of the aspects of the rock n roll lifestyle (love, journalism, criticism, touring, drugs, alcohol, creative differences,& power struggles). I think Cameron Crowe did a great job of capturing not only the good side of rock music, but the ugly side as well. The film also takes a look at maturing, learning, and basically growing up.",Almost Famous
672,tarrabv,Almost Famous for Journ 110,8,29 November 2007,"Though I never lived through the era depicted in the 2000 film, Almost Famous, I do feel it was a very accurate representation of the effect of popular music on society, especially young adults, during that time and fundamentals of rock and roll that still ring clearly today. I learned the exact devotion that fans had back then with their music, and how much they connected with it, which, I also feel, paved the way for the way many turn to music today: to express their emotions whether it be extreme love or extreme hate.The film also followed the pursuit of a young, inexperienced journalist who is looking to get an amazing story about an up and coming band. While on tour with the band, he learns more than he ever wanted to know about the members and realizes that they truly are real people too. I think this is a situation to be examined by any journalism student, to see exactly what it takes and the many extremes you must go through to get the ""inside dirt"" and truly capture the essence of your story assignment.What stuck out the most to me about the film was the passion the characters showed towards what they did. I think this is also an important learning lesson for any one, no matter what happens and what you go through, if you are doing what you love that's what matters. The character of Jeff Bebe managed to say it the best, ""Some people have a hard time explaining rock 'n' roll. I don't think anyone can really explain rock 'n' roll but that's okay. Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle and a way of thinking... and it's not about money and popularityBut it's a voice that says, ""Here I am... and f*** you if you can't understand me."" And one of these people is gonna save the world. And that means that rock 'n' roll can save the world... all of us togetherBut what it all comes down to is that thing. The indefinable thing when people catch something in your music.""",Almost Famous
673,VVBLiSS,Behind Enemy Lines,8,5 December 2007,"Never have I seen a movie, based on the music scene and its coverage, that flows so well. It is easy to place one in the shoes of the main character, for he is very average. He reminds me of how many Americans view themselves. The intricacies of following musicians is depicted with amazing accuracy.The supporting cast superbly directed this movie in a solid direction. The cohesion is apparent in most scenes, even the naughty times are lightly thrown into the mix, in this beautiful film. Seventies music scene was a little rambunctious, as the little reporter found out. The topic of this movie relates to me, fully. Music and writing go hand in hand. One typically writes music, then plays it for an audience, if one so desires. When you get paid more and more, things tend to escalate among those involved, all wanting some of the money. These scenarios are typical of most music scenes, but this film brought light to some aspects many may have overlooked. This movie was thoroughly enjoyable and inspired me to be a writer for Rolling Stone or some interesting magazine, like that. There are pitfalls in every job, but if you have fun and enjoy your work, then you are never working a day in your life, as the saying goes. This movie has an underlying message of hope and shows how a boy followed his dreams, without regard to obvious setbacks on his path to writing an article for a big magazine. Many positive influences are shown among the other influences of Rock N Roll, in this era. I love this movie each time I see it.",Almost Famous

There were superb performances by Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, I really saw them as a band member and a groupie of their time. The aeroplane turbulence scene is one of the funniest film scenes I have ever seen - I laugh just thinking about it.It picks up on the feeling of the era very well with the choice of music being second to none.

There were so many parts when i thought the band was going to break up over stupid issues and fights.....one thing i noticed was that the rock and roll scene today has not really changed from the 70's still drugs and sex and groupies, maybe not as much acid use but other hallucinogens have taken its place, my favorite part of the movie was when they all thought they were gonna die on the plane and started telling secrets, but then they didn't die and everybody acted all salty, like it would have been better if they did die. as a final thought i thought they could have picked a more attractive set of groupies especially penny (hudson), i just think she doesn't really fit the role.",Almost Famous
676,shadow_hippie_013,My All-Time favorite Movie,10,4 June 2008,"""Well, to begin with..."" There really are not enough words to describe the brilliance of this movie. It combines brilliant writing, acting, and direction to make a heart warming film about a boy and his dream. William Miller, wonderfully portrayed by Patrick Fugit, idolizes these rock stars that he finally gets to meet out on tour. Only then does he realize what they really are. Russell, great performance by Billy Crudup, is really only out for himself and Jeff, another great performance by Jason Lee, is jealous at every action Russell does. The rest of the cast is brilliant. Frances McDormand is wonderful as William's overprotective mother and Kate Hudson is equally as great as the band-aid, Penny Lane. My favorite performance goes to Philip Seymour Hoffman as the iconic Lester Bangs. He steals all the scenes that he is in. All these actors fit their roles extremely well and portray these people even better. All this is thanks to the wonderful script written by Cameron Crowe.This is about him, so you would expect it to be good, but not this good. I think this will always be my favorite movie, and I haven't really seen one that is even close to surpassing this one. I highly recommend this film to every and anyone interested in seeing it. Even if you're not, see it anyway. You won't regret it.",Almost Famous

I thought that Almost Famous was the perfect choice. Not only does this movie have a great cast, but it also has amazing music. I love how the movie is based on the director's own experiences. The movie kept my interest throughout its entirety and it's definitely in my top 10 favorite movies. My favorite actress is Kate Hudson and I thought that she did a phenomenal job and my favorite song in the movie has to be Tiny Dancer by Elton John.

Is an exiting trip to the 70's that mix people linked to rock n' roll who could really feel, and experience, and live all the spirit and pure essence and magic of music and those crazy-celebrity-followers always looking to catch the ""shiny"" reflex from a ray of fame.Penny Lane is the most wonderful fantasy a man can dream.

When you watch Almost Famous, you feel like you are a part of the movie, right there with the cast and a little piece of that experience stays with you afterwards.

680,LakrsFn24,Fantastic Movie,9,24 August 2008,"Overall, just a great movie. I just watched this movie again for the first time in years and it really holds up well. It's got a great plot and character development, along with a time period setting. The movie isn't all feel-good in itself but as a whole, you can't walk away from this movie without having a big smile on your face.Kate Hudson gives a great performance as Penny Lane in this movie; easily the best of her career and you can see why she got so many rave reviews when this was first released. Match that with her ""pretty"" looks and girl-next-door smile, and you have a winning combination. Billy Crudrup also gives a good performance as the star of the rock band the movie follows, Stillwater. Carrying the ego of a rock star, yet still able to show a human side of himself, it's hard to knock anything about his performance.If you have two hours to spare and just want to sit down and watch one heck of a movie, Almost Famous is always going to be a good choice. After watching it again, it's a wonder why I haven't made it a point to see it again sooner. It's a movie that will truly never get old and it will always be more than ""Almost"" Famous in my book.",Almost Famous

I've been on the road most of my life, and there are several moments in Almost Famous that take me right there! Touring with rock bands is a very unique experience, indeed, and yes, there are girls, parties, etc. However, it is work, nonetheless, and all the ups & downs of work are there just like anywhere else. But because you are in a protective ""bubble"" where Mom, Dad and everyone else you know cannot see what you're up to, the excitement level is gargantuan. A real stroke of genius by the producers and art directors for excellent attention to detail. The Penny Lane character is the one that really captures the spirit of this real-life fantasy world where, literally, anything can happen. Highly recommended.",Almost Famous
683,behicks,Forrest Gump meets Spinal Tap,6,25 December 2002,"Almost Famous is a great movie, very enjoyable to watch with superb acting(Hudson, Fugit, Lee Crudup) and great music(why didn't the Neil Young songs make the soundtrack????).The movie attempts to come off as realistically as Spinal-Tap, but comes up short in this respect.  It ends up more like Forrest Gump, with a nerdy, naive kid thrust into an incredible string of encounters with sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, each very entertaining but not very believable.  None of this would ever happen to a kid like this in the setting of a 1973 Zeppelin/Black Sabbath wannabee band on the road.For example:  I just can't picture a Zeppelin/Black Sabbath wannabee band spontaneously breaking into a sing-along of Tiny Dancer on their tour bus. Yet, I still love this scene and watch it over and over again.Another example:  The plane scene where they hit the turbulence and everyone ends up blurting out death-bed confessions, and then there is no crash. Um, this was a little over-the-top for me.And Rolling Stone assigning a 15 year-old kid to a cover story without ever meeting or verifying the kids credentials?  Come on.  And the scene of Kate Hudson skating around the gym with flowers or kleenex or whatever that was, geeesh.However, despite all of that I do love the movie and bought the DVD that has the extra scenes added.  I think the movie ends up being about 2 Hours, 40 minutes long with the extra scenes.  I find myslef watching it over and over again.Brian",Almost Famous

It shows Rock 'n' Roll is not just about getting smashed, its about the love and the fans. Everything about this film was just brilliant, with an amazing soundtrack, and to top it all off an amazing cast. Billy Crudup, was outstanding at playing Russel, i really felt every bit of emotion.

688,rawbecht,cameron crowe-great filmmaker/writer,10,3 November 2003,"I think Cameron Crowe is a great writer and great filmmaker.  I have every one of his seven movies and think they are all amazing in their own ways. Granted ""The Wild Life"" doesn't have a lot to it, there is still some good stuff with the characters.  My two favorites are Crowe's last two, Vanilla Sky and Almost Famous.  I know Vanilla Sky isn't Crowe's writing but I still think he did a good job of remaking Abre los Ojos.  I have the original and have seen it about 10 times.  It gets criticized a lot for being a simple copy but that's what I like about it.  I like how Crowe remade a brilliant movie but for the American audience.  We don't usually get to see a movie like this and Crowe exposed us to this.  Almost Famous is another amazing film.  He basically chronicles Crowe's early life when he worked for Rolling Stone.  I love the relationship that William has with Penny and the relationship with Russell.  I also love Jason Lee.  He is an amazing actor on so many levels.  His lines are great in both Vanilla Sky and Almost Famous.  I also like the fact that Crowe uses many of the same actors in his movies like the obvious Cruise and Lee but then the guys who don't have big roles like Noah Taylor and Eric Stoltz.  He also has a great soundtrack for every movie, using music to create the most memorable scenes including the boombox scene from Say Anything, the tiny dancer scene in Almost Famous, and basically every scene in Vanilla Sky.  I just wanted to say that I love what Cameron writes and I hope that he continues to produce brilliant movies. They may not always have box office success and they may get some negative criticism.  But opinions are like assh*les, everyone has one.",Almost Famous

It is funny, feel good and everything i wanted it to be. I love the bus scene where they all start singing Tiny Dancer [By the way buy the soundtrack it features Elton John, Rod Stewart, The Who, Simon and Garfunkel and the Stillwater song Fever Dog] and also the plane scene ""I'm gay!"" Then there's the party with Russell on acid ""I am a GOLDEN GOD"" and Williams mother ""Your mom kinda freaked me out"".Almost Famous is one of the best feel good movies ever it even beats The School Of Rock.

But what I saw was enough to make me desire to see it again. And when I watched it, I saw in William the same desires and conflicting emotions that i was feeling. Indeed, it is thanks to this film that I decided to become a journalist. it is also thanks to this film, that I managed to turn my life around and begin believing that life is worth living as long as you have one true thing for you to cling to.

691,andyj18,A love letter to life on the road,10,3 February 2004,"The film is based, I believe, on Crowe's own experiences as a youngster, when he hung out with rock stars and wrote for Rolling Stone while most people his age were trying to get their first date. His honest affection for the music and life he led shines through in every frame, so don't expect a critical or deep analysis.And yes, there's plenty of rock cliches as mentioned - the plane sequence, the drugs, the groupies - but the film is a celebration of these very cliches, because they are part of rock folklore and, let's face it, the reason why most of us have dreamed (or still do dream) of becoming a rock star at one time or another. Well, except the plane bit...
However, to say the film is cliched in that William learns life's lessons is, I think, wide of the mark. He doesn't profoundly reconsider life, he just gains experience and realises he loves this world he's been invited into even more. Basically, how could a 15 year old go on the road with a rock band in the 1970s and not have his eyes opened?!The soundtrack is also great, and Frances McDormand is excellent (as always) as William's embarrassing, over-protective mother.Basically, don't expect any shocking twists or deep thinking, but if you're a fan of great music, life on the road and the whole ludicrous circus that was rock's golden age, then just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Almost Famous

Without question then, Almost Famous is the most romantic movie ever made.Almost overwhelmed by the beauty of its musical heart, I never wanted this movie to end. I didn't want these experiences, some of them so familiar and others brand new, to stop playing out in front of me. As my wife and I left the theater exhilarated, there was just a twinge of sadness. We got to share that THING, that unconditional love for music, all of us in the audience, and now it was time to just leave?What the heck...?At one point in the film, William Miller is shown running his fingers over an album cover as if to further connect to the whole musical experience. Well, if it were possible (and not highly suspect), I'd give a ridiculous hug to the film cannister this movie shipped in!

The cast is also really great. Not very many movies today capture what it was like during those times but this one was great. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 10 is because the plot was a little off in some parts of the movie and Jason Lee tries to hard to be a serious actor when in reality he should stick to pure comedy movies. The music would be enough reason alone to see this movie. Kate Hudson does a great job as Penny Lane. I don't think anyone could have done a better job capturing the character persona of Penny Lane. Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup do a pretty good job. Kate Hudson is still the best in this movie. Some artists on the soundtrack include The Who and Elton John. I have the DVD and it is pretty cool.

696,zepfan52886,Almost a 10,9,7 June 2004,"I loved that it was an ensemble piece. There wasn't really a STAR of the movie....not just one main character. I loved the relationships as well. Because 15 year old boys/girls DO ""fall in love"" with older, cooler, people that they idolize, we are witness to William's adoration of Penny. The relationships between the band mates were dead on accurate, not only to the times but as well as today. More often then not, no matter what band or group there is, some form of jealousy will appear, and it will either break up or seriously damage the band's trust with each other. This happened when the market-moguls came in and changed the manager. When they did that, Stillwater became more cooperate and the band began to deteriorate, which is what happened back then A LOT. As for specific relationships, Penny was a lost woman who was reaching out to Russell for companionship, though she was well aware that he was involved with his ex-wife and their relationship could never happen. This hurt her, so she took in and guarded any love that was sent her way, even if it came from a star-struck 15 year old William. Love was love to her; love was love to EVERYONE in the 60's and 70's. It didn't matter where it came from, just as long as the potential for good sex was there. She was broken, and searching for something to keep her going. As you saw in the end, a change of her bad habits, a change of scenery, would do that for her.The sex and drugs depicted in the film holds so true to what went on 'behind the scenes.' There were teenagers who went and followed the band, because they 'loved the music so much it hurt,' and had sex with other teenagers and older groupies/band-aids (in other words, sex ruled all). They were freer, and the story depicted that. No, the freedom that they gave themselves didn't always result in positive things, but the 70's were like that.The portrayal of the 'groupie' scene was remarkably spot on, indicating that Cameron Crowe has been a part of, at least to some extent, the music scene in the 70's. The film accurately showed what happened after a concert. The band members would point to girls during the show; their security team would steal them away from the crowd and send them on up to the hotel rooms, where the band would receive 'gratitude' for their music (and bulge in their tight pants) from their adoring fans. That was the world of rock. It still is, depending on the morals of the bands today, and what they have chosen to learn from their music-forefathers. The script poignantly portrays the humanity of society during a time where drugs and sex ruled all. I say, well done.....overall to the movie, and yes, as well as to the hot guys.",Almost Famous
697,mammamia87,More than Almost Perfect,10,21 November 2004,"Absolutely wonderful. Almost Famous follows the tale of gorgeous, talented Patrick Fugit as an interveiwer of the fictional band Stillwater. You can cry and laugh at the same time here. Kate Hudson does a Oscar-worthy job playing the Band Aid Penny Lane, but its such an free-spirited part I'm sure anyone could have done it as well. Hudson and Fugit are the star roles in this and really brig the movie to life, as does the wonderful soundtrack. Fugit's mother, Frances McDormand was wonderful and brought back memories of my own slightly barmy paranoid mother. Favorite movie of all time and my comments are terrible to describe such a good movie. 11 out of 10!!",Almost Famous
698,shawnybug98117,Possibly my favorite film of all time.,10,9 August 2013,"""I'm on drugs!"" is the first thing you will say once you're finished watching Almost Famous. It's that good. That's basically how Russell would describe it, and that's exactly how I would describe it as well. Almost Famous is the story of an excluded high school student/rock writer that gets a chance to write an article for Rolling Stone about an up-and-coming band; much to the dismay of his over-protective mother. This is a semi-true story based on Cameron Crowe's early years. The film includes extraordinary performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, and Jason Lee, but every Almost Famous fan would agree that the real stars are Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson. Frances McDormand beautifully plays the mother, while Kate Hudson is a groupie that rides with the band throughout the time that the writer (William Miller) is with the band. Both earned Academy Award nominations, but neither won. Over time, it is fairly obvious that Kate Hudson should have won. The film brought both actresses great success, but the really winner was Hudson, who has gained role after role since then. Now-a-days, she hasn't had that much, most likely because she never really showed the acting that she did in Almost Famous ever again. One Academy Award nomination that Almost Famous failed to grasp is for best picture. And really, was Chocolat really that good? Almost Famous earned a mere one win, going to it's magical writing by Cameron Crowe. It also had an amazing soundtrack that was mentioned countlessly in the script, and perfectly portrays music in the 1970's.Overall, this film is one of if not my favorite film of all time, and is a must-see for anybody that has ever even heard of the 1970's.A+",Almost Famous

I saw all of the above...Love Patrick Fugit, love Kate Hudson, love it all.

The acting performances of all the actors are very good and they make you feel what they feel in almost every scene. It's emotional and it's fun at the same time. At times you may feel a bit out of the rhythm, but at the end of the day, it lives up to the expectations of the audience in one way or the other.

I love the music and absolutely everything about it. Kate Hudson is my idol here. Anyhoo...those are just my thoughts. Oh yeah, And Patrick Fugit it just absolutely adorable! Philip Seymour Hoffman does an amazing job as Lester Bangs. If you listen to interviews of Lester, the voice is right on! This is one of those movies where you can watch it multiple times and pick up a new favourite scene or moment every time, because you find a new meaning in it. Cameron Crowe was really able to tell the tales of his early life with creativity and an impeccable eye for details and exact moments from his memory.

A word stating my utter frustration and confusion. After watching this I saw Glitter, and i must say, that piece of mindless candy made me feel a lot more depressed! I got the impression that this was a 122 minute long on nothing, with some good music and the writers name as the only things to save it. And indeed, it truly gets saved. On each and every review i have read, the music and the writer's amazing history was praised unto oblivion. I didn't know that Cameron Crowe was the writer, and that may have been what saved me. I guess he created some adequate films, but it cannot save this film, and neither can the soundtrack Almost Famous is so shallow, both feeling- and plotwise, with puns that can be predicted hours in advance. Come on, the whole Morocco deal was so obvious, and the love plot with William, Penny Lane and the various band members, my God. Even the pathetic remarks that are supposed to make it look, i repeat, LOOK like a comedy are so flat and tedious that they really never were worth the effort to begin with. The only thing it needed to enter the film genre of ""Teen Comedy"" was chicks, drugs, and a wide and unimportant array of persons... wait... Well, if it were up to me, Cameron Crowe would be turning in the grave he had dug for himself with this shoddy remake of his youth, but I see that after Citizen Kane he has moved into the ranks of untouchable and uncritizised.

From the perfect script through to his fantastic film-making style, Almost Famous has one of the best ensemble casts ever constructed, with performance-bests by most of the cast. Crowe has the unbelievable skill of being able to allow the viewer the experience the 70s without even being there. By far the greatest account of Rock 'N' Roll (yes, that's even better than Spinal Tap!), the film builds on Crowe's abilities as a filmmaker, from Say Anything through to Singles and then Jerry Maguire, and while Vanilla Sky and Elizabethtown are both brilliant films in their own right, Almost Famous will remain Crowe's undoubtable masterpiece.

(This basically is the story of writer/director Cameron Crowe's fifteenth year.) This movie is rockin' awesome, for the following reasons: 1) Great quotes, including the afore-mentioned one, spoken by the film's Lester Bangs (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is always a joy). 2) Great music--which you'd have to expect from Mr. Cameron Crowe. 3) Great acting, from a cast of (then) mostly-unknowns. 4) Good story. There's only 3 plots in the world, and this is one that combines them all.Add to these the element of star-screwing (if you're familiar with classic rock at all, you should be able to recognize some names and some fan-adoration...""Mr....Mr. Robert Plant...he touched this pen!""), the ethereal beauty and gorgeous vulnerability of Kate Hudson (and I'm not usually a fan of young actresses, due to the fact that most of them suck), and the sweet naiveté and teen angst of Patrick Fugit.

I'm from the 90's and this was my first met with the 70's. Cameron Crowe showed a part of his albums and it is wonderful.

Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this film, started writing for Rolling Stone when he was 16, and toured with bands like Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers Band. Crowe wrote this autobiographical film about his own experiences on the road with famous rock bands of the 1970s. Patrick Fugit's take on William Miller is brilliant. I really related to his character's family, and school life. Kate Hudson is amazing in this film, which led her to win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.

The music adds a special quality to the film that only the special genre it inhabits could posses. True rock fans will appreciate each song choice, and yearn to have experienced the back roads of 70s rock and roll.

710,gary-540,Does Anybody Remember Laughter?,9,8 May 2005,"Where to start with this review? I think it's the period feel, the early 70's when rock music was not understood or controlled by the marketing men, when bands toured incessantly to get their music promoted, before MTV, before ""celebrity"" status, when rock music was a cult that mainstream society was totally ignorant of, when ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll"" was still appropriate lifestyle behaviour for musicians who couldn't care less what anyone thought of them.Amongst all the positive emotions, I felt a tinge of sadness and a yearning for a simpler more honest period when the music and the fans were what mattered, not the profit and loss account.Being a massive fan of Led Zeppelin, this film clearly draws on their touring exploits - ""the riot house"", the ""golden god"" scene, the relationship between the moody star guitarist and the lead singer all ring true, as does the slightly unrealistic aircraft scene.The acting is warm and natural, and as many have commented Kate Hudson's performance as ""Penny Lane"" is terrific, as was that of Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand and Patrick Fugit.There was a lot of reality with the relationship with ""Rolling Stone"" magazine - yes they did hand out a lot of criticism to some of the finest music ever made.Some have commented that the drugs and seedy side of touring are not shown as much as they should be - true enough, and this does make the film somewhat ""rose tinted"" in its portrayal of the period - but everyone is allowed to remember their favourite period of growing up the way they want to.I rented this film, and now I have bought it - fantastic is all I have to say.ps: Did I mention the music - 5 Led Zeppelin tracks and a whole lot more - my wife said ""this is your record collection on film isn't it?""",Almost Famous

715,Lorin_Voegeli,I just made a review,7,12 July 2005,"Almost FamousI really liked this film, because it's very funny but also exciting. I think it's a mix between a film with a interesting exciting story and a documentation about the rock music and the life as a rock star. The main subjects of the film are sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. In my opinion, the beginning is a bit complicated but very important for the story. The sister teach him about the rock'n'roll and he learns to love it. Penny or should I say Lady is a very interesting character too. She's mysterious and very special but also kind and pretty. One of the greatest parts is the one in the plane. There, the truth appears. The relationships between the members of the band Stillwater are bad, but that makes it interesting to travel with them and their tour bus. In the middle, the film goes more and more boring, because there's hardly ever something new. In the end it is exciting again, because we don't know how it will end. The time, when it plays is very good imitated, you think that you are in this time. The soundtrack is surly one of the best points of this film, but there are some bad points too. For example, that everything is a bit unclear. All in all I find it's a good film.",Almost Famous

The film hasn't got special effects but it doesn't need some. In this film we can see a little bit of life in 1970 and the problems with drugs. In my opinion the film is not too short but it doesn't take too long too. The scene where Russel and William are at the party is a very special scene. It shows us the way of thinking in this time. Russel is standing on the roof and says: I'm on drugs and the other people are screaming and laughing. After Russel says: I dig music but the people haven't fun after that. The scene where Stillwater, William and Russel's wife are in the plane and it's stormy is great. They all think, that they'll die and they tell all their secrets to the others. To my mind it's a very funny, interesting scene. The only things I dislike in this scene, are the special effects. While the plane was in the storm it doesn't look like it's true. The end of the film is for me a bit unclear I like the great music of Stillwater in many of the scenes. But I have to say that this movie is particularly a bit melancholic.",Almost Famous

They are very success-full but they have also problems like ""normal people"" . Drugs, sex take a big place in the film and shows us, that the life, when you are a star, can be really difficult. One time, Russell, I think he is the singer of the band, and Williams are at a party and Russell wants to jump down from a roof of a house to the pool in the garden. He is drunken and he shouts to the people, perhaps they are his fans:"" I'm on drugs"" and every body shouts enthusiastic. And then he shouts:"" I dig music"".

719,debastif,Nor to bad,6,12 July 2005,"Almost FamousIt surprises me how a film about rock-Stars can be good. The film is made like a reportage about the band Stillwater and her Band Aids. In the film are bad scenes, for example, when a Band Aid died, and happy scenes, for example, when William comes home after the Tour with Stillwater, and comical scenes, when they sit in a plane and fly in a storm.the main character is William, a Journalist. He has to write a story for a magazine about Stillwater, but on tour he hasn't time to write.The film has a very good passive Soundtrack, but there aren't many good songs, which are suitable to the film, except when Stillwater plays.A real problem is that the film has two or three very big events, like the concerts of Stillwater at the beginning of the film, but later there aren't any big events. At the End they've get help from embarrassing scenes, like traveling by bus, that scene we see many times.Until yet I've wrote many bad things about Almost Famous, but I think there are also good things.

I think that the film has been directed in a very delicate and sensible manor, which could partly be due to it being a semi autobiographical account of the director (Cameron Crowe)'s experiences of teenage rock journalism whilst he was growing up. The cast was perfectly chosen, and they complimented each other fantastically in order to give a very realistic performance.
