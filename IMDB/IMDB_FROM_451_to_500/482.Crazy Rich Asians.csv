0,MartinHafer,"Apparently, the first of three...and quite enjoyable.",8,21 December 2018,"My daughter loved this movie...so much that she found the book from which the story was based. While she MUCH prefered the movie for many reasons, she also informed me that this is only a third of the story and that two follow-up films have been slated.Constance Wu (from ""Fresh Off the Boat"") plays Rachel, an American Economics professor who doesn't realize she's dating a man whose family is among the richest in Southeast Asia. Oddly, he never mentioned this and his family only comes up when he announces, out of the blue, that he's returning to Singapore for a wedding and wants her to come along to show her off to his family and friends. Once there, she realizes she's in for a surprise....not only because they are so wealthy but because many of them are bigoted jerk-faces. Can she manage to deal with these vipers or is her relationship doomed?While some might call this a rom-com, there isn't a lot of comedy in this movie. Instead, it's more an interesting lesson about wealth and Singaporan-Chinese culture. In this sense, I found it very interesting and I enjoyed watching it while occasionally yelling out ""dump the boyfriend""...much to my daughter's annoyance, though, fortunately, we saw it at home and not in a theater! Worth seeing and cleverly written.",Crazy Rich Asians
1,SnoopyStyle,a few flaws in the diamond,7,17 November 2018,"NYU economics professor Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) is dating Nick Young (Henry Golding). As the best man, he invites her to his cousin's wedding in Singapore. She does not know that he's the heir apparent to a family empire.This mostly works as a romance and family soap opera. It does have a few flaws in an otherwise valiant effort. First, I don't love this couple. I like them enough but I don't love them. It's missing the meet-cute. The movie does open with a racism-cute and I don't propose to cut that out. The relationship is simply underdeveloped. The couple has only one scene together before the movie starts throwing the Oh-He's-Super-Rich stuff at her. It needs more and it may help to have a scene with him and her mother. Their lives in New York need more time. The one scene I could cut out is the poker scene. It's meant to connect with the climatic mahjong scene but that's the next flaw.The mahjong scene is a high difficulty move. It has to solve the conundrum in the characters' relationship. Without giving spoilers, the scene isn't perfect. First, one needs to know how to play the game in order to understand what the characters are doing. Second, Rachel needs to show both perfect deference and perfect defiance. It's almost an impossible task which they try to do with the game. It may work in a book where the author can explain the concepts. A movie doesn't have the time to explain it all. I would do it differently but I must admit that I may not have it cracked either. Rachel should at least defend her mother in her speech.What's great are the actors and the simple act of making this film. The characters are compelling if only Ken Jeong can hold back a little. Michelle Yeoh is a great dragon lady. The staging is impressive. For all the riches, this diamond does have its flaws.",Crazy Rich Asians
2,Hitchcoc,Fluffy Romance,6,2 September 2018,"People seem to love or hate it. It is a simple plot with an awful lot of glitz. An attractive Chinese American woman falls for a handsome Chines man. After a while it is decided that she will meet his family. It turns out they are some of the richest people on earth. Of course, clashes with Asian tradition, mostly relating to family throw curves along the way. While it is interesting, it is pretty predictable and dull at times. What saves it is some information that comes in late that forces several issues.",Crazy Rich Asians
3,Horst_In_Translation,What a difference a game of Mahjong makes,6,11 September 2018,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a new American movie from 2018 and one of the most successful comedies of the summer this year, maybe even of the entire year. There are so many films that focus on African Americans (some major successes at the Oscars too recently, pretty much one per year) only these days from Hollywood, in terms of both drama and comedy, so a bit surprising it took this long until we finally get one that features Asians/Asian Americans only and with some smart references about flower festivals for example it was a success from this perspective. Director is Jon M. Chu, a pretty successful Hollywood movie maker in recent years and funnily he was mostly known for directing Justin Bieber music videos early in his career. Now back to this one. You can call it a romantic comedy, but you would only be partially correct because the drama component is dominant too on many occasions. The comedy also is not as much as you may think about depicting rich and their decadent ways in a humorous fashion. And still they did not seem unlikable which is certainly a success. The two lead actors are not too famous admittedly, especially the male who has not acted before this film we have here. But the likes of former Bond girl Michelle Yeoh as well as Hangover running gag Ken Jeong will be familiar to many. Awkwafina is one the newer generation of movie goers (and rap music fans) will recognize and the older ones will be amazed to see Lisa Lu, who admittedly looks really good for the age of 90. I also liked how her character and the relationship to Yeoh's were somewhat mirrored in the next generation with Yeoh's taking the role of the old woman.I cannot deny that I had many problems with this film though to be honest. One was the depiction of the male central character. I am not sure to which extent acting was the problem here, but honestly he may be super rich, but he is also as bland as it gets to be honest the way he was written. It's okay if the film is supposed to be more about Wu's character, but I still would have expected more for/from Golding. A great deal here is about the clash of worlds for the former as she from a relatively poor background enters the world of the super rich and super famous, thus the cinderella reference on one occasion too. So how, if they are together for a pretty long time, he never told her where he originates from. A mystery. I mean he does not need to say how rich he is exactly, but she knew virtually nothing. But like I said, apart from a slightly fishy parody of a famous Godfather scene, the clashes between her world and the man's family's world were okay to watch. Still there were more embarrassing minor moments like the wine spilling scene (just too generic), the talk where his former girlfriend gets a bit bitchy or the other story line about a cheating husband that felt really out of place and adding drama for the sake of it. But not all the drama involving the main characters was a success to be honest either. The final revelation with the female protagonist's family background honestly had telenovela level in the worst imaginable way possible with the meeting between the young and the old, the detective talk, the mother appearing all of a sudden, the rushed-in marriage proposal (the second in the plane isn't any better). They really messed up in terms of dramatic story telling I must say.Maybe it would have been better to take the comedy route 100% because this is where the film succeeds the most and as there is almost 0% comedy to the two main characters' story, the supporting players have to deliver it and they do so pretty convincingly. Awkwafina did not do too much for me, even less than in the new Ocean's movie, but everybody from her character's family was pretty hilarious, especially father and son. And there are other minor characters that provide for some decent comedic relief. The best moments? Perhaps the wedding scene which somehow had me choked up a bit because it looked very beautiful with the water and plants and everything else. The music there was great too and I am saying all this as somebody who is not too interested in marriage as a concept. Sadly, the party scenes afterwards were when the film really hit rock bottom. I mentioned the detective story already, but also the actress moving from one guy to the next immediately and nobody cares was just bizarre, especially with her motivations. I know it was included for comedic reasons, but just didn't work at all for me. Admittedly that guy she moves on to is one that also made me laugh once or twice during the film, but not more often. The comedy here is pretty interesting as a whole I would say. It is more subtle than you think on many occasions, but it cannot make up for crucial flaws in other areas, like I am not sure about the Mahjong game at all. Or let me say it was okay the way they included it, but it was virtually impossible to deliver credibly in a way that the mother would forgive her potential daughter-in-law because of what she says and how she says it, even if the delivery was pretty good. All film long, she hates her and instead of being happy she is finally gone, she gives her son her own priceless ring? I did not buy it to be honest, it just didn't feel right and all for the sake of a happy ending, just like the clumsy airplane scene and with that I mean everything, also the attempts to get in comedy with people being in his way.Finally, on a side note, let me say that I was a bit surprised to see this film is actually based on a book, did not feel like an adaptation somehow, but yeah my review is of course from a perspective of somebody who has not read said book, so I cannot talk about parallels and differences compared to the film. I think that would be all pretty much. I am curious if they will ever make a sequel to this one. I would say that story, ending and success (with critics and audiences) were convincing enough for it to happen one day. We shall see. I can see it happen with more focus on the groom's father for example as we know pretty much nothing about him here and they can really create a completely new character there. And there's certainly more than enough characters in here for another 2 hours. I am not sure if it would help the quality because 120 minutes feels too long in this first film already on some occasions. But I am not sure I'd be interested in that to be honest because this first film here is already very close to getting a thumbs-down from me. It was somewhat entertaining, but it never felt deep, dramatic or engaging enough for me to be really sucked in here. I also think it's not too accurate a statement to say that Asian Americans should watch it rather than anybody else. Maybe start the movie and if you don't like the first 20-25 minutes, then watch something else instead because it really does not get any better afterward, stays the same or gets worse I'd say, even if the poker scene early on was not exactly too amazing either. By the way, I saw some oversensitive people say this is a racist movie, but no it absolutely isn't. Yeah, very cautious 3 stars out of 5, perhaps less on rewatch.",Crazy Rich Asians
4,Prismark10,Rich in love,4,15 November 2018,"They were rich and asian but they certainly were not crazy and this film is really not a comedy.Guy (Henry Golding) comes from an extremely wealthy Singaporean family, they are old money.

It is only in Singapore when Rachel realises just how wealthy Guy is.Guy plans to propose to Rachel and he introduces her to his mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh) who dislikes Rachel and does not think she is good enough for her son.Despite some quirkiness, this is really a well worn drama of a woman not quite good enough for a wealthy family, Rachel is viewed as a golddigger.The film is too long and it just sags in the middle. Having travelled to the far east many times, it was nice to see some familiar locations. The film was shot in various parts of Singapore and Malaysia.",Crazy Rich Asians
5,nogodnomasters,I'm the Rainbow Sheep of the Family.,8,24 October 2018,"The film is a formula romantic comedy with the cliche ending used in every successful romantic comedy. Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) is an economics professor in NYC. Her boyfriend is Nick Young (Henry Golding). He is rich and famous and considered royalty in Singapore. She is unaware until she boards a plane to fly with him to Singapore where he is to be the best man at a wedding, the event of the year in Singapore.Mom is afraid Rachel will take Nick away from family and doesn't want her around. The rest of the family is a bit more receptive, while there are those who believe she is just a golddigger and makes things difficult.

6,kosmasp,Rich versus poor,7,6 June 2020,"The age old romance story. Rich person in love with poor person. Rich parent(s) not really in favor of that relationship - to say the least. Now while this does not invent anything new, it does have some fine touches. It is quite self aware, while ticking off all the boxes it needs to (stay in the predictibility lane). Characters are nice though and the acting really helps too.Also not everything gets resolved, because there are problems that simply no solution can be found for. And that is a good thing in my book, but may impact some hopeless romantics in a bad way. Don't sweat it though, overall this will go where it needs to go to stay a romantic comedy. No matter the main players or their heritage. Speaking of which, the movie acknowledges a lot of things, some may be cliche when it comes to race or how they are treated in America ... sadly still true though",Crazy Rich Asians
7,lee_eisenberg,these rich people don't like their children marrying outside their social class,5,20 December 2018,"The criticism of ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is that it glamorizes the materialistic lifestyle of old money families (ignoring the poverty in Asia) and that it ignores Singapore's ethnic diversity. That's true, but I got the feeling that the movie's main point is that these rich families don't want their children marrying anyone lower on the socioeconomic ladder. It's not a masterpiece, but there are plenty of funny scenes.Aside from the main stars, the cast includes Michelle Yeoh (of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") and ""Daily Show"" correspondent Ronny Chieng.",Crazy Rich Asians
8,jboothmillard,Crazy Rich Asians,7,23 December 2019,"This film positive reviews, including from film critic Mark Kermode, and then I found out it was put in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was definitely going to get straight on it, directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, Now You See Me 2). Basically, Rachel Chu (Hustlers' Golden Globe nominated Constance Wu), an American-born Chinese New York University economics professor, is travelling with her boyfriend, Nicholas ""Nick"" Young (Henry Golding) to his hometown of Singapore for his best friend's wedding. Rachel is surprised when they are taken into first class on the flight, and Nick tells her that his family are very wealthy. In Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin (The Farewell's Awkwafina and her family, they are shocked when she tells them she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin reveals that Nick's family is extremely rich and famous and are members of high society. At a dinner party at the Young estate, brining Peik Lin with her, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh). Also attending is Nick's cousin Astrid (Humans' Gemma Chan), who discovers that her husband Michael (Pierre Png), who comes from a humbler background, has been having an affair. Rachel senses that Eleanor dislikes her. At the bachelorette party for bride Araminta Lee (Sonoya Mizuno), Rachel meets Nick's former girlfriend Amanda ""Mandy"" Ling (Jing Lusi), who hints Rachel may not be able to integrate into such a high-class family with her lower background. The other girls deem Rachel a gold-digger, she is devastated to find her hotel room vandalised by them, but Astrid comforts her. Nick attends the bachelor party for groom Colin Khoo (Chris Pang), he tells his best friend that he plans to propose to Rachel. Colin expresses his concern about the trouble it will cause, with Nick expected to stay in Singapore to run his family's corporation and Rachel loving her job in New York, and the difference in their statuses. Nick apologises to Rachel for not telling her who he really was and takes her to make jiaozi dumplings with his family. During dinner, Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made for the Young family and makes digs at Rachel for her American background. Eleanor privately tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earn her respect. On the day of the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair; Michael says he unhappy and there is a large financial disparity between them. During the wedding reception, Eleanor and Nick's grandmother Shang Su Yi ""Ah Ma"" (Lisa Lu) privately confront Rachel and Nick. Eleanor reveals she hired a private investigator. The investigation findings revealed that Rachel's father is alive, and she was conceived through an adulterous affair, Rachel's mother Kerry (Tan Kheng Hua) abandoned her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of a scandal, and Rachel is stunned, as Kerry had told her that her father was dead. She flees and stays with Peik Lin, becoming depressed and unwilling to speak to Nick. Kerry arrives in Singapore, explaining that her husband was abusive, she was surprised to find out she was pregnant, and she fled with baby Rachel fearing that her husband would kill them. Kerry reveals that Nick was the one who had called her to Singapore and urges Rachel to talk to him. When they meet, Nick apologises and proposes to Rachel, saying that he is willing to leave his family behind to be with her. Rachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a mahjong parlor, they play a game and Rachel reveals that she declined Nick's proposal so his relationship with his family would not be ruined. Rachel tells Eleanor she hopes Nick will marry someone ""good enough"" for her, and it will be because of a selfless act on her part, a girl Eleanor looks down upon. Meanwhile, Astrid leaves Michael, telling him his ego, insecurities, and unwillingness to make the marriage work has caused it. Rachel and Kerry board a flight back to New York City at Singapore Changi Airport. Nick boards the plane, he reveals his mother has given her blessing, and proposes marriage with her ring. In tears, Rachel accepts, and they stay in Singapore and have an engagement party. There, Eleanor nods at Rachel in acknowledgment, having finally earned her respect, and Astrid and her ex-boyfriend Charlie Wu (Harry Shum Jr.) spot each other. Also starring The Hangover's Ken Jeong as Wye Mun Goh, Jimmy O. Yang as Bernard Tai, Ronny Chieng as Eddie Cheng, Remy Hii as Alistair Cheng, Nico Santos as Oliver T'sien, Carmen Soo as Francesca Shaw, Fiona Xie as Kitty Pong, Victoria Loke as Fiona Cheng, Janice Koh as Felicity Young and Selena Tan as Alix Young. Wu is splendid as the working-class New Yorker who has to contend with tradition and expectation, Golding is likeable as the good-looking son and heir to a huge family fortune, Yeoh is a terrific choice as the villainous disapproving mother, and many of the cast members create charming characters. This film breaks boundaries for a Hollywood production, having a predominantly Asian cast, it is a very modern Cinderella style story, full of vibrant colour, I agree it gets a little carried away showing the lavish luxury lifestyle, but it features tasty looking meal sequences, wonderful costumes, and many wonderful locations, and it makes you laugh and feel good, a satisfying romantic comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",Crazy Rich Asians
9,Quinoa1984,the off-the-charts likeability makes up for a mountain of cliches,7,23 August 2018,"This reminds me in a way of Love, Actually in a specific sense - both that and this are gigantic, stadium-sized collections of cliches. But this is to the benefit of what director Jon M Chu is after here: if you have everything, then it's preferable to only having one or two bad ones that stick out. You have here the loud and sorta-funny best friend; the gay caricature who is the one in the family who is the black sheep only not called that; you have the *costume change montage* which was already a joke 25 years ago in Dumb and Dumber; you have the third act twist/reveal, easily the most befuddling and ill-executed thing that comes about because, hey, there's still time for one more conflict; and you have the b*tchy mom of the guy who says in the trailer (and thus in the film) ""you will never be enough.""So why do I still on some level recommend it and kind of enjoy it? Because it does the cliches with a good amount of careful, if shallow attention. And Michelle Yeoh is the mother and is pretty much a perfect, an A plus performance who elevates all of her scenes in the middle of what is a B, maybe B minus movie as far as its substance. And I can let a lot go if the main couple is charming and have genuine chemistry, and Henry Golding and Constance Wu have chemistry and charm to burn (it's almost kind of like another cliche, one we saw in Fifty Shades of Grey, up to a very screeching point, but also done as it should be if it has to).The Socialist/dirty Commie in me feels some revulsion to all the opulence, but at the same time I get it as pure escapism. This reminds me too of what was done a lot in, say, the Sex and the City movies, but again the characters by and large are less intolerable (if not more tolerable or likeable). They're all types, but Chi gets it and knows his audience will eat it up - this is on a level total rich-people porn and it is there in the food too (I want to eat all of it fyi, but I digress). What makes it stand out of course is that it is specifically about this world and culture, and so there's more to chew on with that than if it were bland white people. Representation IS important and all of them are heightened because of the setting and the nuttiness even has that too (Ken Jeong for the first time since... When did Community end again, is funny).So, yeah, if someone told me this was one of their favorites to watch (many many times) with a good pint of ice cream in ones PJs, I wouldn't begrudge them for it. Even for all the BS in it that I dont like or care for, it's not worth getting angry about it. And hey, all from the director of...Jem and the Holograms?",Crazy Rich Asians
10,tavm,Crazy Rich Asians was a very enjoyable take on the romantic comedy from the Asian-American side,8,25 August 2018,"Since I'm an Asian (Filipino)-American, I was very interested in seeing this since Constance Wu-who I knew from the TV show ""Fresh Off the Boat""-is playing a Chinese-American in love with a very rich man from Singapore but was not initially aware of that. So her being a commoner gets her some backhanded criticism from anyone around her partner's circle especially his mother played by Michelle Yeoh. And while this was mostly a romantic comedy, some scenes could be pretty shocking in what the Wu character goes through. But me and my movie theatre-working friend very much enjoyed this. I was especially entertained by many of the pop songs I remember from my youth being played here in the Asian languages. So on that note, we highly recommend Crazy Rich Asians.",Crazy Rich Asians
11,BandSAboutMovies,I really liked this!,7,23 January 2019,"Jon Chu has really turned his fortunes around with this movie. Originally the director of musical theme films like Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, he moved on to two Hasbro properties, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Jem and the Holograms, which was out of theaters in about a week. Lucky for him, this film has been a success, with a sequel being announced a week into its run. Strangely enough, Chu is mentioned in the book as a distant cousin of main character Rachel Chu!Based on the book by Kevin Kwan, the movie faced early controversy. Despite being the first major American release with Asian stars since 1993's The Joy Luck Club, it received criticisms for casting biracial actors over fully ethnically Chinese ones in certain roles, as well as failing to include non-Chinese Singaporean ethnic groups, such as Malay or Indian actors.This played out in its international release, as Singaporeans didn't really enjoy it, criticizing it for its lack of diversity and authenticity. But domestically, its success -- it's the highest grossing romantic comedy in a decade -- should hopefully lead to plenty of work for Asian actors from every country.Nick Young (Henry Golding, A Simple Favor) and his girlfriend, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu, TV's Fresh Off the Boat) are going to Singapore for the wedding of his best friend Colin to Araminta (Sonoya Mizuno, Annihilation), a fashion icon. Rachel hasn't learned much about Nick's family, but once she sees their flight accommodations, she's shocked to learn just how rich they are. Meanwhile, thanks to someone named Radio One Asia, everyone in Singapore knows all about her.Just how rich Nick's family is gets cemented by a visit to her old college roommate, Goh Peik Lin (Awkwafina) and her family, which includes Ken Jeong. Despite a giant bachelor and bachelorette party, Nick feels out of place and Rachel gets a dead fish -- and lots of blood -- all over her bed.If that reception seems bad, it gets worse when she meets Nick's mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh, whose stunts in movies like Police Story 3: Supercop put her on the same level as Jackie Chan even before more dramatic films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Memoirs of a Geisha), who wants nothing to do with a foreign girl coming into her family. And that's before she even gets to know his grandmother Su Yi (Lisa Lu, who was in The Joy Luck Club and Demon Seed).I loved both Jimmy O. Yang (who is also in HBO's Silicon Valley) and Nico Santos (from Superstore) as Oliver T'sien, who gets the Young family anything they need.If you love fashion, you'll really love this, as clothes from Ralph Lauren, Elie Saab, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino and Dior all appear. Yet for all these designers, Michelle Yeoh was dissatisfied with the ring that she was to wear. The emerald and diamond ring that she does wear is her personal ring, as are many pieces of jewelry in the movie.Interestingly enough, Netflix wanted to produce the film and offered a much bigger budget, but Kevin Kwan turned down the offer in favor of a smaller $30-million budget from Warner Brothers. Why? Simple. He wanted to prove to studios that Adian-Americans would come to see this film and others like it.There's all manner of family drama, revelations, lavish parties, insanely expensive weddings, fireworks both personal and in the sky, love lost and love found. And the film looks gorgeous, with so many lavish sets. I may be Italian/Polish/American, but there's still plenty of truth that I found even in my family.",Crazy Rich Asians

It would quite like to be a romantic comedy, but is actually a mild drama. Apart from the addition of the attractive Singapore locations and the sociological context of Chinese family obligation, this is utterly formulaic, and largely predictable from about 5 minutes in.Having said that, the leads are likeable, and the supporting players all make an impression, especially Awkwafina (who? what?) as Rachel's best friend. And I never thought I would ever see a film co-starring Michelle Yeok, Ken Jeong and Britain's Emma Chan, so there's that.I'm still no wiser as to why ""Asian"" as a description only seems to relate to this particular ethnic type and doesn't seem to include the Indian subcontinent, though.",Crazy Rich Asians
17,evanston_dad,Ugh,2,16 January 2019,"I watched a ""What Not to Wear"" episode once featuring a plus-size woman who got frustrated at her shopping experience because of the limited options available to her. She was basically saying that she would love to wear clothes made of rich colors and nice fabrics, but they don't make them for women her size. That's how I feel whenever I try to watch a feel-good popular movie. I would love to enjoy some mindless entertainment and check out for a while over something lighthearted, but these kinds of movies are clearly not made for people like me.Exhibit A -- ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" an obnoxious film that looks like a two-hour ad for a Vegas resort. A regular girl wants to marry a dude but comes up against the displeasure of his crazy rich family. In our more enlightened and ""woke"" times, you might think the answer to this dilemma would be to give the regular girl some semblance of an inner life and volition over her own destiny, but you would be wrong. Instead, she has to prove why she's worth marrying and if she does that well enough she'll get rewarded at the end with a man. Forget that the man is a total weenie who doesn't take any action himself or have the slightest thing resembling a character arc. That would come too close to narrative complexity and the vast hordes of people who liked this movie would probably rebel.I have a feeling scads of people storming social media over MeToo and female empowerment watch movies like this and love them, which to me are two mindsets that feel pretty mutually exclusive.If ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is what passes for mindless entertainment these days, I'll stick to movies that send me spiraling into depression.

18,ferguson-6,the judged should be judging,7,16 August 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. With so much attention on this being a rare mainstream movie with an ""all Asian cast"", it's possible to lose sight of the fact that it's much more than this generation's THE JOY LUCK CLUB (1993). Director John M Chu has delivered a very entertaining, though a bit slick and glossy, crowd-pleasing romantic comedy with touches of cultural awareness. It also features a few noteworthy performances, including a star-making turn from Constance Wu (""Fresh Off the Boat""). Based on the best-selling novel by Kevin Kwan, the screenplay is written by Peter Chiarelli (THE PROPOSAL) and TV writer Adele Lim. Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) is an energetic, American-born Chinese economics professor, and her boyfriend Nick Young is played by big screen newcomer Henry Golding. A successful and confident person on her own, Rachel, having been raised by a hard-working single mother (who fled China while pregnant), assumes her charming and handsome boyfriend is equally grounded. It's not until she agrees to accompany him to Singapore for his best friend's wedding that she begins to pry the truth - most of the truth - out of him. See, Nick and his family are quasi-royalty in Singapore ... one of the wealthiest families in the city and country. Upon arriving, Rachel quickly learns that Nick's mother is certainly not open to the idea of her son, the company's heir-apparent, having anything to do with a woman lacking the required pedigree - namely money and a Chinese legacy. Michelle Yeoh (CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON) plays the icy Eleanor Young, and is quite elegant in her disdain for Rachel, and in capturing the relationship between Asian mother and son. Some of the best scenes are the interactions between Rachel and Eleanor - each so eager to succeed in their polar opposite missions. Facing widespread accusations of gold-digging, Rachel retreats to the comfort of her old college friend Goh Peik Lin, played by a fast-talking and quite hilarious Awkwafina (OCEAN'S 8).The humor is prevalent throughout, with some of it being quite outrageous. Ken Jeong and Koh Chieng Mun play Peik Lin's parents ... the caricatures of new money. Jimmy O Yang is the high-roller never-grown-up frat boy type responsible for the outlandish bachelor party; Nico Santos is Oliver, the self-titled 'rainbow sheep of the family'; and Ronnie Chieng is the obnoxious family member everyone avoids. The comedy provided by this group prevents the dramatic elements from ever being too weighty for viewers. This holds true even with the short-changed sub-plot featuring Nick's beautiful sister Astrid (a scene-stealing Gemma Chan) and her disintegrating marriage to another ""outsider"".Opulence and obscene wealth is on full display, leaving us a bit unsure (by design) exactly where the emphasis should be placed on the title. Although it has the required elements of a fairy tale, it's certainly not run-of-the-mill. Cinderella allowed a kind-hearted woman to be rescued from slave labor and a basement bed. This Cinderella story doesn't exactly rescue Rachel, who is a strong, self-made woman. Instead, it ups the ante by having her harshly judged ... while in fact, she is the one who should be sitting in judgment - first of a boyfriend who was never honest, and then with a family who assumes she's not good enough to be one of them. In a tip of the cap the aforementioned THE JOY LUCK CLUB, Lisa Lu (now 91 years old) plays Kevin's grandmother, the matriarch of the family, and one who has played a role in making Eleanor the protector of family and tradition. Eleanor's guiding philosophy and contempt towards Rachel is summed up in her line, ""All Americans think about is their own happiness"". It's one of the moments where we do wish the film would dig a bit deeper and further explain the traditions and cultural differences that cause such venom spewing towards Rachel.Director Chu has had a stream of poorly reviewed films (NOW YOU SEE ME 2, JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS, G.I. JOE: RETALIATION, STEP 2), but that likely stops here. His social media montage early in the film is a visual feast, and the camera work (by Vanja Cernjul) over Singapore is stunning. The soundtrack offers Asian versions of some well-known songs, including Cheryl K singing ""Money (that's what I want)"", a Berry Gordy song which we are accustomed to hearing sung by John Lennon. Credit goes to casting as well, since Ms. Yeoh and Ms. Lu are Asian acting royalty, and Ms. Wu and the dashing Mr. Golding are sure to see their careers skyrocket.The director and producers are also to be commended for making the rare decision of choosing art over money. They were so committed to the film finding a theatrical audience that they turned down huge bucks from Netflix for the rights. It's a risk that will likely payoff for them. Is it a simple love story made complicated by family, economics, tradition, and class differences ... or is it a story of tradition and wealth that attempts to salvage the purity of a love story regardless of class? Either way, it's a relatable story and one that will surely entertain most anyone who watches. As a bonus, you'll pick up a banana joke that you'd best not repeat.",Crazy Rich Asians
19,phd_travel,The female leads are outstanding in quite a moving story,8,27 August 2018,This ground breaking rom-com is actually 50-50 drama and comedy. There are some laugh out loud funny jokes and some more subtle ones about nouveau crassness that you can miss if you don't pay attention but things got quite dramatic towards the end. The story is quite universal about a person in love with someone from a different wealth level - so it's easy to see why the movie has been a success.The acting especially by the actresses is excellent. Michelle Yeoh as the disapproving mother of the guy is a very moving actress portraying a complicated role sympathetically. She carries the show. Hope she gets more dramatic roles. Constance Wu as Stanford educated American Chinese Rachel Chu is equally sweet and expressive. A breakout star. Gemma Chan' Astrid has a great speech dealing with her husband. There was some controversy about non Chinese actors being used like Henry Golding plays Nick Young is Malay British. He doesn't look Chinese but it doesn't matter. There is no mistaking this is an Asian dominated English language film and probably a trend setter for the future breaking some stereotypes. The wealth displayed here isn't that over the top - certainly not as crazy as the real life Asian ostentation today. The filming is quite attractive in the most expensive city in the world Singapore (some in next door Malaysia) with lots of attractive food and parties and the fancy wedding of the Khoo family.Worth watching.,Crazy Rich Asians

The cast is well selected and the music is overloud but the idea of looking into the traditions of family wealth in Asia is an entertaining one.The story follows Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an American-born Chinese economics professor, who travels to her boyfriend Nick's (Henry Golding) hometown of Singapore for his best friend's wedding. Before long, his secret is out: Nick is from a family that is impossibly wealthy, he's perhaps the most eligible bachelor in Asia, and every single woman in his ultra-rarefied social class is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down.The 'caricatures' emphasize the clothes on their backs but there are some solid actors in the mix - Michelle Yeoh is the maternal dominatrix, and the other family members and associates are Lisa Lu, Gemma Chan, Chris Pang, Jimmy O.

21,JamesHitchcock,A Pretty Woman for the Modern World. But Does the Modern World Need a Pretty Woman?,5,21 September 2018,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" is that rare beast, a mainstream Hollywood movie with a majority Asian cast in a modern setting, allegedly only the third such film ever made. (The others were ""The Flower Drum Song"" from 1961 and ""The Joy Luck Club"" from 1993). To avoid confusion, I am here using the word ""Asian"" in the American sense to refer to East Asians. In Britain ""Asian"" generally refers to people from the Indian subcontinent and East Asians are frequently referred to as ""Orientals"", a word which has no pejorative connotations this side of the Atlantic.The plot is that old romantic comedy stand-by, ""poor girl loves rich boy"". The rich boy is Nick Young, son and heir to one of Singapore's wealthiest and most eminent Old Money dynasties. The poor girl is Chinese-American Rachel Chu. Now in all rom-coms there has to be an obstacle to the love of the young couple, and here it is the standard one in poor-girl-loves-rich-boy films, the disapproval of his family. Rachel, an economics professor at New York University who doubtless earns a very good salary, is not poor in any absolute sense of the word, but in comparison with the boundless wealth of the Youngs she is a virtual pauper. Nick's formidable mother Eleanor does not approve of Chinese-Americans, whom she sees as more westernised than Singaporeans, and regards Rachel as a gold-digger. This last allegation is unfair, as Rachel met Nick while he was living in New York and only finds out how wealthy his family are when she accompanies him back to a friend's wedding in Singapore..The film has proved controversial on a number of levels. Although the film-makers doubtless thought their film represented a gesture towards inclusivity and diversity, it has been criticised for not being inclusive and diverse enough for portraying Singapore as a mono-ethnic Chinese society and ignoring the city-state's Indian, Malay and white minorities. It has also been criticised for casting the mixed-race Henry Golding, who is half British and half Malaysian, as the wholly Chinese Nick. (Nick's father never actually appears in the film, but the script makes it clear that both he and Nick's mother are Chinese, not European). The criticism which most interested me, however, is one made by a number of other reviewers on this board, namely that the film takes an excessively materialistic attitude towards life, equating wealth with happiness and success. Rachel may be an intellectual high achiever, but the film is nevertheless not about how she got a university degree or became a professor but about how she manages to marry into the financial aristocracy of South-East Asia.At first I was surprised by these criticisms. There was, after all, a time, and not so very long ago, when rich boy/poor girl rom-coms like ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Maid in Manhattan"" were flavour of the month in Hollywood. On second thoughts, however, I realise that I was wrong to be surprised. Those two films belong to an earlier era, the relatively prosperous world of the nineties and early noughties when we were being told that history had come to a full stop and that the world was now safe for bourgeois capitalist democracy. Since the financial crisis of 2008 those assumptions no longer seem as secure as they once did, and the capitalist world order once again finds itself under attack, from the political right as well as from the left. If the film-makers envisaged ""Crazy Rich Asians"" as a ""Pretty Woman"" for the modern world, the modern world may well retort that it does not need its own ""Pretty Woman"", especially as the material trappings of wealth and luxury are much more on display here than they were in the earlier film.From other people's criticisms to one of my own. The ending struck me as highly unsatisfactory, as the logic of the plot seemed to be moving towards an unhappy ending of one sort or another; Nick must either give up Rachel or marry her at the cost of estrangement from his family. Such an ending would have been quite at odds with the generally light-hearted rom-com atmosphere, but the only way the scriptwriters can avoid it is by contriving an unexplained and unconvincing change of heart by the previously implacable Eleanor. Actually, I am not convinced that even that contrived ending should count as a happy one; given the materialism, crassness and boorishness of many of Nick's friends and relations is this really the sort of milieu that the lovely Rachel would be happy marrying into?On the positive side, the strikingly handsome Golding and the adorable Constance Wu make an attractive and charismatic leading couple. (I initially thought that Wu was too young to play a university professor, but it turns out that she is 36, more than a decade older than I would have guessed). Nevertheless, good looks and charisma are not enough to rescue this film. Nor is the pursuit of ostensibly worthy ends like inclusivity and diversity. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is really little more than a tacky, hackneyed Hollywood rom-com with the novelty feature of an ethnic cast. 5/10A goof. In the film's opening scene, set in 1995, Eleanor and her children are turned away from a smart London hotel, the implication being that this is because they are Chinese. This is nonsense. No British hotels in the nineties would have operated a colour bar, something illegal under British law. Even in the bad old days before the passing of the Race Relations Act, high-end establishments like this one were more interested in the colour of their guests' money than the colour of their skin. Those notorious ""no blacks, no Chinese, no dogs"" signs were the hallmark of the cheap downmarket flophouse.",Crazy Rich Asians

23,DKosty123,Not A Novel Approach To Crazy Rich People,5,4 September 2018,"Wow, who would of thought that rich Asians are as snobby as rich Americans? This movie manages to do this, and more. With the exception of one actress who was in ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" this cast is largely unknown in the US. That does not mean they are bad. They do fine, but the script must be much worse than the novel (though I have to admit I have never read it). The money spent on the film, mostly filmed in Malaysia, shows it's $30 million budget. The director having the same name (Wu) as Rachel (the main actress character) is a coincidence that has nothing to do with the script. To me the good points of this film are the location shots, the beautiful women in the cast (if only I were young again to meet them), the music is pleasant, and one throw away line which needs emphasis. There is some subtle humor early on but late in the film the jokes are few and far between. The irony of this one line should not be lost on Americans. The rich Asian parents are at the dinner table, when they tell their children they should eat their chicken nuggets so they don't starve like American Children. Unfortunately, it is a serious statement that is the results of American Free Trade policy disaster which must have slipped by the media here because our media has still not criticized this fact despite the grim statistics they have already reported which are the results of over 30 years of Free Trade. Barack Obama once did a radio commercial about how much school drop outs had increased in recent years in America, plus several other stats in 60 seconds. Seems that commercial has fallen on deaf ears. The plot is really overly predictable because we get the old happily ever after type of plot solution at the end. I thought an opportunity was missed here as it could have been done differently. Maybe this caters to the novel, maybe not. 
The thing is I have seen crazy rich Asians portrayed in other films that are much crazier than this bunch. This is actually soapy enough that I'd consider it an Asian casted 2 plus hours of Dallas, only without the oil barrens. There's lot of rich Asians who seem bent on messing up their lives. I would like a cattle call of every picture I could see of these young women, clothed or not. Other than the eye candy, I wonder how much they paid the talking heads on CBS News in the US to promote this one? Makes you wonder about the network, as from what they said on the network, nobody had seen this one? If FOX news was smart, they'd run these clips in commercial to prove that CBS News has declined in quality. After all, the CBS Evening News now has ""Your World In 60 Seconds."" FOX News used to do that, before they grew up.I wish this movie had great benefits for Asians, but sadly, no.",Crazy Rich Asians

The movie stars Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh, Gemma Chan, Awkwafina, Chris Pang, Lisa Lu and Ken Jeong. It was directed by Jon M. Chu, written by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, and it's based on the 2013 novel (of the same name) by Kevin Kwan. The film has gotten almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it's also a surprise hit at the Box Office as well. I think it's great to see a hit movie starring an entirely minority cast (including a woman of color in the lead), and it's also nice to see that it's well made and effective as well. It's not quite as good as all the hype (and positive reviews) make it out to be though, because it's a cliched and predictable romcom obviously, but it's still decent and entertaining enough I'd say.",Crazy Rich Asians
25,cherold,Familiar concept with an Asian twist,8,24 December 2018,"Romantic comedies set among the upper classes are as old as movies themselves, and Crazy Rich Asians fits neatly in the category, with an attractive couple, a few eccentrics, a few people living in this rarefied world who are still pretty normal, some challenges you're not that worried about, and a happy ending.So yeah, you've seen this all before. The only difference is the cast is all Asian, and there's a tiny bit of Asian-specific business, like Mah Jong, but it's still basically something you've seen a million times before.But the reason you've seen it a millions times before is that it's a fun formula, and Crazy Rich Asians gets all the ingredients right. The lead, Constance Wu, is pretty and likable, even though this part is not nearly as fun and flashy as her hilarious turn as the mom in Fresh Off the Boat. Awkwafina and Nico Santas are the funniest of the film's oversized cast, and they should really do a buddy comedy. The sountrack, consisting largely of Chinese renditions of American songs, is terrific. The story is well paced and there are a number of solid scenes, including an awkwardly romantic one in a crowded airplane aisle.I didn't come into this movie with any expectations. My girlfriend wanted to see it for some reason and I was fine by that. But I was surprised by how much fun it turned out to be, and I'm looking forward to the sequels.",Crazy Rich Asians

Indeed it's extremely formulaic; there's nothing here you haven't seen a hundred times before, a two-gag movie, the gags being, you guessed it; they're rich and they're Asian. (the 'crazy' bit hardly registers). It's nicely played by beautiful people in very opulent looking settings and Singapore looks amazing, (I wouldn't be surprised if the Singapore Tourist Board had paid for it all), and it's mildly amusing at best.

27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Doesn't redefine its well-worn but still-loved genre so much as reshape it to suit its own, surprisingly grounded needs.",6,15 September 2018,"'Crazy Rich Asians (2018)' picks up steam towards its latter portion to provide an emotionally resonant third-act, thanks mainly to a relatable, fairly realistic central relationship and some generally well-rounded, likeable central characters. It does dip into convention on more than one occasion, though, and relies on tried and tested tropes for most of its run-time, despite its more grounded approach - which is ironic considering the lavish, 'spare no expense' lifestyles of its well-off ensemble. There's little done on the whole to mitigate the 'flexing' found within the picture, since many a sequence is dedicated to the large price-tag associated with the locales and situations involved and our lead often gets caught up in the 'high-living' of her newest acquaintances. Yet, material worth is never placed above the more traditionally, and rightfully so, 'worthy' stuff (such as friendship, family and love) and, even when considering the more closed-minded characters, money always comes second place within the story - though there are some characters who value it above all else, of course - to the point that it doesn't even outshine prejudice in its more antagonistic of players. The picture certainly isn't an epic, despite its large and occasionally overwhelming cast. The sheer amount of characters does mean that some are quite difficult to remember, since they're fleetingly introduced and aren't actually all that relevant to the plot, especially the various bit-players brought in during a montage. While there are a few side-plots are peppered throughout, one of which takes up a little more time than it perhaps should but is strangely almost more impactful than the central story strand itself, the focus is placed squarely on our fish-out-of-water protagonist as she meets her boyfriend's crazy rich family for the first time. It's a good job, then, that Wu is a compelling screen presence who convinces you of both her naïveté and strength all at once. Her chemistry with the family, whom are all played admirably by their respective actors, works just the way it ought to so that the finale itself is as satisfying as it ultimately, and perhaps unexpectedly, is. Seriously, while the finale may be slightly counter-intuitive considering the wonderful sequence that precedes it, it's a bizarrely moving moment that encapsulates the aspirations of the picture, as well as its genre-based predictabilities, in their entirety. Overall, the film is a diverse, usually entertaining and relatively engaging entry into a well-worn but still-loved genre that doesn't redefine things so much as reshape them to suit its own needs. It isn't the most compelling or surprising picture I've seen, but it's an enjoyable and decently charming one that put a smile on my face on a couple of occasions. 6/10",Crazy Rich Asians
28,ThomasDrufke,Significant but Ultimately a Disappointingly Cliched Rom-Com,6,28 August 2018,"Crazy Rich Asians is a groundbreaking achievement that should be noteworthy undoubtedly, but I don't think it has anything to do with the quality of the film. I've seen so many rom-coms over the years that the word cliche in this sense has been used too many times to count, but that doesn't clean this film's slate. It's certainly fun to watch, but Crazy Rich Asians too often falls into cliches, gets overwhelmed by silly characters, and a lack of character depth. Plus, you know exactly where this film is going right from the opening scene. Which you can arguably say about a lot of films, but if the execution isn't refreshingly than it becomes painfully clear that this film isn't doing anything to separate itself from the pack. With all that said, the film is a perfectly fine story about two good looking people in love torn apart by people who don't think they should be together. A few powerful 3rd act scenes gave it a boost, but I was far from blown away by this one.6.2/10",Crazy Rich Asians

30,Cineanalyst,Conspicuous Consumption,3,11 January 2019,"In a way, I suppose, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is something of a testament to racial inclusivity; it's a major Hollywood movie starring Asians and Asian-Americans that's just as awful as any of the other numerous rom-coms starring Caucasians and people of other races to spew out the same shallow, cookie-cutter formula and nauseating clichés. If we're to look beyond race, the most distinguishing feature of this entry is the excess of the materialism. Yet, some conspicuous consumption is usually built into rom-coms. It's kind of fitting in a way, too, because these type of movies themselves are a complete waste of time and money to see. At the very least, they rely upon romantic dates, parties, engagement rings, weddings and a climactic grand romantic gesture that's all about throwing one's effort and money away on and making a big public display of puerile notions of love.In this one, there's a montage where the Cinderella type tries on dresses with the help of her gay friends so as to show up the evil witch. There are even some Disney-like overhead views and zooms of some of the more glamorous displays of enormous wealth, such as for the mansions and parties. The lead couple, of course, break up for a time and, not uncommonly, it's because of the family. There's a ridiculous wedding where everyone dresses up in stupid outfits and cry and stare at each other for a long time as music plays. In fact, there are quite a few scenes in this one where nothing of interest happens while music plays. It's like watching a very bad music video at times. There's also a sequence where a bunch of nitwits gossip to each other through their cell phones, with the movie including a bunch of text and Emoji images that fail to be funny. Oh, and, of course, there's the usual cabal of mean girls, in addition to the matriarchal witches, out to thwart Cinderella.I couldn't care less about the main couple. Of slightly more interest here methinks is the Astrid character and her husband, whose marriage is strained by her conspicuous consumption, which she tries to hide from him. There's another reason given for the problems in their marriage, but that's of no interest other than to draw one's attention away from the movie's celebration of conspicuous consumption. The tell, to use the poker lingo of our economics professor protagonist (Although, really, five-card draw is the game they chose to illustrate math? That that's the poker game requiring the most skill is itself a silly movie trope, but I digress.), of where this movie's ethics lie is in how Astrid's marriage is handled. The other interesting character is the one we never see, the patriarch of the Young family. You know, the guy making all of the money that's being spent by all of these characters that we never see working a day in their lives--aside from a lousy ECON class and a wretched movie production. I know he has another story in the books that this movie is based on, but at least for his role in this movie, it's the part to be most envious of because it's inconspicuous.",Crazy Rich Asians
31,gbill-74877,Charming romantic comedy,9,21 August 2018,"Somewhere, Anna May Wong is crying tears of joy.What a charming romantic comedy this is, and how fantastic is it that it also has a nearly all-Asian cast, breaking the molds these actors are usually poured into. I loved the strong female characters, starting with lead, Constance Wu, who turns in a great performance. She shows real range in several scenes, including those with her mother and her boyfriend's mother. What an empowering character as well - smart, kind, honest, and graceful. Michelle Yeoh is also very strong, and with depth in her character - not simply a tiger mom; she is cool and calculating, but we see her caring moments, her conflict, and the way she was treated by her own mother. Apparently she pushed for these extra dimensions to her role, and the film is better for it. Her lines challenging Wu's character (""You will never be enough"") are delivered like icepicks. Lisa Lu is also excellent as the grandmother, and this is a nuanced character as well, starting off so sweet and seeming to make a connection with Wu, but gradually unfolding to something else, the depths of which were a little surprising. It was so nice to see this 91 year old actress. Gemma Chan is brilliant when she tells off her philandering husband, and makes it clear their marital problems aren't due to their differing backgrounds, but his weakness. Tan Kheng Hua as Wu's mother is in a quieter role, but shows a strength and dignity, and when she reveals her backstory, it's powerful.The men are a little overshadowed but not outdone, especially Henry Golding, who is suave, forthright, and endearing. And hooray that Asian masculinity is acknowledged. The scene he has with Wu in the morning, where she studies him shirtless and says 'hubba hubba' prior to him jumping on her is nice. The scene on the plane, where he tries to talk to Wu from the other aisle, while trying to get through people fumbling with the overboard bins, is rom-com gold.In comedic roles, Awkwafina and Nico Santos are funny, and light up the screen in every scene they're in. My favorite was the one where they comment on clothes that Wu is trying on. (""I'm not sure if it's working or if she looks like a clown's tampon."" ""On a heavy day"" ... among several others). I could have lived without all of the antics of the 'crazy' characters - Jimmy O. Yang (who you may recognize from 'Silicon Valley'), Ronny Chieng (The Daily Show), and Ken Jeong (The Hangover(s)) - but it was nice to see them, and they provide a few comic moments as well.The 'rich' aspect also initially put me off, as there is a great deal of opulence and extravagance, but I came to terms with it. Firstly, it is central to the story, with the woman from a more humble background involved with the scion of a wealthy family. It also shows an aspect of life so counter to the stereotypical, humble roles Asians have often been confined to. Lastly, all of the wealth is juxtaposed with Constance Wu's character, and her mother's. Though 'Americanized' and on the surface seeming to pursue her own passion as an individual, in the end, we see that Wu embodies kindness and self-sacrifice far more than this family living in luxury, who are in some cases overly concerned with their image, and in others, boorish in their wild partying and materialism. Director Jon M. Chu gives us a lot of razzle dazzle in what he puts up on the screen, but my goodness that wedding scene is truly memorable. It's enchanting, ethereal, beautiful, and so sweet, accompanied by a cover of 'Can't Help Falling in Love' by Kina Grannis. The entire soundtrack is a joy for that matter, with a mix of Chinese and American songs, covers, and musical tones. There are some who are dismayed because the film doesn't give us enough 'real Asian' culture, and instead is 'too Hollywood'. It's obviously not a documentary or an attempt to cover all aspects of a very diverse culture or a place like Singapore, but I think it should be appreciated for what it is. There are elements of Asian culture in everything from little details in the sets, to symbolism in the Mah Jong game, to the gap that sometimes exists between Chinese and Chinese-Americans. I also loved the celebration of the food, and the warmth of that scene early on in the Singapore food stalls.At the end of the day, it's a romantic-comedy, which along with comedies often face an uphill task in winning over critics, weary of the formulas often employed (and yes, they're used here too). It's also got an Asian cast, which because of the novelty, puts it under a microscope. Personally, I liked the sweetness of the story, and despite the genre and materialistic overtone of the context, found it had depth. I also liked that it was a step forward, and hope it's followed by more steps forward.",Crazy Rich Asians

But, although seemingly welcome to her son's girlfriend, Eleanor soon reveals her true colors. She is deadset against the relationship going any further, as she tells Rachel on the QT. Nick is clueless about his mother's attitude, which upsets Rachel even more. But, can a young American from Flushing become a Chinese Cinderella? This wonderfully rich and crazy film is manna to a romcom lover's heart as well as a thoroughly entertaining film for most everyone else. Set in the fantastic setting of the super rich, its opulent scenery is amazing. This is true also of the fabulous costumes, comedic script and bouncy direction. Yet, even then, the storyline proves that riches can't buy everything. Most importantly, Wu, Golding, Awkwafina, Yeoh, Chan and all the others are near-perfect in their lively, touching roles. The one possible caveat is that the riches displayed make one hurt inside for those less fortunate. But, as ""only a movie"", most can dismiss this more easily. Movie tickets are happily not only affordable by the super rich so grab one soon, soon!",Crazy Rich Asians
34,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,20 November 2018,"Crazy Rich AsiansThe easiest way to distinguish between rich and poor Asians is the wealthy ones wear gold-plated surgical masks.Mind you, as this romantic-comedy points out, well-heeled Asians can also be extremely rude.Rachel (Constance Wu) agrees to attend her boyfriend Nick's (Henry Golding) friend's wedding in Singapore. During their visit, Rachel is introduced to Nick's well-to-do relatives (Gemma Chan, Awkwafina, Ken Jeong), whom she gets along with swimmingly. However, the matriarch of the family (Michelle Yeoh) feels that Rachel is not the right fit for her son, while others accuse her of being a gold-digger.Although it does shatter stereotypes with its all-Asian cast and enamors with the pageantry associated with Asian nuptials, this aptly cast adaptation of the 2013 best-seller does little to differentiate itself from the typical Caucasian rom-com formula.In fact, the only difference between Asian and Caucasian families is that the former doesn't banish their elders.

I was kinda expecting a bid darker, maybe even more sophisticated romantic comedy - there are plenty great examples. Sadly for me ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was just too predictable and sweet and melodramatic. The good things about this movie - it looks great, actors are good looking as well as everything else - its a very good looking movie. Also Coldplay's masterpiece ""Yellow"" sounds amazing in all languages. It also has a heart but sadly not a real emotion - everything just felt to true to be good and just way to predictable, like in a soup operas.Overall, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was a bit of a disappointing movie for me, but its not a bad one definite by any means - someone looking for exactly movie like this will enjoy it for sure.",Crazy Rich Asians
36,westsideschl,Insightful??,9,3 December 2018,"Many highlights from our range of characters in this all Asian cast, but thought Kina Grannis version of ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" was one gem. Another was Awkwafina's, Peik Lin Goh character, a damn straight spot on outrageously funny scene stealer throughout. Also intrigued by the American music standard oldies being sung in one of the Chinese languages/dialects (Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese) used along w/English throughout.Witty humor to start: Dad, to young Chinese children who don't want to eat anymore & would rather play, says ""eat your chicken nuggets ... there's a lot of children starving in America right?"". Or, comparing their gold gilded bathroom with Donald Trump's bathroom (and may I add, growing up with a similar number of servants at beckon call - hmmm!, does that say anything about character development?). ""All Americans think about is their own happiness."" Well, I disagree, I think it's more an individualized human acquired value than a national, ethnic, or class value.The representation of ostentatious, garish, gaudy, excessive wealth shown in the locations, sets, props, costumes was beyond even imagining which hopefully makes one question the ethics & values of excessive consumption & wealth with a billion people dying from preventable starvation & disease. To this, a Napoleon quote in the opening scene, ""Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world."" shows the nearsightedness of political thought to allow the wealthy nations (US, Russia, China) to parcel up the world for their own benefits. ""The tide is turning & the future being American is as a second class status."" Hmmm, are we another Rome?",Crazy Rich Asians
37,tabuno,An Asian comedy romance drama that nearly crosses the line of stereotypes,8,28 January 2019,"This comedy romance drama of a distinctly Asian bent, nearly crosses the line of Asian stereotypes in the beginning of the movie, but through a deft hand of a script, allows most of the Americanized Asian tendencies to settle down into a carefully crafted but nevertheless American version of a somewhat poor (though not really) girl meets rich boy and uptight, but elegant Chinese mother. There are some great silent moments in this movie that elevate the emotional and heft of film's characters. This is definitely a summer, entertaining movie that ultimately avoids the harder, real choices that underlay this relational and cultural density of this movie. More along the lines of The Princess Dairies (2001) but a tad darker, Crazy Rich Asians offers up a succulent taste of Asian sights, food, and culture. In some ways, this singular effort to bring Asian-oriented film into the American mainstream almost tries too hard to get it right for the American taste. The balance of comedy and drama is well accomplished. A great effort, entertaining, but American Asian movies still has more to come.",Crazy Rich Asians
38,paulclaassen,"Boring, predictable, unromantic, American and not Asian...",2,18 February 2019,"I love Asian movies, which is why I wanted to see this film. Unfortunately, I can't stress enough how annoyed I am with this film. Although this is essentially about Asians, the film couldn't have been more American.I loved the setting in beautiful Singapore, but that's about as much as I enjoyed about the film. We hardly even knew the couple when they were jetting off to Singapore to meet Nick Young's family. I would have preferred to know more about the couple and their relationship before they jetted off. Then again, this is nothing compared to what else I would have preferred the movie to be. In short, I HATED this film! It was so American, American, American, yawn, American...Despite all their efforts, I didn't find the plot credible enough. Everything here felt so forced as if to make a statement. Nothing happened naturally. Constance Wu might be an acclaimed actress, but I didn't find her good enough as Rachel, as if she herself had doubts about the script. Henry Golding was very bland as Nick Young (well, maybe he's not entirely to blame, as Nick Young was a very shallow, bland character). The rest of the cast was ok.The obligatory third act 'break-up' was painstakingly forced and annoying. There was absolutely no reason for it and wasn't plausible. It is so American... There was nothing romantic about this film. Towards the end I couldn't wait for it to end because I got so bored. Cliche upon cliche upon cliche, and so predictable! Even though the director might be of Asian descent, he is every bit American, being born and raised in the States. Well, that figures...",Crazy Rich Asians

But Asia itself produces so many films with Asian actors so that's not too remarkable. The story itself is understandable and relatable for those not part of these cultures.

At the same time, he is going to introduce his girlfriend to his parents, something that makes her feel very nervous. She will find out some truths about him and more information about his family that they will make her consider one more time their future.I didn't like this movie because it didn't have an interesting plot, it was full of stereotypes and it was liked watching another Cinderella movie. The direction which was made by Jon M. Chu was very poor since it consisted of American wannabe stereotypes and the fact that all Asians want to be like Americans and that is the dream of their lives. Regarding the interpretations, I believe that Henry Golding's who played as Nick Young was the best interpretation in this movie. I didn't like the interpretations of Constance Wu's who played as Rachel Chu and Michelle Yeoh's who played as Eleanor Young.Finally, I have to say that ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is an average movie with a poor and boring plot, average interpretations and not good direction. I don't recommend this movie to anyone because I am sure that you are going to waste your time watching it and you won't enjoy it. As it can be easily understood a high budget doesn't always make a great movie.",Crazy Rich Asians
41,cruise01,A beautiful romantic film that has a wonderful cast and story.,9,21 November 2018,"Crazy Rich Asians (4.5 out of 5 stars).Crazy Rich Asians is a spectacle romantic drama film with a great cast ensemble, fun direction, and well-done plot. The film having a huge Asian American cast ensemble was also good. It had a big cast with many actors that I am not familiar with but everyone was great playing their characters. The film leads Constance Wu playing Rachel Chu who is a professor and falls in love with Nick Young (Henry Golding). Which Nick is from a high class family that owns a lot of real estate in Singapore. When Nick travels back home with Rachel to go to a family's wedding. Rachel is shocked that she never knew about his family. Which is what brings in the good and bad. Were she meets his brothers, cousins, ex girlfriends, and his mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh) who does not think she is good for Nick.The film is very fast paced. It moves at a brisk pace with meeting Rachel in her economics class. And Nick proposes the idea to her that they need to make a trip to his home country. And regular bystanders nearby who seem to know who he is and snaps a picture of him which gets around and back to his mother. Rachel meeting Nick's friends and family was a lot of fun. They either love her or hate her. Constance Wu plays a sweet charming girl. She is beautiful and very talented with her performance. Henry Golding was also good as well playing the prince of Singapore. Which everyone seems to gossip about who is Nick dating? Or the girl he is with? The rest of the cast was good. There is Nick's cousin Astrid (Gemma Chan) who is beautiful but is having marriage trouble with her husband. Goh Peik (Awkwafina) who is Rachel's best friend and the loud mouth and an open personality. Even Ken Jeong makes an appearance playing Goh Peik's father and a fun personality at that.Jon M. Chu's direction was fun. It is flashy and it moves from one beautiful production set to another. From beautiful wedding venues to exotic beaches and islands. Even the costume design was beautiful as well. The story's drama was fun to see it unfold. With Nick's mother being hard on Rachel. And seeing how she accomplishes to fight for who she loves.Overall, Crazy Rich Asians is a pretty good film. It exceeded my expectations for a romantic movie. From its beautiful cast, set design, and a fun moving direction. I can not wait to see a sequel.",Crazy Rich Asians
42,eddie_baggins,A fun and likeable Rom-Com,7,16 September 2018,"It may not mess with the well-trodden, tried and true romcom formula but thanks to its colorful culture and insight into a society many of us have likely not much knowledge of, Crazy Rich Asians is a winning crowd pleaser with a great big beating heart and enough laughs to ensure it's likely to remain 2018's most popular date movie.Based on Kevin Kwan's best-selling novel of the same name, John M. Chu's energetic film is one of the rare times Hollywood has delivered a tent-pole picture with an almost entirely Asian cast and with a majority of the films proceedings taking place is the oft overlooked country of Singapore, Crazy Rich Asians feels like exactly the right type of romcom for an industry looking to showcase itself as much more than a 'white's only' landscape.In many ways as important as Marvel's Black Panther was in the early parts of the year, Chu's film is a great example of transporting a story that at its core is rather cookie cutter into a fresh and exciting world that in turn makes the familiar narrative beats stand out much more than they had any right to do.Following the fish out of water story of Constance Wu's working class Asian/American economics professor Rachel Chu and her relationship with Henry Golding's filthy rich Asian property tycoon heir Nick Young, as the two look to win over Nick's family in his homeland of Singapore, Chu strikes an engaging balance between examining this luxurious high society, old school traditions and the growing relationship between Rachel and Nick.Played enthusiastically by relative newcomers Wu and Golding, Rachel and Nick are the type of too good to be real movie lovers but that doesn't stop us from getting on board with their plight to overcome the odds and learn to live as one as Chu throws them into various scenarios and situations that will bring viewers a range of emotions from well-earned laughs through to equally earnt tears, all done in a way that will be loved by its target audience and more than tolerable for those dragged along by their other halves.If there was an anchor to how far Crazy Rich Asians can take its fresh approach to age old material it's in the fact that it never takes any chances to surprise the audience as is the case the romcom genre, things will often play out exactly as you would expect for a film of this ilk, making Chu's feature an enjoyable but far from different experience outside of its cultural grounding.Final Say -Filmed with an energy and vibrancy that brings its settings and characters to life in a loveable way, Crazy Rich Asians is a winning cinematic outing that will see more Hollywood players scrambling to unleash more Asia infused outings into the marketplace in hope they too can capture some similar crowd pleasing magic.3 1/2 dumplings out of 5",Crazy Rich Asians
43,howard.schumann,"You don't need to be rich or Asian to enjoy this film, but it helps if you are crazy",8,27 December 2018,"You don't need to be rich or Asian to enjoy this film, but it helps if you are crazy. Unless you sneaked aboard NASA's InSight Lander, you may have heard that John M. Chu's (""Now You See Me 2"") satirical Crazy Rich Asians is the first Hollywood film since 1993's ""The Joy Luck Club"" to feature a predominantly Asian cast. Fortunately, that is not the only reason it is worthy of our limited attention span, especially if you are keen on emeralds, tuxedos, champagne, and other fluffy distractions from politicians run amok and cheery end-of-the-world predictions.Adapted by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim from Kevin Kwan's international bestseller of the same name, the world of Crazy Rich Asians is not only abounding in opulence but also in ridiculously attractive stars such as Henry Golding (""A Simple Favor""), Constance Wu (""All the Creatures Were Stirring"") and Gemma Chan (""London Fields""), among others. Happy is what is reflected on Rachel Chu's (Wu) face when her boyfriend Nick Young (Golding) asks her to go with him to attend the wedding of his friend Colin Khoo (Chris Pang, ""I, Frankenstein"") and his fiancée Araminta (Sonoya Mizuno, ""Annihilation"") in Singapore and (not incidentally) also meet his family.Little does Rachel know, however, that she is about to confront a real-time version of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."" Reality dawns on her when, instead of squeezing into seat 37D on the airline, she finds herself lounging in silk pajamas in a private first-class suite that Nick explains away as a perk resulting from his family connections, the extent of which the unsuspecting NYU economics professor is soon to find out. To make the goings-on more real, Nick gives Rachel a primer on certain members of his family. Among them are Nick's brother Edison (Ronny Chieng, ""The Daily Show"" TV series), a functionary in the family business, and his wife Fiona (Victoria Loke).There is also cousin Astrid (Chan), who has some issues with her husband Michael Teo (Pierre Png, ""Nothing to Lose""), and his ""cheatin' heart"" and Colin's friend Bernard Tai (Jimmy O. Yang, ""Patriots Day""), the brains behind the groom's gaudy bachelor party held on a cargo ship in international waters. Also getting in on the sub-plot thing is Nick's vengeful ex-girlfriend, Amanda Ling (Jing Lusi, ""Survivor""), but this one goes nowhere. Nick and Rachel are warmly greeted when they arrive in Singapore by Colin and his fiancée. It is not until the next day, however, when Rachel meets her supportive but decidedly over-the-top college roommate Peik Lin Goh (Awkwafina, ""Ocean's 8"") that she finds out just how wealthy Nick really is.Given a tour of the family's answer to Versailles Palace, Rachel discovers the full extent of her boyfriend's ""old money."" Before she can say ""count me in,"" however, she is met with icy hostility by Nick's mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh, ""Morgan""), not exactly Cruella De Vil but a proud woman who values tradition and status and would have probably had Shakespeare (the Stratford version anyway) wait in the vestibule during a 16th century literary gathering. Mom expected Nick to return to Singapore from the U.S. to assume control of the family business, but did not expect his partner to be quite the emancipated type.It seems like Eleanor who wants only the best for her son has some serious considerations about his girlfriend's family history and American-style values (read gold digger). It is only when Eleanor discovers some hitherto undisclosed information about Rachel's family, however, that the ice hardens and turns into steel. While Crazy Rich Asians will never be mistaken for a film of profound meaning, it is more than the typical artificial Hollywood romantic comedy and brings unique warmth and humor to the table. Besides its entertainment value which is considerable, Crazy Rich Asians actually has a great deal to say about the conflict between a family's plans for their children's future and their offspring's own sense of where they want to be headed.The film especially makes us aware of the differences in values and the changing social norms between traditional Chinese families and Chinese-Americans. At any rate, there is a lot of fun, loud music, cheering, dancing, and the like to offset the serious mother-son drama of thwarted expectations. If nothing else, it is way better than the Food Network in offering tantalizing looks at some luscious dumplings. Add to that, the fact that Nick's beloved grandmother Ah Ma (Lisa Lu, ""2012"") tells Nick that she likes Rachel's nose. Now that's rich.",Crazy Rich Asians
44,TheMovieDiorama,Crazy Rich Asians expends its expensive mahjong skills to produce a hilarious heartfelt insight into a familial cultural clash.,8,2 November 2019,"Romantic comedies. The amalgamation of two genres that exercise the very worst tendencies of Hollywood's mechanical repetitions. Modern romcoms follow the same formulaic narrative structure and embed the same interpretive clichés. Y'know what I'm talking about. Boy and girl fall desperately in love, something/someone comes between them, they fight, break-up and embrace each other again, to the accompaniment of Coldplay or Ed Sheeran, when they realise that ""they are the one"". All the same mundane clichés that fail to exert the writing capacity to take those mechanisms and overload them with ferocious energy.Well, Chu's adaptation of the eponymous best-selling novel battles that. He consumes the cliché-ridden narrative structure of a romcom and transforms it into a cultural depiction of Asian traditions, juxtaposing the values of American immigrants, whilst still bashing the familiar beats of ""boy meets girl"". And let me tell you now, this is without a doubt, the best romcom since 'Bridesmaids'. I loved it! Rachel is invited by her new boyfriend Nick to Singapore to meet his family who are attending a wedding, but without realising Nick's family is one of the wealthiest, infamous and superficial in the country.Chu tackles several poignant themes and morals within this two hour romantic comedy, whilst retaining a sufficient amount of investable character development and hilarity. Yes, the underlying story between Rachel and Nick is a predictable ordeal, but much like any film within the genre, acts as the backbone for the additional qualities. One of them being the exploration into Asian culture, particularly the continent's cuisine, highlighting the traditions that contrast with the typical audience member. I cautiously read somewhere, that Crazy Rich Asians was the ""whitest romcom featuring a non-white cast"", which is an absolute barbaric statement to form. The predominant cast and crew were all of Asian descent. Just because the film was confounded within the Hollywood system, does not discredit the contents of its insight. Overtly politically correct viewers bumbling about a non-issue. I'm sure 'Black Panther' didn't receive the same criticism from them. Anyway! I digress.The point is, Chu allows the illustration of traditions and values to be accessible for everyone. However it's not just a cultural clash. Wealth and public image are two contributing factors to the spiky relationship between Rachel and and Nick's family. Yet neither one of them are viewed as the antagonistic force of the plot. Every character is treated as a delicate human, with sufficient back story and development, to warrant their choices and actions. A sub-plot involving an affair could've been a ""how dare you!? We're over!"" situation, but Chu manages to present the reasoning of the immoral act and add that subtle layer of empathy. You understand. You feel. You reflect. And there are several poignant moments throughout, like this, that elevate the contextual values that are insightfully divulged.Of course though, Awkwafina provides the majority of laughs, demonstrating the creative humour of writers Chiarelli and Lim whilst showcasing her own excellent comedic timing. Conversely, Wu and Yeoh focus on levelling the comedy with romance and drama respectively. They do so with blinding results. Expressing a variety of emotions, participating in tantalising chemistry and bringing their A-game (their...acting game...).The lavish 'Great Gatsby' parties and genuinely beautiful weddings, that performed a rendition of my all-time favourite romantic song ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" by Elvis ""Hound Dog"" Presley, nearly brought a tear to my eye with the astounding production design. Minor nuances such as the pop soundtrack, including Coldplay, sung in Mandarin, dumplings being everything and my eternal yearning for marriage, rounded off the rough edges of Crazy Rich Asians smoothly.It is absolutely refreshing to see a high-ticketed American produced romcom have an entirely Asian cast and crew, granting several new opportunities for those involved. It is absurdly reassuring to witness a cliché-ridden and formulaic narrative of the genre be fully exploited in a wonderfully entertaining story that harnesses every angle available. Yet most importantly, it's a colossal piece of entertainment that can legitimately be enjoyed by everyone. Crazy fun, rich in characters and quintessentially Asian. More please!",Crazy Rich Asians

Therefore, representation is in our melting-pot world-media. But even outside of purely socio-cultural reflection, representation also adds to entertainment value, widening perspective on and appreciation of others, even through fluffy diversion. Crazy Rich Asians does just that within its strict genre maxims. Complete with a dressing room montage, over-the-top side characters, and even a chase to the airport, it's everything we come to expect in rom-coms, and more.
You've heard the story: a young woman (Wu) struggles to find her place amongst her boyfriend's (Golding) ultra-rich family. In setting and style, it's beautifully and boldly opulent, boasting the first all-Asian cast in an American film in 25 years. And what a cast it is! Surrounding the central couple (who are fine, but far from the standouts) is a colorful cadre of big, super-specific characters. Regardless of culture, the family is so well-written and performed, you will undoubtedly recognize your own kin in them. A couple side character stories bog down, but most are welcome, especially scene-stealer Awkwafina, whose undeniable magnetism recalls Melissa McCarthy's Bridesmaids breakout.
In story mechanics, it's far from groundbreaking or transcendent. Still, those cozy plot familiarities and expected (though strong) humor make its all-too-unique viewpoint and cultural setting soar that much more. Crazy Rich Asians serves to remind us that all cultures should have the right to a tear-jerking, feel-good romance, no matter how predictable; and regardless, it's just one of the best straight-ahead rom-coms in years.",Crazy Rich Asians

50,Turfseer,Almost all-Asian cast features narrative that wants it both ways: a critique and embrace of crass materialism at the same time!,4,30 August 2018,"Before seeing this film you might have been like me and assumed this was going to be an upbeat comedy. Here's a warning, however, to all intrepid filmgoers bent on seeing this film: an upbeat comedy it is not! Actually it is a melodrama (in the popular parlance, a soap opera!). Like most soap operas, it presents a rather stereotypical, simplistic view of human relations, where there are good and bad guys, pitted against one another. 
The ""good guys"" here are the protagonists, one Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), a young NYU Economics Professor in love with Nick Young (Henry Golding), son of a very wealthy Singaporean (Chinese) family. When Nick's best friend Colin is getting married in Singapore, Nick invites her to the wedding where she can meet his family. Quite incredibly, Rachel has no idea that Nick comes from a fabulously wealthy family (don't you think this smart NYU professor could have easily googled information about Nick for the nine months or so they've been going out together?). 
The antagonists are the not such good guys, the Young family, headed by Nick's steely mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh) and a subset of obnoxious cousins, who are introduced early on in a series of calculated cameos. While Crazy Rich Asians gets pluses for featuring the first almost all-Asian mainstream Hollywood cast in quite a while, these thespians ultimately should be embarrassed with the material they're been handed-a script that suggests well-off Asians are obnoxiously materialistic with few ethical scruples. 
The plot doesn't pick up until almost half the film is over-before that it's all exposition, simply introducing one member of the family after another. We finally discover there is a story here as Eleanor is determined to make it clear to Rachel that she'll never be part of the family and consequently not permitted to win Nick's heart.  
Soon one realizes that Director Jon M. Chu wants things both ways. His rich Asians are exposed as a bunch of crass materialists, exposed by the sweet Rachel, who goes toe to toe with the controlling Eleanor, and eventually triumphs. On the other hand, despite the critique, Chu appears to revel in all that crass materialism, presenting one bloated scene of excess after another, appearing to appeal to the audience's lowest common denominator. 
Much of the excess is highlighted at a bachelor and bachelorette party, the latter attended by Rachel, There confederates of Nick's family place a dead fish in her bed in an attempt to scare her off. Initially intimidated, Rachel regroups and receives a rousing makeover courtesy the gay cousin Oliver (the makeover is strictly for fashionistas of the highest order!). Now with the perfectly chosen gown in tow, she attends Nick's friend's wedding, where an even more serious confrontation develops between the fledgling fiancee and potential mother-in-law.  
Had the director chosen to play down the glam and concentrate on the story, Crazy Rich Asians would have been much better. There is a twist here that's well written-Eleanor hires a private investigator who discovers the truth about Rachel's parentage (unknown to her) and temporarily drives a big wedge between the two lovers. 
The big climactic moment occurs when Rachel confronts Eleanor at a Mahjong game, sticking up for herself but dumping Nick in the process. The denouement on the other hand is sentimental: Nick rushes to the airport and begs Rachel's forgiveness, proposing again in the process, followed by a celebration with the mother now in attendance (finally impressed by Rachel, after Rachel tells her off). 
Constance Wu and Michele Yeoh steal the show with excellent performances, but Henry Golding's part as the sweet but bland Nick suffers in comparison. Special mention should be made of Awkwafina as Goh Peik Lin, Rachel's old friend, who provides comic relief along with Nico Santos as Oliver.

52,stevendbeard,Better Than Average Rom-Com,7,16 August 2018,"I saw ""Crazy Rich Asians"", starring Constance Wu-Fresh Off the Boat_tv, Eastsiders_tv; Henry Golding-This is his first movie but he was on the Bachelorette_tv this year; Michelle Yeoh-Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, The Mummy:Tomb of the Emperor and Awkwafina-Ocean's Eight, Neighbors 2:Sorority Rising.
This is a better than average rom-com that is based on a book-of the same name-by Kevin Kwan. It is also part of a trilogy, the other two books are called 'China Rich Girlfriend' and 'Rich People Problems'. This is the first western produced film with an exclusively all Asian cast in about 25 years-the last one was 'The Joy Luck Club' if I'm not mistaken. Constance plays a New York teacher that is dating Henry. When Henry gets an invite to a friend's wedding in Singapore, he decides it's time Constance met his family so he invites her along. Awkwafina plays Constance's long time friend that tags along, too, and she is hilarious. When they arrive is when Constance first finds out that he is from a very wealthy family. Michelle plays Henry's stuck-in-tradition mother that does not approve of his choice of girls-she is half American and not a true blooded Chinese girl. There are some cameos of Asian actors that you might recognize. I remember seeing Ken Jeong from the Hangover movies and Ronny Chieng from the Daily Show. There are some music covers, some sung in Chinese. If you like rom-coms, you should enjoy this one.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive material and language and has a running time of 2 hours.

55,CubsandCulture,"Solid Rom Com, Nice details set it apart",8,10 December 2018,"Late in the film there is a pivotal scene that is takes place over a game of Mahjong. I haven't played the game and while the film was strong enough to allow me to follow the gist of the scene checking the Google machine allowed me to fill in the missing color that really makes it a scene feel richer. This sort of thing really sets the film apart; the story largely conforms to the poor girl/rich boy tropes and conventions but the details are refreshingly different. It is a cool way to inject new life into a classic form. Also, good on the filmmakers for largely not providing clunky exposition on the various cultural points.The film is quite funny and engaging. It is almost entirely the visual flare of the director and the charming cast. Whether it is the silk and steel of Yeoh's disapproving mother, Wu's strong and smart heroine, or Golding's sexy and soulful man caught between his heart and his family the cast makes the film really work. The supporting characters are all hysterical if a bit stereotypical.I must say I found the fixation on displaying wealth a little off putting. It struck me after awhile to be less fantasy fulfillment and more cruel. I can't say the film didn't warn you but it is hard to be representative when it is about the .1% in terms of material wealth.

69,jadepietro,My Big Fat Asian Wedding,8,16 September 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A rom-com that entertains despite its racial stereotyping.JIM'S REVIEW: Romantic comedies keep to that ""true love never runs smooth"" formula: Couple meets cute, misconceptions and problems ensue, lovers realize their foolish ways and reunite, all leading to a happily-ever-after ending. When done well, they are highly entertaining and can be quite moving moviegoing experiences. (I strongly suggest seeing The Graduate, Moonstruck, Crazy Stupid Love, the Woody Allen duo, Annie Hall & Manhattan, (500) Days of Summer, LaLa Land, The Philadelphia Story, Love, Actually, The Apartment, Four Weddings and a Funeral, It Happened One Night, and my personal fave, Roman Holiday...they are the best of the best of this popular genre.) Mostly though, today's rom-coms go off course rather frequently: from My Big Fat Greek Wedding Part 1 and 2 to Aloha, or just about any rom-com that has starred Matt McConaughey, Kate Hudson, Ashton Kutcher, Catherine Heigl, Cameron Diaz, the Jennifers: Lopez and Aniston, Gerald Butler, Sarah Jessica Parker, or Ben Affleck. This movie doesn't crash and burn, but it does get a bit singed around the edges.Crazy Rich Asians stars none of the above perpetrators and is a better-than-average example of this genre. It boasts an all-Asian cast (its major drawing card) but it generically follows the typical storyline of two star-crossed lovers dealing with outside forces that want to sabotage their relationship. As the couple is put to the test of their love, they will hopefully bond together with enough comedic moments to satisfy the film's target female audience members. As a moviegoer, male or female, you too will be tested and hopefully endure the film's racial stereotyping and sit-com hi-jinks to satisfy your personal level of humor. (This reviewer found the film engaging enough to recommend despite its flaws.)The plot is basically a fractured modern day fairy tale: Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an American-Chinese professor, accompanies her boyfriend, Nick (Henry Golding), to attend Nick's best friend's wedding in Singapore and also meet his family. It is there that Rachel discovers that he is filthy rich and should be the next viable contestant for The Bachelor. Of course, his mama, Eleanor (a wonderful Michelle Yeoh), disapproves of the courtship, as does most of Mainland China.The film deals with the underlying issue of culture and class wars. The stage is set for the immigrant commoner (good) vs. the elite upper class (evil). It's poor Cinderella wanting her dashing Prince, with the Evil Stepmother (or in this case, the haughty Mother-in Law) closely behind to undo her wish. We have crossed over into soap opera territory yet we know the inevitable outcome.Crazy Rich Asian is solidly directed by John M. Chu, although he is more interested into the lavishness of the surroundings than the characters in motion. He displays ad nauseam all of the excess materialism from this wealthy Chinese family: the exquisitely tailored costumes and expensive accessories, the palatial life styles of the rich, their stylish sport car toys and yachts, etc. It seems accurate. This, I am told is how the 1% live. But knowing that fact did not make me care for most of these superficial characters, their empty and self-absorbed lives, and their selfish impulses. Based on Kevin Kwan's novel, we get a glimpse into how the other half live, or with the new economics, the other quarter live. With money comes power, yet these shallow billionaires wallow in their extravagances rather than use their wealth for any philanthropic purposes. This crucial detail usurped my full enjoyment of the film, even though some of the comedy worked effectively well due to the talented cast.Ms. Wu and Mr. Golding are charming and play off each other very convincingly. Perhaps the best performance comes from Ms. Yeoh. Given a one-dimensional role of the evildoer, she does wonders with her subtle interpretation of this character and layers it with a semblance of humanity. The screenplay by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim wisely tries to instill some funny lines and physical comedy into this sudsy tale with the help of Awkwafina, Ken Jeong, and Nico Santos as the comic relief team. However, most of the supporting roles are not particularly well-written and are actually borderline racist in their depiction of Asian society today. Gemma Chan adds depth and pathos to her role in one of the film's sub-plots. Also providing strong support are Lisa Lu, Chris Pang, and Pierre Png. Others get swallowed up in their cliched roles.Crazy Rich Asian is pure melodramatic soap opera. Over-the top. Opulent. Glitzy. It's really My Big Fat Asian Wedding with some extra class and lots of entertainment value.",Crazy Rich Asians

No this isn't a political paper for a social studies class, but it makes up a big theme of the movie I'm reviewing tonight. Tonight's film is all about the traditions and heritage that comes with certain families and how they can complicate aspects of life for many. Naturally, we love the drama that comes with it, as it provides stories to become immersed into, especially when the pursuit of romance comes with. Based on a popular book, tonight's rom-com hopes to bring a lot of people into the box office in hopes of wrapping up the summer with a good romantic aspect to tie us over. Will it work? Robbie K here to shed some light on the subject as he reviews: Movie: Crazy, Rich, Asians (2018)Director:
 Jon M. Chu
Writers:
 Peter Chiarelli (screenplay by), Adele Lim (screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh 
LIKES: Fun: The movie is overall a fun take on the romantic-comedy aspect. It has plenty of drama, but somehow uses the traditions and culture to really craft an entertaining tale that incorporates a number of colorful characters to bring out the full emotion. In addition, the movie has a lot of aspects that the rich culture brings that brings more entertainment to please the masses that come to the film. The Tasteful Jokes: You'll need to go in expecting stereotypes, but based on what modern TV and movies can do these days, Crazy, Rich Asians keeps it quite tasteful. Clever wit, a well-timed joke, and the fantastic delivery of lines will have you howling in delight at all the awkwardness this situation brings. Even better, is how most of the jokes are well embedded into the story, and not just thrown in for the sake of making a joke. Throw in a little justice being dropped and the result is jokes that will have people nodding or smirking in delight at the pokes it brings. The Gorgeous Set/Sequences: With crazy money, comes the ability to get super creative with the parties and celebrations that fill this movie to the brim. The elaborate houses are certainly a wonderful start, but the shores of Singapore are lined with tourist destinations galore that will have you craving a vacation sometime soon. As boats, towers, and shopping centers begin to unwind. In addition, the movie scores points at bringing a lot of fun into these immaculate settings, fully bringing out the fun and helping you dive into the celebrations at hand. The Music: The music is fun, fresh, and in the Asian tongues and melodies that fit well into the movie. While certainly more covers than anything, Crazy Rich Asians does a nice job selecting tracks that either fully agree to the scene, or at least bring the emotions out in full force. This is certainly most prevalent at the romantic intense moments, primarily in the wedding you saw in the trailer. The Characters: I've already said this before, but the movie's characters are certainly my favorite aspect of the movie. Constance Wu and Henry Golding are fantastic protagonists, managing to bring the passion out in full strength, but not cross over into corny levels as we often see. Gemma Chan and Michelle Yeoh do their parts justice as well, acting as subplots that run-in tangent with the main plot, but yet add to the story. In addition, their support of the main story keeps their involvement relevant and fun. Finally Awkwafina and Nico Santos, steal the show in their own regards as they help amplify the fun and contribute to the growth of the characters in their own regard. As for the other collection of characters, they play their own part in crafting grandiose farces that are meant to only irritate the nerves of the audience. 
DISLIKES: The Cliché: It's a romance movie, and sadly Crazy, Rich, Asian follows the tried and true plot of the genre. It's formulaic, romantic bouts are flattering, sweet, and full of that mushy love Nicholas Sparks fans loves, yet it is so bluntly predictable that it makes for a yawn inducing plot at times. So, originality wise it doesn't win points. The Cheesy Tertiary Characters: Dramas are all about extreme characters to stir the pot and get people addicted to the madness to come. This film takes those moments a little too extreme, making these ridiculous characters even more eye rolling than needed. I could have stomached it better had they integrated this group into the plot, but sadly they were reduced to a diluted farce whose sole role was to bring a big joke, or jab at the main character. Not the best use of these groups, but hey at least we got a laugh. The Incomplete Story: A book has load of time to develop the story and give you the in-depth details that many crave. The film though did it's best to balance the imagination into a 2-hour run-time and keep it entertaining. While they accomplished the task of making the rich lifestyle explode on screen, and infuse the girl power, strong woman role, the other parts of the story were sub-par. I've hinted this up in the characters, but there was strong underutilization of characters, including Awkwafina, and I would have liked to see their involvement span out more. In addition, there were other family dynamics that showed potential, but then flunked out and went broke with only a few gags to try and recover. Trailers Revealed Much: I don't think there is much explaining, but there are a lot of scenes that have been elaborated too much by the trailers. So hopefully you haven't been obsessed watching the trailers too much. 
THE VERDICT:
 Overall, Crazy, Rich, Asians works for the romance movie, not crossing too far into the cheesy realm, but still not escaping it either. You will find the scenes fun, entertaining, and at times charming, but the film is also a spectacle of what you can do with obscene amounts of money. Still, the formulaic presentation is rather stale and incomplete, meaning you should rent the book and get the full story. My recommendations are it is worth checking out, but better reserved for the home viewing over the actual theater minus maybe a date movie or girl's night out. My scores are: Comedy/Romance: 7.5

73,moviexclusive,"As hilarious, romantic and heartfelt as the best rom-coms, 'Crazy Rich Asians' is also a surprisingly textured and poignant examination of ethnic, class and person",8,25 August 2018,"We are proud, immensely proud, to say that for a little red dot which some had up until recently mistook as a province in China, Singapore has been getting plenty of limelight within the last few months. On the political stage, the recently concluded Trump-Kim Summit that was dubbed the 'Singapore Summit' showcased our professionalism at organising a milestone diplomatic event. And just barely two months after, the very first Hollywood film to feature an all-Asian ensemble in more than 20 years (the last being Ang Lee's 'Joy Luck Club' back in 1993) is easily the most impressive our island city has ever looked on the big screen. Oh yes, the iconic touristy locations including Chijmes, Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands are all there, but there are also surprising nods here to our hawker culture (which you may have heard our PM announcing at this year's Rally is being put up for a Unesco listing) and Chinese heritage that you'll cheer for, and damn if seeing the sights and sounds we call home doesn't make our hearts swell with national pride.Indeed, 'Crazy Rich Asians' is as much a win for Asian-Americans as it is for Singapore, and you'd be plain silly to let some misplaced criticism about how the movie doesn't reflect the real Singapore (because it was meant to be a satirical fantasy?) or lacks the representation of other races (because no film set in New York, or London, or Los Angeles reflects the full cultural breadth of the place?) rain on our parade. Gamely assembling an outstanding ensemble cast from Hollywood, Malaysia and Singapore, this adaptation of Singapore-born author Kevin Kwan's bestselling novel is as breezily entertaining and hilarious as the best of the rom-coms, but its examination on class, culture and the Asian identity is what truly gives it emotional heft and thematic resonance. In fact, it would be utterly simplistic to say that it is a critique on the nouveau riche in Singapore society; there is also the intra-community prejudices within the Asian diasporas, the Chinese tradition of filial loyalty and its implications on parent-child relationships, and last but not least the tensions between different forms of identity including personal, cultural and class.If it isn't yet obvious, this movie is so, so much more than just an indulgence in the escapist pleasures of the ultra-rich that its synopsis may suggest. Certainly, as the young economics professor Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) at New York University accompanies her boyfriend Nicholas Young (Henry Golding) back to Singapore for his best friend's wedding, she plays the role of the audience surrogate channelling our sense of disbelief, amazement and disgust at his family and their never-never land of aspirational wealth, obscene consumerism and invidious judge-iness. Yet beyond these and the obvious caricatures of Nick's movie-director cousin Alistair (Remy Hii), his status-conscious Hong Kong cousin Eddie (Ronny Chieng) as well as spoiled-rotten bachelor Bernard (Jimmy O. Yang), there is plenty of sobering material about Nick's formidable mother Eleanor's (Michelle Yeoh) disdain towards Rachel and protectiveness towards her son. Ditto the crumbling marriage between Nick's fashion-maven cousin Astrid (Gemma Chan) and her husband Michael (Pierre Png), owing to the latter's inferiority complex and subsequent infidelity.As directed by Jon M. Chu, the movie is perfectly balanced between big broad sequences and quiet intimate moments. The former comprises the gaudy scenes of opulent dinner gatherings, lavish bachelor/ bachelorette parties and $40 million weddings that the trailer was full of, and Chu's eye for colour and movement ensures that these scenes are lively, vibrant and eye-popping. But it is the latter where his film truly scores - witness for instance how Chu and his cinematographer Vanja Cernjul capture the way Eleanor sizes Rachel up and subsequently regards her with withering putdowns as well as icy glares, and how Rachel and Eleanor face off in a penultimate segment over a thrilling game of mah-jong. Just as captivating but for entirely different reasons are the occasions where Nick and Rachel distance themselves from the crowd and allow themselves to re-discover just why they had fallen in love with each other in the first place. As packed as the movie is with its huge group of characters, Chu never loses focus on his core characters and their relationships vis-à-vis one another, and it is his keen eye for these interactions that ensures his film also possesses emotional gravitas.Most significantly, 'Crazy Rich Asians' offers a touching lesson on embracing who you are, no matter if you're rich or poor or disparaged. That is as true for Nick as it is for Rachel, just as true if not more so for Eleanor, and surprisingly poignant for both Astrid and Michael. Wu is a standout as the classic good-girl, never overselling the role but instead playing it with just the right mix of poise, vulnerability and self-assertiveness at the right time. Her chemistry with Golding is also infectiously appealing, and for all the hackles about casting a British Malaysian actor to play a Chinese Singaporean justifies the casting choice with his own polished screen charisma. Even more electrifying though is the push-pull dynamic between Wu and Yeoh as their characters lock horns with each other, and though the movie belongs to the younger actors, the veteran Malaysian actress is absolutely regal in her supporting role that is crisp, authoritative but also unexpectedly deserving of empathy. Chan and Png try to flesh out the complications arising from a reversal of the classic Asian husband-wife breadwinning role, but they as well as the other more minor supporting actors relegated to over-the-top bit comic parts are constrained by their little time onscreen.That said, Kwan's novel wasn't ever going to fit neatly into a two-hour feature film, which also means that some of the subplots were going to necessarily receive short shrift; still, for the most part Chu's screenwriters Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim have retained the core themes within the novel and ensured that these remain just as affecting as Kwan had intended. Like we said at the beginning, Singapore has never looked as gorgeous as it does in this movie, and credit to that colourful razzle-dazzle goes of course to Chu's visual eye. Yet beneath that shiny veneer is also a layered reflection of the Singaporean Chinese identity, which is both ethnically similar and different to the American-Chinese (or better known as Asian-American) identity, demonstrating how race is shaped as much by history, geography and kinship. Ultimately, its message about identity is as much relevant for an Asian-American audience as it is for us, especially how our multi-racialism often neglects intra-racial differences as well as class differences. You need not be Asian, or crazy rich, or even Chinese, to enjoy this hilarious, romantic and heartfelt rom-com that doesn't lose its cultural richness while retaining its universal appeal.",Crazy Rich Asians

This would be be like a typical cable lovesick ""dramedy"" if not for the richly portrayed characters and totally over-the-top scenery and locations in Singapore and Malaysia. The first half of the movie is a knock-out until it comes out that Rachel, a highly intelligent economics professor, is the result of her mother's love affair in China.

75,Abdulxoxo,Enjoyable in most parts,6,29 January 2021,"Crazy Rich Asians is essentially a romantic-comedy, which features many of the standard tropes expected from the rom-com genre. So let's get those flaws out of the way quickly. There was a supporting character who was slightly creepy around Rachel, continually taking pictures of her on his phone. Referencing him fancying her would have been sufficient for purpose. The continuous photos I think were too much. Finally, I thought at times the score crossed a line from romantic into cheesiness. On the flip side, the film looked amazing. The cinematography was stunning. The locations and buildings were postcard beautiful. Considering the movie was dealing with characters who had endless supplies of money it should come as no surprise to tell you that the production design and costume design were fantastic. It seemed like everything we saw was purposely shot to make us go wow. As for the film's main stars, I thought Constance Wu was terrific in the lead role. She was perfectly believable as the cute, smart, girl next door type girlfriend of Nick. She also blossomed when Rachel was forced into confrontations with members of Nick's family. A particularly powerful obstacle was Nick's very prim mother, Eleanor who even before meeting Rachel already didn't like her. She's a cold and calculating character that could have been too sharp for a traditional rom-com. One of the main themes of the film is about the burden of tradition and family money. Michelle Yeoh was integral in giving this movie the foundation for which this theme could be built upon. Whereas Wu's Rachel represented the new, Yeoh's Eleanor represented the old; and together they worked perfectly to create a satisfying sense of awkwardness, which in turn led to comic drama.",Crazy Rich Asians

77,pyrocitor,The Greater Gatsby,9,23 August 2018,"It's fitting that author Kevin Kwan has been heralded as the 'Jane Austen of the 2010s,' as the cinematic adaptation of his smash hit Crazy Rich Asians opens in a prim, stately British manor that the Bennetts would feel right at home at - then has its eponymous protagonists triumphantly turn the power tables on the stuffy Brits who have the gall to be racist to their faces. It's a purposefully reappropriative moment of triumph - an opening 'hell yeah' fist pump, coyly acknowledging the 25 years(!) of cinematic silence since Hollywood has bankrolled an Asian-focused story with a functionally entirely Asian cast. And, like Black Panther, 2018's fellow benchmark of Hollywood representation, it's about damn time. And Crazy Rich Asians owns its rumbling fanfare of expectation with the jaunty confidence of a pair of Jimmy Choos sauntering down a runway. Replete with riotous humour and consummate charm, it's a two hour slice of flashiness, fashion, fireworks, and frivolity - bubbly, escapist silliness and sentiment with just enough heart and slyly satirical cultural critique to keep from becoming superfluously frothy. In short: it's a perfectly delightful romantic comedy, and a fun as hell time at the movies. Director Jon M. Chu handles his international audiences with care. His pacing is cleverly canny, starting with a slow ingratiation into the architectural (Merlions, Marina Bay Sands, and Botanical Gardens, oh my!), culinary (the food, the FOOD! Whatever you do, don't watch Crazy Rich Asians on an empty stomach), and cultural landscapes of Singapore - shot on dazzling location - before plunging down the rabbit hole into the dizzying wonderland of wealth. Cleverly, the story's melodramatic histrionics ramp up in direct correlation with the display of jaw-dropping money being thrown around, and the dramaaaaaa unfolding amidst a sea of private islands, million dollar earrings, and one of the most unforgettably over-the-top movie weddings lends it a firmly tongue-in-cheek, bawdy escapism, like the best kind of reality TV show. Chu attacks his subject matter with a champagne pop of vibrancy, with appropriately flooring haute couture costumes and production values, and a candy-coloured aesthetic that brings the opulence to life so energetically you'll nearly want Ray Bans in the theatre. Initial fourth-wall poking flourishes (including a zig-zagging coloured line jaunting across the planet, in the WeeChat equivalent of a 1970s telephone split-screen) punch up the playfulness, but quickly fizzle out - probably for the best, lest they grow obnoxiously overbearing, but still indicative of the film settling a mite too comfortably into cliché. Still, the devilish cleverness of touches like the superb soundtrack, punctuating the party with Mandarin covers of on-the-nose Western songs like ""Material Girl"" and ""Baby You're A Rich Man"" (as well as a climactic accompaniment that somehow blends teary sentiment with hilarious incongruity, too good to spoil), are enough to stave off Great Gatsby showy hollowness, and keep the film playfully fresh and fiendishly fun. Still, within the tsunami of showiness lies an intimate, affecting parable of love and family, with aspirations of modernity and shrouds of tradition going viciously head to head. The genius of Crazy Rich Asians is the populist accessibility of its story yet unique cultural specificity of its telling, and Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim's screenplay is careful to sprinkle in idiosyncratic moments specific to Southeast Asia, including interchangeably switching languages between English, Mandarin, and Cantonese and carefully delineating the cultural milieus of 'old' and 'new money,' to ensure the narrative's cultural roots aren't excessively diluted in the wash of its international audience (the peppering of knowing chuckles in my theatre would suggest they succeeded). Chu proves as adept at letting tender private moments breathe as fanning the razzle-dazzle of the loftier celebrations. He anchors several tearjerking emotional beats on scenes that would play as Asian stereotypes in most other Hollywood productions (a family making dumplings together; an emotionally charged game of Mahjong), thereby deftly reappropriating their authenticity. The film will inevitably draw crowds for its lavish blowouts, but it's the sweetness and resonance of the story that will linger long after the confetti and caviar settle to the floorboards. Constance Wu makes for an irresistibly lovable lead, her disarming goofiness making her a perfect fish-out-of-water guide through the film's capitalistic culture shocks, while her sparky charisma and emotive vulnerability make her the perfect emotional fulcrum. As her secretly superrich beau, Henry Golding is consummately dashing, while Gemma Chan embodies sympathetic socialite Astrid's effortless elegance and deep sadness with ever fibre of her being. Still, the unquestionable show-stealing performance goes to the wonderful Michelle Yeoh. Cementing her standing in the annals of 'scariest movie moms,' Yeoh is terrifyingly austere and magnetic in her glacial stillness, so subtle and effective that she can summon a tidal wave of staggeringly intricate conflicting emotions with an almost indiscernible tightening of her jaw. Supporting them, rapper Awkwafina is surprisingly funny without overstaying as Rachel's bombastic comic relief friend, while Chris Pang and Sonoya Mizuno are delightfully down to earth and loopy respectively, headlining the wedding of the century. Finally, Ronny Chieng, Jimmy O. Yang, and Nico Santos each take turns stealing scenery with side-splitting aplomb, while the incomparable Ken Jeong is customarily hysterical, perfectly encapsulating the flashiness of 'new money' with gleeful excess. Crazy Rich Asians is a perfectly populist summer delight - a kaleidoscope of sensory delights and cinematic energy ensconcing a terrific cast bringing a quality story to life with honesty and humour to spare. Chu leaves us with enough of a hangover of giddiness to keep expectations fierce for the invariable upcoming China Rich Girlfriend. And if it continues to pave the way for more diverse, personal stories reaching international exposure in the meantime? Well, that's the most enriching (ha) outcome of all. -8.5/10",Crazy Rich Asians

83,sharky_55,"A poor, raised by a single mother, low class, immigrant nobody.",8,15 September 2018,"Even before its release, Crazy Rich Asians faced the same uphill battle that Black Panther encountered in some circles. Majority critical praise aside, there are and were those that would poke holes in their representations of diversity. No, Wakanda didn't usher in a new world order of black power and racial equality, but merely established an outreach centre in Oakland. But that also doubled as a baby step in the real world. In the same vein, CRA has had criticism levelled at its actors' various ethnicities as well as not being a thorough ethnographic census for every Asian residing in Singapore. But the film shouldn't have to single-handedly shoulder the burden of speaking for all of 2 billion audience members around the world. The title is the title, tongue-in-cheek taken from its biting, satirical source material, not a monolithic marker. And this is without the backing, reach and might of the Disney corporation behind them, mind you. This moderately budgeted flick may just be another romcom to the dismissive, but it's undeniably significant when you have to claw back decades just to find the last Hollywood feature with a majority Asian cast. Sure, it utilises Ken Jeong as a punchline, who has practically been a totem pole for Asian emasculation. But it's also got plenty of eye-candy in the form of lush closeups of the various shirtless lead males, including a particularly gratifying shot of Pierre Png after a shower, lingering generously on his torso. ""It's like the Asian Bachelor,"" the witty Awkwafina quips. And where is the sin in that? Are we not allowed a little indulgence? Let's not pretend that Hollywood itself doesn't have a strict quota for the non-attractive and the non-wealthy, as if it doesn't engage in wish-fulfillment at every turn. Let's not tear down a milestone for failing to attain a perfect representation of a scattered, worldwide diaspora. Political implications aside, the story takes on a familiar fish-out-of-water format while deftly sidestepping some of the genre's more groan-inducing cliches. We follow Constance Wu's Rachel, a economics professor at NYU (and one of the youngest in her faculty too), as she dives headfirst into the luxurious world of her boyfriend's, Singapore's old money millionaires. Yes, it's the comfortable and the intelligent stepping into complete opulence. Conventionally, we might expect this level of luxury to overwhelm our poor little protagonist and render her into an embarrassing, classless puddle. When a film dangles a jewel like Queen of the Night flowers that bloom once a year, it's usually a prop for the clumsy outside to knock over. But Rachel doesn't back down from the lavishness that's on for show. One the the film's subplots involves the glamourous Astrid's husband having an affair because the pressures of such a high-profile marriage make him feel inadequate. Their relationship's end is the perfect compliment to Rachel and Henry's, in that it highlights the sheer belief and self-confidence of Rachel, who won't be made to feel unworthy no matter how many of Singapore's elite dismiss her. One couldn't be blamed for being seduced by this world of grandeur. Chu and DP Vanja Cernjul craft the flashiness of Singapore's wealthy with a crisp, digital look, the nightlife popping with all sorts of flamboyant neon streaks, only to be reigned in by the relatively conservative mindset of the Young matriarchs. There's soft focus shots of food prep and ornate interiors; glistening dumplings, steaming pots and Eleanor prowling through the kitchen in silent approval. Crazy Rich Asians never feels the need to apologise for this lavish presentation, and why should it? Consider how Eleanor uses her wealth as a weapon against prejudice and bigotry in the opening scene, not as mere decoration. Or how her character, having been thrust into the world of the Youngs much like Rachel, never feels quite at home, her stereotypically icy exterior shrouding her own insecurities and regrets. Not every story needs to be raggedy social realism, and not every depiction of the rich needs to eventuate into downfall or humility. It's not any movie that could make dropping casually dropping 1.2 million on a pair of earrings an empowering act, but that's what Astrid enables it to be. She and Henry both brandish jewelry not as icons of status, but as powerful symbols of how comfortable they are with WHO they are. It's fresh and bold to see a film so at ease with its glamour, and as something not necessarily to be ashamed of, as we pull back from the top of the Marina Bay Sands. This clash of culture is most obvious in the penultimate scene between Rachel and Eleanor, who are both beginning to realise they have more in common with each other than they think, and where the former lays down her cards (or mahjong tiles) and admits that she loves Henry enough to know that he cannot cut off all of Singapore just to be with her. The move once again underlines her courage and understanding of the importance of family, perhaps even better than Eleanor does. And as we follow her onto that plane, the movie almost ends on her note of selflessness. I was ready to accept this, recognising how truly brave it was to finish with such a twist on the romcom...and then I was cheering as Rachel accepted the happiness that we all knew she deserved. But baby steps. Maybe next year. By the way, that mid-credits scene is in my personal non-canon. It turns Astrid's individual arc into a goddamn wink and a mere stepping stone to another man, and I won't have it.",Crazy Rich Asians

85,rockman182,Crazy Rich Asians (2018),7,11 September 2018,"Recently upgraded to AMC A-List and I was very happy to try out this service with this as a first film. Heard a lot of positive things about this film all round and it is certainly nice to see diversity in films, especially as leads. The film is supposedly the first all Asian Hollywood film since 1993. After watching the film, I'll say that while the story is familiar and not so innovative, the glory and wonder of the visuals costumes and actors really push the film and make it enjoyable.The film is about a woman named Rachel who travels with her boyfriend to Singapore for his relative's wedding. As soon as she arrives she realizes that her boyfriend and his family is actually very rich. Rachel struggles with acceptance and jealousy from her boyfriends family. She soon must think about if her relationship means enough to her to carry it on despite being at odds with the mother of her boyfriend. The all Asian cast includes Constance Wu, Michelle Yeoh, and a supporting cast that includes Ken Jeong and Awkwafina.I won't comment on the controversy of misrepresentation of Chinese Americans or any of the other cultural issues at hand. I will say that I enjoyed taking a look at Asian andd Singaporean culture. The food, costumes, ceremonies and such are simply beautiful. I agree with a review I read comparing it to Baz Luhrman's The Great Gatsby, which I adore. The film is vibrant and grand and very well acted. Michelle Yeoh is the standout in this but all the characters do well.While its well acted, not all supporting characters are fleshed out. The plot is very familiar and has been seen before. There is imbalance in the plot because of its scattered focus switching between the two leads and the other members of the boyfriend's family. There are moment's where I feel jokes are forced and don't come off smoothly. Still, its nice to see recognition and praise for a film that is speaking up about representation and showing appreciation and giving a glimpse into a culture many people may not know about. A sequel is in the works and might do just as well.7/10",Crazy Rich Asians
86,jon.h.ochiai,About Family? About Passion? Or Both.,10,21 August 2018,"Michelle Yeoh is powerful eloquent reserve in Director Jon Chu's romantic comedy ""Crazy Rich Asians"". Star Constance Wu, of ""Fresh Off the Boat"" dazzles in the lead, yet it's Michelle's understated gravitas that grounds Writers Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim's screenplay based on Kevin Kwan's bestseller.At the home of Grandmother Ah Ma, played by Lisa Lu, Michelle's Eleanor Young speaks with her son's girlfriend Rachel Chu, played by Constance. She tells Rachel what she has learned over her years: ""You are not enough."" It might be easy to stereotype Eleanor as the Mother whose son is too good for any woman. However, was Eleanor speaking of Rachel or... of herself? Instead of vilifying Eleanor, Jon and Michelle subtly unveil her humanity. We truly get a feel for what it's like to be Eleanor. In a tender scene at Eleanor's home. Her beloved Son Nick, played by breezy strong Henry Golding, changes his shirt after Rachel accidentally spills wine. Mom helps her son get dressed. Nick asks Mom, ""How do I look?"" With unconditional love in her eyes Eleanor replies, ""Perfect."" We get it. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" opens in Hong Kong in 1995 with young Mom Eleanor weathering the rain storm with her kids, and trying to check into their Hotel. She encounters blatant racism. Opting not to make a scene proper Eleanor calls her billionaire Husband. Turns out she's the new owner of the Hotel, unbeknownst to the service desk. Problem solved. No much ado. That defines Eleanor. According to Eleanor: Family above passion. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is hysterical in the ostentatious style and visual opulence. Constance's Rachel is the daughter of the single Mom, who is the NYU Economics Professor specializing in Game Theory. She's in love with fellow NYU Professor Nick. He invites Rachel to Singapore to attend his best friend's wedding. Colin, played by handsome funny Chris Prang, is marrying his sweetheart Araminta, played by bright gorgeous Sonoya Mizuno. Rachel is friends with both as well. This presents the opportunity to introduce Rachel to Nick's Mother. That's the hysterical rub, at least not very funny for Rachel. The trip provides Rachel a chance to visit her college roommate bleached blonde free-spirited Peik Lin, masterfully whimsical Awkwafina. 
Until their trip Rachel had no idea that Nick's family virtually owns Singapore. And that Nick is Singapore's Prince William. Actually, thinks he's more Prince Harry. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is hilariously in the excess: Be it the musical DJ and bikini clad bachelor party on the freight ship in the middle of the ocean or Araminta's gaudy shopping spree bachelorette party on the tropical island. Rachel meets Nick's ex-girlfriend Amanda, beautifully subversive Jin Lusi. Amanda is not the only one hating on Rachel for dating Singapore's Most Eligible. In the goofy homage to ""The Godfather"", instead of a horse's head, Rachel discovers a barracuda's head in her bed from her numerous haters. Perhaps, immersed in its visceral parody of excess, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" runs a tad long. That's forgivable in its distinctive charm. Constance is the star. She's radiantly beautiful. Her eyes discern her wisdom of people. She is authentically funny and vulnerable. Henry Golding is deceptive in his poignant gravitas. His vast charm belies his strength within. He confides his profound humanity and compassion when talking of Rachel while drinking beer with Colin on a desolate river. He loves Rachel. He would give up everything to be with her. What I love most are the conversations with Rachel, Nick, and Eleanor. As in life people will surprise in wondrous ways. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is clever, hysterical, and so heartfelt in its humanity. Michelle's Eleanor may not be as her surface reveals. She is the rock of ""Crazy Rich Asians"". She is amazing. Perhaps, family comes before passion? Maybe, life is the balance of both family and passion? Life is absolutely about unconditional love. That's what makes ""Crazy Rich Asians"" so memorable and soulful. It's one of my favorite movies of the year.",Crazy Rich Asians
87,RforFilm,"Though a story about meeting the parents is nothing new, Crazy Rich Asians is likable and charming enough to be enjoyable",7,20 August 2018,"How warranted are people when they claim that Hollywood is not diverse enough? It depends on what they're asking for. When someone says that characters within movies are not diverse, then that can be tricky as the actors have different jobs then the creators. They're merely hired to play people, and yet get the most critics if they don't fit the mold of whom they're playing. So should the blame be on the creators? That too can be unfair, as many movies have been made around different cultures that have been made by people of different backgrounds. My only opinion is that we simply need more people willing to step up to tell their stories rather then waiting for someone else to do it for them.In the case of people of Asian descent, they've come far with stars like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Lucy Liu being able to carry their own movies in America. I'll admit that there aren't a lot of options for them (as it is for most that are not Caucasian), but again, it relates to more people that are willing to write stories for them to work on. In the case of Crazy Rich Asians, we have a full Asian cast, directed by John M. Chu, and based off a novel written by Kevin Kwan. We center on a young couple, an NYU economics professor Rachel (played by Constance Wu) and the dashing businessman Nick (played by Henry Golding). They are both flying from New York to his home country of Singapore for a friends wedding. Nick is using this opportunity to introduce his family to her. As soon as they got on they plane, she realizes that with their first class upgrade, his family is wealthy. He admits that ""their comfortable"". Yep, we know anyone who says that is loaded.Arriving in Singapore, Rachel finds that Nick's family is very power and...crazy rich. In fact, when Rachel visits her college roommate Goh Peick Lin (played by Awkwafina), she's given an expensive dress to wear for Nick's family get-together. Not only does she find he house huge with other wealthy families, but finds she's way out of her element. She even gets the sense that Nick's mom Eleanor (played by Michelle Yeoh) doesn't care for her, given her poor background and American personality. She spends the next couple of days proving to his family that she's more then worthy to be come a part of it.Despite having a majority Asian cast and being set in Singapore, Crazy Rich Asians may have been the perfect story for a mainstream audience. That's because by being a fish out of water story, this allows our main character to be given explanation for traditions and customs of the family that live this lifestyle. However, the story itself isn't that complex. It's like a lot of romance comedies about meeting the significant other's parents (or just the mom in this case). Does it work in a crowded environment along with Guess Whose Coming to Dinner and Meet the Parents?Yes, this does work. A lot of it does thanks to it's really talented cast who manage to carry the overused story. Both Constance Wu and Henry Golding have a lot of chemistry together and seem like a couple you want to see together despite the mother's objection. Speaking of which, Michelle Yeoh gives just enough of a dominance that seems intimidating without becoming too much like an evil characters. Like a lot of people, I'll admit that actress Awkwafina gives out a lot of necessary comedy that kept my attention. She has a character that's so outrageous, that I wouldn't mind seeing a spin off about her.As I said, the story of meeting the other's parent is nothing new as long as something new is brought to the table. In terms of culture and lifestyle, this is a high-pressure environment that sees outsiders as a trespasser. It makes sense for Rachel to be shunned. It can lead into territories that seem out of place. There's a moment with a dead fish and another with a plane that feel like something out of different stories. Plus, I'll admit that while Nick is likable, he doesn't seem to be trying as hard to stand up for Rachel. Yeah, he does follow her and tries to make her confortable; I wish the movie would have shown more of his interaction with his own family.I'll give this seven gongs out of ten (trust me, there's a whole joke about this in the movie). This is going to have a long life in rentals and streaming. It may even be something I watch again in the future. If your not into romantic comedies, then this may not be for you. Otherwise, give a watch and experience something rich.",Crazy Rich Asians

Chu has crafted a beautiful, funny film that sends a message and brings the viewer into a world that is, heretofore, not seen on the screen. And he brings this to the viewer with a loving eye and deep, soulful heart that shines throughout.As the lead couple, Wu and Golding are charming, charismatic and VERY GOOD TO LOOK AT, they are an easy pair of people to spend some time with. Most of the other actors on the screen are very well cast and some standouts include Nico Santos as Oliver and good ol' Ken Jeong as Wye Mun Goh.But it is the work of three very good, very different, but very PROFESSIONAL actresses that caught my eye. The first is Awkwafina (OCEAN'S 8) as an old College roommate of Rachel's who is the funniest thing in the film (think Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids) she brings a much needed level of irreverence to the stodginess of Nick's family. Gemma Chan (TV's HUMANS) carries a good deal of the dramatic and emotional weight of this film as Nick's Sister - a ""cool on the outside, emotionally troubled on the inside"" soul who steals any scene she is in. I think we have a real star in the making with her.And then there is Michelle Yeoh (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) as Nick's ""Tiger Mom"" who disapproves of his girlfriend and her ""American ways"". She's a traditionalist who gave up quite a bit for her family and expects the same level of familiar commitment from her children. It would be easy to make this character one-dimensional, but in Yeoh's capable hands, it is anything but.It's not a perfect film - I felt it dragged a bit in the middle - but the beginning and (especially) the last 1/2 hour of this film is funny, poignant and emotional (bring your hankies - you're gonna need them).Oh...and stay through the first part of the credits, there is a scene about 2 minutes in that sets up the sequel (there are 3 books in this series).This is a good film for EVERYONE - whether your are a CRA or not!Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Crazy Rich Asians

92,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Dull Asian Ballers,4,4 June 2019,"Before I mention why I gave this movie only four stars, I like to say what I did like about it. I thought the photography and the sets were outstanding. As an amature photographer, I really do appreciate the excellent cinematography, props and sets that went into this film. The attention to details like frame composition, lighting, colors and sets were extremely well done. It's almost like a tourism film for Singapore. Visually, this film has a Disney sort of eye candy to it. The wedding ceremony in particularly felt like something out of a Disney animation but live action instead.But I honestly can't see why this film was rated so highly. The main characters are so totally dull that I found the secondary characters much more interesting. I really didn't care about the main protagonists at all. This film could have used more of Ken Jeong working with Awkwafina to bring out real laughs. Personally, I think they should have hired these two comedians to write the entire screenplay because they are genuinely funny. The characters are nauseating, conceited, materialistic and vain. The dialog seems so artificial and braggy. Again, this film could have used more of Ken Jeong and Awkwafina to break the monotonous baller dialog from the rest of the family. The story is boring and unoriginal romcom without the com. Just because the cast is Asian doesn't make the underlying story unique or good. If this film were produced by a Chinese studio no one would bat an eye. But because it was made by an American movie studio, it is a big deal? Hollywood is so full of itself. Wouldn't it be ironic if Hengdian World Studios made a Chinese romcom starring only American cast members and then pat itself on the back for being proactive SJW? Sheep4/10 from me. A 7/10?

94,silvermistvio,One of the love stories I could watch.,8,10 November 2018,"For most conditions, I hate love stories, anything that has to do with Romance and drama. So, I didn't have high hope for this film. I saw trailer and people addressed this one as a great movie. So, I gave it a try.The story is quite simple. A guy and a girl falls in love. They dated over a year and one day, they have to attend a wedding. At the same time, that guy wants to introduce his girlfriend to his family. The girl doesn't know that he comes from extremely rich family. On the other side, the girl doesn't have a rich family background. The worst thing about that girl is her mother was having an affair with other guy because her husband hurted her and got a baby with that guy. That baby is Rachel. Because of that and that guy's mother thinks that she isn't good enough for her son, so, his mother doesn't agree they are dating. And then, blah, blah, blah, the mother finally agreed they are together which is the end.It's a love story and all is about romance. But the difference is that the director doesn't make audiences feel boring. Even I who hate dramas, romance and love stories, I can still watch it. So, it's quite good.One more thing I'd like to mention is the actings, especially the leading male actor, Henry. While watching this film, I haven't had a clue of he's just a television host and this one is his first movie ever acted in. I thought he's on this path a long time ago. He didn't seem like he's a newbie. His acting is so realistic and makes me think that he's a real pro. He's got a really cool acting skills.The only thing I don't like is that there's only a few part for Gemma. I wish I could see more parts of her.All in all, yeah, it's a great movie. It's totally worth spending time and money.",Crazy Rich Asians
95,mikayakatnt,Significant Cultural Movie for the West,9,13 January 2020,"A Cinderella-style Asian American rom-com that is full of money porn and materialism.Some areas felt as if I was watching an HBO documentary of the rich and famous. Yet, this movie does what it intends to do and it does it well.Though the storyline is shallow at best, I find the characters and setting refreshing. Some genuine laughs were to be had. Singapore stays as a constant throughout the story. Singapore's well-manicured image throughout the movie leaves one to wonder if the tourism board had some say in production.One glaring omission that bothered me was the lack of Malaysian/Indian-Singaporean representation. This surprised me. Singapore has done well in making sure that no ethnic group was left behind. But most American filmgoers will not notice this lack of representation.The conflict and message of the story are clear. Is American style individualism compatible with Asian style harmony and networks? The film does justice in showcasing the differences in the Asian-American/Asian experiences.But make no mistake about it, this is a rom-com that ends with a happily ever after. Don't expect questions about materialism, wealth, or poverty to come into play here. This is a happy movie.Though I had some issues with the shallow storyline, this movie is groundbreaking. It is nice to see Asian characters on the movie screen that are not stereotyped for once. To me, that means a lot.4.5/5. Hollywood, please take note. There is a market for these type of movies. Please, no more whitewashing films.",Crazy Rich Asians

His montage of introducing the boyfriends' family to our heroine talking into the camera, the special angles of the camera as well as the pronounced Kurosawa editing wipes show that Chu learned his lessons adeptly at USC.Scriptwriters Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim screenplay is brilliant in portraying Kevin Kuan's novel of the clash between the super rich and the rest of us commoners. Constance Wu's performance as the family-scorned girlfriend is Oscar worthy. And the cinematography of Vanja Cernjul is equally impressive, especially his photography of the beautifically-aesthetic wedding ceremony.I would wager CRA will be politic heavily for the Academy Awards Best Picture category.

Incredible wealth and jewellery and costumes that are both at times breathtaking and vulgar.
It's interesting to see the values and customs of incredibly wealthy Asian dynasties, not so very different from Downton Abbey I thought , the wealth ,matriarchs ,snobbery, ambition, schemes and intrigues are all on display wrapped up in gold leaf and sprinkled with five spice.

But it really wasnt anything new storewise, except that the protagonists where not caucasian but asian. I dont really get the hype. it was mild entertainment, sometimes even a bit slow moving also there were subplots that really did not really bring the movie forward.
Acting was often a bit stiff or to soap-opera-ish. I did like Constance Wu to some extends, especially in more serious scenes she really stood out. Same goes to Gemma Chan. I wasnt a big fan of Henry Golding at all s I did not buy his performance, and he was more a pretty face than just an interesting or inspiring character. Michelle Yeoh was good, no doubt. However it was on her best performance. The one that stood out most was Awkwafina who was actually the funniest performer and character. She really has a great comedic timing and her appearances in the film were among the most (and only) funny bits, that and the very promising opening. Nice romance, not always believable, rarely cliche-free. I did like the soundtrack and some of the images however. Great scenery of Singapore.",Crazy Rich Asians

105,CANpatbuck3664,Solid Rom-Com but Lacks any Game-Changing Element,7,10 September 2018,"If you're familiar with the book that inspired this movie, when you looked at the trailer, you were going over the characters or the difference between book and movie. The thing that caught my eye was the environment and style of the movie. Singapore is known for its unique architecture and style and with the movie being mainly filmed in Singapore and Malaysia, the setting is as much a character as Rachel or Nick. This movie captures these places beautifully and the movie flaunts how extravagant the lives of the social elite are. This is a strength of the movie, it has all the first-class trappings (with the decent sized budget and the unique settings) and it uses them to its advantage. I wasn't envious of the stars, but I couldn't help but appreciate how cool everything looked.The characters that populate the movie are a mix of the familiar with a couple of twists. Rachel is your fresh face in a new setting protagonist, but I liked how she was neither helpless or stupid. She's impressive in her own right (only movie I've seen where no one is impressed by a beautiful economics professor) and while she's vulnerable to the pressure, she isn't a flake or without any agency. Nick is your spoiled rich adult who is trying to find something real. This also isn't a new idea, but I liked how he was more compassionate and down-to-earth than your typical rich snob. He's still not a strong character but there were nice touches in his development. I'll cover Eleanor in another section but another character I liked was Astrid and the relationship she has with her husband (until the turn). She's wealthy and she has expensive taste, but she genuinely cares about the happiness of her family and her husband which was good considering how vapid and self-centred the rest of the supporting cast is.Crazy Rich Asians boasts not only a talented group of actors and actresses to fill out the cast, but it represents a step forward for diversity. There aren't many movies with all Asian actors/actresses, but they not only pull it off, they pull it off completely. Constance Wu is strong as Rachel, she's a little restricted by her character (it leads to a lot of typical fish-out-of-water comedy), but she's given enough, and she capably carries the movie. Henry Golding is pretty good for a newcomer as Nick Young. They never miss a chance to shoot him without a shirt on or to show off his looks, but this is par for the course and he's still decent as an actor. Michelle Yeoh is appropriately cold and steely as Eleanor, I wish she had gotten to show a little more vulnerability, but she got the job done. Awkwafina gets a couple of funny moments in this, it was a step up from her performance in Ocean's 8 for me. Gemma Chan was a standout for me as Astrid, I thought her subplot with her character and her husband had more honest emotion than the main arc and I liked her a lot. I also want to credit Nico Santos who is playing a stereotypical character, but he also had his share of funny moments.Most of my criticism that's directed against Crazy Rich Asians is stuff I would say about any formulaic romantic comedy. I was initially impressed that they weren't creating an over-the-top villain in Eleanor Young (not a spoiler, its in the trailer). They do show you her perspective and while I was never on her side, it was a departure from a typical genre cliché. This works until they push her into being a manipulative jerk just, so they have somewhere to go with the plot. This is one of the worst tropes of the genre and it just made me groan. The next thing is that while there are minor twists and turns, the big beats of the plot are predictable for Rachel and Nick. These aren't the biggest problems, but this movie has been hyped as ""The Return of the Rom-Com"" and I think when you strip away the charming cast and the fun visual sensibility and look at the story, its your same generic rom-com plot. That doesn't make the movie bad but with all the hype, I wanted something surprising or new with the story and Crazy Rich Asians doesn't deliver that element that could have pushed this to the next level.This is another case where the movie doesn't equal the sum of its parts. There's a charming cast, some effective humour sprinkled in and enough window dressing to keep anyone entertained. But the result is a solid but forgettable movie for me. This could also be a situation where my expectations were too high for this. There have been a couple of movies over the past few years where the hype has been relentless and full of hyperbole and yet all I see is a good movie that isn't the classic I thought I was in for. I liked this enough to recommend it, but I don't think its a must-see movie at a theatre. Catch this on your preferred streaming service if you haven't seen it in a theatre already.",Crazy Rich Asians
106,cliftonofun,Not just a romantic comedy,7,4 September 2018,"Without a doubt, this film matters. Hollywood's lack of Asian representation (both in front of and behind the camera) makes a story like this one important. Thankfully, I also happens to be good. The story is a fairly conventional romantic comedy set-up - formulaic and predictable, for sure. But almost every character feels real/complex, and the laughs flow from there. The biggest character of all? Singapore itself. The culture and cuisine are absolute stars, and they help a pretty standard romantic comedy to feel like something truly unique.

109,statuskuo,"Crazy Rich, Or Is It Crazy and Rich?",6,19 August 2018,"I concur with a lot of mid-level reviewers who see this as mindless fluff. And, well, they accomplished it. It's a beautiful looking place with beautiful (sometimes wealthy crass) people. It hits every trope, to the ""Pretty Woman"" make-over. But...so what? It satiates the place in rom-coms today that fears the corny. It is a late 80's early 90's nod to these movies (which oddly is a throwback to 50's rom-coms). Though not as buoyant and oftentimes heavy handed, it's predictable even in it's opening scene where Michelle Yeoh with children in tow are grossly discriminated against. Who couldn't guess she was a powerful person with powerful connections. A family doesn't simply stumble into this painfully posh luxury hotel. The rest, well...more of the same. Some un-even moments, such as when the cattiness rears its ugly head. Why not distance yourself from these manipulative people and go your own way around Singapore? She has a college friend whose family is wealthy (not crazy rich). Pretty unbelievable situation, but again...when has Audrey Hepburn ever been thought of as the daughter of a driver for rich people only to come back as a Parisian sophisticate.
So, if these things bother you, don't bother to see it. I only wished they didn't start with that London scene. But I do understand why, despite small world racism, globally, someone who has crazy rich money can buy you out and put you out on the street. If only the scene didn't feel so ham-fisted and vindictive (but it plays to Michelle Yeoh's character later, but is curious, considering she was treated as lower class and treats others the same).

Honestly, this thing is nothing but cliche'd romcom characters and situations, and I didn't even chuckle during any of it.

On the plus side, the actors (if you can even call them that) are very attractive, so the film is easy on the eyes.

It looked really dumb to me when I first saw the trailer but thought I'd see it. It's actually not that bad. It tells the story of Rachael Chu, played by Constance Wu, traveling with her boyfriend Nick Young, played by Henry Golding, to Singapore to a wedding. Rachael soon finds out that the Young family is super rich and she's nothing like them. Also Nick's mother Eleanor, Michelle Yeoh, is not pleased with Nick dating Rachael because she's not like them and she's what's keeping Nick in New York City and not their hometown. The performances were wonderful. Michelle Yeoh and Awkwafina were my favorite. Michelle played one of the coldest people and she made the audience hate her. She did it very well though. Awkwafina absolutely hilarious played Rachael's friend who is rich (not as rich as the Young family) and helps her with her problems including dressing. She was in Ocean's 8 and I thought she was one of the best parts. Needless to say she was the best part of this movie. Going back to the costumes, they were really good. Along with the makeup and hairstyling and the production design. I could potentially see nominations for Costume Design and Production Design at the Oscars. It was colorful and just appealing. The score had Asian songs and covers of songs that were beautiful and great. Loved that part. My problems with the movie was that it was very predictable. You could tell everything that was going to happen. Also it was pretty long running at 2 hours. There was a lot that could've been taken out like a side plot with a character named Astrid. Since this is the book series and there was a credit scene it looks to be that they're making another movie centering about her. I felt it to be unnecessary and it could've been its own thing. Maybe just a little bit of it but it wasn't that interesting and took away from the story. Crazy Rich Asians is a funny rom com that is pretty good for a rom com that is a nice happy feel movie.

119,ethanbresnett,Sweet and endearing from start to finish,8,5 April 2020,"Its hard not to fall in love with this film in some respect, its just so endlessly charming.First and foremost this comes from the cast. Henry Golding has such a great screen presence and is a fantastic leading man, handling the comedy, drama and romance equally well. The rest of the cast are also fantastic, with a particular nod to Awkwafina who completely steals the show whenever on screen. It is because of the tremendous cast that the relationship between Golding and Wu feels so real, with the chemistry between them really something special.Another great element of this movie is the plot. Its not too complicated at all , elegantly simple in fact. A man introduces his girlfriend to his family and they disapprove. A tale as old as time really and one that is presented and framed really well within the context of the Asian culture and the image that the family wishes to cultivate. There are also some interesting side plots which embellish the film and produce a well rounded and entertaining picture.What I would say is that Crazy Rich Asians never really had me belly laughing. It definitely sits more on the Rom than Com side of things. In all fairness comedies have to work pretty hard to crack me up so I'm not counting that against the film in the slightest, and in fact I really appreciate the direction this film went in its emotional parts. There were certain scenes which definitely had me in tears and if you're heart isn't warmed by the end of this film then it must truly be made of ice.A special mention also needs to made of the sound and costume teams. Particularly the former - there are two fantastic covers in Crazy Rich Asians (one of Coldplay's Yellow and one of Can't Help Falling in Love) which I have been listening to on repeat since watching it.There really is something for everybody in Crazy Rich Asians, but that's not at all to say that it is a lowest common denominator type film.

120,CineMuseFilms,"While we laugh at this film, it is laughing at us.",7,5 September 2018,"Cinderella is a popular trope in romantic comedy despite its innate sexism. Mix it together with Western unease over the surging might of Chinese capitalism, add a level of excess that even Baz Luhrmann would envy, and you have the core ingredients for the lightweight entertainment that is Crazy Rich Asians(2018).An ultra-simple plot and loads of visual opulence are the drawcards for this film. New York University academics Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) and Mick Young (Henry Golding) have been dating for a year when he invites her to meet his parents in Singapore. It is not until they board their business-class luxury lounge that Rachel suspects Mick and his family are very rich. When they arrive, she learns that Mick is from one of the wealthiest families in Asia. In every Cinderella story, there is a wicked witch: here it is Mick's imperious and disapproving mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh). The romance hits hurdles as Mick's family and friends do their best to send her packing. That's it.With such a thin narrative, what makes this film so entertaining? Certainly not the all-Asian American cast. In particular, thirty-something Rachel is unconvincing as a top-tier Professor of Economics, and Mick's 'deer-in-the-headlight' naivety makes him a limp Prince Charming. The comedy is pitched at chuckle level rather than belly laughs, except for one ridiculous scene. At a friend's wedding, the bride and her entourage walk down a water-canal aisle to be married in soaking shoes and water-logged gown: as if any bride in the world would do that. It is the one scene that most reveals the latent satirical streak running through the film: crazy rich Asians mocking crazy rich Americans. With 'punch a Yankee nose' gags about American values and an over-the-top display of opulent fashion, jewellery, cars, and homes bordering on fantasy, the film taunts those who are discomforted by the rise of the world's newest economic powerhouse.The cinematography takes teasing to another level. Close ups on glitzy trappings of extreme wealth; stunning travelogue shots of Singapore's hyper-modern architecture; close-frames on mouth-watering Asian cuisine in exciting marketplaces and grand mansions; all combine to make this film a visual treat. The messages are not only for Americans: the borderline gag calling Asian diaspora 'bananas' ('yellow outside, white inside') is a reminder that home beckons.As with all films, what you see depends on where you look. Most will enjoy the sparkly entertainment and see Rachel's 'love conquers all' story standing tall for all women. But bear in mind: while we laugh at the film it is laughing at us.",Crazy Rich Asians

124,Mike_Devine,"A fresh telling of a romantic story, cliches and all",6,21 January 2019,"One of 2018's breakout hits - 'Crazy Rich Asians' - really made a cultural impact and brought traditional Asian customs and references into the forefront. Based on the hit literary trilogy by Kevin Kwan, 'Asians' paints a picture of the seemingly wide divide between traditional Asian customs and Asian-American ideals, which is something that few films have ever done.Boasting a ""who's who"" cast of Asian-American actors, everyone from Ken Jeong to Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh to Gemma Chan. But it's Constance Wu who really steals the show as middle class American Rachel Chu, who is swept off her feet to Singapore where she joins her boyfriend (Henry Golding) for his cousin's wedding. Wu brings her role to life in a way that others could not, as the naive yet likeable Rachel is viewed almost as an exotic specimen when she bounces around between dinner parties and bachelorette excursions.But at its heart, 'Asians' is a classic love story, with all the cliches, twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. In this sense, the film is not anything truly groundbreaking from a story standpoint, but the setting and cast are enough to make it feel fresh and new. The infusion of Asian music, art and other cultural elements also help the audience feel like they are indeed part of the story.'Crazy Rich Asians' probably will not be remembered as an amazing movie, but its impact on cinema and what it accomplished for Asian-American actors and audiences will be recalled for a long time.",Crazy Rich Asians
125,daisukereds,It's fine. Even good.,7,12 January 2021,"An Old and over-the-top drama outside of reality (if something like this actually exists, I know nothing of it).
Sure, the romance might be a bit superficial, but the delivery from both leads (and mothers) make for a great relationship, emotions and scenes. It's a proper story, with a bit of pacing issues here and there, but locations, camerawork, setup and execution are all top notch. Even the editing is good (the email/messages bit at the beginning was well done, and an excellent way to tell something without saying anything).This is one of those movies that are led by the actors, and little else matters. Both Constance Wu and Henry Golding are very charming and work great together. They sell their little relationship. The spike and exaggeration are just context!Now, I don't understand the hate over this piece of ""fiction"". It is a movie! And the story developed just as they expected when it was written.

128,TheHonestCritic,"Is this a crazy rich movie? Or, a crazy stupid one? Check out my review below to find out!",4,14 June 2021,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018), before I get into my review, I just wanted to say this. I hate this ""film"" so much, that when I was coming up with my top ten list of my least favorite movies, this one almost made that list. Seriously, that's how bad this ""movie"" is to me. This is one of the most obnoxious and dumbest films I have ever seen in my life. This ""film"" has a predictable and boring storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to attempt to tie it all together. The plot is, a Chinese-American professor travels to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's family and then finds out that they're one of the richest families in the country. That's it, really, the whole story revolves around that. Yes, it's about as thin a plot thread as you can get. It's just a bunch of annoying people doing obnoxious things and during the majority of the ""movie"", next to nothing happens. I couldn't care less how rich these Asians are, I don't like any of the characters, which we'll get into more details with the acting in just a moment. The only somewhat interesting scene was the elaborate wedding with the water rushing through the aisle. That's a unique scene and it is beautifully shot. Unfortunately, it amounts to nothing and is not warranted in regards to the boring and predictable story. Another big issue is how obnoxious the majority of the characters are. For the most part, all they do is brag about how rich they are, they spew about having families, etc. The same old tropes we've heard and seen a million times before! How is that entertainment?! Believe it or not, this ""film"" is based off a novel. I've never read the novel before, maybe it's better than this ""movie""? Probably not, because if this ""movie"" is any indication, then the novel most likely sucks. Normally, in the field of book-to-screen adaptations, one is usually better than the other. Once in a while, both forms of media can actually be equally good, but that is rare. In the case of this ""film"" and book, it sounds like they're both garbage! As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the plot. One thing I hate in the aspect of horrible acting, is when they look like they're full of themselves with their ego taking over their well-being. A couple of them do look like they are trying with their performances, but overall, the acting is embarrassing! The soundtrack is about as generic as you can get. It adds nothing to the so-called story. Honestly, if you took the film score out of the ""movie"", it would be exactly the same, nothing would change. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2018. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a terrible waste of cinema. Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl! That was two hours of my life I'll never get back. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I even have to tell you to stay away from this pile of garbage of a ""film""? The sad thing is, there are people out there, including ""professional"" critics, that actually like it! As I mentioned, just because someone else likes or hates something, doesn't mean I have to. If you mirror someone else's opinions, then what good are yours? It just shows that their intelligence is outmatched by their stubbornness. All ""Crazy Rich Asians' does is make me wish I was rich. Did I mention that I hate this ""film""? I hope all of the characters in this ""movie"" go broke!",Crazy Rich Asians
129,gavinp9,"Assured, mostly-fun rom-com",7,26 August 2018,"'Crazy Rich Asians' is both very simple and subtly intricate, for a romantic comedy. The plot is pretty straightforward - Nick (Golding) & his girlfriend Rachel (Wu), live in New York and are visiting Singapore for Nick's friend's wedding. The trouble comes from Nick's mother, Eleanor (Yeoh) and the fact that he hasn't disclosed that he comes from an obscenely rich family and that everyone's going to be judging Rachel.There's plenty of things going on - mummy issues, historical Asian family traditions, culture vs modernity, being set almost exclusively in Singapore, rather than America - but it mostly boils down to the old adage of it's what's on the inside that counts. While there is some drama, family politics and serious moments - mostly with Eleanor, Astrid (Chan) & Michael (Png) - they're offset by the varied cast, with some great comedic moments from Peik Lin (Awkwafina), who steals the show in her scenes, Bernard (Yang), Eddie (Chieng) & Wye (Jeong).It's probably a little long at two hours, but the Singaporean/Malaysian scenery is great to see, as is the soundtrack, with Chinese versions of popular English songs. Both Golding and Wu are likeable leads, with good chemistry. Overall, it's a well-made & balanced film - not too stupid, not too sappy, not too unrealistic.",Crazy Rich Asians
130,thebricks,"Very unrealistic, bad movie with obnoxious characters",1,18 August 2018,"I knew this movie would be bad when it started out with Michelle Yeoh's character, Eleanor Young and her family getting turned away from a luxury hotel in London. No way this would have happened in 1995. They made it seem like her family were the first Asians the manager and desk clerk had ever seen. Hilarious! That would have been thousands a night out the door along with round-the-clock press coverage of this hotel engaging in racism against Asian customers, ensuring that hotel's demise. If you were too young to have been around in 1995, this never happened, I guarantee it.The cast was just terrible aside from Michelle Yeoh. Constance Wu was not believable as an NYU Economics professor. They had her act like she was some waitress from the Midwest unaccustomed to insanely rich, pompous people. I graduated from a pretty reputable university full of rich kids; she would not be uncomfortable in a crowd like that and she would be incredibly pompous herself.Henry Golding and Rachel had zero chemistry. They had zero in common. There's no way she could have been dating him so long and not known his family was rich. Incredibly unbelievable that it would dawn on her at the airport. He would have a ridiculous apartment in NYC as well as a nice car. Plus, there is this thing called Google. No way she or her family wouldn't have done research or a random person wouldn't have said anything to her, especially at NYU!The scene at the wedding where Nick's grandmother and mother confront Rachel about her family's past was ridiculous. In reality, for an American like her, she would have laughed and said ""That's it? What's the big deal?"" What did it have to do with her? Absolutely nothing. After they pressed it, any real person would have marched right out and gotten on the next plane home. The end.For a movie that was supposed to prove Asians could hold their own in the box office, I was very disappointed. Awkwafina, as always, was cringe-worthy. Gemma Chan forgot she wasn't still on the set of Humans and not playing a robot anymore. Henry Golding has the personality of cardboard. The only memorable performances came from Michelle Yeoh, Calvin Wong and Nico Santos.The ending was absolutely cliche. Being a chick flick, I understand they couldn't do anything edgy, but they really should have. I applauded when Rachel left the wedding, and it should have ended like that. Can't recommend.",Crazy Rich Asians

138,kaptenvideo-89875,"If ""50 Shades"" was a sexless rom-com with Asians instead of Caucasians...",4,27 October 2018,"How I wanted to like this movie! I am partial to American mainstream comedies in general, and the idea of adding rich Asians twist to this type of mayhem seemed liked a great idea.""Crazy Rich Asians"" does add that twist but as it turns out, it's not exactly a comedy we have here. Yes, the trailers and other promotions present it as such but in reality, if we're to talk about genres, it's not exactly anything.Many recent TV/web series and movies have taught us that not clinging to a genre may be a good thing, helping to achieve extra authenticity and relatability.In this case, however, the result would probably improve by having a clear vision of what it wants to be. As it is, I can only call the movie numb and perplexing, and overall rather off-putting.The general storyline is straight outta mainstream rom-coms. A boy and a girl are happy together, then something bad happens and the pretty facades crumbles, until they find a way to deal with it.The problem is the boy's family who turn out to be super rich living in their own glamorous bubble, and they don't like the idea of some nobody stealing their precious son who's supposed to continue building on everything they represent.I know, judging by this summary, there seems to be no serious problem with the whole thing. It's an entertainment after all, etc.But the actual level of writing is so cliched, basic, and lacking anything remotely interesting that stretching it all over two hours seems unbelievable, at least in hindsight.The actual experience is like a pale shadow of some soap opera, with plenty of beautiful things and glamour but lacking any of the emotion, suspense, or passion.The tone is so heavily sugarcoated that it drains away any chance of bonding with or relating to any of the characters. There's never a real conflict to build some interest on.Also, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" may be the most uneffective mainstream movie ever in using supporting characters as comic relief.There are at least four characters meant specifically for that but the jokes are so seldom, lifeless and/or charmless that it feels a bit embarrassing to watch.What's so hilarious about Asian woman fast talking like a high-pitched black man, for example? The actress doing this has an awesome artist name, though: Awkwafina.During the two hour movie, I only laughed once - when somebody compared somebody else's colorful clothing to clown's tampon.Honestly, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" doesn't even feel like a proper movie but rather a pilot for unsold TV comedy series. It's all about introducing the setting and characters rather than giving anybody something interesting to do or say.But despite all this, I had a strong feeling that the movie works pretty well for some - as a kind of fast food entertainment product.The late director Garry Marshall did something similar with his ""Valentine's Day"" / ""New Year's Eve"" / ""Mothers Day"" trilogy... only this time there's even more saccharine and mind-numbing niceness, if you can believe that.Picturing it as not a movie but comfort food, it's easy to imagine there's a grateful audience for ""Crazy Rich Asians"" which will lap everything up greedily, and is equally happy with inevitable sequels offering exactly the same.This could basically be the same audience that loves ""50 Shades of Grey"" (the books, the movies, or both) but can do without the ""sensuality"" the E.L. James-created series is famous for.Excluding the sex-related stuff, the basic building blocks are exactly the same. There's a cool guy who also looks good, adores the girl in every way possible, can't get enough of her, and can't even think of living without her - even if the viewer can't actually see what's so extra special about said girl. And of course he turns out to be super rich as well.If THIS doesn't have an effect on a small princess living in you, regardless of your age or sex, then nothing will.The princess in me has left for a vacation or something, so it didn't work for me. I find ""Crazy Rich Asians"" too ham-fisted, boring, and sparkless to anything more than a waste of perfectly good two hours.But judging by high scores at Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, I suspect I'm in the minority here.",Crazy Rich Asians

Their way of acting is that kind of exaggerating type, like that in a drama on stage. My appreciation is specially given to Yeong, who acts as the mother of male lead. Not long before she is a Bond girl. She is so elegant, with superb acting skill. The prettiest woud-be mother
In law.The dresses of the female leads are beautiful, elegant and well chosen. The big houses are grandly furnished and decorated. The way of gossip spread through probably whatsap while the male lead is seen with a girl friend is funny.The movie would be better if it is a sad ending.

Having read some of them, I believe that most users looked at this film rather superficially, whereas to me this film actually deplores shallowness and rich people showing off their wealth. We are supposed to view things and the rest of the characters from Constance Wu's character's point of view. We feel her awkwardness and insecurities towards these rich people's awful ostentatious display. In a sense we are Rachel Chu, and we see and interpret things from her perspective. That's the way I thought of it, anyway.Putting that aside, in my opinion it was a bit predictable, but that didn't spoil the experience of Rachel's journey through the ups and downs of finding love. There were some romantic scenes which were done tastefully; felt real and tender. It's hard to come up with original plots or twists when it comes to this kind of movies, so you sort of have to take them for what they are. And to me this was acceptable, taking into account that all the luxury and wealth exhibited in the film didn't really bother me; I don't think that rich people are the main target for this movie, I find that utterly ridiculous. Normal people are outsiders to such flaunty lifestyle, that's why we should watch this movie through Rachel Chu's eyes, it makes much more sense than to just feel outright outrage and to judge the movie almost entirely based on that single notion.Anyhow, I enjoyed this movie, it wasn't amazing or mesmerizing, but it entertained me for a couple of hours.",Crazy Rich Asians

The basic premises of the film is that Constance Wu's Rachel Chu is brought to Singapore by her boyfriend to discover a whole host of over the top family members and friends who all share the common trait of being extremely rich and must try to co-exist and fit into the family. This is a premiss that doesn't sound to unfamiliar however, the distinction of being in a culture that is unfamiliar to American audiences and to the Hollywood industry means that there is a lot of freshness and nuance to the genre despite its generic premiss. The spin on the classic 'fish out of water' romcoms much like Ben Stiller's ""Meet the Parents"" makes this film a lot more vibrant and interesting.However, by no means am I suggesting that the film is only great because it features a different culture but that this point is one that elevates the genre. If the film were to be poorly acted it would've still been a bust. Luckily, this film had a brilliant cast who all delivers brilliant performances, there was charm and relatability in the acting that makes this film resonate deeply with audiences. From the main cast to the support all brought to the table something that is new and interesting because they play their roles so well. Even characters who are very two dimensional were able to flesh out their character traits in a unique way that can almost only be portrayed by them (I will not name them here to avoid spoilers).

What surprised me the most about the film was the phenomenal, and fairly untapped, acting talent from the entire cast. Constance Wu was absolutely perfect. It was difficult to praise any one performance besides hers because everyone was so genuinely great. I believe this speaks on the state of Hollywood and portraying Asians in primary roles. So many Asians actors and actresses are limited to supporting roles, so I hope that the break out cast of Crazy Rich Asians shows future movie makers that there is unbelievable untapped potential in the acting market. As the credits were rolling, I found myself feeling so happy and I could not quite put a finger on what was making me feel this way.

Nearly every cast member serves a contrasting purpose to the film's entirety, each featuring unique charisma-all though Jimmy O. Yang was vastly underutilized (I needed way more screen time from him, he is a hilarious actor/comedian)-which allows the story to feel lucrative since there are so many sides and perspectives interlinked within its breathless tale. It's directed with a fashion that channels into the dramatic yet fast-paced, and dazzling spirit, and presents enough of this galore to satisfy viewers of its ""rich"" category. If I had to pinpoint one major flaw, the first act of this film was quite jarring especially since the film bounces back and fourth between like 100 character introductions-which had me worried for a while. Gracefully the movie picks up steam afterwords with a more consistent and flowing pace. Crazy Rich Asians features the typical ""Family VS True Love"" formula but emboldens it with a more heated curve that makes its entirety indeed, fresh and worthwhile. (Verdict: B)",Crazy Rich Asians
148,spasek,"Formulaic, Predictable Film That Actually Works...Until the End",7,20 December 2018,"Some of the best romantic comedies are those that stand alone. They don't rely on cheap gimmicks and plot holes to make the film work. They are also very different from your ""typical"" romantic comedy. ""Roman Holiday"" is my all-time favorite. And yes, the end does not follow the norm for this genre. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is another. And while the end is predictable, the joy is in the wonderful journey of the two characters, which do not follow the typical norm for this genre.I've lived in China, Korea, and now Taiwan. I know the cultures pretty well. Status is huge for Asian people. And yes, parents are incredibly controlling and manipulative. I'm an ESL teacher, so I deal with them quite often. Asian girls, more than Asian boys, pretty much have their lives planned out, for the most part. There is really no individuality that is passed down, although I've been around long enough to see some parents go completely the other way and vow to give their child anything and everything to make up what they, themselves, didn't get.The movie has some good laughs here and there, and we get a pretty good look at a culture that is very typical of most Asians. Yes, you marry up, not down. Yes, the dream for many families is that you marry into a rich family or a family that is certainly well-off. Also, getting an Asian mother to change her viewpoint on something...well, you'd have a greater chance of getting struck by lightning while being bitten by a shark.The writers dare to show all that is beautiful and horrible about Asian cultures. Make no mistake, all cultures have their pros and cons, to be sure. But, Western cultures have long been enamored with Asian cultures because most lack any real idea about what it's like. Being a tourist isn't enough. You have to live among them to really know. So, we're given the beauty marks and the pimples.For the most part, we have seen the same thing in so many romantic comedies. A couple go to a wedding, and of course, one of them is not accepted by the other's family. The persecuted character typically has one or two allies in his/her corner, but ultimately, it isn't enough. But, the actors do a good enough job to help us care about what happens, despite the all-too-familiar story.The movie had a chance to really do something different with the ending. If you've seen enough of these films, you already know how it's going to end before you even watch the movie. There was a moment near the end when I was hoping that the writers would break the mold and dare to do something different. Perhaps they don't get together in the end. Perhaps they realize that they are from two different worlds. Perhaps one isn't willing to play the familial status games because integrity and being who you are is more important.If the film had gone down that ""road less traveled by,"" then I think we would have seen something very special as well as making a powerful statement to those who stubbornly believe in unwavering tradition and status as being one's entire world. Or that only a rich person can make you happy. Either way, the ending for me was a letdown, because the writers decided to take the road that so many films before it have already gone down. Hallmark's entire movie line-up makes this formula their Bible!Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, and on average, it's better than many of the genre. The performances are almost all very well done. But, a real opportunity was also missed, and that is what is truly tragic about ""Crazy Rich Asians.""",Crazy Rich Asians
149,LukeCustomer2,All I heard was how great this was... and romantic,1,25 April 2019,"But the actual reality is that it is a propaganda piece. It clearly was meant to make Americans think that asians / china is where it is at. That even though China is a communist country somehow we are to think that the people there are crazy rich. And, you can be too. Now I know there are really some super rich in Asia..they keep buying real estate in the USA...that is far from what it is like in most of Asia. The story concerns an American asian who is apparently in love with the son of a super rich family (who of course slums in in NYC). But that being said, there is nothing about this couple who makes me think they are in love. They are just together and, somehow, this woman has never googled her boyfriend. Romantic? Hardly. Of course she goes to Singapore and sees the massive riches of this family but mom doesn't like her. Why? No real reason. I ended up turning it off. People talk about Asian culture and perhaps this is how it really is... but I don't believe it and I don't want to see it. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. NOTHING. If mom doesn't like you, who really cares. You will be living in the USA. But I didn't want to root for the girl anyway as I didn't believe almost anything about the couple. Overall, it just was a way to drum up tourism and make ""asian"" culture seem like an opulent one you want to be part of.",Crazy Rich Asians

151,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Hope the box office is Crazy Rich...,8,20 August 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very charming, funny and touching. What I think really stood out to me was Constance Wu's performance. I know the Best Actress race is gonna be stacked this year, but I honestly think she deserves a spot there. She's that good. And Henry Golding was just the perfect pick to be the romantic lead. He was charming and sexy. Michelle Yeoh was really good too. She was a little more subtle but I think her character was meant to come off that way. She's supposed to be stoic, but you could get hints of what she was feeling through her eyes, so Michelle did really well. There is a lot of laughs through Awkafina and Ken Jeong's characters. Sometimes, it was a bit too over the top, but overall I thought their inclusions were funny. And even though the film follows these crazy rich people (something I probably will never actually experience in my life) you can still relate to them and empathize with them. Even though, I did enjoy the film, I can't say its a perfect film. It does follow some familiar rom-com beats and so at times you can predict what will happen next. Plus, I kind of wish that Nick's father had an actual role in this. For a film that is so family oriented, it just seemed weird not to include him or show that dynamic. I get he's a businessman and therefore busy, but I just wish he was included in some way. And even though I loved Gemma Chan's character (Astrid) and it was great that she had that ""Im a strong woman"" moment of her walking out at the end, I kind of had hoped that her husband was going to fight more for their relationship, because I actually liked their dynamic and I liked that he was a underdog in this family like Rachel was. But some of those things were just small nitpicks. Overall, its a fun movie. I enjoyed it and its nice to see a good rom-com come out again.",Crazy Rich Asians

153,Jared_Andrews,"Perfectly Fine, But a bit Overhyped",7,25 August 2018,"'Crazy Rich Asians' is garnering mountains of praise, some of it is totally justifiable and some a bit more dubious. For making a U.S. movie with an all-Asian cast, it deserves commendation. For decades, Asians have been underrepresented (or flat out not represented) in American cinema, so this cast is a welcome sight. As far as the dubious praise-I just want to manage expectations. This is a perfectly adequate rom-com. But it's being billed as an all-time classic, which is unfair to viewers and to the movie, itself. Look, I liked it, okay? It's FINE. The story flows along at a leisurely yet comfortable pace, as we meet the starring couple, and he invites her to his home in Singapore for his brother's wedding. The two characters are likable enough, as are the actors playing them, especially Constance Wu-she's spectacular. Wu plays Rachel Chu, who finds out on the plane ride to Singapore that her boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding) comes from one of the wealthiest families in the world. Rachel sees their house and their lifestyle. She's awed but not enamored. The world of decadence and luxury isn't something she needs or something that she even seems all that interested in. The filmmakers, on the other hand, cannot get enough of the glamour. Sweeping shot after sweeping shot of a giant ship and a giant house and a giant rooftop party loses its impact after a while. Yeah, these people are rich, we get it. But, that's the life they lead, and they are proud of it. Nick's family immediately judges Rachel harshly, looking down on her for any reason they can find (not that any of the reasons are good ones). Basically, they're snobs, some of them. Nick certainly is not and neither is his sister, so there's hope for the upcoming generations of the family. But it's Nick's stuffy mother and traditionalist grandmother who insist that Rachel isn't right for him. The film's strength's lie in the character building and in the dialogue, which aids the character building. Every character feels realistic and thoughtfully written. In addition to Nick's family and friends, Rachel also meets the family members of her college roommate (Awkwafina, funny but a tad overhyped), who are new-money rich and hilarious. Ken Jeong, playing the dad, slays with every line, including the doozy, ""finish your food-there are starving kids in America!"" Throughout the story we're treated to quotable lines, like that one, in both funny and emotional context. The movie knows when to get serious and how to do it. So, what didn't I like? For one, there's a character that's supposed to be creepy-funny, but is actually creepy-creepy. That's a nitpick, I know. There are larger flaws, but I don't want to mention them in much detail because they're spoilery. There's a bonding moment between Rachel and Nick's sister that happens far too abruptly and didn't feel deserved. There some small details that don't make sense when given a touch a scrutiny. There's also a massive issue with the story's resolution, once again, because it's too abrupt. I can't decide if it's laziness, mediocre writing, or a choice made to set up the sequels (it's probably the last one). I'll reiterate: I liked this movie. It's perfectly fine. If there's a sequel, I'll definitely see it. I just don't view it as an instant classic, as some viewers would have you believe.",Crazy Rich Asians
154,lyubitelfilmov,The story of an Asian Cinderella or the Rich also cry!,8,2 June 2020,"Romantic comedy. A film adaptation of the novel of the same name by American writer of Singaporean origin Kevin Kwan. This picture attracted my attention with the participation of Henry Golding, Tom from my favorite Christmas for Two picture, and that crazy popularity and excellent box office in American and international box office. Agree, two such reasons are a great reason to see what the Americans took off there. Yes, the picture is American, but almost all the actors are Asians. I have not read the book yet, but have already bought it and now it lies on my bookshelf and is waiting in the wings, so I will consider the film adaptation as a whole work. It's just that I have the rule ""first I watch a movie - then I read a book"". I just made this rule when I got into a big deal with Roman Polansky's Oliver Twist. I first read the book, and then - looked at the picture - and was very disappointed. And you know, after watching ""Crazy Rich Asians"" the desire to read a book only strengthened. It's a long introduction, forgive me, and let me give you my brief opinion - the rich also cry! As in any picture, there are both pros and cons, and I intend to consider them all. I want to say right away that in Asian culture I understand the level of an amateur, therefore I evaluate it exclusively from my bell tower, if you have any clarifications, clarifications - you are welcome to comment. In the meantime, let me get started.
So, the pros:
1. Singapore - Kevin Kwan, the author of the book, hails from this amazing city, and therefore the film adaptation was not supposed to hit the face in the dirt, showing it in all its glory. In fact, this whole two-hour picture is one of Singapore's majestic advertising - and it works. I already want to go there now, but finances, closed borders and coronavirus are brutal reality hitting rampant fantasies. Just think about it - until the seventies of the twentieth century, Singapore was the most dangerous city on our planet, street crime, robbery, murder, smuggling - it was the criminal capital of Southeast Asia, and now Singapore is the safest, richest, most fashionable, the most famous city not only of Asia, but of the whole world. For twenty years, turning the minus to the plus is just a miracle that has a name - Lee Kuan Yu. In the picture, Singapore is represented in all its glory - the most famous hotels, skyscrapers, sights, customs - you will find all this here. The operator very successfully hooks up the best angles so that the viewer wants to come to this magical city.
2. Wealth - the picture lets viewers into the house of the richest and most influential families of Singapore - the Yangs, who are so rich that only Abramovich, well, and a couple more people can compete with them. The author of the book himself is a man from this world, so he knows what he wrote about. They have money - chickens do not peck, but they cry the same. Behind all this ostentatious gloss, ordinary human passions are hidden - intrigue, love, betrayal, tears. And it was not in vain that I said in one of the reviews that the rich envy the poor, and the poor envy the rich. To have a lot of money is certainly good, we all strive for it, we will be honest even to ourselves, and I want to be rich. But, having become rich, we must not lose the most precious thing that is in us - it is a soul and a good heart, otherwise wealth will become our curse.
3. Touching moments - as in any romantic comedy, without it - just nowhere. I can't say that they all turned out successful, I won't say that they touched my heart - but the fact that they work is a fact.
4. Humor - it is not very much and a lot in the picture, which slightly surprised me. There are practically no rush moments, I personally amused one. All the rest of the humor caused me a slight smile from the idiotic antics of some heroes.
5. The scene of the game of mahjong - it was not in the book (if they did not lie to me). She is perhaps the most memorable of the whole picture. She is full of symbolism, very emotional and elegant in some way. Indeed, between the poor and the rich there are only two barriers - money and a heart of stone.
So cons:
1. A simple story - the picture tells the story of a modern Asian Cinderella - an American of Chinese descent and an heir to a wealthy family. The guy takes her to Singapore, to his family's house for the sake of meeting - his family, to put it mildly, was not enthusiastic, although not all - and then you know this story. All turns can be predicted in advance, the finale is obvious from the very beginning. So why is this a minus? Just closer to the finale there comes a moment after which the whole story could end on a completely different note, but a miracle did not happen - a banality. The spectator was lured by an unexpected person, and then they threw the latter out of the window.
2. ""Glamorous world"" - if you understand the bags and clothes of famous and expensive brands, the latest fashion and so on - you will get incomparable pleasure from this picture. This world is completely uninteresting to me, therefore - this is a well-deserved minus.
A little about the main characters:
1. Rachel Chu performed by Constance Wu is a poor American of Chinese descent who fell in love with an ordinary guy who turned out to be the most enviable Asian groom. Going with him to Singapore, she will have to learn the peak of the ""glamorous world"", the customs of a strict family and understand herself and understand if she can cope with all this. Constance pretty confidently performed this role. You look at her and you see in front of you an insecure and dreamy girl who suddenly found herself in this world inaccessible to ordinary mortals. Well done.
2. Nick Young, played by Henry Golding, is Rachel's guy who pretends to be poor for love. After a series of trials, she finally understands that she loves her with all her heart and is ready for everything for her, even for the most desperate step. Henry again pleased me, his Tom from the ""Last Christmas"" captivated me, his Dry Eye from the ""Gentlemen"" pretty amused, but here - he is clearly in place. Thanks to the magical and wonderful painting ""Last Christmas"", which opened for me this wonderful actor!
3. Eleanor Sung Young performed by Michelle Yeo - Nick's domineering and proud mother, who instantly disliked Rachel. He manifests himself as a real tyrant and dictator, although not everything is in order with her life story. The image of Michelle here is so strongly contrasted with the image of Santa from ""Last Christmas"", that can only praise this wonderful actress for acting. Bravo Michelle!
And here Ken Zhong also lit up, yes, the same grumpy from ""The Hangover"" and even heaps of comedies of different quality - and he plays here absolutely at the level of these comedies - he pokes his eyes and jokes stupidly.
This picture did not get to Russia due to reasons that I am too lazy to find out in China - in general, failed. But given the budget (thirty million) and the general fees (two hundred and forty), the success was complete. The book has two sequels, the second is already translated into Russian. The box-office success was supposed to guarantee the continuation of the shoot - but two years have already passed - and it is gone. Why? Unknown But if he doesn't exist, then maybe it's for the best, because we never needed to continue Cinderella, right? ""And they lived happily ever after, until the end of their days!""
As a result, we have a good romantic comedy, moreover, a film adaptation, with a simple history of a modern Asian Cinderella, a good mood, great views of Singapore and great acting!",Crazy Rich Asians

Sometimes there asian in American movies but not as much as this movie. I loved that it was set in Singapore. I also loved that all the problems in this now was caused by the dude parents instead of the dude being an idiot. That was a nice change for one. It did do the Rich's poor troupe but the movie did that well. I loved when the women he dating goes up to the mother while playing a game of mahjong and was like just think your son can marry anyone but make sure you remember if was the one that made it possible or something like that is what she said. I really did like ray scene a lot. The plot, storyline, character development, characters were all good. I recommend this story to everyone no matter the age.

160,hunter-friesen,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" Hits and Misses",6,27 September 2018,"Rachel Chu and Nick Young have been together for over a year now and couldn't be happier. Both of them are professors at NYU, which is how they first met. One day, Nick asks Rachel to come with him to Singapore for his best friend's wedding, with the added bonus of meeting his family. Thinking she knows everything about Nick, Rachel agrees to go on the trip. Except there's one thing she doesn't know: Nick's family is rich, ""crazy rich"" in fact. Caught off guard by this, Rachel is unknowingly thrust into a new world of luxury and spectacle, one that is a far cry from her modest upbringing. Despite the challenge, she's determined to be at Nick's side and to make a good first impression to his family.Directed by Hollywood journeyman Jon M. Chu, the film's biggest problems mostly all stem from his lackluster directing. Chu doesn't bring any originality to the finished project and mainly just uses every rom-com cliché in the book, such as the tough parental figure, comedic sidekick, wacky relatives, and will-they-or-won't-they plotline between the two leads. Chu also struggles to provide a sense of balance in terms of pacing and plots. The pacing is inconsistent throughout. The beginning of the film quickly shifts from scene to scene as we set up the story and characters. After that things slow way down and we tediously crawl to the end. Apart from the main plot, there is also a subplot featuring Nick's cousin, Astrid. While she's a good character overall, her story is very unnecessary and continually gets dropped and picked back up at odd times. On a bright note, Chu does impeccable work during the wedding sequence. It's easily the most heart-tugging part of the film as the two main characters share a loving connection. Writers Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim do a fair job at adapting from the original bestselling novel.They do a great job at making the lead character very likable and relatable. Rachel isn't your average rom-com woman whose life is in shambles until she meets a guy. It's refreshing to see a lead female character have her life together and not have to rely on some guy in order to be happy. The screenplay also fits in a good amount of quality jokes, a lot of which come from Awkwafina's character. Unfortunately, just like the directing, the biggest problem is the overabundance of clichés. It's a shame that for a screenplay to have such a great lead character and then repeatedly bury her with the same old tropes we've seen time and time again.Because of the large cast of characters, the film boasts both good and bad performances. Constance Wu does a great job as Rachel Chu. She makes herself relatable and confidently holds her own throughout. She also shares electric chemistry with both Golding and Awkwafina. Opposite Wu is Henry Golding as Nick Young. Golding does very well, especially when considering that this is his acting debut. He's at his best when with his on-screen partner and adds a lot of charm to his role. Having already done great work in this year's ""Ocean's Eight"", Awkwafina gives another hilarious supporting performance here. Playing Rachel's roommate from college, she constantly delivers the best jokes, with most of them coming off as improvised. Some minor supporting actors suffer from Chu's poor directing and have to resort to overacting in order for us to like them. The biggest losers from this are Ken Jeong and Jimmy O. Yang. Their characters are way too over the top and are annoying as soon as we meet them.""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a film that mostly suffers from poor directing and a formulaic story that lacks any sort of originality. Still, it's better than most modern romantic comedies and the reliable trio of Wu, Golding, and Awkwafina make this film a moderately enjoyable ride.",Crazy Rich Asians
161,lia00027,Too Exaggerating Of a Movie,4,23 September 2018,"What the heck is my first impression when I was watching the beginning of the movie. The movie opened where a Chinese families consist of a young boy and girl with their moms entering a private reserve hotel turned out their staffs are racist and didn't allow the Chinese families to go to their reservation room including using their phone, when Michelle Yeoh's character calling her hubby to tell-tale the incident hmmmm not longer than 10 minutes the Chinese families became the owner of the hotel. That is only the beginning of the movie, throughout the scenes audiences will be treated with the life-style of the riches not to mention how they behave in front and back from the eye of public. The characters that the actors were trying to bring out are weak except for the actress who was acting as ""Astrid"" and Michelle Yeoh. As for the main couple they are showing me weak acting which I feel that are they really actors??? Anyway the plot is weak and the story is nothing special its a Cinderella fairy tale but of course in modern time well if you compare to Selena Gomez's Cinderella story I'd choose the later one.To sum up when people and media keep mentioning how good the movie is it turns out to be an exaggeration and this movie is just promoting Singapore to the core.",Crazy Rich Asians

166,The_Orenda,A romantic comedy in the right direction.,8,12 February 2019,"When the Oscars were announced, one movie stood above all others on the snub list. The underlying essence of increasing the number of Best Picture nominees north of five was that there were not enough 'mainstream' movies represented to 'mainstream' audiences, hurting viewership. And granted, Jon M. Chu's vision of Kevin Kwan's novel is by no means a tour de force (we are talking a rom-com here), Crazy Rich Asians provides a diverse, mainstream look of what Kwan was trying to achieve: contemporary Asia.So what originally returned me to writing reviews was one performance that stood out among them all: Michelle Yeoh. How could Penelope Cruz win an Oscar representing her culture and yet the presence and power displayed by Yeoh's Eleanor, carrying literally everyone on the screen with her (especially Constance Wu), come up short? The presence commanded from Yeoh's role really held court and is essentially the glue that keeps Crazy Rish Asians from dissolving into the fluff most accuse it of.Crazy Rich Asians may be a romantic comedy, and those who know, know well how history treats them, but the movie succeeds in showing Kwan's vision. The level of effort, despite heavy limitations, shows that everyone knows what was at stake here, and I laud the movie for that. Enough to say that Crazy Rich Asians was contemporary enough, was diverse enough, to stand with others at the biggest show.",Crazy Rich Asians

This movie is even more funny if you are Asian as some of the jokes will pertain to the funny culture of Asian people (for example, everybody you meet who is older than you are either your ""uncle,"" or your ""aunt,"" even if they are not related to you).The story follows a basic structure of; boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl has problems and fall out of love, boy and girl fall in love again and everything ends perfect for both of them. It doesn't change too much but they did do some stuff at the end that kinda caught me off guard. The Singapore setting is great and it makes you wanna go there.Yeoh, and the rest of the cast are good. Ken jeong has some funny lines but at the same time, some of his line were not funny. The comedy is mostly funny, although there are some scenes that just was not funny. Awkwafina is the highlight and she has the funniest and best scenes in the movie. Jimmy O Yang is good too but he only appears briefly. There are other actors and actresses from Britain and Hong Kong who are good but don't get much story.It has been a long time since Asian people got a movie that actually showed Asian culture. Remember ""Ghost in the Shell,"" where Scarlett Johansson played a Japanese lady who gets her brain inserted into a White lady? Remember ""Cloud Atlast,"" where White actors played Asian people by putting on makeup that made their eyes super slanty? Even if you are not a fan of romantic comedies (Like me), you should still support this movie so that stuff like ""Ghost in the Shell,"" don't happen again. The movie is good, even though it may be a bit too sappy and romantic for me. Go watch it, and if you ASIAN, Ya'll better go support this film. Black Americans supports ""Black Panther,"" now ASIANS, get yo butt out the door and watch this movie.",Crazy Rich Asians

177,samyoung-82648,"Funny at times, some good characterisation - too politically correct",6,7 November 2018,"I've read many of the reviews. In summary: OMG, not enough Asians, too many Asians, not the right type of Asians, they're too poor, too rich. Most of the reviews are divisive - I must define myself as Asian. Get over it, seriously. You've got to stop listening to the newspapers and TVs. Start seeing people we we used to (and no longer can thanks to the entire main stream media)The film is light-hearted. It pokes fun at the wealthy and woe-is-me for the poor. Many of the wealthy characters are superficial and confrontational (and i'd say this is realistic based on my own life experiences). Rachel and Nick were well played by Constance Wu and Henry Golding. Nick, whilst loveable, is just a little too far fetched.What I found most enjoyable was the scenery, the music, most of the acting and some of the characterisation (eg. Nick's Grandma and his mother and their complicated relationship).This film is politically correct (eg. the first 5 minutes are the usual nauseating Hollywood garbage we are being fed in the last 5 years - with extra scoopings of revisionist history) and it frames a low expectation for the rest of the movie without any benefit other than stereo-typing and identity politics (ie. the modern Hollywood has made an art of it). Without the PC tripe, i'd probably rate the film an 8 because it's a good escape from reality and fairly easy going.Having said that it's politically correct, the people I expect to like this film the least are the politically correct. Implying that women like shopping and fashion, discussing a career vs a family and saying you can't have both ... these things would have you publicly executed in today's ""liberal"" media. When our media is so intolerant and extreme, it's nice to see some lightheartedness coming through.If you're not racist, not politically correct and you want some light entertainment that's well put together, this is worth a watch.",Crazy Rich Asians

What she doesn't know is that her Chinese boyfriend is related to one of the oldest, richest families in Asia. Like, ""Crazy Rich."" Cue the setting for drunken or spoiled billionaires, jealous would-be girlfriends and judgmental parents. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a funny, clever, upbeat, feel-good movie.Most of the dialogue is in English and where required the Chinese is subtitled. I thought the boyfriend's English-American accent was too good but I got used to it. The scenery and setting is fine, camera work is good, production values are high and it is nicely scripted. I really liked the slow reveal of gross wealth and the makeover scene was nice, though her final outfit is only so-so.There is occasional bad language and mild sexual references. The comedy ranges from witty to farce while the romance is gentle. You won't be crying with laughter or emotion but it is good.Children won't enjoy this much. Everyone else will get something out of it even if it's only brownie points from your own girlfriend.I really don't understand why there are so many 1/10 reviews. It's like there is a witch hunt. Is it because there is no 'token' American? Is it because when they said 'Asia' that India is expected? Is it the shocking realisation that other countries can be racist too?

180,jakob13,Flourishing in a rising economic universe of Singapore and decline of the West,10,20 August 2018,"Jon M. Chu's 'Crazy Rich Asians', based on Kevin Kwang's best selling book, is highly enjoyable and amusing.
Reviews saw a Jane Austen 'Pride and Prejudice' influence. For Old Time Radio mavens the film echoes 'Our Gal Sunday': an never ending saga of an orphan girl from a mining town in the West, who marries a rich British lord.
To me, it strangely recalled Viscontini's 'The Leopard'. Kwan's novel (one of a trilogy) is affected by, at the same time, melancholia and an appreciation of wealth, good food, drink and the special privileges of money obtains.
And of course, in spite of false perceptions of what is Chinese, 'Crazy Rich Asians' has a touch of Cinderella.
Whites, Malays, Indians matter little in Kwan's universe. It is the the description of an edifice of the financial center that the Chinese immigrants have turned Singapore into, as a Crown Colony and more importantly under the guidance of Lee Kwang Yew and his People's Action Party, that lifted a poor The West called a 'Tiger economy'.
'Crazy Rich Asians', at a gallop, embellishes, without a blush of exaggeration, the opportunities and the authority and immunity from mundane society taboos, but not Confucian hierarchy, the prerogatives of staus and rank, and in the case of the Youngs, to the manor born.
In a way Kwan whose own world he describes with tongue in cheek perhaps, is what China and Singapore and Korea and India represents as power and wealth have shifted from the West to the East.
'Crazy Rich Asians', the story line is done with a light, farsical hand. It is film that well uses the underused talent of the Chinese diaspora. And we know how the denouement will work out.
The film will goose interest in high fashion, as it will whet your appetite for Chinese, Peranankan and Malay cuisine. And more importantly, juice up tourism to Singapore.
'Crazy Rich Asians' leaves out the majority of Singaporeans who eke out a living on the lower end of the economic scale. It's the world of the 1 percent, with its excessive habits and the mindlessness of its children.
The US and Chinese America is not well viewed, to say the least. For the hero love conquers over all, but we know he has not completely rejected the wealth and the privileges of the class and benefits of the super rich.
And all though the object of his love is low born, she's an economist at New York University, who speaks Mandarin and is a whiz in game theory, and therefore, she will fit in the world of the manor.

In the end, Nick's mother, Eleanor, respects Rachel, and that is very satisfying. I got a splendid glimpse into Asian culture and traditions, and that was amazing for me.

The story starts with Rachel Chu (played by Constance Wu) who is accompany by her boyfriend Nick Young (played by Henry Golding) who has family of insanely rich people. Eleanor Young (played by Michele Yeoh) who is Nick's Mom. She's more culturally family oriented and Rachel is more American tradition than Chinese. Between them is a conflict on what's more better between Chinese and American. When you think of rich people, do you think they are snobbish and totally look down at those who are not rich. This part here is what makes this movie great. What can you prove to haters, and how you can prove them wrong? Rachel is a fighter and she clearly shows she is no Chicken. The two supporting characters that I love are Peik Lin Goh played Awkwafina and Oliver T'sien played by Nico Santos. Very hilarious characters and technically steals the show.Without them it wouldn't be hilarious. It will dull. The director did a tremendous job and bringing the Asian culture of this movie.

I couldn't help but feeling that you are going to feel good, even if the movie makers have to ram it down your throat. And just for good measure, they want us to understand that if by some chance we don't feel good about it, no matter. Because now the Azzeeaains have the moolah to buy everything anyway, so if you don't play along and feel good, watch out, because they'll just buy the whole world anyway. Then the rent the Caucasians have to pay, is in the form of smiling and feeling good. This movie has my admiration ... the Crazy Rich Asians have worked hard or inherited hard for their money.

So, I watched it and I am totally amazed for this movie. This is a representative movie of rich Asians. I am Indonesian and I know what Indonesians perceive about rich Asians, especially Chinese. The shooting location of this movie is in Singapore, the neighbor country of Indonesia and yes, Singapore is famous of its richness in both culture and economy. They said Singapore is the center of gold in the ASEAN, so that this movie tells us about what happens to rich Singaporeans who grew up in white countries, such as America and United Kingdom. Falling in love among Asians is common and yet it becomes culture because it would be difficult if Asian is dating non-Asian. People will talk about it. This movie begins with ordinary dramatic scene of lovely couple from America to spend their travelling days in Singapore. The girl has nothing guess about her future husband family fame. In Singapore, she faces such serious problems about hedonism and rich culture problems among her boyfriend's family and friends. The scenes of plots of this story can make you sit peacefully until the end, with heart-melted, angry, and humorous feeling become one. I like the way of Director to figure out the culture in Singapore, between new-rich and old-rich and how love story can be fighting with family legacy. The insight and the flawless rich family can not be enough measured by what other people's think, but deep down inside the family is scarifying everything. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Michelle Yeoh took one of important roles in this movie and yet this movie can be a representative movie of rich Asians, especially in Singapore, on how they are dealing with future, including how they make a balance between self-satisfaction, family, business, and private life.

With a romantic comedy like this, I say it really captured my attention with a great assortment of talented cast members like Constance Wu, Ken Jeong, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and Henry Golding. Since the film is adapted from the book by Kevin Kwan, I had no clue what to expect out of this movie.New York college professor Rachel Chu is dating a good man named Nick Young. She is shocked to learn that her boyfriend comes from a rich family and feels inferior when he decides to introduce her to them personally overseas. Although things prove uneasy at the start with them, it becomes an adventure into exploring what more does Singapore have to offer.Director Jon M. Chu provided a display of how the most affluent individuals in Asia are also stern in their own families. Aside from the stereotypical portrayals and lifestyles shown in most Asian families, there's depth and a story worth telling here. 'Fresh Off the Boat' star Constance Wu really took it a step further from her TV sitcom (which I personally watch) and into film by allowing the audience to see from her character's perspective on the most difficult of situations. Feeling marginalized and looked down upon by the high class can make anyone feel insignificant, but there are morals that can overcome them.From what I've learned in each confrontation the characters face - both ruthless and at times pitiful - it implies reverse discrimination amongst one's own race regarding class. This is no ordinary romantic comedy that borrows off of countless, past rom-coms either memorable or cliché, it's a type that supplements this genre rather than diminishing it.

The direction of the film was very good along with the fascinating editing and good shots. But nothing is perfect in it. Creating a ""Crazy"" atmosphere which only presented through annoying characters with bringing a confusing character acting weirdly to appear sexy and all that stuff with awful performances along with the characters itself. A movie with ""Crazy"" word that lacked craziness is no doubt a big flop. The ""Rich"" ward was the one who controlled the atmosphere of the movie and it wasn't much big but was good. Everything in the film is either weak or good but the romance relationship and the performance of our protagonists is very much beautiful and decent with tons of fun and love along with direction and music too.

Funny? Not gut-bustingly funny, but a few chuckles, and an occasional actual laugh. Romantic? Sure, but nothing stands out about it. The end to me is the best part of the film, as the end result was sweet. The performances make this film enjoyable enough to not cross the boring territory. It's a film you can relax with, no edge of your seat moments, or anything like that. It conveys an important message involving loving someone for who they are, but I've seen that many times before. So this is a very borderlined review for a borderlined movie. I liked it, but didn't love it.

It's simply not what you think it's going to be, which is precisely why director Jon M. Chu has struck gold with this wonderful film.From the opening scene, bursting with the throbbing beat and sound reminiscent of the 40's big band era, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" rapidly sets the tone, preparing you for a multi-cultural, multi-themed adventure in Time and Place.""Crazy Rich Asians"" is about Sex, Families, Humor, Heartache, familiar themes ingeniously bound together by over the top wealthy Asian and Asian-Americanized lifestyles zipping through life in exotic Singapore. In this particular fairy tale, the beautiful Cinderella has already met her Prince Charming. But will the Prince's stolid and skeptical mother sanction a relationship where Cinderella comes from the other side of the tracks? Prince Charming - with all that money and power, yet so charmingly vulnerable - can this guy be real? ""Crazy Rich Asians"" seems to intentionally limit the time you'll have to ponder such philosophical questions. Indeed, the fast pace of the film is merely a continuous rollout of glamour, fashion, comedy, political correctness (and incorrectness), and, of course, money, and then more money. But even gross excess can be entertaining if portrayed like an art form, which certainly film director Chu has done. And underneath all the sparkling glitter, glamour, fashion, and style, there is a sense that this is a film that has genuine heart.Adapted from Kevin Kwan's novel of the same name, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a familiar yet upgraded story about romantic love and devotion and how it is sometimes different than family love and loyalty. Jon M. Chu cleverly shows how the two can be balanced even when the real worlds of the young lovers are so distinctly opposite. You'll be laughing along with this wonderful cast, and you may even shed a few sentimental tears, but one thing will be clear: You're going to want to visit Singapore after seeing this wonderful film.",Crazy Rich Asians

Where is the contrast with America? Muriel's Wedding was Aussie and My Big fat Greek Wedding was its namesake but this one was not what you would expect.

I am not like people who give shows a 1 or 2 because they are not getting what they want. It is watchable and there are a few jokes and even some tears to round off emotions but it could have been better. It could have shown how Asians are unique and not copiers of Hollywood and America.

It follows the story of Rachel Chu who's thrusted into the lives of the crazy rich Asians when her boyfriend, heir apparent to the massive Young fortune brings her to the other side of the world to meet his parents. And we all know how smooth that usually goes, meeting Asian parents. How will our New Yorker, Chinese-American heroine fare against the Young matriarch is a battle of epic proportions, typical of a future daughter-in-law's worst nightmares coming to life, culminating in a mahjong table duel and a massive stare downs that will shake you to the core of your soul if don't look away first.Constance Wu is charming as Rachel, Awkwafina is a scene stealer when she's on and Michelle Yeoh is as stunning as that blinding engagement ring she shows off while making dumplings (so Asian!) The ring btw is from her personal collection because she didn't like what she was supposed to use c/o the production team. Lastly, at first I thought Gemma Chan's acting was lacking but looking back, she is the typical Asian woman, meek and passive, knows her place in the order of things, but feisty and bites back when poked hard enough.I haven't read the book (I believe to get the most out of the movie and book versions, watch the adaptation first then read the source novel {no set expectations} as opposed to being disappointed by the movie when it wasn't faithful to the book), but my interest in this was piqued because it's not often you get an All-Asian Hollywood produced movie. Notwithstanding the brouhaha over the casting of Eurasians for Chinese roles, or the continued pandering to China because that's where the money is and ignoring other ethnicities, we should still consider this a win in the fight for Hollywood to be more inclusive and diverse (Black Panther, Love, Simon, To All the Boys... etc.) A sequel has been approved and will be based off of the second book, and we hope this will spark further interest in anything Asian, which may mean possible opportunities also for the Asian community.",Crazy Rich Asians

Henry Golding does not even look sufficiently ""Asian"". Most of the actors and actresses are western, almost all the characters are Oxford grads,!!!, and this is the only thing that the movie gets right, when Michelle Yeo's character keeps quipping disapprovingly about the American way. Because this is what this movie is, a piece of generic Asian folklore for non Asians. Just like Anthony Quinn's Zorba was Greek folklore for non Greeks. I've worked with ""Asian"" students and colleagues for over 25 years in Australia, this movie is as far from depicting Asians as it could wish to be. And as soon as I heard Michelle Yeo tell the story of the emerald ring, I knew it was going to be the proposal ring. Just like you could tell Astrid's husband would be he one to have an affair.

First of it is refreshing to see a Hollywood production that actually feels respectful and not negligent to modern Asian culture. Constance Wu and Michelle Yeung delivers powerful performances and the cinematography of the film is breathtaking and showcases the best of Asian culture. What is most impressive is that it really talks about the inner psychology of a lot of Asian families that I can really relate. The pressure of being a part of your family and living by their words is common place across so many of my peers and myself.

It felt too long for me after the wedding scene, mostly because it's usually in weddings when the climax occurs in movies. However, the ending was very powerful. Rachel's speech to her boyfriend's mother is impressive, and charged with a great sacrifice from her and a lot of emotion.

The women make the decisions, call the shots, are put down by other women. They are strong (Rachel), stoic (Eleanor), revered (the matriach), caring (Astrid), reliable (Peik Lin) and tender yet tough (Kerry Chu). The men here are more like eye candy and window dressing.
In any case, the cast is pure delight. Just to name a few: Constance Wu makes Rachel Chu real. Henry Golding is self-assured as Nick Young. Ken Jeong is Ken Jeong which is not a bad thing. Michelle Yeoh as Mrs Young fabulously channels Lauren Bacall. Akwakina steals the show as Goh Peik Lin. And Harry Shum Jr, cut out from the main feature, appears in a teaser during the end credits.

Tony Stark?As for the accents, have you ever been to Singapore? English is the official language of Singapore. They are an ex-British colony and they do speak with a strong British accent. They are also far closer to Australia and many study abroad there so anyone studying there you'd expect them to pick up that accent. Many of the people in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia just a short drop away also all speak fluent English and tend to have a British or at least non American accent. Did you expect a bad accent with poor English? That only reflect on your prejudice and ignorance.As for Singapore being rich, IT IS RICH! They serve a $26000 drink at the bar at the Marina Bay Sands for rich kids to show off. Is it disgusting, yes. But the movie was about a non-rich American girl visiting her, unknown to her, boyfriend's rich and snobby family. How many times have similar stories about a poor person dating a rich person been told with white people? Oh, like a million. Did you get upset then? Sense and Sensibility? Breakfast at Tiffany's? Pretty in Pink? Pretty Woman?Some people claim it's not a romance? What movie were they watching? Rachel and Nick seem in love. Neither seem to be addicted to the money.

It's about a rich, handsome Prince (of commerce) who has fallen in love with someone who is not a princess (she's an economics professor), and the Prince's mother tries to prevent this mismatch from reaching its obvious conclusion. At times, this movie reminded me of a James Bond film because of its exotic sets. At times, it reminded me of the wedding comedy ""Bridesmaids"" for its focus on wealth and female attire. But always, this movie is as accessible to middle-class Caucasians as it is to Asians.

224,johnplocar,Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Boy takes girl to Singapore to meet his ridiculously rich family at a wedding where they judge and berate her for being different!,7,26 November 2018,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" is the story of when Nick Young takes his girlfriend, Rachel Chu, to Singapore for a wedding where she gets the chance to meet Nick's family for the first time. However, it turns out that his family is...well...'crazy rich'. When they arrive it becomes apparent that Nick's mother doesn't quite approve of his new girlfriend. So will they figure out how to put their differences aside or will this be the end of Nick and Rachel as we know it?!So from the plot, it's fairly obvious that we have seen several times before; whether it be ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", ""Meet the Parents"", ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", etc. Anyone could probably picture in their head how this film might play out and they would be exactly right. It has every cliche in the Rom-Com book. The characters are every stereotype we've seen before. The story is one-hundred percent predictable at every turn. Yet, somehow, this manages to be a very genuine and even sweet film. I was able to accept the constant cliches, the wildly familiar archetypes and the lack of ambition in narrative because I found most of the characters likable and even enjoyed the exploration of Asian culture. By all accounts, this was a rehash of a movie that has been made countless times in the past, but it was a good example of how to work with something that is familiar yet finding a way to make it still entertaining.In the opening scene the film establishes everything that one needs to know about the Young family, specifically the character of Nick's mother, Eleanor. This family can make one quick phone call and they are immediately the brand new owners of a five star, high class hotel in London. This family has powerful connections and Eleanor is always at the ready to use that to vindictively strike at anyone who threatens them. This intro really does help set up the mother and why she is the way she is when Rachel comes into the picture. Eleanor is basically another iteration of Robert De Niro's character in ""Meet the Parents""; she's quick to judge Rachel for being a mistake for Nick to be with, resulting in her trying to put a wedge between the two in hopes to break them up. Nick is pretty much golden child of the family, especially to his mother, and is in line to take up the mantle for the family business. He's smart, successful and completely responsible; practically the perfect guy with seemingly no flaws at all. And Rachel is an economics teacher at N.Y.U. who loves her job in benefiting youths' lives. Daughter of a single mother who raised her all of her life after her father passed away before she was born. She too is successful in her career, but not quite to the standards of the Young family.A huge factor that held this film together for me and kept me from being irritated by the familiarity of it all is how much personality is interjected into these characters. I believe that to be heavily due to the terrific actors who do their best with their roles. I wouldn't say that there is anything groundbreaking or even Oscar worthy by any means, but the actors involved supply enough charisma and depth in character that I couldn't help myself from being somewhat invested in the story. Michelle Yeoh as Eleanor in particular gives a layered performance that is interesting and understandable, especially when the relationship between Eleanor and her mother-in-law is revealed. You get where her character is coming from and why she is as strict as she is when it comes to Nick and his decisions. On the other hand, you certainly don't agree with Eleanor interfering in Nick and Rachel's lives the way that she does. Instead, it is fairly easy to route for Rachel to persuade Eleanor, or at the very least prevail against Eleanor's efforts to cut her out of the picture. When Nick and Rachel share scenes together, their relationship is extremely cute, and was actually touching in one scene in particular involving the wedding that they were invited to attend. Plus, the acting on Constance Wu's part as Rachel is very solid work; it's near impossible not to feel a bit of emotion any time something stressful happens to Rachel to the point where it makes her eyes start to well up.Like I've said, this is a story seen so many times before that it'd be insane if someone didn't know where this film was going. The boyfriend/girlfriend takes girlfriend/boyfriend to meet the family. The family, specifically one parental role, disapproves or is weary of the relationship. That parent does everything they can to sabotage the romance. The 'outsider' does everything they can to brush their efforts off and persevere. There's a number of quirky characters that add to the wackiness and stress of our main character. Once the third act hits, there's a big misunderstanding that leads to the two romantic leads to break up. They spend the next several minutes in heart break over the loss of their love. But in the last remaining moments, love concurs all. The romantic leads realize that they love each other and they have no reason to be apart while the judgmental parent finally learns the error of their ways and accepts the newcomer into the family. The end.So what makes this a more enjoyable pill to swallow than say something like ""Meet the Fockers""? Aside from the acting doing a good job at making the characters feel lively, the writing makes an effort to put its own unique spin on every event that happens in the movie. The misunderstanding is something that is something that goes beyond even the knowledge of our lead characters and there's no real way that it could have been cleared up prior to when it is brought up in the narrative. The rivalry between the girlfriend and the significant other's mother doesn't come across as naive on anyone's part, but rather it comes from a place of honor and tradition for the Young family.Speaking of the Young family, there is a decent amount of care in detail provided with the extended family of Nick. Taking a peak into the lives of several of his cousins, showing several examples of what a significant fortune does to a large family. There's the ones living the care-free, rock star lifestyle. Others that just pour money practically into every aspect of their lives. The most interesting, however, is the cousin Astrid who is going through a sort of rough patch in her marriage with a man who also wasn't seen as a 'worthy' inclusion of the Young family. The dynamic between Astrid and how she tries to keep her family, as well as her money, completely separate from her husband because it somehow makes him feel inept. Again, it is a subplot that is predictable from the start, but I thought that the acting was good enough to support it and I also liked the character arc of Astrid.The culture that all of this takes place in gives everything its own interesting context, as well as a unique flavor. This film is very stylish in how the scenes are lit and edited; I mean, it never hurts to supply some eye candy to the movie and with the Chinese aesthetics displayed all throughout the film, it does have some beautiful imagery. The most impressive of which has to be the wedding scene. In all honesty, the wedding sequence was possibly one of the most visually appealing weddings that I had ever seen in a movie; it was truly gorgeous to watch as it went along.Another aspect about this movie that probably helps it stand strong is that it actually is relatively funny. The comedy here, for the most part, is handled very well. It doesn't feel like a string of juvenile or sophomoric humor being shoved into the movie, nor does it try to make the dialog into two hours worth sex puns. Thankfully it also doesn't take part in a modern trend I'm sick of with the actors providing line-o-rama the whole run time. The comedy is much more character based and feels natural from where the jokes stem from. With that said, however, there is one character where the comedy felt particularly forced. That, for me, was in the supporting character of Peik Lin Goh who is played by Awkwafina. I found her remarkably annoying. For some reason Peik felt like the least natural part of this whole film and could have undoubtedly been cut from the film with a simple rewrite. The actress's style of comedy was just obnoxious and constantly mugging to the camera, I found that grating to watch. Especially when everyone else is so good and is already funny on their own, so it feels pointless to include this supporting comic relief that doesn't match the tone for the rest of the cast. There were a couple of moments where she was 'fine', but any time she popped up on screen I wanted to chuck her out a window.So my final thoughts are that...yes, this has been done before. But when it's done right, then why fight it? Just enjoy the ride. And that is exactly what I did. I sat back and enjoyed the ride. I delighted by the characters, I had my fair share of laughs, I admired the visual spectacle of the film's locations and aesthetics, I knew where the plot was going and I was okay with that. There was one character that I slightly hated and wished was dead, but if that's the worst thing that I can say about this movie then I declare this to be rather a success. If you would like to just have a date night and watch some cute movie fluff then this is pretty perfect for that. Check it out and turn your brains off.",Crazy Rich Asians

Having never met his crazy rich family, Rachel takes great care in making a good first impression, though quickly picks up on the fact that Nick's mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh) has taken an immediate disliking to her. It doesn't take long at all before the Young family turn on Rachel and blatantly refuse to make her feel welcome, causing her to question the future of her relationship with Nick, who's own future already appears to be planned out for him by his strict, stubborn mother. The Rom-Com has never been a favoured genre of mine, save for a few acceptations. Along with some of my favourite Rom-Com flicks including When Harry Met Sally (1989) and (500) Days of Summer (2009), Crazy Rich Asians is a film that took very little effort to win me over. One of the films strongest factors is the likeability of its leads. Both Wu and Golding are wonderful together on screen and share impeccable chemistry, forging one of the most believable onscreen romances in years. With the addition of Gemma Chan as Nick's (likable) cousin Astrid and Awkwafina as Rachels hilarious college best friend Peik Lin, the film contains a solid supporting cast (with a minor role fans of The Hangover series will appreciate). Chu's film boasts some truly stunning locations and set design, resulting in an endlessly bright, dazzling looking film. Tropes of the Rom-Com are well and truly present (as expected) but the film is made in such a way that it feels more authentic than I had previously expected. A side plot involving Astrid does feel less important than the overall storyline, and its exclusion would not have made a great deal of difference to the overall story. Easily a contender for feel good film of the year, Crazy Rich Asians is a frequently charming and heartfelt film that is well worth seeking out. It's a hard one not to love.",Crazy Rich Asians

I believe better introductory lines from both leads - and not about dessert portions - would have accomplished this.The great treasures are the non-leads (the protagonist Eleanor, for example) and the best of these are the blonde ""Ellen"" and the gay fashionista.For those complaining that this or that about Singapore wasn't captured correctly, welcome to movie-making. Not every detail or nuance can be captured. When people from New York or San Francisco or Tokyo or Rome see their cities depicted, they accept it as a depiction - showing their experience with these kind of things.For those who say that the characters were not terribly deep, remember that this is a comedy that sets a particular scene for particular laughs at particular things.

For the actual Oxford-trained lawyer to play one on film is not that much of a stretch, after all. Her expressiveness will surprise those who know her best from HUMANS. I dare to compare her with Gong Li. I expect to see her in some vast, mainland Chinese film epic before too long.",Crazy Rich Asians

236,fatcat-73450,Trite and Ethically Bankrupt,4,7 November 2021,"Poor girl is dating rich boy, rich boy's friends and family don't like her because she's not on their social level, rich boy feels some pressure to leave her but doesn't.It's the same plot as Pretty in Pink (1986). Although, to be fair, it may be a timeless plot. Surely that wasn't the first and this won't be the last time this plot is reanimated for use.So how is it different from Pretty in Pink? Well, not in a good way. It's set in a la la land where lots of ethnic Chinese people are rich enough to own huge tracts of land with mansions in Singapore.It's a billionaire exploitation film. That is to say, it shows extreme opulence just to impress its intended audience. They own mansions, they drive giant cars, they hold bachelor parties on aircraft carriers. Pointless.On the other hand, there is a very superficial handling of Chinese culture. They play mahjong in one scene... for no discernible reason. The girl wants to dress in red (the Chinese ""good luck"" colour) to meet her prospective mother-in-law... Except that red isn't in just at this moment so she should't wear it. The ""Chinese culture"" is just there for decoration.Yeah, they don't mention the existence of Malay Singaporeans at all and some Indian Singaporeans only show up as door guards, but I don't see this as a point worthy of indignation. Chinese Singaporeans make up the vast majority of the country, probably almost all the rich there are Chinese, and this is a movie about the Chinese Singaporean community. I doubt the ethnicites hang out together too much in their personal lives and I'm sure if it were a movie about Malay Singaporeans, most if not all characters would be Malay.On the other hand, I understand the male lead here is actually Malay or partially Malay.It would be nice if they included some more diversity, but there's nothing really wrong with not doing so.No, the main problem with this movie is that it's offers nothing but a hackneyed rehash of an old worn plot and an empty-headed advertisement for luxury items.It's watchable, just barely. The creepy son of GangJo Jeong's character is kind of funny (surprisingly GangJo Jeong isn't funny at all) and Awkwafina is fun to watch. That's about it.Honourable Mentions: Jingle All the Way (1996). Just like that movie was a cliché Christmas Comedy being pushed hard as something incredible by Arnold just because it had Arnold in it, this movie is a cliché romantic comedy pushed hard by Asian-Americans because it has Asians in it. But Jingle All the Way had Arnold and Phil Hartman so it actually does end up being a bit of a gem.",Crazy Rich Asians
237,Scarefish,I'd give it a perfect 5/7 rating if I could,7,25 August 2018,"Crazy Rich Asians is one of few pleasant surprises in film this year thus far. It is a simple romantic comedy, but it is certainly elevated by a great cast and witty dialogue.I wouldn't say this film is a masterpiece, but I would say it is great. It is based on a novel, and I think that leads to a number of limitations. The story doesn't perfectly lend itself to the medium of film, though the way it was handled was surprisingly satisfying. This film feels unique despite looking and sounding like a typical rom-com, keeping the elements of a typical rom-com that work whilst trimming out some of the worst bits and handling the tropes with restraint, and what results is a charming little film.The dialogue was very good for the most part. Jokes landed a majority of the time, and were never truly bad even at their worst, and there certainly are a lot made throughout the film. There's a confidence throughout that's well justified. This film feels like what a lot of Western chick flicks try to accomplish, which allows me to feel the way Amy Schumer fans must feel when they watch her movies. It feels like a lot of those comedies, if they were catered to my tastes and demands from films of this caliber. Delivery is often sharp and fast.Michelle Yeoh was superb as Eleanor Sung-Young, the mother-in-law from hell. She stole the show with every moment she was on screen, and was a master of saying one thing whilst meaning the exact opposite, and being an absolute monster throughout the film. She's the definition of a character I love to hate. Constance Wu was a fine lead, playing Rachel Chu, though one of her apparent empowering acts in the film felt rather counter-intuitive. Awkwafina did a fine job as the obnoxious friend through the film, and it felt like a more reasonable Kate McKinnon type performance. The rest worked really well, providing a nice range of personalities and offering a surprisingly large range of unique characters, none of which overstay their welcomes.It's neat to see a movie showcasing Chinese culture, especially considering I watch mostly North American films and the occasional Bollywood film at our theater. There seems to be a huge push for diversity in the vast majority of Hollywood films that feels so deliberate and follows along the lines of a melting pot, in which cultures are blended together to the point where it is nearly lost among all the other conflicting cultures.I'd recommend this film to just about anyone who enjoys film, especially considering how few good films there have been this year so far. Even if this genre is not one you typically have patience for, I found it surprisingly enjoyable, and certainly worthy of the praise it has gotten so far.",Crazy Rich Asians

Rachel faced difficulty, but with help from her collage best friend and some members of the family, she really proved herself to them in the end. Speaking of the ending, It Was So Romantic and the song really fit perfectly in that one special romantic moment between Rachel and Nick. Plus I loved the characters as they were all so colourful, unquie and different, but I also enjoyed the subplot focusing on Nick's cousin, Astrid. She is one of the few rare members of the family who is truly kind and caring towards Rachel, making her one of the sweetest characters, plus I loved how she stood up for herself against her cowardly husband.Overall, This is A Truly Fantastic Film and I could watch again and again without Ever getting bored.",Crazy Rich Asians
240,martin-intercultural,"Entertaining, and deep in places",9,10 July 2019,"I lived in Singapore, Hong Kong and China for many years. Learned Mandarin. Married and divorced a Chinese woman. What I found bold, fresh and authentic about Crazy- [hyphen, surely...] Rich Asians was mostly embodied in the character of Nick's mother. Trust me, she's not a Godzilla or Mother-in-law-Zilla or anything like that. Not at all. She speaks for an entire tradition. A culture that never for a minute believed in diversity and openness and all that other western PC claptrap. Where strength comes from homogeneity and keeping stuff close to one's chest. Where truth is whatever doesn't upset the apple cart. Where extended family controls your life -- and as miserable as it makes you feel, you keep coming back for more, week after week after week.Of course, in the face of all this existential profundity and honesty, other parts of the story were bound to disappoint. The romance quickly becomes sort of an 'Asian twist on Julia Roberts' vehicle. As does the ending.Let me tell you -- the real Nicks of this world NEVER walk away from family. They don't have it in them, and never had. Plus it would financially destroy them. If they marry a non-wealthy or a non-Chinese girl, often it's only for a short while. Mummy is willing to sit this one out, until cooler heads prevail. Which they will. She will never back off, ever. Not to mention that marriage, just like in Europe up until 100 years ago, is primarily a coup of business and diplomacy. A way to ally two conglomerates. To win government backing. To enter a new market. Etc.I wasn't too bothered by the consumerism on display. The 'taitais' (ladies who lunch) are trashy and they know it. The young ones are spaghetti-strap-clad money-sucking machines, and they know it too.The dialog was quite unconvincing - but that's fine. At least the viewer established that crazy-rich Chinese in Singapore & Malaysia indeed like to speak English at home and to attend church - usually an evangelical / wealth-celebrating one.Production-wise, the Singapore Tourism Board's usual apparatchik signature all over the film was as heavy-handed as it was predictable. Flogging the Merlion (the puking lion statue) yet again, are we? Of course they are -- they created him out of thin air in the first place, back in the 80s. And Singapore food... Please lah! The island has no agriculture; the ingredients are not fresh; the costs of running a food stall prohibitive. It's just watered-down versions of Malaysian and Indonesian dishes, only a lot more expensive.While we're at it, ALL the historic mansion / glitzy club / resort / private jet scenes were filmed in MALAYSIA! Kuala Lumpur and Penang, to be specific. Including the opening scene in the ""London"" hotel. And the ""New York"" restaurant. :-)Lastly, nice to see Henry Golding get a bit of limelight. What a matiné idol mix he is of English, Jewish and Malaysian Borneo aboriginal genes. From travel channel specials to Hollywood: Nice!

245,richard-fieldhouse,Well I Enjoyed It,8,31 March 2021,"Many reviewers seem to fault this movie for being unrealistic - or for featuring obscenely wealthy Singaporeans - or for not featuring a proportionate cross section of all Asians.Kevin Kwan, who wrote the original book, was brought up in Singapore, great grandson of a founder of Singapore's oldest bank. Aged 11, he moved to the USA. So, for the most part, we should accept that he knows whereof he speaks.It's possible, however, that in reflecting Kwan's personal journey, the present-day setting of the film is misleading. The overt British racism of the first scene, for instance, does not ring true for a memory of the 1990s. But transpose the present day of the movie back to 1975, when Kwan left Singapore, then this would in turn move the opening scene back to the 1950s, and the attitudes portrayed aren't so out of context. In the same way, the strangely snobbish and ""postcolonial"" lifestyles of the wealthy Singaporeans might also have been more in keeping with the time that Kwan was there. And he is poking fun at these lifestyles, not promoting them.But this is a romcom, not a social commentary so it really would be best just not to worry about such things and enjoy the ride. The pretext is simple. Boy meets girl in America. He finally takes her to meet his family back home and to her amazement, they turn out to be fabulously rich. (Again let's not worry about whether this wealth might have been exaggerated.) The snobbish mother, with her dislike of all things American, provides the perfect dramatic foil to give the story an edge.The acting is strong and there's an immense energy to the film which carries it along at an excellent pace. Constance Wu as the Chinese American lead and Henry Golding as the heir to the Singaporean dynasty have the chemistry to be the lovers while Awkwafina and Nico Santos have tremendous fun in their supporting roles. Michelle Yeoh is convincing as the conflicted matriarch and Gemma Chan (lately an android in Humans) gets a chance to be even more human as the unfortunate sister.",Crazy Rich Asians

It's a very powering movie and it almost made me cry in some areas. Sure, there are some Chinese jokes in there, but the people in the movie are Asian too, think about that, and they don't seem too offended by the jokes.

Now let me tell you that inserting Chinese stereotypes and caricatures does not make an authentic Chinese atmosphere; it makes for a poor facsimile of Chinese culture - to the point that I felt like I was watching rich crazy white Americans wearing extremely accurate yellow face rather than rich crazy Asians. Rachel Chu displaying American behavior is fine, because she IS American, but I've seen Cinderella stories played out in Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese cinema/drama and, while there are superficial similarities of them being snobbish and pompous jerks, the rich Asians in those stories just do not behave as they do in this movie (the uncanny difference is in the small details of how they talk, stand, walk, emote, etc.). As for the two leads, Rachel and Nick, they for some reason kind of reminded me of Anastasia and Christian from ""50 Shades of Grey"" minus the explicit sex scenes... it's not a positive reminder.My recommendation: If you want to see authentic Chinese (or East Asian) characters, watch a Chinese, HK, Taiwanese (Korean, Japanese) romantic comedy.

262,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Unique doesn't always mean best,6,25 August 2018,"A unique rom-com but not the best rom-com. This movie did something that Hollywood really doesn't do, and that is go overseas to Asia. Then past that it was a well-made romantic comedy. They followed the best-selling novel and took the audience to an unseen side of the world in Singapore. Because of this, there movie just had to be good for it to come off as super creative, unique, and a blockbuster; it did just that.
 Crazy Rich Asians follows an Asian-American Rachel Chu, played by Constance Wu, who flies to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's family. Much to her surprise, his family is one of the richest families in Singapore. The film then broadcasts the luxurious lifestyle and beautiful architecture that is prominent in Singapore and just like Rachel Chu we are experiencing this for the first time. Due to the rarity of any movie of my knowledge showing the luxurious areas of Singapore, they capitalized on this void in American culture and half of the movies success came from scenes similar to a documentary of Singapore. Now this was a film so they didn't go into that much detail, but they showed this unknown and beautiful culture off very well. 
 The movie is quite long for a romantic comedy, especially one that follows in step with the typical plot line of these films. They could have done without a few of the scenes just to keep the pacing up and build more into the main characters relationship. Where this film took steps backwards was in these main characters. Whether it was the writers or the actors Rachel and Nick just didn't seem to be the main focus of the film, and they just played your typical cheesy couple. There wasn't beautiful chemistry or unique characteristics of either of them. More of just your rich boy and average girl scenario. 
 Now where the movie excelled was with the supporting characters. They built a cast around them that brought all of the life and believability to the film. Whether it was the comedy of Awkwafina, playing Rachels friend from college Peik Lin Goh, or Nick's mother Eleanor Young, played by Michelle Yeoh, who brought the serious and emotional scenes. They each added all of the parts that the main characters just couldn't bring. Constance definitely had her scenes near the end of her game theory and independent American side was put into focus, but overall, she was lacking.
 The success of the film means we will hopefully get more looks into the Asian continent, maybe more competent Asian actors in films and not just playing stereotypical Asian roles. Crazy Rich Asians has opened up this opportunity for others where we won't look back at this movie and say it is the best of the genre, but this is another stepping stone that will allow other greater movies to be pushed through Hollywood and hit the mainstream audiences.",Crazy Rich Asians
263,maindraaritomo,Above my expectation,9,29 September 2018,"I admire the director for presenting one certain unique Chinese mixed modern and traditional culture for spectators all around the world to again digest an old ever drama story tale which happens on every nation with numbers of cultural background. It is love vs wealth. For it is based on famous best-selling novel, although this time the novelist, Kevin Kwan, has brilliantly scripting a wonderful dialogue in bending down a stiff lady lord about perfection to accept an unconditional love whilst clearly seen it is impossible to be one. Eventually the stars are very well done communicating it to audience by the remarkable act.My note is Golding often doesn't show enough affection to Wu on few scenes. It would be nicer if Golding put his arm over Wu's shoulder, very close pressing his body against Wu's, after hours they are away from each other, while they're on couch moment Wu is telling Golding unpleasant things she went through during the bachelorette party. Also in car, Golding should have only put his right hand on wheel, the other hand is resting to anytime touching Wu, body a bit leaning to left to show how he is very always open to Wu everywhere they are.

It's not a bad film at all; technically it's done very competently, the direction and acting are all above average.Yet it's such a dull movie that it leaves you with a bland taste after watching it. Nothing remains with you the next day, despite the great visuals. It's like a book with a great cover, in which the pages are all blank.The plot involves the son of an extremely rich family falling in love, but hiding the truth about his family wealth from her, fearing that it may affect their relationship. When he takes her home to meet his family, we see that he was right, but not in the way we expected: it's not his girlfriend that causes problems, but his family.This story has been done a million times, and the movie only touches the most obvious points, never exploring anything more than superficial. Which is sad, with that budget and cast, there was a lot that could be done, but they prefer to play it safe. The movie focuses so much on the ""Look, we're Asians! It's an all-Asian cast!"" gimmick that it forgets to present the viewers with something interesting to tell.I also have to add a personal note: While I can't stand people who nitpick on words and play the ""I'm offended!"" card on every minute detail, I also have to point out that ""Asian"" is the most blatantly stupid generalization I've seen in a long time.

265,ShitizSays,The average Blockbuster with great performance from the Lead Actress,6,2 February 2019,"I won't lie. I only saw the film because I heard a lot about the film, on the internet only.I didn't read any reviews about it but its blockbuster status and super success was guarantee enough to watch this film.I did it.Frankly, I didn't like it.It is the most cliched and ordinary film I have ever seen. I have no idea why this film worked wonders on box office.I was thoroughly bored and was waiting for some interesting moments or twists in the film but there were none.Indian Cinema is full of content like this. It was like an Indian film with Chinese actors having American accents.I thought this film would a be a fun loving comedy. I really thought it was a Korean film. It was not.Then I thought it was a Chinese Film. It was not.It was an American film with Chinese actors speaking American English and glorifying the non-existent American Culture.The film is a love story of a rich boy ad poor girl. Poor girl doesn't know that the boyfriend is rich. Boyfriend invites her to his sister's wedding and she accepts. A poor girl comes to know that he is a rich guy. Everyone else thinks she is a gold digger. They hate her, then they accept her and then they insult her. She runs away and the rich leaves everything to stop her at the airport after the mother of the rich boy finally agrees.Nothing new. It was watchable for once but not twice.The opening scene is great and paves the way for hopes that the film will be indeed a great film. But the first scene has nothing to do with the rest of the film.The lead actor, Henry Golding, is a fusion of Chinese and American and has to play the role of a nice guy which he plays well. I am sure he would be the reason for many girl's orgasms after the film. He is a good looking man.But the real scene stealer is Constance Wu with her impeccable portrayal of Rachel. The best thing about her as that she looked ordinary yet maintained a grace which made her look beautiful despite her conventional looks.Another great performance was by my childhood love Michelle Yeoh. She played Eleanor, the mother of Nick, the rich boy. Now she portrays some real grace with her acting. She is such a fine actor that she can even act with her eyes and her breathing.Truth be told, the second half was all about Rachel and Eleanor's confrontational scenes.There were times the film was intolerable and was way too romantic for me but I finished it anyhow.One time watch.

It still had a weird ""magic ending"" to it. Ironically full of 2 dimensional characters and villains. A Hollywood story in Asian clothes. Are we to understand that super rich cultures are the same all over the world?

267,jamesmoule,Some People Miss the Point,9,24 September 2018,"I was not going to review this movie as I noted that those who enjoyed it as much as I did had already said what I wanted to say and there were a lot of reviews.
The great thing about this movie is that it works on so many levels. Some reviews indicate that the viewer has only found one level. 
Superficially, it is just a simple love story with predictable events and predictable outcomes. On another level, it is a brilliant send-up of materialism as typified by so many Chinese people, both in China and in Australia (and elsewhere). If a Chinese family has wealth, they feel obliged to show in with as much extravagance as possible, (he says, drawing a long bow and painting with a broad brush). This especially applies to those families who have come from poor peasant backgrounds and ""made good"". 
The most important theme in this movie is the tension between love and financial status. This is not confined just to the Chinese community, of course. 
The negative reviews of this movie reflect more on the character of the reviewer than the quality of the production.",Crazy Rich Asians

269,OlgaGorelik,"Smart, inventive, and as genuinely funny as it is affecting",8,31 December 2018,"One of the most important ingredients of a good romantic comedy is conflict, obstacles that prevent the central couple from either becoming a couple or living boringly ever after or both. The obstacles need to be plausible and ideally somewhat original. Crazy Rich Asians has that in spades thanks to the customs and rules of the titular tribe, which, I'd venture to guess, are just as new to most of us as they are to Rachel (Constance Wu). And the movie offers so much more than that. It's smart, inventive, and as genuinely funny as it is affecting. I actually found myself bursting into tears during one particular scene, which practically never happens to me. (Not because I am cold, I just don't usually have that kind of strong immediate reaction.)Crazy Rich Asians has a large and interesting cast, but it ultimately hangs on Constance Wu's quietly commanding performance. Her male counterpart Henry Golding is perfectly charming. Michelle Yeoh is magnificent as his mother. And Awkwafina was a revelation to me - her Peik Lin is not just insanely funny, but also warm and real.There was only one scene that bothered me. A lot! The very last scene. I felt it was completely unnecessary, even worse, it kind of undermined the whole movie. I am just going to pretend I never saw it because I loved the rest of the film so much.",Crazy Rich Asians

But it turned out to be set in Singapore and and all characters are Asians.It is a Cinderella story with the background of the modern Asia's booming economy. A Chinese American Rachel goes to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick to attend his friend's wedding, and to be introdused to his family. And the family turned out to be 'crazy rich'.Rachel faces the conflict with his family. She was raised by her humble single mother while his family is like an empire. She is American self-made woman while his family's most important value is family bond. This contrast makes the plot convincing.She is confronted by her possible mother-in-law Eleanor, who doesn't hide her hostility from their first meeting. The scenes between Rachel and Eleanor are always tense.Scenes are set in a series of extravagant parties in luxurious villas. Maybe their wealth are of without tradition, maybe just mushroom millionaires throwing orgies, but still they are pleasure to watch. They show the true energy of Asian economic bloom.It's a story about women. Male characters have only little significance. Nick's family is matriarchal. The comparison of two mothers, Nick's and Rachel's, is interesting to see. You see the ugliness of Nick's ex-girlfriends' jelousy.And my favorite character is Peik Lin, the best friend of Rachel's.

Frankly, I was expecting to either cringe in my seat or fall asleep - neither happened. Still, when it was over, I enjoyed it but it was also largely formula at its root..SPOILER ALERT
Let's face it - at it's root the story is your basic uber rich dude who falls in love with common girl.We have been down this path before - think Love Story (1970), My Fair Lady (1964), Pretty Woman (1990), Sound of Music (1965) and even Batman Returns (1992). As such - the questions becomes what is the surrounding story and what are the twists and turns, if any, from the formula and how well do they work. Well, the movie introduces several subplots. Most notable is the problem the main character's sister, Astrid, is having with her marriage - which basically reverses the main plot - rich girl marries a commoner - who has an affair because he cannot deal with feeling secondary to his wife's fame. It is an interesting subplot and commentary to thee main characters.The main plot involves Nick, the rich son, Rachel, the commoner girlfriend,and Nick's mother, Elanor. This turns into the somewhat standard ""parent doesn't approve of child's choice of partner so child has to choose between family/wealth or love"" story. Here the story takes some interesting turns. Nick does propose to Rachel, who turns her down - and Rachel's explanation as to why, to the mom, is a psychological bomb going off - the scene is really quite good. Where the movie breaks down are the other people Nick's family is associated with. They are all gaudy rich - and they act like something out of a cheap novel or reality TV show (Kardashians maybe?). Everyone appears to be engaged in petty games, mind tricks and even some over the top cruelty (there is one scene where they leave a dead barracuda in the hotel room of Rachel...I mean, really?) .I am not sure if this is to keep the story focus on Nick and Rachel, heighten the good character of these two by providing an extreme contrast, or......, Indeed, the only characters outside of Rachel and Nick I really warmed to were Rachel's friend, Peik, and her family. They are so over the top, and yet Peik is so generally wise, that I found myself loving the scenes with them, if for nothing else to get away from the constant backstabbing atmosphere of everyone else. Frankly they keep the movie from drowning in its own drama......So it is enjoyable - the ending is somewhat predictable, which you'd expect - everyone goes home happy, more or less. So if you go, either by your own volition or because your significant other drags you to it - well, you won't be disappointed.....",Crazy Rich Asians

Almost, because (without giving away too much spoilers) some of the braver choices made in the book do not come back in the movie, one at the end can even be seen but were edited out at the last moment.
Still, some unexpected serious moments between the Asian bling. Because there is bling, lots of it, but it shown mostly as pointless and depraving.
Complaining about this is at the level of accusing David Lynch of showing off Hollywood in the LA drama Mulholland Dr.
The rich people are almost all shown as total assholes. The ice cold mother and grandmother. The absent father. The cruel girlfriends. The persverse nephew.
And do they atm up to NY's Rachel? No way. No sweet reconcilationd here.
The most interesting part is how this semi-inspendent, mostly Malaysian, movie came together at all. So what the uneven pacing, mixed-up filming styles, actors seeming to be in different movies (compare the outrageous Awkwafina and Oliver, compared to bland male lead Henry Golding, and aggressive Constance Wu, at times qualifing for the succession of Daniel Craig as James Bond.

Crazy Rich Asians tells the stories of those parts of the world. Even if it is steeped in the excess of those crazy rich, it tells ground level stories that connect. Even though it's a very specific level of culture and society on show here, it feels universal. Because for all the differences, there are resonant similarities.It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but every second does feel like a triumph, finally giving centre stage to a different representation. The first scene onwards feels like a satisfying step forwards for races pushed to the background and to their own cliches. The film takes the familiar and makes it its own. It creates its own conflicts and plays with what you see and hear, even through the many Asian covers of western songs. It's a film that tells you that there's more than just white people here in your movie genres, and they can do it just as good if not better.It may be biased for once to give this a glowing review, but goddamn I was grinning ear to ear seeing this story unfold in front of me, and goddamn did it make me cry when the beats get hit.

289,abhijith-alpha,CONSTANCE WU'S STAR KEEPS RISING,7,9 May 2019,"CRAZY RICH ASIANS: MY REVIEWCrazy Rich Asians is filled with extravaganza. Rich people and their stories have always been fascinating just because of the shenanigans they get up to with the kind of access they can afford.CRA is about old school Asian money, finally being recognized by Hollywood. It is also a Cinderella style romantic story, a comedy with enough heartwarming moments and genuine emotion and lots and lots of sexy girls and handsome guys of the East Asian variety.Constance Wu plays the central role of a second generation Chinese-American economics professor who unwittingly gets drawn into the familial discords and issues of an old school Singapore-by-Chinese old money family. She handles her own and delivers a great performance, cementing her status as the rising star of Asian Hollywood. Surrounding her are a galaxy of actors who are in various stages of movie star fame, who do enough to dispel the notion that Asians are not sexy or hunky enough. They get to some excessive bachelor- and bachelorette- partying, spa-ing, making food, eating said food and hold a wedding somewhere in between. But the excess is not mindless. Each of the set pieces feel distinctly separate, paced well and intercut and interlaced by exposition, character beats, gossiping, and other usual tropes you have already seen before. The fresh-faced cast makes it look interesting, for sure, but plot isn't just there as fodder; this is a story most anyone who have faced alienation of the economic or racial or geographical kind can relate to. There is the usual rich guy with a sensible head; his best friends who're getting married; the playboy jock-type friend; the highly classy and stylish sister; the youngest and creatively 'ambitious' brother; the ferocious mother; and an even more formidable grandmother. There are gossipy sorority types wanting to nab the crown prince, the handsome yet poor guy who married into the family and as a consequence questions his masculinity every day. It's not an endless procession, they all are developed enough to distinguish from each other and serve the movie well.Every aspect related to set design is brilliant. The church wedding had one of the most innovative sets I have seen. The Young mansion is extravagant yet reeks of style, high status and class. The difference between new money and old money is hilariously presented with the contrasting of this mansion with that of Ken Jeong's character's house, which is no small thing in itself, yet, comes across in its décor as a bit gaudy and showy, as is apparently the case with the nouveau-riche.The choice of music felt apt. Many songs that were used I could tell were the Chinese versions of classic American pop songs. It blended well with the overall look and feel of the movie. It is an enjoyable one-time-watch.I have to say; I didn't think I would enjoy this one as much as I did. And most of it is thanks to Constance Wu, who brings her wit and charm from Fresh Off the Boat to here as well. But the standout performance in the movie was from Michelle Yeoh, who outshines Wu by miles. The Young matriarch's dislike for Wu's character jumps off the screen, as if she's emanating it from every fiber of her being. She elevates what would have been a stock villainous mother character into a complex and complicated person who had to fight for everything in her life, yet never felt like she won, and hence guards what she sees as hers with a fierceness that Asian people would report seeing in their own mothers. If I were to meet such a prospective mother-in-law in real life, I would try to put as much distance between her and me. This is a welcome return for her for me.DIRECTION 6.5

Not just because I loved the book but because I know wealth in Asian culture is super exaggerated and over the top, so seeing it on screen in a crass, comedic way made me anxious to see it. The cast was perfectly chosen from the legendary Michelle Yeoh and the upcoming Constance Wu, whose potential as a leading lady is undebatable. But also a lot of new up-and-comers like Awkwafina and Henry Goulding. The film was visually stunning. Singapore is beautiful. The fashion was amazing and the pacing of the story was good but I'm afraid the film suffers in aspects of the writing and directing. The story and characters could have went much more in depth. The leading couple's chemistry wasnt fully realized. The Mother's disdain for Rachel wasnt really focused until the very end but it was too quick. The film was needed and I'm glad it was made but I'm not opposed to mixing up the behind-the-scenes teams if it means we will get a more well rounded cast of characters and a more engaging story.Of course, romantic comedies are an acquired taste so if they're not for you, that's okay. But if you a love them like me you will still enjoy this film because its a fun ride, has some great laughs at times and is definitely rewatchable.

292,jg_1977,A bit of a let down,5,16 August 2018,"I truly wanted to like Crazy Rich Asians. I heard almost all good things leading up to it's release, which might have raised my expectations too much, but nonetheless I felt it was a bit of a let down. First, I'll talk about what I liked. The general camera work and cinematography did an excellent job at highlighting the vibrant lifestyles of the characters and showing off the Chinese culture in an incredibly stunning way. The shots of both the Singapore skyline as well as the more intimate shots of the city marketplace made me want to visit very badly. Another plus for this movie is the actress Awkwafina who plays a supporting role. She was without a doubt the funniest part of the whole movie and stole every scene she was in. However, scene stealing wouldn't be particularly hard in this movie as most scenes play out with little to no successful comedy. The lead actress, Constance Wu gives a completely flat performance that conveys neither humor nor accessibility. As the main character, it is a massive issue that she is portrayed as unrelatable and lifeless. None of the other actors do a bad job, but rather aren't given a whole lot to do in terms of acting or comedy (with the exception of Awkwafina). I also had some narrative issues with the story. Worst of all, I felt the main character Rachel had almost no agency in this movie. She goes from scene to scene with stuff happening to her along the way, to which she never responds until the final moments of the film. Like a lot of this movie, she felt very one dimensional and hollow. Another issue I had was the over stuffing of plot threads. I don't want to get into spoilers so I'll leave it vague, but I thought many of the story lines were either poorly set up or didn't tie into the climax in any way. The general story line is fine, a very by the numbers rom-com story, that didn't break any new ground, despite having characters and a setting that are often underrepresented on screen. I think all this surface level story with random side plots could have worked fine if the comedy worked better, but I felt most of the jokes fell flat, my theater got a few chuckles but certainly not what you'd expect. Also, interestingly, there were one or two scenes that made people laugh, however I believe this was unintentional. The scenes seemed to be meant to be taken seriously but were just somewhat ridiculous. I suspect the reason that this movie was unsuccessful to me in having compelling characters or fresh comedy was due to the type of lifestyle the characters lived. Although visually appealing, very few people can relate to the asian billionaires who are described as Chinese royalty. When I think of successful movies that show off another culture in a respectful and honest way, what comes to mind is The Big Sick. It was able to draw you in with characters that are of another culture but still operate on a more simple, grounded lifestyle like most people, making their story more compelling due to the accessibility of it. I'm sad that Crazy Rich Asians wasn't able to work on that level because I think it's an important movie for getting minority representation in four quadrant hollywood movies. Based on what I've seen of other reviews, I might be in the minority on this one, but I can't confidently say you'll like it.",Crazy Rich Asians

297,skniazi7,A Must Watch!,8,12 January 2019,"What a joy it was watching this film. It's brilliant. Well directed, meticulous script and excellent acting by all. Its funny, romantic and heart warming. A definite must watch.",Crazy Rich Asians
298,criti-cally,Over-Hyped Same Old Drama presented in a new way {criti-cally reviews},5,14 March 2020,"Very stereotypical for Asians. Shows Indians in a bad light. Very predictable Cinderella + Gold Digger story. Inaccurate Romance. So what stands out in this movie?Craziness
Ultra Luxury Rich Lifestyle
Comedy
Cinematography
ScreenplayJust these 5 things made a poor script and generic story one of the highest grossing movies. There is lots of crazy antics by these rich Asian snobs like all you can shop bachelorettes, or bachelors on a huge transport ship, or ultra rich weddings. All these craziness adds to the humor and charm of the movie.Of course, there is the Ultra Rich Lifestyle of the Asians shown, like them buying a hotel in London, or huge mansions and rituals. All these make it an interesting watch as I'm sure we all have dreamt of something similar at some point in life. So seeing that, and helps us relive those dreams.Comedy is hilarious. Lots of funny moments and very funny dialogues, even if stereotypical or old. Just the way the comedy plays out on the screen is actually very funny. Kudos to the actors here for doing a great job.Cinematography. Lots of amazing views and shots of the beautiful Singapore. We were going there anyways, so it was even more fun.Screenplay. The timing of the comedy was good. There was drama, good comedy, slight action and partying. All parallel stories connected well and the story flowed without a pause. Overall it was a very well written script.",Crazy Rich Asians
299,CitizenKaneAAAAA,ROMCOM,5,12 September 2018,"There are critics and audiences who said that this film was one of a very few film in hollywood that represent asian and with all asian actors, and it hasn't been done in a long time (jimmy kimmel said that the last film to do this is The Joy Luck Club, nobody counts Life of Pi which was also set in asia and with asian actors tho), some people were disappointed because it only represent the 1% of asian who are crazy rich asian, well the film is set in singapore which is a high developed country, so of course the film would represent singapore in it's true light.So you just can't get it right when the motif of watching this film or even to try to like the film were based on political issues. so i'm just going to review this film purely in a value of entertainment in a form of movie, which is only fair since i also review and rate any other film the same way.it is a romcom, something that i rarely like, every character's streotype, the way the plot revealed, the twists and turns, the dialogue, are working as any other romcom that hollywood have produced before, the difference is the actors that are asians or asian descent, and the conflict that feels very asian. a lot of boring moments but also very funny moments as well, overall, it's a very enjoyable film if you like a light film to watch with your significant other, especially if you love each other, but not my cup of tea.i've been to singapore several times (i live not too far from Singapore) and there are some setting in this film that i've always wanted to visit like the OCBC skyway and that pool in Marina Bay Sands, and i've never been to the street food place in Singapore (idk why!! as i sometimes am a food enthusiast), so if there are anything in this film that made me feel represented as an asian and also a filmmaker wannabe is that these rich filmmakers not only could afford to go to that expensive hotel and skyway but also have the permission to film there lol.",Crazy Rich Asians

301,hayley96,"Crazy bad writing, directing and editing",3,10 February 2019,"There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours. If you watch the DVD you can whittle it down to an hour and a half. This is simply a massive disappointment. A lot of good actors are given cliché after cliché to speak into the camera. Scenes drag or unexpectedly jumpcut. Relationships bloom between people who just met that make no sense. The movie seems to be driving toward a big moment and when it comes, not really a plot point.Great clothes, Singapore is beautiful, and Awkafina is funny. Otherwise, it pretty much sucks.",Crazy Rich Asians

303,PradoCedric,"A superb, fun, entertaining and fascinating romantic comedy that exceeds expectations with an impressive all Asian cast and truly restores the romantic comedy genre",10,15 August 2018,"As much as the romantic comedy genre has been declining over the last decades, Crazy Rich Asian clearly brings back and restore the rom-com genre with a terrific and compelling performances from Constance Wu, Henry Golding as well the ensemble cast but what clearly makes it fascinating and great, was the scene-stealing and stand-out performances from Awkwafina and Ken Jeong. Even a layered and nuanced performance from Michelle Yeoh, elevates the great quality of the film. Furthermore, Crazy Rich Asians is also one of the best rom-coms films since Bridesmaids, Father of the Bride, Bridget Jones's Diary, Love Actually, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and 500 Days of Summer. In addition, it also delivers a worthy film adaptation of Kevin Kwan's novel that Jon M. Chu brings to the table. The production design, costume design as well the editing are also magnificent and outstanding. Even Chu's direction as well as Peter Chiarelli's and Adele Lim's screenplay is also stellar and fascinating, which almost draws comparison to Richard Curtis's direction and screenplay from Love Actually and even some comedic elements to Bridesmaids.The greatest contribution that Crazy Rich Asians had also delivered is the wide representation of an Asian cast within the Hollywood film and is also the first film to feature Asian actors and actresses in over 25 years since The Joy Luck Club. It also creates another major milestone for representation as well a cultural phenomenon, and cultural and iconic legacy with the success for Black Panther for its major representation for blacks as well Wonder Woman for its major representation for women.",Crazy Rich Asians

From Uneven Acting (From underacting to overacting, WHich makes this whole production look much worse), non-exsistent script (Where is the scriptwriters, Is She/He on a holiday while writing this?) to The Directing which his main purpose is to advertising Singapore instead of telling a story through visual.

306,Carrzinho,Perhaps culturally too subtle?,5,25 July 2019,"Disappointing in some ways as this was well reviewed and I had high expectations. I wasn't particularly engaged by the story though it's entirely fine. Where it really let me down is it's just not funny at all. However, I will quite happily accept this movie isn't aimed at me. I have enough movies to watch. While a different culture shouldn't have too much of a bearing on whether a movie should be enjoyable. I've likely watched as many ""world"" movies as traditional western and on the whole prefer them. It does mean I'm likely to miss out on certain more subtle jokes. I can only presume it's littered with them and they frankly went over my head. Otherwise I really am missing something. FIVE",Crazy Rich Asians
307,Love_Life_Laughter,A not such a suprise hit - mild spoilers,10,31 August 2018,"This rewrite on the Cinderella love story pits the Asian over-achieving middle class against the Asian super rich, but the magical charm is intact. For me the break out charmer was the lead actress who manages the requisite transformation from dress-down geek to dress-up stunner with equal aplomb and enthusiastic equanimity. I couldn't take my eyes off her the entire movie. This being Hollywood, I expect never to see her again except in a sequel, but the male lead will be cast again and again, probably in some action flick. I find it more than mildly insulting that this movie, in the spirit of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, is such a ""surprise"" hit. The endless litany of super-hero films targeted to 14 year olds, or ""realistic"" depressing adult-oriented films about the many horrors in our current society, it almost guarantees that when there is a film with a modicum of humor, charm, and mild suspense, targeted to adults, we will come out in droves. While I am happy for the Asian community, I don't see this particular movie as particularly representative of their culture. It's just a clever, well- acted and well-constructed romantic comedy, delivered to an adult audience starved for similar fare. A thoroughly enjoyable romp.",Crazy Rich Asians
308,danwilberforce,Predictable is an understatement,3,16 September 2018,"After seeing the film so adored by critics and having read some of the reviews saying how ground breaking it was I thought, why the heck not.Sadly despite having some of the best Asian actors working today (Gemma Chan and Constance Wu were great!) the film was filled with every cliche in the book. From the disapproving mother and jealous ex girlfriend, to the flamboyant gay fashion icon friend and the quirky comedic sidekick, this film ticks all the romcom boxes, except sadly for the com part, which was mostly lacking (Awkwafina being the film's only real saving grace).The only genuinely intriguing part of the story belonged to Gemma Chan's character Astrid, a welltodo lady trying to navigate a relationship with a husband that doesn't come from money like herself. Sadly it felt like the majority of their story had been left on the cutting room floor in favour of the more generic main storyline.If there is one takeaway to be had from the film though, it's how beautiful Singapore and its surrounding islands are. I can't wait to visit one day. Overall I'd say Crazy Rich Asians is a competent enough romance, that whilst it's not going to blow you away, is at least worth a watch with your significant other on date night, if only for the beautiful scenery. Although I'd probably save your money and wait until its available to stream.",Crazy Rich Asians
309,Lord_of_the_Things,Chuless!!!,5,23 July 2020,"Vapid, soulless and unfunny. It felt like I was watching a cheesy soap opera. Money, money, money is basically all this film offers. The story is uninteresting, the characters are weak and the writing is lame.Constance Wu and Michelle Yeoh are good, but it's a small conciliation.The fact that this movie appears on the 1001 movies list, among other recent additions in the last few years, renders the list to be a bit of a joke.

I enjoyed the film as it played out, but it was rote. I enjoyed the performances by Constance Wu and Henry Golding as the leads. The rest were all standard best friend, cold mother tropes done many, many times before. This is an elaborated, more expensive Hallmark channel romance. There were no surprises, and it lacked an oomph that would make me recommend it. I only give it 6 because of Henry Golding, who is an up and comer I want to see more of!",Crazy Rich Asians
312,AJx91,Asian Cinderella and Mean Girls,7,22 May 2021,"This is just a less kid friendly version of Disney's ""Cinderella"" with a ""Mean Girl"" twist. Starring a almost Asian cast. It is full of narcissistic eye candy; ranging from wealth, fashion, beautiful scenery, and the actor's/actress's model like physiques and facial structures. Which makes this film hard to relate to, but to be fair. The same thing can be said about shows like ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians,"" ""Love & Hip Hop"", and ""Basketball Wives."" However people still enjoy these.The comedy isn't bad. But the romance needs some work. When it comes to romance you would be better off watching a Kdrama or netflix's ""To All The Boys.""Other than that, there is nothing new being done in this movie. So I can't see how it could get a 8, 9, and 10 stars. However it isn't all that bad.

It's moving and hilarious, and tells about reality. it's a funny drama film about real love, not like those boring love stories with the same script or message! I won't tell anything about the directing, editings ...etc nevertheless the film is well done, the actings are good enough to make it the family film we've been waiting for.",Crazy Rich Asians
314,austinfromdahood,"Probably won't win any oscars, but it is still a monumental film",8,2 September 2018,"Being born and raised in an asian family, I was obviously excited for Crazy Rich Asians. It was a movie I've been waiting for, a movie with an all asian cast. And sitting in the movie theatre, I was beyond hyped, and Crazy Rich Asians really delivered. Starting off with one of the movie's best aspects, the humor. Crazy Rich Asians is a really funny movie and their jokes are original because it comes off as making fun of asian stereotypes ins a really good and funny way. I could relate to many of the jokes done in the movie because those jokes happens in my family and it's really funny especially for the people that understand the asian tropes and stereotypes. I also thought the acting from these asian actors were outstanding. Some of the actors and actresses in this movie are in their first acting roles, and they really perform in this movie. I really think Constance Wu, Henry Golding and Awkwafina are the best actors in this movie because they all are funny and serious in times where they need to be, and we the audience can relate to them in many ways. The plot is something we've seen before, but the movie feels very different because the delivery emphasizes asian culture, and that hasn't been expressed in a movie for a while. Some flaws I had with the movie is a subplot with a few family members and the pacing of the first act. The subplot is this affair with a man and a women and they are related to Henry Goldings character's family members. Even though this subplot kind of relates to the main plotline, I still felt like it was unnecessary. They just bring it up at random times and the whole movie would've been better if either they toned down the subplot a bit or completely removed it. The first act felt very slow paced because nothing was really going on. We are just introduced to the characters, parts of the plot, and a few potential conflicts that could occur in the movie, but it was introduced in such a bad way because I didn't feel too invested into the plot and if they elaborated more, it could've been better. Nevertheless, Crazy Rich Asians is a really entertaining movie that I can relate to btw I cried at the end pls watch it because it's great. 8/10",Crazy Rich Asians

317,PhatManBad,The First Act Of A Movie That Never Ends,3,9 June 2021,"Plenty of pretty Asians, pretty houses, and pretty clothes. That's it.It's hard to tell if the acting is good or not, because no one really acts human. They're not robots exactly, but (like every other romantic comedy) the characters are extremely hollow. Like I said, there's plenty of attractive Asians in this movie. Several of them have sexy British accents for some reason. And they're all rich. What else is there to say?I'm trying to find the best way to describe this movie. A really long movie trailer? A neverending montage? Most of the movie consists of endless introductions to characters. It's like the wedding scene in Goodfellas.The plot is exactly what you'd expect: an ""average"" woman falls in love with an impossibly rich, handsome man. She meets the family. His mother instantly disapproves of her son's ""average"" girlfriend. Then other stuff happens and then it ends.Like most romantic comedies, the jokes are bland and annoying: Ken Jeong has wacky hair, wears wacky clothes, and says wacky things. Awkwafina has wacky hair, wears wacky clothes, and says wacky things. And there's a fat nerd with a bowl haircut and it's funny because he's a fat nerd.It's another movie that's technically not terrible, but you kind of wish it was because it would be more entertaining. But everyone and everything looks gorgeous.The perfect movie for people who love shallow romantic comedies.",Crazy Rich Asians
318,davekeanu,crazy but enjoyable,8,2 October 2018,I really love the movie's setting being set in Singapore which is a country I go on holiday every now and again. The characters are great and interesting and the story is great as well. oh by the way this has got the actress who play jessica from fresh off the boat which is a tv series I really enjoy when I have the time to watch it. I was not fund of the mother that much as she was trying to ruin her son and girlfriends relationship. But I am glad things worked out in the end. so if you are looking for a movie being set in singapore this is the movie for you overall I really enjoyed it. 8/10,Crazy Rich Asians
319,bobandlulureview,Predictable!,4,19 October 2018,"The movie is based on a book of the same name penned by Kevin Kwan. It has Michelle Yeoh (of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Memoirs of a Geisha, Tomorrow Never Dies fame) in it and features an all Asian cast. This is Henry Golding's (the male protagonist) first film.
PLOT: Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an Economics Professor NYU is dating Nick Young (Henry Golding) unaware of the fact that Nick comes from a crazy-rich family who are real estate tycoons in Singapore. Nick has to travel to Singapore to attend his best friend's wedding and decides to take Rachel along and introduce her to his family. Rachel comes to know about Nick's affluent background and with the help of her Singaporean friend Goh Peik Lin (Awkwafina) tries to fit into Nick's family. Nick's mother, Eleanor Young (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't hide her disdain for Rachel. She disapproves of Rachel's background, economic status and the fact that Rachel has her roots in the US and that she is passionate about her work. To make things worse, Nick's friends consider her a gold digger. This creates a rift between Rachel and Nick.
Will Nick's family accept Rachel for who she is? Will Nick and Rachel work things out or will Nick choose to stay back in Singapore and join his family business?
Does the plot sound all too familiar to our Indian audience? Boy takes Girl to meet his rich family. Girl, being from a lower social stratum doesn't meet their approval. Girl is shunned by Boy's family and friends and not to forget the baddie in such storylines- the mother in law. Spoiler alert for those not familiar with such storylines - Girl then reveals her goodness by some act of benevolence, good wins over the 'not so good' , Boy proceeds to cheesy proposal with the blessing of his family. Boy happy, Girl happy.
The movie is fully Bollywood ishtyle, complete with songs and Cinderella-esque makeover of the female protagonist because it's important to look pretty. Who cares that you are a Professor at NYU.
If I were to keep the storyline aside and review the movie for what it is, I'd say the movie is average- a typical rom-com 'time-pass' movie. When I watched the trailer of this movie, it reminded me of Monster-in-law, which has a similar storyline. Now, that movie was HILARIOUS. The title is a misnomer. Yes, the movie does involve rich Asians, but I was expecting to see crazy toys and exorbitant splurges especially with a wedding involved in the film. On that front too it was disappointing.
Besides Michelle Yeoh, the other actor you'd recognise is Ken Jeong (Hangover). Sadly, he's been given the role of a shady father who hits on his daughter's friend. His role is minor and failed to evoke any laughter.
Michelle, Constance, Henry and Awkwafina have acted well. However, the story was predictable, the movie not funny enough and sadly there wasn't any vulgar display of wealth to leave us flabbergasted.
When Rachel is first introduced to Henry's mother, Eleanor mentions that Henry's father is out of town on a business trip. I was expecting the father to be the hero of the film (figuratively) by making an appearance towards the end, standing up to his wife and reuniting the lovers. I have been so accustomed to our films where we've had our sanskaari Alok Nath follow the righteous path and protect our frail women from harassment. I was wrong!",Crazy Rich Asians

321,Yee_Reviews,A Typical Rom-Com but a Fresh Take with an All Asian Cast,7,10 August 2018,"Good: The scenery and setting are gorgeous filled with vibrant colors depicting the wealthy lifestyle of the families. For the most part, the acting is solid, but can get over the top in order to portray extravagantly rich family stereotypes. The film is well paced and the editing helps provide an upbeat and entertaining tone. There are some nods to Asian culture, and the film will resonate with younger as well as older generations.Bad: There is minimal originality or creativity in the storyline. Some jokes try too hard and end up falling flat. The movie is generic and the story does not differ much from other romantic comedies. Overall: The film does a solid job with an all Asian cast and provides eye pleasing scenes. The story line is common to other romantic comedies. The main thing making it fresh is the cast and cultural introductions. Asians will be pleased with the humorous winks and appreciate their REPRESENTATION within the movie.3.3/5",Crazy Rich Asians

They were pleasant enough but the over the top stereotypes were a little too typical.
I was looking forward to seeing Singapore showcased, as it is a favourite holiday spot of mine. This did not disappoint. The Singapore street scenes were well photographed and conveyed the variety of life in this bustling capital. At times I wondered whether the Singapore Tourist Authority had made the film as an advertisement to encourage visitor.

Sure it has funny moments and is well choreographed but it is so cliche and fake and in many ways horrible how they are portrayed in this movie. There is not one ugly or normal looking Asian in the entire movie! The music score is like a Disney movie or Dallas series.
So much overacting, superficial, materialistic, over-smiling and fake ""perfect"" people. And it's wonderful that it's possible to make a movie like this but it is not my cup of tea. It's reminds me of scrolling through Instagram of oversaturated filters on top of wannbe rich people.
Apart from some of the main characters doing a good job of acting I'm so annoyed how perfect everything is in this movie but also at the same time so much out of place. It feels like an American interpretation of how it is in Asia. Makes no sense!
You could have made this movie into a series with crazy rich Americans, crazy rich brits and so on. It would be more of the same movie with other faces.
It just feels like a typical high school movie with teenagers comparing breast sizes and so forth. No real depth or interesting story - not even a feel of what real love is... I am just glad that the movie score makes it feel like you want to watch just 2 min more - it gave me hope.Sure it's well made and it's clear to see the movie budget was big but that doesn't make it a good movie.

341,kevinthecritic,"Crazy Rich Asians: Romantic Dramedy Promotes Positive Representation, Despite Flaws",7,25 August 2018,"3.5/5 stars (Above Average)Crazy Rich Asians is a pretty big deal. Not only is it a mainstream film promoting positive representation of Asian culture, but it is also a funny, sweet, and sometimes thought-provoking look at the bonds of family. Anyone expecting this to be a turn-your-brain-off yuk fest will surely be disappointed, but for people who go in with an open mind, Crazy Rich Asians should be a mostly satisfying experience.Economics professor Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) and her boyfriend Nick Young (Newcomer Henry Golding) have seemingly have the perfect relationship. Rachel is a hard-working middle-class Chinese-American, and Nick is secretly an ultrarich guy who chooses to live frugally rather than embrace his family's lifestyle. This secret is blown when Nick is named best man at a friends' wedding, choosing this function to introduce Rachel to his family. Now, Rachel must learn to mingle with the disapproving Youngs, especially, Nick's tightly traditional mother (Michelle Yeoh), with supportive best friend Goh Peik Lin (A sometimes annoying Awkwafina) in tow.Crazy Rich Asians mostly works. Many of the characters come off as flawed and relatable human beings rather than easy stereotypes for us to laugh at. Constance Wu and Henry Golding have great romantic chemistry, and Michelle Yeoh provides Nick's mother with more depth than initially expected. I understand where she's coming from in her dislike of Rachel and can sympathize with it while still disliking her, a tricky feat to balance. The soundtrack is also solid and some stylish visuals kept my engagement when present without overstaying their welcome.On the negative side, Goh Peik Lin feels more like a borderline ghetto caricature than a regular person, along with a flamboyantly gay cousin Oliver (Nico Santos). The actors do well, but I don't understand why a movie that is so good at representing Asians as regular people would stoop to those stereotypes for comedy's sake. Goh Peik's brother also takes pictures of Rachel creepily in an uncomfortable running gag given the current political climate (which I would love to stop thinking about at the movies). However, these issues did not detract too much from my enjoyment of the film as a funny and occasionally resonant romantic dramedy.All in all, Crazy Rich Asians is an enjoyable romantic dramedy with mostly solid performances, a respect for Asian culture, and a great step forward for proper representation of minorities onscreen. Jon M. Chu's stylish direction helps the slower moments, the soundtrack is toe-tapping, and the characters have unexpected layers. However, Awkwafina and the gay character's stereotypical portrayals do not fit in this movie, and, while not film-breaking, keep it from being one of the best of the year. Despite these problems, I still recommend this film. See it.Rated PG-13 For Some Suggestive Content and Language",Crazy Rich Asians
342,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,Love and laughs from literature,7,10 August 2018,"No, I'm not talking about Fifty Shades of Grey!The romantic comedy genre is a flavor that gets a bad rap for being one-note and heavily playing on sappy/silly tropes, even if that is not always the case. I have learned to expand my horizons when it comes to the genre and fit more good titles in there that don't necessary hit that mark. Last year, we were graced with the best of the genre staple I've seen in a long time in The Big Sick because of its strong writing. I am pleased to say that we have a winner again this year, and a lot of it has everything to do with how the editing complements the writing and directing.Crazy Rich Asians is an entry that treads lightly on both the romance and comedy (there are plenty of laughs to be had, I just never got an abs workout or fell out of my chair is all) and instead delivers a story built around culture, respect and trust, taking pages from Meet the Parents and The Devil Wears Prada. It is an absolutely accessible film for all audience members, even if they might have had *ehem* so good of a time that I couldn't hear some lines because of the overdrawn laughter from others. Through framing, editing and choice of music, director Jon Chu finds a way of bringing about action in a film that is entirely devoid of it. He really highlights Singapore as a character in the film full of vibrancy and vivacity, claiming set-pieces to dictate entire acts of the story. There is a lot of symbolism that is foreshadowed very subtly, and almost everything has a payoff instead of making the audience question what a certain setup was meant for. We get to see the crazy-rich invite us to their fantastical routines as side-characters like Awkwafina hilariously bask it all in and takes nothing for granted. We envy their possessions, even if we may not envy their lifestyle.The first 1/3rd of the film is wide-open throttle on the gas pedal. There are colorful overlays to indicate locations and text messages that mesh with what is going on in the image, and they feel as if they want to arrive to the story about as fast as Get Out. Characters are introduced so fast that you will want to bring a pad and pen to web-diagram the whole thing, but Chu made a smart choice in having the audience remember characters less by their names and faces and more with their actions, like when you play a name game icebreaker with a large unfamiliar group. You start to figure out where people stand on the totem pole (us audience members are clearly at the bottom) and get to enter Rachel's mind while she's absorbing things as a ""fish out of water"" at a breakneck pace, and we have to do the same. This representation may be that of the 1% end of things, but the wealth is only in your face from a glamorizing perspective and is not too in your face with snobbery constructed from their wallet and purse sizes.Once this is all enacted we reach the second 1/3rd of the film, which lets off of that gas pedal and coasts for quite a while. It hit me rather fast like brake lights and I wasn't expecting it, so I called the film out a bit on its inconsistent pace and didn't feel the typical story arc of ""rising action."" Thankfully, what was lost in that art was found in character chemistry and intensity. Our main protagonist couple is a duo worth rooting for as they yearn for a cathartic endgame with one another, despite what morals stand in their way. They drive the story's purpose, but they are on the bland end of personality when it comes to delivering the comedic goods, and this is totally okay; they let those around them bring us most of the character and laughs. A couple of them are thrown in for the cheap shtick, but there are nearly a dozen characters which get the limelight with their own romantic subplots. This ends up being more than just one love story, and normally I would consider this a detriment but this drawn out middle act of the film spends a lot of time establishing tangible and intangible values, and these characters' interactions are a big part of that. We get a lot of conversation regarding the betterment of characters from each side of the proverbial fence that separates rich versus not-rich, Chinese versus American cultures, and wants versus needs. In a movie that could have easily only stated messages for an elite class of individuals or specific ethnic group, they spend a long time catering to the other 99% so we can be a part of the journey and not just seeing it from a particular lens. I am purposely leaving out the story's pulse of tension between Rachel and Nick's mother, because I would like for you to strap in and see it all for yourself. As the film puts it at one point: it basically starts to feel like the two characters are playing chicken and they want to see who swerves away first. It doesn't quite reach Stiller vs. DeNiro or Hathaway vs. Streep in their respective film roles, but these two characters have a lot more to say that speaks to us and possible predicaments that we may encounter, especially regarding the ideas of family and what it means to be a part of one beyond the surface level.We transition into the final 1/3rd of the film where I feel the story arc had found its footing again. I was recognizing aspects of resolve taking place, affect brought personal emotions within me to rise more (I started to get the feels when a scene took place where the only thing you hear are the sultry echoes covering an Elvis Presley gem), and although this is a romantic comedy that may hit some of the stereotypes that other ones do, you don't dismiss it as a negative thing because the way we arrive at those points feels organic and validating. I could not predict where this story was going to go or what it wanted me to come home with earlier on, but by the time we hit the credits (there is one minor ""mid-credits"" moment thirty seconds in, in case you intend on leaving your chair immediately) I was completely understanding of Chu's conveyed intent that he displayed within the two-hour runtime. Ironically, his statement exceeds that of the film reel and the novel that this film adaptation is based upon. He is playing chicken with Hollywood, and I think he will strike victory here. Like Black Panther earlier this year and The Big Sick last year, we are beginning to realize that 'serving the underserved' is a good business strategy when there is a story to be told that requires exactly that. I am excited that both this film and Searching (please give that a look in a couple of weeks) is garnishing Asian leads without it feeling like an intolerable offense. Yes, one film is based upon that culture and the other just so happens to utilize characters of that background, but it just goes to show that mainstream audiences are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and come out the other side with smiles on their faces, saying that the film is ""good"" and not needing to bat and eye over the fact that they were not graced on screen with a white male lead. I could have done my review without stating any of this, but I really think this is one part that separates this from many other romantic comedies.From the earlier marketing, I did not expect this movie to win me over. It did, and I think you will feel the same if/when you decide to check this one out. Story-wise I felt some unevenness, but Jon Chu strikes enough visual flair to make a duvet out of a blanket. What could have been a tedious sitting was instead a raucously good time, and I really feel like there is something for everybody here. It is a recommended watch. Go check it out.",Crazy Rich Asians

It's like slave owners having relationship issues - human day to day concerns in the face of an overwhelmingly awful and evil framework.
These Crazy Rich Asians are uniformly horrible, materialistic, shallow, deceitful, and amoral. They are more concerned with brand names, wealth, gratuitous over consumption, and racial purity (does someone come from a ""good "" background) than love, compassion, growth as a person, morality, etc.
One case in point is a mother literally destroying her sons relationship and emotions because she dislikes the background (not ""pure"" bloodline and too poor) of the girlfriend.

348,mshackletonchavez,Rather Standard But Still Entertaining,7,21 December 2018,"While fairly standard, this feature breathes anew light into a generic narrative, along with strong performances from the cast.This movie was nothing remarkable in the narrative or screenplay department, however I understand the whole talk about its more unique cast, being almost entirely of an Asian disposition. However, in almost all other areas, this film was rather more standard, but by no means bad. Quiet the contrary, I believe it to be rather stronger in the romantic-comedy drama, and most definitely a breath of fresh air into one of the most routine and now boring genres.Constance Wu as Rachel Chu was good, not a great performance but certainly good. It was alright, however the same could not be said of Michelle Yeoh as Eleanor Sung-Young. Her performance, contrary to what many believe, I thought to be the stronger one. Her character is definitely more interesting, and had more potential to explore, and was far more defined. The rest of the cast was good, whats more to say of a romantic-comedy, there was all the usuals of the genre: the corny ones, the funny ones, the gay character, the sister/brother who is complicated and the chubby aunts, its all stuff that we've seen before. I say that with the upmost respect, I understand it may be a little crude but it is simply the tropes of the genre, however it is all a used recipe. It works rather well, but beyond that it is fairly standard.Where this film most definitely differentiates itself, and finds its voice within this crowded genre: is it's clear effort to be ethnically and culturally different, while still remaining accessible enough for all audiences, in that regard it is a huge success. I suspect this is why most of the characters, and plot, is fairly generic, it feels like it wants to be accessible, bring audiences into a new world, a new physical environment, that is highly admirable and is worthy of all the praise it has received. This is a great step is representation of minorities within western countries, and for asian cinema. While I dare not delve into politics, I must say that this film is a great breath of fresh air, which is extremely welcomed.The rest of the film is, as I stated before, very generic. The score is forgettable, the costumes were suitably functional and flashy where they needed to be. The costumes were fun the regard that the feature made the effort to look Asian, so there was very interesting designs and patters but still fairly blended into the scene. The set design was very interesting, it incorporated many far eastern designs, and displayed the flashiness and wealth of the characters well. Often times I did notice how good the set design was, quiet above the standard of the romantic-comedy genre.The cinematography was very colourful, and a lot of fun. Though this is normal within the genre, it was made more memorable here due to the setting, and the vibrancy of certain scenes was highlighted very well. The angles were normal, but thats perfectly fine within this genre.What I must criticise was the wealth of fairly useless characters, and others who were extremely generic to the genre. As I stated before, many are things we as viewers have already seen many times before. For a film which clearly wants to stand out, and does, it is somewhat strange to me that they didn't incorporate that huge potential to be revolutionary into its characters, and be more than just another romantic-comedy. It had the potential to be so much more.Overall, this is certainly a unique film in many regards, and a great leap forward for hollywood. Bu it is weighed down by its incredible genericness, and lack of innovation in so many places where it had such great potential to do so. Im almost saying, it didn't go far enough, this film could have been even more special. But aside from that, what is present does work, and it works to a charm. This film is very funny, it does have some well crafted characters, and a convincing narrative, along with really wonderful set design. This is a good movie, but disappoints me that it averted a clear potential to be a great one. But is still worth watching, and I give it a 7/10.",Crazy Rich Asians

353,aalleekk1989,"A decent drama, a peep into Asian family affairs",6,14 June 2020,"I see a lot of reviewers here take issue of the casual use of ""Asian"" in the title. While I agree with that in principle, I think it should not be a reason to shoot this film down.This is a decent drama aimed at breaking into white-predominant Western market, and there are many elements designed to make it more easily understood by that group of audience, including the casual use of ""Asian"". In a way, this is a light intro into dating East Asia guys. There is the issue of typical power struggle between daughter in law and the mother, who typically runs the family. Since Asians typically value family unity and respect the opinion of elderly of the family a lot more than most Western cultures, approval from the parents could be a make or break moment for the relationship. A lot of Asian dramas feature or even center around such conflicts. Such family value also leads to more intense internal and external struggle between collectivity (what the family wants) and individuality. Finally, the sake of family benefit is often tied to material measures (impact on wealth and status from the new member). This is exacerbated by the cultural clash, here represented by a very Americanized Asian, of collectivism and individualism.Those above-mentioned topics are typically increasingly pronounced as the family net worth increases, therefore it is understandable that a rich Singaporean family was chosen as the story setup. The scenes of glamorous parties also serve as great material for marketing, and help keep the interest of audience, which might have been otherwise difficult had the film dived too deep into Asian family affairs that other ethnic groups have little touchpoint with. I do not agree with some of the reviews suggesting that the point is to flash the money - quite the contrary, it plays more of a supporting role in the film. However, those comments do show that they did distract the audience from the main story/message.Overall it is an entertainment film, not a social critique or culture study documentary, and for that it is decently made. The main actresses did a brilliant job, but the rest of the pack fell rather flat or even failed quite badly. The camera work was pretty good and, together with the nice cars and beautiful architectures, helped partially cover up the shortcoming of acting. The development of the plot is rather obvious and predictable, and there is not enough relationship-building to support the story. The couple show a lot of affection towards each other but the audience cannot see where that comes from. The protagonist most definitely acted like a NYU economic student rather than a professor (due to the script writing, not the acting). It is the right step for Asian community in the entertainment business, but there is still a lot work to be done. This film can be a good pass time but not a must watch.",Crazy Rich Asians

355,notaprincess9,Thumbs up for the asian casting but..,6,8 November 2018,"It was nice to see a film full of asian actors come out since asians are under-represented on TV and in films. One of my first thoughts was asians calling people from other races racist because they can't tell asians apart (Japanese from Koreans etc). But I clearly saw the casting wasn't Chinese as they claimed in the movie. Checking their IMDB pages I see most of the actors are Taiwanese and Malaysian. But instead of hiring actual Chinese actors that don't have to pretend to be Chinese, they hired people from other asian countries to pretend they look like they're Chinese, which they obviously don't. So that was a disappointment.Now I won't get into the superficial aspects of the film or gold-digging other reviewers have mentioned, because I have a feeling they will say bad things about every movie featuring wealthy people. If a movie features wealthy protagonists they'll start ranting about capitalism, nepotism, gold-digging, blowing the viewer's mind with lots of money and fancy cars to make you like it etc. But is a movie supposed to never be about wealthy people in order to not make poor viewers mad? I am definitely not rich and I didn't mind the movie's approach. Sure it was based on many stereotypes but don't tell me there aren't controlling asian parents who dictate who their son will marry or what their job will be or rich asians who look down upon anyone who isn't as rich. The movie doesn't portray everyone like that, for example Astrid, the couple that wed etc.It was cliche in the sense that it followed the standard structure of a rom-com. Couple meets, falls in love, obstacles appear, they split for a little while, but their love is so strong they overcome the problems and make up. But it is a rom-com, not a drama..so I was expecting the ending.

Unfortunately my crazy Asian is not one of the rich ones, so I really couldn't relate to much of anything in this movie.The concept had some potential, as the idea seems kind of interesting. But this movie is just so incredibly predictable and boring that it's almost beyond belief. If you've ever seen (or even just heard of) Cinderella, you know everything there is to know about the story. All that's missing from this one is a magic pumpkin and a glass slipper.I gave it 4 stars because my wife and son laughed a few times--although it did seem that the laughs were few and far between. I also thought the ending (predictable as it was...) was handled pretty well.Looking at the reviews, I find it fascinating that people either love it or hate it, without many in the middle. I have to say that I'm baffled by the ""love it"" group, and I suspect that the producers hired an army of reviewers to post hyper-positive reviews (I'm joking!). A lot of the positive reviews that I read say things like, ""the story is not that great, but the acting is really good."" I have to say that most of the acting does seem solid, but the most important character of all (i.e., Cinderella herself) strikes me as pretty wooden throughout.But, it is the negative reviews that I find particularly fascinating. Most of the extremely negative reviews seem to have been written by enviro-Nazis who hate the movie because of the environmental damage that they imagine happening as a result of all of that conspicuous consumption, or by people who are so politically correct that any movie about Asians would surely offend, or by people who are just jealous of the rich, in general.

364,yaseenfawzi,"""Crazy Rich Asians"" Review",7,20 September 2021,"""Crazy Rich Asians,"" based on a best-selling trilogy by Kevin Kwan, makes Hollywood history as one of the first major Asian-American-centered films in recent years. The story focuses on Rachel, a young Chinese-American woman traveling to Singapore to attend her boyfriend Nick's best friend's wedding. While meeting Nick's family, she is surprised to learn he is actually the scion of the Young family, one of Singapore's wealthiest, as well as being a highly sought-after bachelor. This puts Rachel at risk of facing jealousy from everyone else she meets, including Nick's mother Eleanor, who is absolutely determined to break Nick and Rachel up.Directed by Jon M. Chu, the film primarily centers on the conflicts between the Young family's traditional Singaporean values and Rachel's fish-out-of-water upbringing as a Chinese-American. However, the tone feels somewhat uneven, as if it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a lighthearted romp, nasty satire, or intimate character study. For the most part, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" falls back on standard Hollywood romantic comedy cliches, right down to the last-minute declaration of love on an airplane. Some of the supporting characters, including Rachel's friend Peik Lin Goh (Awkwafina), and the flamboyant fashion designer Oliver (Nico Santos), also come across as a bit too broad in their characterizations. There are a few intimate moments between Nick and Rachel scattered throughout, along with the dramatic subplot between Astrid and Michael, but Chu seems more inclined to showcase just how ""crazy rich"" this family is through montages and music video-lite depictions of excessively East Asian materialism. The wild nature of Vanja Cernjul's bright and colorful cinematography and the rapid-fire editing by Myron Kerstein don't really cool down until the last-third, when the more dramatic elements come into play.Thankfully, what saves this movie is the cast itself. Constance Wu and Henry Golding have good chemistry as Rachel and Nick, both of whom serve as the primary focus. Michelle Yeoh gives off an intimidating streak in Eleanor, the domineering matriarch, while Gemma Chan shines as the well-off but dependably self-aware Astrid. Ken Jeong is surprisingly (and appreciatively) restrained in his brief appearance as Wye Goh Mun, Peik Lin's father and Lisa Lu, plays Shang Su Yi, Nick's grandmother, with a potent touch of sensitivity. The Singaporean high-life culture is in full swing here, as we see numerous shots of its delectable delicacies and establishing shots of its high-rise buildings, cruise ships, and pools overlooking the skyline. There are also some visual jokes that work well, including one where Peik Lin is picking out her best party dress. The soundtrack features a richly effective mix of popular Western tunes sung in Mandarin and local Asian pop hits, which makes the montage-crazy action feel at least more appropriately cohesive.Although the authenticity of its Asian cast and culture is a major breakthrough, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" puts far too much emphasis on the ""crazy rich"" part to make it anything more than a charmingly upbeat experiment.",Crazy Rich Asians

I wasn't sure what to expect but I do like movies which are set in different countries so I gave it a go. It was funny, romantic and heart warming.

367,lamiaaos,A mellow ride,5,20 August 2018,"The all-Asian cast may have been refreshing to see on the big screen and a much needed change, but this does not redeem how uninspiringly ordinary this film is. 
The storyline is far from being original; in fact, it is quite the contrary, seeing as how it is about a modern day cinderella. 
The acting itself was quite banal and every scene proved as uneventful as the preceding one, with the exception of maybe one that may stir a pinch of emotion in the audience, but not nearly enough to change the overall lack of impact this movie's story really has in general.
All in all, this film adds nothing novel to its predecessors in the romcom genre, but it is a lightweight moderately entertaining film that should not be taken too seriously.",Crazy Rich Asians

A bunch of shallow stupid mega-rich people with nothing interesting to say drinking champagne in gigantic houses and slithering around in slinky designer clothes. And really, how did her mother never know her boyfriend's family was that famous and rich after she dated him for a year and they were so 'close'? Predicable ending. Cute lead actress who is supposedly a brilliant professor but she hardly showed her brains to say anything clever during this movie. Jokes and gags fell flat.

I was skeptical because it looked funny but award. However, when I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I did enjoy it for most parts. But then, the movie started to make me angry. I didn't like how hateful Nick's family was towards his fiancee Rachel. I felts so bad for Rachel. The movie is beautiful cinematography ,location, and the food. The rich lifestyle made me hate myself of how I don't have lavish lifestyle. Here are the parts I hated. First, was when Rachel was at a Bachorlette party at the beach and she sees a room with a dead fish and a note on the window as a murderous note written in fish blood. GROSS!!!!! Second, when Rachel and nick were making diner and Nick's mother was talking about tradition and being racist towards Rachel about being American as well as not being good enough for Nick. Third, when Rachel was called to talk to Nick's mother and grandmother they ambushed her about her private life and revealed they have been spying on her for months!!!! What kind of family does that??!!!! Lastly, this movie is so cliche, Rachel leave Nick in tears goes to her friend's mansion all depressed for ""weeks or days"". Her mother shows up and talks to her about the past. Rachel goes to Nick only to turn down his proposal! Rachel talks to his mother while gambling. Then, she leaves on a plane only to find Nick right behind her. He proposes AGAIN!!! she says yes. Why is that scene ripping off Casablanca??!!!! Yes. All the sudden the whole family NOW wants to be nice to Rachel when they were being morons towards her. I didn't like this movie. I'm not racist. I'm happy this movie has an all-Asian cast. However, it's so cliche and predictable!!! The movie tries way too hard to be funny! I don't understand all the positive reviews of this movie. It's just your typical romantic-wedding comedy just all Asian. The characters were so forgetful! My girlfriend loved this movie, but I didn't. I like good romantic comedies but this one bites the dust! It's predictable, too over the top, cliche, and heartless. There are some characters I do like in this movie. Except for Nick's family! It's just a decent movie that your dates will love. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or something original. The trailers failed to showcase this movie. I hope this movie doesn't get a sequel. In the future, can Hollywood please make more original diverse and groundbreaking movies??!!! Therefore, If you like this movie. I will not judge you. There are better romantic wedding comedies than this",Crazy Rich Asians

The film was shot in Singapore and made good use of the beautiful scenery. It was also nice to see an all Asian cast, although it was clear that the actors were not all Chinese (as was described in the movie). But culturally, the film was spot on. They charmingly captured the struggle for independence that most Asian children undergo at some point to separate themselves from their over-bearing parents. The movie uses the protagonists to compare and contrast the American mentality to what I will broadly describe as the immigrant mentality, without taking sides. Overall, I think this film was entertaining while also being educational and relatable.",Crazy Rich Asians
376,jwkc2,A rallying cry for class warfare,5,26 September 2020,"Crazy Rich Asians is just wealth porn built around a middling rom-com. All I see is the suffering of the working classes and the corrupt decadence of the wealthy.The opening scene is downright absurd. As a Brit of Oriental descent, Britain's never been that racist as depicted, and certainly never in 1995. At worst, I could imagine the working class porters making a sneering racist remark under his breath, or when he thought he was out of earshot.The idea that a professor of economics isn't respected and admired is nonsense. Asians love elite education - Singapore was built by a Cambridge maths genius and their government still pays for lots of Singaporeans to study there. Professors certainly aren't broke and no strangers to mixing with high-net-worth individuals e.g. University donors.Not introducing yourself as an economics professor at NYU to a Princess that published a paper you want to discuss is bonkers. In fact, you've probably already met at a conference.No-one gets into Cambridge to study law only to quit because they got married. No-one.Focussing on only one ethnic group in Singapore is utterly unrealistic.Singapore is a nation of immigrants. Why would the mother have a problem with being immigrant such that Rachel would bring it up?'Asian' only means Oriental in the USA... which is a problem for the non-US world.The real problem with the film is that it's really a film about Asian Americans, not Asians.",Crazy Rich Asians

No this isn't My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Meet the Parents or Guess Who's Coming to Dinner or...you get the picture.Point being, on its surface, there is nothing special about the story in Crazy Rich Asians and yet it still manages to transcend that shortcoming by excelling in nearly every other area. The cast is engaging and charming, the setting of Singapore is a fresh and interesting setting for a North American made film to utilize, and the visuals pop with color and life! You'll probably be able to call out the story points before they land, but there's just so much effort and energy thrown at the mediocre narrative that it's practically impossible to be bored. Instead of being a bog-standard romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians feels like a celebration of standard romantic comedies!The cast is all very capable, but Awkwafina runs away with every scene she's in. Standout role right there! The story errs on the side of overcrowding, they could have probably left a couple extended family story threads on the cutting room floor but overall there's very little to critique.Except for one gigantic factor.The movie as a whole is a sweet, kindhearted affair and that's a bit of a problem. It's the tale of an American being thrust into the high wealth upper class of Singapore; a country known for its authoritarian oppression, rigid class divide, and corrupt government. We're talking about everything from fines for chewing gum in public, the death penalty for petty crimes, limitations on public gatherings, erasure of their indigenous peoples and culture...the place is, on a fundamental legislative level, a prison. Bringing an American into the high, privileged end of such a country and forcing them to struggle with the divide between the well-to-do and the so called ""common folk"" could easily provide a strong emotional undercurrent for the narrative to rest on. To make matters worse, a character spouts a brief history of the country which is a revisionist part-lie embraced and promoted by the current government. The movie never bothers to contest blatant propaganda like this. Ignoring this aspect of Singapore and instead just using it as an exotic backdrop for a bog-standard love story feels naive at best or purchased propaganda at worst.But hey, that's probably just me. I could easily level similar criticisms of any film set in the United States of America, with it's continuing worldwide list of inflicted atrocities, so why am I holding this movie to a different standard?That's just it, I suppose. Because it's different, it was championed as this great step made in cinematic representation. To a point it really is, it's hard to find wide release films featuring an all Asian cast and it must certainly get credit for that on top of being a fine example of its genre.Crazy Rich Asians, on its own terms, is a frivolous delight. But for me personally, its careful omissions muddy the aftertaste.

We get to see how both parties view each other's values and acknowledge their advantages (sometimes reluctantly).But viewers would be mistaken if they thought this film only had cultural and romantic undertones. This film also adds a healthy dose of humor, familial love, romantic love, and girl-power messages. It also mirrors movies of similar plots such as Prince & Me. Complete with the signature subgenre trope - a makeover scene. But above-all, we get to see the intelligence and integrity of some of the main women in the film.I thoroughly enjoyed the film and all the messages it touched on. However, there weren't many added elements (besides the setting) that made this feel above-and-beyond the genre it sits itself in.

These two attributes are not mutually exclusive. You can be both. And therein lies the conflict in the movie. Eleanor had not been deemed worthy to join the Young family. Chances are she was not. Because in her older years her pettiness and divisiveness prove her unworthiness. You cannot change you who are. Eleanor remained the same person she was when she was young. Her modern day equivalent in the movie is Michael, Astrid's husband. As Astrid says to him 'I cannot make you what you are not.'",Crazy Rich Asians
403,greggs_nbacon,"Basic, but well done.",7,17 September 2018,"As I was going to the movies the other night to see BlackkKlansman, a woman stopped me. She was an Asian woman. She looked at me sheepishly and said, ""Pardon me, I've never been to the movies before. Would you help me buy my ticket?"" I assisted her on the machine. She was so grateful, smiled, and shook my hand as she walked into her showing of Crazy Rich Asians. This is why minority representation in Hollywood is important.
Crazy Rich Asians tells the classic Cinderella story and takes it to modern times. Boy meets girl, girl falls in love with boy, boy turns out to be rich as hell. The film indulges in all of the luxuries from Kevin Kwan's novel, on which the film is adapted. There's the first class flights, the expensive weddings, and other various obvious showings of that great Asian wealth that Yeung family has procured. The real twist here is that the film features the first all Asian cast in a Hollywood film in over 25 years. Crazy Rich Asians opens brilliantly with the perfect middle finger to all of the racism and backlash it has received. A racist hotel manager refuses to believe that the Yeung family has enough money to stay in the hotel. It shows the family scared, all huddle in the phone booth outside as rain falls upon them. When the family returns, entirely drenched, they are now the owners and proprietors of the hotel, as Eleanor Young (Micheel Yeoh) smiles to the audience. It is the perfect opening to a film that takes on such a difficult yet amazing task of inclusion and diversity.
 The film has its moments of absolute brilliance as previously mentioned. Seeing Asian culture and sensibilities portrayed in such an honorable and non-stereotypical way is refreshing. However, the film failed to escape from the classic romantic comedy tropes that we have seen time and times again as viewers. The leading lady is pretty, but not gorgeous. She is insecure about how she presents to her boyfriend, who is ungodly attractive and has been with tons of beautiful, yet interpersonally unappealing women. He finds the one he wants, despite their differences in social class and standing. All along the way, the girl is increasing her external beauty, as a total loss of complete feminism. This tells the female viewer that if you aren't wearing the right clothes, and look the part, you have no success at love. All along the way, the oddball, yet humorous and encouraging friend steals every scene as the far more interesting and in-depth character. This isn't to say that Awkwafina isn't absolutely brilliant at her role, and doesn't have one of the brightest young futures of anyone in show business, but it feels overplayed.  The madcap insanity of this movie, followed by its basic poignancy is something to be appreciated. The film has been a smash hit at the box office, proving that diversity really does sell. Pay attention, Hollywood! Overall, Crazy Rich Asians is an enjoyable movie, but no great feat to write home about.Grade (7.5/10)",Crazy Rich Asians

405,janefgdoe,Disappointed,6,6 January 2019,"After hearing a lot of good reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I shouldn't have.First and foremost, the only Asian thing in the movie is the title. Seriously, this movie could work just as well if you exchange the Asians for Russians or Africans or whatever. Without changing a word from the script, just the last names and the name of the city. Nothing more. It's as white-washed as it gets. And not in a good way.Second, the plot is remarkably vain. One would expect some rich people to be superficial and stupid, but come on, all of them? And even Rachel, who is a PhD, doesn't confront them on this and instead decides to play along? I kind of assumed she did it, because being submissive is her way to show respect, but it just doesn't make much sense for her as a character.Third, the romance, the twist, everything is like out of a fairy-tail. Only, everyone is Chinese. It's all very plain and not distasteful enough to be funny. It's like a modern fairytale. I guess that's why so many people liked it, but still, I don't feel it was worth my time. If I really have nothing better to watch- sure, why not, the actors are pretty enough and everything is posh enough. But it's not what I expected.",Crazy Rich Asians

-family disapproves of scrappy down to earth girl
-family and friends try to sabotage relationship
-Asians (as if they're all the same) disapprove of the ""Americanize"" girl's values
-Let's sit around the table, learning lessons while making dumplings
-Let's sit around the table, learning lessons, while playing mahjong
-couple breaks up, man admits he was wrong, proposes marriage, but 
-she's so noble of character (guess 'cause she's Americanized) she turns him down rather can compromise her values. 
-eventually the family relents and accepts her ... wee!It's been years since I've seen a more predictable, formulaic movie. There was nothing unique about this film except the ""Asian"" part. If the cast was Eurocentric, Afrocentric or anything else, this would not have been made. It's too stupid. The actors did a fine job, given the stilted nature of the wall-to-wall clichés, and Singapore looked nice, but I felt like my intelligence was being insulted. Frankly, I was embarrassed.

411,SCManCA,Predictable and cliche,4,20 January 2020,"A predictable movie that can't be seen as anything more than just a typical romantic comedy. But not a very provocative or clever one. Certainly romantic comedies are not meant to delve too deeply into the psyche of human behavior, but it would be kind of nice to see one that is like that on occasion.This movie did not live up to that. And certainly has a lot of irritating pieces to it. And not only in the vapid behavior of its participants. Those characterizations were all equally predictable and a pretty tired caricature at this point.Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world. It stands to reason that there will be a lot of very shallow people there. Shallowness knows no cultural limits. For those saying how ""western"" it is, again, money screams no matter what part of the world you're in. London, Singapore, Hong Kong, New York, LA. It doesn't matter. White westerners don't have the monopoly on shallow. It's part of human nature for a lot of people who have it.As for the abs. The majority of the hot guys are from money. They're in the early part of adulthood. That's all they have to worry about at that point is going to school, spending their family's money, and working out at the gym. The ladies...all they have to do is work out to keep their svelte bodies and don themselves in expensive designer wear. Shopping is what they do.The most irritating thing about the movie for me were the lead characters. Though a romantic comedy, I'm not rooting for either of them.She is supposed to be such a decorated, intelligent young college professor, yet she talks like a Valley Girl, and gets all cutesy emotional at every turn. For someone who is supposedly so smart and connected with who she herself is, she comes off rather insecure and juvenile at times.And as for him...he is dating her for how long and doesn't trust her enough to tell her who he is? And she has no knowledge of who he is or no interest in finding out. What, does she live in a vacuum? Does this mean that she doesn't really care for him beyond his body and his looks?And funny how when their relationship is exposed at the beginning of the movie to all his friends, we're to believe that's the first time these two have ever been spotted together in NYC? If these ""reporters"" are all so gossipy and savvy when it comes to social media, why is this the first time their relationship is being exposed to all his friends?But back to her. Dude is dating her long enough to want to marry her, and she knows nothing about his family? And yet, she gets over it in no time when he does tell her. I'd be like, what else have you not told me? Again, blinded by his looks, his body, and now his money.If I'm going out with someone for a year and I know nothing about their family, that's a problem. And not real believable to the plot of this movie.Again though, I guess when it's a hot guy with a hot body and money, things are easy to overlook for a lot of women. And we know a lot of women (most?) are like this. A pretty face and a hot body excuses a lot in their eyes. Even though women are very quick to say that it's the guys who are out for one thing.....looks and body, women are just as bad, if not worse, in situations like this. That's why hot guys know how easy women are to manipulate.Strange though how her response becomes like, 'What, was this a test?' He sweet talks her for two seconds, and she's like, 'Okay. Pass the champagne.' Looks-wise though, he's out of her league, IMO, so I guess it's easier for a woman to accept the deception when the groom is prettier than the bride.She's super lucky though. He may have been misleading himself, but when he finds out about her, there's no reason to believe he knows her mother never told her the truth. As far as he's concerned, she was lying to him. Yet he keeps pursuing her and actually has her mother flown in to Singapore.Two misleading people...not a real admirable way to start (or in this case) continue a relationship. These two know nothing about each other. Even after a year. A very odd ending, if not totally forced.Also not real convincing is when she walks away from the mahjong table, she has no emotion whatsoever. But then again, that's probably because she knows it's not over. She has manipulated the situation so she knows that even if she never has a relationship with the mother-in-law, he'll come running after her.And yet a few moments later on the plane she's like 'What are you doing here?' As if she didn't know it was going to end that way.She may not have started out a gold digger, but she became one. Her being all taken by his house at the beginning. And then flaunting the ring on her finger at the end in front of all these people who thought she was a gold digger, but are now suddenly okay with her?Too cutesy.The song at the closing credits though is perfect. 'Money, money, that's all we want.' Certainly fits Rachel's personality. And as someone noted on here, gold diggers get theirs in the end. He will end up cheating on her when things start settling down. And she'll probably become just like the rest of the vapid women this guy has surrounded himself with.",Crazy Rich Asians

As a rom-com it checks some boxes but the script holds it back tenfold. With a moderately paced Act 1 we start to get to the good stuff helmed by creative family intros. You would think the movie will pick up from there and showcase the family and how they relate to the plot itself. 
But that never happens, a lot of things don't happen in this movie as it plays too safe for anything interesting to happen. The climax was at least 1hr and some change into the movie..

420,caleblimsw,Lavish rom-com entertaining but far from profound,6,8 September 2020,"This movie, which could very easily have fallen into many deep and unforgivable trenches, manages to neatly sidestep most of them with a simple premise: what if we focused on just the rich?In a retread of the classic trope of an unconventional love interest, expect everything to be exactly as you think it will be. The cast does a passable job, and where the movie shines is in its heady depictions of the excess of the rich and in admittedly fun sequences of classic gossiping and high-school style backstabbing.Nothing much in this movie ever passes beyond mildly entertaining, with jokes that alternate between funny and flat, fun and nearly fantasy-driven moments of excess, and the occasional burst of late-movie poignancy.What disappoints most is the inability of the screenwriters (or even the original novelist Kwan) to truly integrate this story and its characters into the context its in. As it is, the Singapore context feels more like window dressing; a convenient prop rather than a vital piece of the puzzle.Perhaps not all of this is down to story. Perhaps some of it is down to execution. But as a Singaporean, born and raised, I felt nothing apart from the occasional flare of national pride at appropriate moments. Believe nothing of the representation hype--more Asians is not a reason to praise this movie.The final act toes the line between some profoundness and sheer cliche, and on some level it does make enough sense for the rest of the story. Several greatly unneeded side-characters (Awkwafina's performance is laughably cringy) and limp subplots throughout also spoil some of the movie's otherwise upbeat and entertaining atmosphere.A lack of subtlety in the writing, particularly when it comes to the actions of Eleanor, the matriarch of the rich family, further complicates the matter. The general story is solid, but without any subtlety, it's already mediocre impact is dulled further.Even after a recent rewatch, many details slip my mind when I root around for things to talk about. Expect your experience to be similar: a fun enough, enjoyable ride for a while, full of lavish opulence and occasional sparks of emotional and cultural significance, but in the end nothing more than an above-average rom com destined to fade in your mind right as you leave your seat.",Crazy Rich Asians

Although I started tearing up and was a bit (ahem, VERY) disappointed when Rachel made the brave decision to leave Nick behind with his family in Singapore, I was immediately satisfied when Nick reproposed to Rachel, this time with the gorgeous emerald ring that his mother had been wearing. I think that there are definitely an abundance of plot points that can be followed up with in the sequel, such as how Eleanor came to approve of Rachel, how Rachel adjusts to the married life with Nick, and possibly even the creation of a bigger family between Rachel and Nick, so I am excited to see how the next movie will play out.",Crazy Rich Asians
424,IdgeE,Entertaining but irritating,7,17 October 2021,"I'm torn between saying I liked it and saying it's a travesty. So many things going on here.The plot is immature for the grandiosity that is displayed. All bright lights and shiny stars with no substance.What I liked: The homes and property are breathtaking. The opening scene was personally gratifying. It was nice to see the look on those racists' faces when they saw the family walk through the lobby. That was a good beginning. I appreciated that some of the traditions and customs were explained, this was probably the best part of the movie.What bothers me: When the couple was in the restaurant and decided to take a trip to his family's home, all of a sudden some girl from his past spreads rumors immediately and shakes up his family. Yeah, it's a movie, but who does that? The women in this movie are all portrayed as either jealous and petty, or aggressive b!tche$. Nick's mother Eleanor: her character shouldn't have been such a b!tch to Rachel after the discrimination she incurred years before. An example of how women are portrayed as b!tches. And where was her husband? They could have just said he was dead since he wasn't around and only mentioned in passing. I did want to watch CRA mainly because Michelle Yeoh is in it, and she acted the hell out of her role!Ken Jeong; I do like him A LOT, but that character was an embarrassment, actually the whole family was made to look idiotic. No doubt people are like that in reality, but that was an insult. ALL the women except for Nick's sister, the bride, and Awkwafina's character were obnoxious and petty. Nick's sister: She was sleepwalking through the movie. Which is pretty much what her cheating husband said. Another sad portrayal of women: shallow and one dimensional.The men never did anything stupid or wrong. Even Ken Jeong's character. As obnoxious as he was, he was shown as dedicated to and loving towards his wife and family. Yet we saw many scenes with women being horrible people, like writing on a HOTEL wall with blood from a fish they killed and set on Rachel's bed, uggh.Awkwafina: She's been accused of cultural appropriation, which may very well be true, but I didn't think that in this movie. Unless you count appropriating perceived U. S. behavior. Her character was a rich girl with questionable taste, but she was pretty much the only female who had conviction and stood by Rachel in every way.This is a fairytale movie, which isn't much different than Cinderella. So if you look at it that way, it is easier to follow. I did like it enough to watch it several times, and I teared up at the appropriate moments. It's cheesy and campy but aren't most movies in this genre? At least it's not a tepid Katherine Heigl movie!",Crazy Rich Asians
425,jonnaharkenson,A fun romantic movie!,8,11 May 2021,"It's a good movie to watch, especially for 1st generation Asian Americans whom can relate a little bit to some of the family aspects of the story. I see many people are upset by 1 or 2 things: 1st, they think the movie is about snobby rich people.. and 2nd, some Asians don't like how Asians are portrayed in the movie and think it's not accurate. The movie is really about culture differences, a normal Asian American girl from a poor family meets her rich boyfriend's family (but she didn't know he was rich because he didn't tell her at first). She immediately realizes it's a lot harder than she thinks to fit in, her boyfriend's mom is extremely traditional Asian and looks down on her.. and other women seem to be very jealous that she's marrying him so they bully her. It's about differences in culture (both family and social differences) but in the end, love overcomes all obstacles. I think people are too distracted from the main takeaway here and instead feel very insecure about themselves, hence why they bother to leave a bad review.. the rich and wealthy things they see makes them feel uncomfortable about themselves and the portrayal of Asians they feel don't think matches their own Asian experience. The boyfriend in the story didn't like the fact that he was born rich and had so much pressure from his mom and family, and he doesn't like some of the snobby rich people in their social circle, that's why he left his home country and family to get away to America (and that's how they met), he doesn't care about the money and social status, he just loves his girlfriend for who she is.. so he's trying to make it work with his girlfriend and be together despite all the challenges both of them face and disapproval from people.

429,Providenceyaway,I walked out after 12 minutes,4,26 September 2018,"I've never done that before, but I did for this movie for three reasons:1. Shows scenes that have nothing to do with each other
2. Predictable
3. Void of contentThe opening scene shows a white manager being racist to the main Asian mom TWENTY YEARS before the events of the actual movie take place! How is this related to the main movie? It's not! It's just a random example of how an Asian was discriminated against having almost NOTHING to do with the experience of the son dating an Asian girlfriend. Then we get to the plot, which is drama centered around the British-Asian son dating an American-Asian woman, and it's mind-blowing to the rich Asian community... because he grew up in China and she grew up in America. 
...What?
So already I know the moms will all be jealous, the girls will be dramatic, and the boys will be boys, and nobody acts specifically Asian. Everyone acts like every other rich immigrant community, like we'd all guess. The title's very misleading: no one is crazy, the only actual Asian-Asian characters are all the parents (everyone else is Westernized Asian, even the parents who are all Christians and capitalists), so changing the title more honestly wouldn't have sold as much. Also having a descriptive title wouldn't have sold out, because changing Chinese with, say, a rich European community would be just as bland. And that is also why it's void of content. I read somewhere the writers just wanted Asians to be more accepted in American film, and okay? Does 5% of the American population really need to take up more than 5% of the American screen? Could you have at least written a unique and engaging story along with it, even if it included traditional tropes and stereotypes? Compare this movie to literally anything made in Anime or Asian cinema and television, and you'll see a huge gap in writing quality. There are scenes showing the characters being good at doing things without showing what makes them unique. That is categorically bad scene writing. So in less you're a child or a foreigner who's never seen an adult movie, or you're a fragile progressive thinking this will give them value, I recommend you skip this one.",Crazy Rich Asians

But what a horrendous vehicle to do it with. I hated all the characters 20 minutes in. I held on certain Ivanka would show up. I won't get into the details that make this a vile, cliched, predictable, absurdity. Many other reviews have already done that clearly. What disappoints me is the 75% positive rating. (92% on Rotten Tomatoes.) That either says so much about us a as people, or how good marketers are at manipulation. I don't know which, but both are disturbing.

435,HippieMoon94,Don't overthink it,8,12 December 2020,"Why all the hate? This movie is purely escapism and it doesn't pretend to be anything deeper than that. It showcases exotic scenery and lots of shiny expensive things. There's also a ""Cinderella-esque"" love story that serves to move the story along sweetly.The characters aren't super deep and they don't do any switching up halfway through the film so the plot is easy to follow. Charming boy is secretly rich with a heart of gold, and eyes for only our lead lady. Successful girl is comfortable and naive, and fights a battle of wits to be with her man.I see a lot of people complaining about racism and the movie promoting bad values. Yeah, the movie primarily showcases East Asians as opposed to every single Asian people, but why the pressure??? Finally, a movie that features Asians whose entire character identities aren't math experts or Kung fu masters (which is the stereotypes mainly presented in American television), but people with varied goals and backstories that can be understood to a certain extent by their audience regardless of race. As for the bad values about gold digging and backstabbing. Literally every rom-com has a gold digger or backstabber thrown in the mix for a little razzle dazzled added drama.All these ""far stretched"" complaints are clearly based in some people's discomfort with a movie presenting any race other than white but still being celebrated on a large scale level. This is a standard modern fairytale type romance. It's not meant to be complicated. It's just fun. Don't overthink it, just enjoy.",Crazy Rich Asians

The three stars are being objective about some good acting and nice production values, but the story... oh the story. This is a 100% plot driven film, that means it creates artificial characters with no depth, no logic and existing only to advance the story. There's very little asian about this film other than the cast, the story is generic american romance story with asian stereotypes added. None of the story or characters are authentic to asian culture, the dialogue is cringe worthy.None of the film makes sense. It opens badly with the idea that 1995 London still has prevalent racism, utter nonsense. Maybe in 1955. Then we are supposedly to believe that married men having affairs are stupid enough to leave their phones unattended in front of their wives. If that wasn't bad enough, the back story to the lead females father makes absolutely no sense. We're supposed to believe that her mother was too scared to make a phone call to china in case her husband found out... somehow... and travelled to America to murder her! Again, utter nonsense invented purely to advance the plot. It's really hard to describe how bad this film is. Just please don't watch this film because you think it's asian, it isn't.

Almost all of the scenes are shot on interior sound stages and sets. With todays films you really expect to see the money of the budget on the screen, and so I guess this movie didn't have a big budget. It reminded me of a tv movie.Strangely, although Constance Wu's character was pretty bland when you compare it to her role on Fresh Off the Boat, her acting was strangely better than when she portrays a ""Tiger Mom"" and imho tries to channel Lucy Liu. She is pretty but she doesn't have Liu's or even for that matter, Michelle Yeo's star power.The story was predictable and his family came off as complete jerks. All of them.

The two couldn't be more different in that ""Greek"" was funny and ""Asians"" was a more serious look at it and it was also kind of disappointing. This wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't a great one and I felt like there was a lot of unanswered questions.The case here is a ""Commoner"" girl is dating a guy from a wealthy family and together they travel to Singapore for a friend's wedding and to meet said family. Constance Wu from ""Fresh Off the Boat"" plays the ""Commoner"" and Henry Golding plays the rich love interest.Along the way, we are introduced to a variety of different characters. Awkwafina plays Wu's best friend who provides a lot of the film's comic relief.On to the family. Michelle Yeoh plays Golding's mother and people will find this character to be very familiar. She's the typical manipulative mother with ulterior motives.Another subplot involves Golding's cousin who is married to a man who is having an affair.Throughout the film, there is a lot of scenes involving family members indicating Constance Wu is a gold digger. Some scenes are handled in a hateful matter.I liked some of the performances but it was very predictable.",Crazy Rich Asians

Some of the characters were very annoying. Being wealthy and shallow seem to go hand in hand. If you are in a mood to watch a romantic movie, you can go for it.

458,hellojaeson,Wooden Candy,6,9 September 2018,"Who and why?
Even the most formulaic films must do something to help us understand our protagonists. Crazy Rich Asians is a great marketing sell. A film that could sell itself even with mediocre execution - and unfortunately this film goes down that road.
 
The film doesn't do enough to establish the key characters. Who is Rachel Chu? What is her temperament? What is she passionate about? Why does she love who she loves? The audience is supposed to simply fall for the lead actor because he's good looking and the fact that he's rich should seal the deal. I know this formula has been done in other films too 
.. And I don't buy it for those stories either. Example: in When Harry met Sally they annoy one another but spend time to make each other laugh. They actually listen to one another and reveal their innermost thoughts. In this film... The lead actor has nothing to reveal about himself. And the lead actress is also just a girl who is reacting to the world around her by smiling and weeping. We don't know why she even needs to be with this guy. When the time comes for the 2 protagonists to have conflict and spend time apart, (as is custom for most films), the protagonists spend time in their emotional turmoil without much incident. If this film were to have a sequel I'd hope they would learn from this oversight or be relegated to film writing at its laziest. As it stands Crazy Rich Asians relied too heavily on a kind of music video aesthetic with picturesque backdrops and party people on golden glitz display. None of these elements are terrible if they served a greater purpose of creating a place for their characters could reveal their truths. The story felt complacent to remain a showcase of caricatures... Never moving forward to reveal how each person no matter how bejeweled hides a human being complex and self contradicting. In Bridget Jones Diary we learn about her want to be smart enough only to reveal she was always funny and charming enough. In Enchanted we learn how she needs to be brave enough to stop needing to be saved. In When Harry Met Sally we learn how friends can be lovers with the most truest connection. The course of true love leads us towards inner discovery. While there were attempts at this kind of revelation, we knew too little about the 2 leads. Some reviewers have made absurd comments about the cast being too Asian. So let me be clear... It's not the Asian cast that I have problems with... It's the lazy writing and the lack of focus on the main ingredients to a great romance...the 2 lead characters. It should have always been their story. Not the fragments of the other 5 people in the background including a friend getting married, a billionaire friend in an unhappy marriage, a very funny but not really helpful female sidekick. All these distractions could not make up for Rachel Chu and Nick Young being half developed.That said,there were a few scenes where I shed a tear. Meaning they obviously knew how to edit some good formulaic heart tugging moments. It wasn't enough to save the whole mess of caricatures and wasted opportunities.",Crazy Rich Asians

Or when Gemma Chanis is the main character of the scene, she is so gorgeous, she will make your mouth water just of pure desire to have her and lick her, which is like another 5 minutes.the rest 100 minutes are tedious. A couple of beautiful song tracks here but despite being beautiful they don't match the storyline. Because the songs are profound and meaningful whilst the scenes are superficial and disposable. The acting cast is cold and empty. There's zero character development. The story itself is completely doubtful cause nobody would be dumb enough. The whole thing is awfully incoherent.it is sooo boring!!! It would have been a great piece in the 70s or 80s, albeit for today standards it is for sure one of the worst launches of the year.

But ultimately, this film does celebrate sacrificial love and should resonate with anyone who has been torn by duty to family.

You can also, found the funny best friend and his funny family.
Positive things in the movie, you can find different female characters who are strong, independent and they have their own problems in life. Constance Wu give as an amazing performance so as Michelle Yo.
The male characters obviously not that good. I can't tell much of them there are all represent one stereotype. I felt they are bad they own way, I didn't felt they are good persons.

The impact of that cannot be overstated. However, the film itself falls short in a number of categories that makes it feel drawn-out and trite.I absolutely adore Constance Wu (The beloved matriarch, Jessica, from Fresh off the Boat), and think she did a great job in her role as Rachel Chu, as well as her counterpart Nick Young (played by Henry Golding). The supporting cast was also strong in conveying the over the top personality of their characters staunched in ritz. The set design, costumes, and props are utilized perfectly to create a beautiful world, outside of the bubble of normal society.While this is a modern-day Cinderella (a classic genre) this film feels like it relied on the tropes and cliches a bit too heavily. The story plays out rather predictably (no spoilers here!) and the actions of certain characters are textbook for the genre.This is worth a rental or bargain buy, and you should definitely enjoy it, but don't expect a classic or your new favorite flick here.Crazy Rich Asians - 6/10",Crazy Rich Asians

It talks about a couple: Nick young and Rachel Chu. Nick is a very rich man but his girlfriend didn't know about his wealth. During their travels to Hong-Kong to meet Nick's parents, she finds out about his family situations. The actors are so terrific, they play their role so well ! We really enjoyed watching this film, we can see the quality of this wonderful movie. The music is very catchy, particularly during their wedding :)By the way, the plot has been covered thousands of times, but we still have a great time in front of it. We recommend this film if you like romance film and action film at the same time ;) !",Crazy Rich Asians
484,writetonight-1,"Cute, but Disappointing",4,27 August 2018,"I was excited to see this movie. I'm white & some of my closest relatives are Chinese and Eurasian, so I loved the idea of an Asian cast. But the very first scene made my heart drop. (Spoiler alert)
The film opens with a wealthy Singapore family checking into their London hotel room in 1995, and being turned away because they're Asian. I just didn't find this plausible at all. Heck, Asians were able to stay at fine hotels in Berlin when they traveled to see the Olympics in 1936. If the Nazis weren't turning them away in the 30's, I find it hard to believe that the Brits were turning them away in the 90's! The scene seemed like nothing more than a gratuitous dig at whites, yet *another* Hollywood film putting out the message that whites are racist. I wanted to give the screenwriter the benefit of the doubt. I thought, maybe this scene is a set-up and something about this hotel in London will be important later in the film, but the hotel was never mentioned again. 
It's entirely possible to make a film that celebrates Eastern culture without taking a potshot at Western culture in Scene 1. The film starts out accusing Brits (or whites in general) of racism, but then throughout the rest of the film, all of the Asian characters speak English with British accents. They appropriate Western culture throughout - Wearing Italian fashion, decorating their homes like the French, having an American-format wedding ceremony, and practicing Christianity (Buddhism is actually the most popular religion in Singapore; less than a quarter of the population is Christian), etc. 
I'm not really against cultural appropriation, but you look stupid if you put down a culture right before you emulate it, and that's essentially what this movie did. 
I expected the film to defy stereotypes and break molds, but was disappointed that it was just another predictable, formulaic rom-com filled with stock characters that we have seen a million times before: the lovers who come from different social classes, the mother who thinks no girl is good enough for her son, the kooky female sidekick; the nerd, the flamboyant gay guy, etc.
The stock characters don't seem any less old and tired because Asian actors are playing them. In fact, this may have been why the movie felt so phony. It was a typical comedy that could take place in Beverly Hills , but it was masquerading as something new and exotic. On the plus side, the production values were excellent. There were plenty of beautiful location shots; the whole film was a visual delight. Constance Wu is adorable, and the cast as a whole were good; I just felt that they needed better material. The mood was light and fun, yet there were few laughs - a prerequisite for a comedy.",Crazy Rich Asians
485,richardc020,I loved it,10,20 August 2018,"In short: simply wonderful, everything from writing (wonderful adaptation of the book atop enormous global expectations) to cinematography (a love story for Singapore) to casting to acting (world-class performances to make a global Asian diaspora proud).There're so many types of reviews for a film with such enormous historical expectations to lift , carry the vast emotions of the Asian diaspora, and weighty expectation from readers of the popular book of the same title. I could give so many types of reviews from that of a sterile template review to the emotional ventilation of decades of being unseen and unheard to that of its strong rom-com merits which single-handedly lift the genre from dead to #1 to one about its storyline being so . It's even harder given the 100s here and the many everywhere across the Internet, so I review from my heart and less from a sterile perspective which professionals have well covered.I've only been to the cinema twice (Skyfall, The Dark Knight) in 15 years and I've only done do so for films whose action nature prefers the cinematic experience instead watching nearly only streaming documentaries in that time, but this one spoke to me initially for explicit commercial support of kicking down the door which has denied us for so long but see it sweetly added the heartfelt pain of seeing so many of my experiences dramatized on the big screen, sharing it with so many others who've seen and felt it with me, knowing that this is a historical lift for our community, and the thrill of this said representation happening.I spent an hour crying for so many reasons: the incredible writing that tells the carefully nuanced drama in marriage, Asian filial piety (mother-son relations); the high drama of the screenplay and the source material (from the best-selling book of the same name), excellent highlighting of the story and acting with the soaring rendition of ""Yellow"" by Katherine Ho and the powerful rewriting into Mandarin re-appropriates a former racial slur now defanged. The overdue need to tell the stories of the uniquely Asian-American experience are not only better for the art and thus better for commercial success but also uplifts the individual AAPI who've long suffered underneath disparagingly narrow stereotypes which have narrowed our perception by Americans and all those victims of its wide cultural reach. The stereotypes will end and we will have our voices heard for the many colorful varied stories that we live. That is how better filmmaking will occur in the Asian-American corner of the Asian diaspora.Those who worried the conversion from a coveted beloved novel to a Hollywood-backed version including myself, no such concerns exist anymore. One can feel the very intricate weaving of many cultures far beyond just East-West but also the tons of Southeast Asian ones with more callouts to Cantonese, Hokkien, Nam-Kee, Malay, and other Straits ones all acknowledged in the film. For those who love the world and its many peoples, this element will thrill. In food, in language, in clothing and architecture (Peranakan!), everything lifts the varied stories that make the world a more interesting place to live and which are real human stories, too.The casting choices are sterling. Citing examples would require repeating the lengthy casting list as even 1-liner roles like Victoria Loke as Fiona Cheng, Eddie Cheng's not-vain-and-snark wife, are brilliantly cast and can never get sufficient air time. May their characters' stories be told in due time, even if decades later in other formats. The casting of the leads is a natural which viewers can see and the countless press tour videos show the cast has a real, natural vibe that stems from such perfect casting. This kind of human connection is both great skill in acting and also a real connection born from the drama that is life.The love story to Singapore is heartfelt because its food is indeed THAT amazing (I say this even as a Taiwanese whose homeland is its perennial food tourism competitor with a similar night market culture), the excellent fluid combination of East meets West audible in the equally confidently English-Mandarin soundtrack, and the green sterling scenery born of the famously high standards of architecture and personal conduct.There're trivial complaints that it's not all things to all Asians, doesn't represent everything in Singapore, doesn't tell every Asian story, Henry's not Asian enough (a crude rude complaint by angry Asian dudes who I disavow as not credible misguided not-men), etc. to which I say, this is just 1 of an infinite number, it proudly doesn't tell every single story because it's huge role in kicking down the door which was closed to us for so long is why those other stories will be told, so unless you're actually going to take action to build those other houses, your criticism is not credible.Go see it.",Crazy Rich Asians

504,joekanuck,Basically...Cinderella in Singapore,5,4 September 2018,"This movie was about as Asian as Nebraska. Sure...the parents of the actors were Asian and Singapore was in Asia, but everything else about the movie was cookie cutter Hollywood...including most of the actors themselves. Hailed as a beacon of diversity, we were shown exactly nothing about any Asian culture. For all of the dialogue about what it means to be properly Chinese...Singapore isn't China...and people who live in Singapore will go to great lengths to make that clear to you. Most of the cast was American or British and all of the characters bragged about their American or British education. They were studying the bible in one scene and the wedding was held in a Christian church. Even the music was either in English or Chinese versions of English hits. They drove western cars, wore western clothes, mostly spoke English and danced to Western music. The PC climate being what it is at the moment, where skin colour, physical features and the heritage of ancestors, (rather than your own life and actions), define who you are, this movie has fallen into the fallacy that American Asian is the same as Asian Asian. Though, they do use that premise as a plot point as part of the movie, Crazy Rich Asians is being promoted as an Asian movie. It's not. It's a pretty average Hollywood movie, featuring mostly Hollywood actors based on a pretty typical Hollywood plot. It is a great ad for the city/state of Singapore, a very interesting place well worth a visit. To be clear...diversity IS good...but this isn't really diversity.

509,Wesley-Wang,Asian Invasion,7,18 September 2018,"Once upon a time, a film featuring an all-Asian cast was produced by a major Hollywood studio.Crazy Rich Asians is certainly a breakthrough for racial representation in the American film industry. Since Wayne Wang's 1993 Joy Luck Club, no Hollywood studio movie has featured an all Asian or Asian-American cast. On top of that, Crazy Rich Asians posted the best rom-com box-office debut in three years, grossing an estimated 25.2 million dollars at North American theaters over opening weekend. Yet as impressive as it is commercially and culturally, is it good?Essentially, what most rom-coms boil down to is whether or not they succeed in immersing the audience enough that they forget about the countless authenticity and conceptual flaws scattered throughout the film. They're silly, but you've got to admit, they're cute. But if the storyteller fails to hold your attention for just one second, just one, you'll realize, ""Ok, what the hell am I watching.""Yet it's not the clichés (like the rich guy falls in love with a poor girl but doesn't care about her wealth, rather her ""inner true self"") that bother me, but rather the manner in which they are executed. I believe a cliché is only truly a cliché if you notice it. Some opinions identify the acting as the shortcoming, but I feel the cast did their job just fine. In reality, the problem lies in the script. Like the great Roger McKee once stated in his screenwriting manual, Story, ""(Imagine) two attractive people sit opposite of each other at a candlelit table, the light glinting off the crystal wine-glasses and the dewy eyes of the lovers. Soft breezes billow the curtains. A Chopin nocturne plays in the background. The lovers reach across the table, touch hands, look longingly in each others' eyes, say, 'I love you, I love you' ... and actually mean it. This is an unactable scene and will die like a rat in the road.""It is simply impossible to act a scene so poorly written. In Crazy Rich Asians, there is a moment where Nick Young (Henry Golding) apologizes to Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) on a couch about how he screwed up or whatever. Rachel, at the beginning of the scene, is sobbing and won't even properly talk to Nick. Yet, in a matter of seconds, she forgives him, and life goes on as if nothing has happened. It's not the actors fault the scene felt fake. It's the screenwriter's.As much as its comedy angered many critics, who emphasized the fact that most of the jokes were exploiting the Asian stereotype, I would disagree. The comedy was clearly not meant to be taken seriously, especially in such a light-hearted film. If anything, the humor calls attention to the stereotypes and how they relate to our society today. That's valuable.On the other hand, Nick's mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), is awfully flawed. She acts as the antagonist of the film, opposing Nick and Rachel's relationship. Since Eleanor is strongly against the relationship, Nick is presented with a dilemma of choosing love or family and money, the three primary motifs of the film. But before they even reveal his choice, we already know his choice. Love will triumph over family and money. It's too predictable. The reason for this predictability factor is that Eleanor simply doesn't provide a strong enough antagonist. She displays such a weak and powerless sense for family, so weak that it feels like there's no opposing force to the protagonist. She even seems to care more about money, boasting a mansion furnished with lavish chandeliers and paintings. And as we know from 99% of commercial movies, greed for money never prevails.For the protagonist's victory to be marvelous and beautiful, the more menacing the antagonist has to be. The harder the struggle, the more glorious the triumph. For example, in great love stories such as Casablanca (1942) or La La Land (2016), we have no idea what the outcome will be because the conflicting values against the protagonist are so persuasive and dominant, so much so that victory for the protagonist seems impossible. Or is it?Despite these faults, one of Crazy Rich Asians' greatest achievements is the beautiful production and costume design. From the extravagant sets to the luxurious clothing, this film does a magnificent job of producing an immersive and believable environment for the audience.Overall, Crazy Rich Asians is a great start for Asians in Hollywood. The clichés and unconvincing characters are so typical in a modern rom-com that there's nothing really to criticize the film about. Originality and ambition is always encouraged, but it's ambitious enough already to feature an all-Asian cast. These flaws and imperfections should not worry us at all; they only serve as a reminder that we still have things to work on. After all, like Rachel finally stands up to Eleanor at the end, Asian filmmakers are finally challenging Hollywood for racial representation. ""Bok Bok, Bitch!""",Crazy Rich Asians

Sure, it's got all the trappings of a chick flick and you can enjoy it on that level but I do think it has relevant things to say about traditionalism and class. While not a prestigious or deep movie, it has more layers than required.
I saw during its original run in theaters, not expecting much, and was completely taken in. I even cried happy tears at a couple moments. My biggest complaint is that Astrid's subplot seemed like underdeveloped, unnecessary bloat that is a weak attempt at fleshing out her character.

Nevertheless the 0.0001 percent dynasty of richest and famous will allow their crown jewels to marry a plain jane doe. This is not privy to asians.It's a comedy and satire, no need to be butthurt.

535,gerald-koh99,"Entertaining look at wealth, identity and cultural tradition",9,30 August 2018,"Let me say straight off the bat that this does not give an accurate representation of 99% of Singaporeans, such as myself, ordinary people with more modest, down-to-earth backgrounds. This didn't stop me from enjoying this movie, which featured terrific acting, a storyline that translated decently onto the screen and wonderful camerawork and production values.Michelle Yeoh, acting as the stern, imposing mother of the male protagonist Nicholas gave the standout performance for me- I could sense the intensity of this character without going over-dramatic. Constance Wu, playing the female protagonist, also did terrifically as the girl thrust into a world she's totally unprepared to face. Everyone else, including Henry Goulding as the male protagonist, were also solid.I found the character development in the movie impressive, not just with the two main characters but even the minor ones too, as their backstories and motivations for behaving the way they did unfolded effectively. The storyline does fall prey to corny moments typical of most rom-coms- indeed, on that note, the story itself unfolded in a manner very formulaic of a rom-com, but that isn't too big of a deal in a script which overall works well. And it's supplemented by interesting camerawork and beautiful production values, illuminating the story very nicely.Many people seem to really detest this movie (and even the book it's based on), perceiving it as a shallow, silly, even offensive glorification of ultra-rich families and modern-day materialism. I'd say that's too simplistic of an overview, as the heightening of a mega-wealthy bubble that is presented in the story is simply to illustrate the issues and circumstances that someone in that scenario would face. It draws out themes such as the love of wealth, the desire to maintain a reputation before others, and how to manage cultural/social expectations and traditions when they conflict with your wishes. That is something I really appreciated in the film, and would recommend you disregard the negative reviews and give it a watch.",Crazy Rich Asians
536,VanillaCaramelLatte,A light movie,6,17 February 2019,"This movie is an adaptation of the trilogy by Kevin Kwan, which I haven't read and most certainly won't, as I've watched the movie and I don't like already knowing the whole story.
So, the main character is Rachel Chu, a young professor of Economics from New York, raised by her mother, who came to the US when Rachel was a baby.
One day, her boyfriend, Nick, invites her to go to his best friend's wedding in Singapore, where his whole family lives. She accepts it only to find out that his family is one of the richest of the island and the wedding is the event of the year.
Rachel finds herself face to face with socialites who spend absurd amounts of money on shoes and jewelry and make her feel she's not good enough because of her status. His mother, a woman who is all about the traditional family values, also thinks she's not worthy of her son and goes great extents to show it to Nick.
In the middle of this mess, Rachel struggles to prove she's not less than them because she's a daughter of a single mother and is not rich. But sometimes it's not easy to change such convinced minds and desperate times require desperate changes.
I don't usually watch romantic comedies but this one was so advertised I thought I'd give it a shot. It was average. In my opinion it's a good movie to watch when you just wanna see something light without having to think too much.
The conflict between social classes is not uncommon in Hollywood movies, but the distinction between Asians and Asian-Americans is, so I think the focus being on these communities was interesting. The wedding scene was really emotional, the scenarios and the music, I loved it.
However, I didn't liked the twist at the ending, it was predictable and extremely cliche. It was an OK watch with its funny moments, but it could have been so much more.",Crazy Rich Asians
537,writekelvin,Feel-good summer movie of 2018,10,6 September 2018,"There's no cure for stupidity and that's what you realize when you read most of the comments here who are written by Singaporeans who have gone out of their way to spite the movie because it doesn't fully represent them-the same bunch of morons who watch other Hollywood movies set in other countries and yet don't speak up about how different those countries are. Anyone with a basic understanding of storytelling will know that nothing can be fully represented-not even a documentary. We all see from various perspectives. Asia covers such a huge continent, but it can't all fit into one story. Only stupid morons will argue for that to happen. This movie obviously features one perspective of life in Singapore just as The Devil Wears Prada features one perspective of life in New York. We don't see New Yorkers complaining about how not all of New York is like that movie. Right? Because most people from bigger countries understand that. 
It's only a tiny island population of dimwits who think they are intellectually smart (but seriously lacking in understanding) who will complain and go all out to make obviously disgruntled posts (as if their voice meant anything) since they are such a castrated population who feel powerless about their local government so all they do is go online and vent on any and every issue. Great thing that the movie has done so well in the States and around the world that the sequels are bound to be made into films and will go on to do well in the box office. Two points to note if you're reading my review: first of all, this is truly the feel-good movie of summer of 2018. It's better on 2nd and 3rd viewing. The subtleties and nuances really come to light upon repeated viewings. The movie isn't about rich vs poor. It's about stewardship of generational wealth vs individual pursuit of ideals. It's not which is better. It's simply a glimpse into the two different ideas that come from being raised in different cultures. And not every culture is reflected so don't expect that either. It's a certain type, which do exist but very rarely seen by most average Singaporeans. But it certainly exists. I happen to know a few people who came from this kind of background. They tend to be from the older and more historic schools in Singapore. The movie actually does a good job of condensing the book, which is actually quite a good read too. I picked it up after watching the movie and found that it made my 2nd and 3rd viewing more insightful. Other point is that to understand most of the negativity on here is from disgruntled Singaporeans who are famous for their complaining and whining. Singaporeans are known for being vocal and complaining (having the good fortune of being schooled in English and thus being able to read and write but severely lacking in social sciences, history, sociology, anthropology and psychology, and thus quite a clueless lot of insular highly schooled people with little understanding of how the world around works). So, if you're wondering if you should watch this movie, ... yes, watch it for the feel-good vibe. It's no surprise it's already such a big hit and continues to do well at the box-office. Audiences around the world are responding to it. So, ignore the hateful dimwits here who take it personally that this movie doesn't represent their perspective of Singapore-these stupid morons who also go watch other movies set in Hong Kong and China and the USA, and don't complain about misrepresentation. No movie nor story book can give full representation of life. Nor is it worth doing so. That's the fundamentals of storytelling which these morons don't understand. Spiteful Singaporeans are worse than menstrual cramps.",Crazy Rich Asians
538,writekelvin,Massive box-office hit for a reason! It's delightful!,10,7 September 2018,"Ignore all these low reviews given by people who sign up an account here just to write a spiteful review this film. Majority of these reviewers are butt-hurt current generation Singaporeans who enjoy complaining and whining (who know enough to think they are smart in their tiny little insular world). This is the same backlash from ""locals"" that happened when Slumdog Millionaire was released and loved by audiences all around the world except in India. Again, same issue. Locals being annoyed that only one aspect of their country was featured in the story, and other aspects were not included. Does anyone else understand the basic principles of storytelling? There is no way to cramp all of the complexities of life into a movie or book. It's impossible. It cannot be done. And it should not be done. A story is meant to focus on a few specific characters while all the rest are peripheral in the margins. That's the essential construct of a story. That's the unspoken agreement between the storyteller and the audience. That's why even in movie storytelling, you've got main actor and supporting actor(s). Because that's how stories are constructed, since the beginning of time when we told stories around the fire. Cramming every conceivable character for the sake of fully representing real life no longer makes it a story; it makes it a CCTV footage. If you want that, go to one of those websites that feature just raw CCTV footage of people in specific locations. This movie, like every novel or every movie, functions within a story construct. That's why even the word ""genre"" is used as a way to classify the type of story it purports to tell to audience. Art and Story are perspectives, and within their construct, there is inherently a focus. And focus implies there will be things that are peripheral and not included. This is the nature of art and storytelling. Most of these imbecilic reviewers here don't seem to understand this salient point. Reacting like a bunch of self-appointed ""correctors"" of perspective of their tiny island, they've only just shown themselves to be truly the uncultured and ignorant. Knowing one's country but not knowing the fundamental construct of storytelling-is stupid and ignorant. Faulting a story for being a story just shows an utter lack of understanding, and also shows the current generation is highly schooled but severely lacking in contextual thinking.

539,trhowever,The conflicts between the cultures,8,2 May 2020,"I think this movie is more or less for those living in the western countries while having (a part of) the family in Asia. The plots are pretty much how the life is in Asian traditional families and you can see it in loads of series and movies in China. As someone from China but living in Germany, I know and resent such life quite a bit. This is how it has been in Asia, especially among the elder generations. I'm happy that this movie is ""international"" and the main characters are not doing what one normally sees in a typical Asian scene: the man stays for the family and regrets, like what I've seen too in the Medici series etc. For many of those from western countries without Asian immigration background, those scenes might be ridiculous and unbelievable, but I think this movie has done a fairly nice job at describing this bit.

I guess movies will be movies, not real lives.You could already tell, what was happening. Nothing is unexpected and you can actually tell by the acting that, it was acting. I couldn't feel the break up emotion and I couldn't feel the sadness in Rachel's mothers eyes after confessing that she had to immigrate to the US to ""save"" her and baby...
I just could't feel it and I think it is important that a movie this big, should deliver the audience EMOTION.I liked that they brought up asian families, because, in real life they really can be very judgmental. Mothers and sons do have a very special connection and thats why it is hard to accept a woman who can be as good as the mother.

549,webapalooza,Crazy Vain Asians,1,1 January 2019,"It's difficult to describe just how bad this movie is. Imagine 90 minutes of scene after scene containing obscene displays of wealth by obnoxious, pretentious, self-centered, condescending people who have complete disregard and utter contempt for anyone who's less than a centimillionaire. It's been misbilled as a ""rom-com"", because it contains not a whiff of either ""rom"" or ""com"". Hard to believe that a major film studio wasn't able to hire a few sitcom writers to add some much-needed humor to this stillborn script.We jump from one multi-million-dollar party to another, or else a multi-million dollar shopping spree, or else a multi-million dollar wedding, or else a multi-million dollar estate. It doesn't really matter, because it's all just an endless parade of grotesque wealth being spent frivolously by vain-glorious people, none of whom you'd want to be in the same room with. This movie practically cries out for a single scene where the main character takes his girlfriend to see the orphanage or hospital or other charitable institution that his family funds as a way to inject a little humanity into them by showing they at least make an effort to do some good with their ludicrous wealth. But no, the filmmakers are evidently far too shallow and clueless themselves to add that extra dimension to these characters.Halfway through the film I actually hit pause and turned to my wife (the rental was her idea), and said ""We're an hour into this movie and I have yet to detect a plot."" Her response? ""I know"" she said with a disappointed frown. And this is from someone with an extremely low standard for rom-coms. Imagine! A movie that manages to be completely plot-free for an entire hour! That's gotta be some kind of a record. Astonishing.By the time the film makes it to the ""big confrontation"" (we're 90 minutes invested at this point, mind you), we don't care whatsoever because these are all people who are oblivious to reality and more concerned with which designer they're wearing than with doing anything admirable with their wealth. If anything, we're eager to see them completely destroy themselves and lose all their riches in an ending worthy of a cautionary tale on the evils of misused wealth. We should be so lucky.The ending is so utterly predictable that it's actually embarrassing that anyone involved in the production thought that audiences would be surprised or satisfied by it.

I watch almost all the ones I come across, whether they are showing in a theater, on the Hallmark Channel or streaming on Netflix, Hulu, etc. They all follow pretty much the same formula. Boy and girl meet, fall in love, break up and get back together. The right cast and execution is what makes a great romantic comedy. Most are just ok but some just hit it out of the park. So when I come across a romantic comedy that hits every mark perfectly, I have to share it with the world.Crazy Rich Asians is a perfectly executed rom com with an all Asian cast. I was a fan of Constance Wu from ABC's Fresh Off the Boat but when I saw her in the trailer, I wasn't quite sure if she was the right actor to play the female lead in a feature film. She proved me wrong! Wu's portrayal of the American born Chinese Rachel Chu was spot on. Her love interest Nick Young played by Henry Golding, who I and most of the world had not heard of until he was cast in this movie, had me swooning whenever his down to earth from a privileged family character came on screen. Awkwafina, Ken Jeong and Jimmy O. Yang's vibrant characters brought just the right amount of comedy to this film. The location, cinematography, wardrobe, set design and music were superb. The wedding scene in particular was spectacular. I want to attend a wedding of that caliber! The cover of Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" and the Chinese version of Coldplay's ""Yellow"" were so beautiful that I had to buy them. I have seen it several times now since it's on HBO Now and I still need to have a box of Kleenex next to me. Don't be deterred from watching this movie because of its all Asian cast.

555,amyz214,A Chick Flick with a twist,6,16 August 2018,"I had been looking forward to this movie for a full year now. As an asian immigrant myself, I was incredibly excited to see Asian representation on the big screen. Growing up in America, I never saw my face on television playing a character that wasn't fetishized or negatively stereotyped. A few things I liked about this film
1) The incorporation of Asian food and tourism culture. The montage of Rachel and Nick dining in Singaporean street food definitely brought a sense of nostalgia to me. Asian street food is so underrated and spreading this important aspect of Asian culture is something I really appreciated in this film
2) The native slang and dialogue throughout the film stays true to Singapore. The blend of Cantonese, Mandarin, and a few of Singapore's own slang is what makes Singapore's language incredibly unique. Though not all the actors had stellar accents, it was still very exciting to hear my native language on the big screen 
3) I have been a long fan of Michelle Yeoh's work. And without a doubt, she was incredibly in this film. She carried herself gracefully yet intimidating. She, along with Ken Jeong and Awkwafina made this movie. A few things I did not like about the film
1) The random ab shots??? I understand the director's goal was probably to allow the ""western audience"" to view Asian men as more than a nerd; Asian men can be hot too! But the ab shots were completely unnecessary, and served no other purpose. Asian women were fetishized like this too, lets not steer this into the wrong way and make that mistake again.
2) The flow of dialogue were at times very awkward to follow. Humor is never easy in a script. But when conversations are stiff and do not flow, an attempt at humorous conversation can become very cringey for the audience. Other than Awkwafina and Ken Jeong, no other actor pulled off humor very well in this film
3) Rachel's accent completely threw me off in the movie. From the start of the movie, the slight accent in her English made me assume that she was perhaps born and raised in China, then moved to America in her late teens. But the movie indicates that she was raised in America. By that definition, she should not have an accent at all. Was definitely confused by this.
Overall, I think this movie was definitely worth watching, and especially supporting. Do not go into this movie expecting it to discuss the Asian American struggle. In fact, it doesn't discuss being an Asian American at all. This movie is more or less a chick flick, but with a different cast and in a different setting. Do not expect it to be anymore. But either way, the movie was fun to watch, and I look forward to a Hollywood with greater representation in the future.",Crazy Rich Asians

You really feel for the protagonist as she has to endure seemingly endless attempts by the boyfriends family and friends to sabotage their relationship. It is literally unbelievable how poorly the family treats her. But the protagonist has incredible strength instilled into her by her mother and from her friends that enables her to push through.

Let the rich part aside, this is how much families and generations in this region value their long held traditions. This is how a families think when their boy choose someone by all his own, this is how everyone reacts when they think this is wrong even if the boy and girl thinks they are the ones.
Its well portrayed enough in this movie even if its from richer perspective, but the middle class or lower classes are all the same.
Their values comes forth than anything else, and its hard make them realize that things can be other way around.
Also, how the bondings could be within the individual of the families irrespective of all the mismatches.

562,dipendrakumarmisra,More like Crazy Rich Singaporean Chinese with a Half White Actor,4,16 December 2018,"I generally don't engage in holy wars but given the hype this movie was receiving, I felt the need to pen down my thoughts.I was excited about a major Asian movie making into Hollywood. However, I could barely bring myself to finish the movie and had to leave it after watching the first 80%. To begin with, the movie is not about Crazy Rich Asians but Crazy Rich Singaporean Chinese with Malay and Indian servants. Secondly, I was hoping that this movie will focus on Asian actors who otherwise have a hard time getting non-stereotypical roles in Hollywood. However, we are offered a half-white main actor with British accent. In some way, the movie essentially shows British treating a Chinese family badly in the beginning and now the same Chinese family is living like the British colonizers with lavish lifestyle, various servants (all non Chinese btw). In essence, criticizing and glorifying the same thing. An exaggerated version of the same would be a movie about Black people in America who after various struggles are now finally owning slaves. What I said above is not a technical point and one can argue is that a movie is just a movie at the end and not an idealized social commentary. However, since the discourse on the movie promoted it as this grand awakening of Asian Hollywood cinema, I wanted to add to it. In contrast, the movie ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" is a much better movie.On a technical point, the plot is quite boring and unentertaining. A woman has to appease her future mother-in-law to get an okay for marrying her son. Most plots involve over the top dressed people with makeup playing in-your-face rich roles (was really nauseating to watch). While the part at the beginning is interesting, once our couple reach Singapore, the movie goes down the hill. Lines are immemorable and the only character development we are presented with is that of the main actress. I do want to point out that Jimmy O. Yang and Rodney Cheng were great.Overall, I think this movie is neither technically good nor does it help as a positive social commentary.",Crazy Rich Asians
563,billweiner,Good clean fun from the perspectives of the Chinese Community,10,16 September 2018,"This movie was a refreshing touch of humor. It is from the perspective of the Chinese Community. I am sick and tired of plastic movies written about some minority group by the same old establishment white males. While the humor did have some light sexual connotations it is still total appropriate for some of our younger audiences. It is your typical ""love story"" and the ending was completely predictable and still had a strong feel good message. I would see this movie again",Crazy Rich Asians

did the movie live up to the hype and expectations that surrounded it? Maybe Not...but that doesn't make it less of an entertaining movie that had a lot of heart-warming moments and some cute funny ones as well.Some of the actors/actresses i'd like to highlight on are:-Michelle Yeoh (Eleanor) played a great role as a mother in law who can be very tough but it's understandable as she loves and cares for his son.-Ken Jeong ""famous for his role in Hangover"", his character could definitely be funnier but unfortunately he was not and his jokes felt flat.
-Awkwafina (Goh Peik Lin) was the funny character that the movie could really utilize in a smart way, she did a great job in keeping the movie light and changing the mood every now and then.
There were also some side-stories that felt like fillers and no one would notice if they were removed altogether ""like the main actor's sister story"".Overall, i would recommend this movie to kill some time, have a good laugh and remember how poor we all are.",Crazy Rich Asians

571,bjwils-46211,An Emotional Surprise,7,4 October 2018,"Crazy Rich Asians is probably the first film I had seen in a theatre without having watched any promotional material for it. I have to say I'm going to have to do that more often. Going in, knowing nothing but the critical and audience buzz about the product I was sceptical. I'm not a big Rom-Com fan and I unfortunately knew the director Jon M. Chu's previously directed work had not been the most breath taking achievement in film making. So why in the hell did I love this film. There were incredible predictable moments. Paint by the number plot threads and characters. So why was I still shocked, surprised and emotionally invested until the very heart wrenching last scene. For me, I think, its that of the Sinagapore culture. As an Elnglish White Male, I'm not very knowledgeable on the facts and family drama of Singapore or any Asian family culture. It did what every film should do, submerge you into a world of the unknown. Despite being in this real world, it brought me into it in an exciting, expensive and explosive fashion. Great performances and openly embracing the predicable tropes allowed me to enjoy and emotionally invest myself into the world of Crazy Rich Asians.",Crazy Rich Asians

575,nsthyer,A movie of strong Asian women,7,22 September 2018,"The movie is standard romantic comedy, led by a very strong female cast. The fact that the film was made in Singapore and not Shanghai or Hong Kong is irrelevant as many commentators would have you believe. Swap the city, the story is still the same. 
Michelle Yeoh is believable and Constance Wu shone, Gemma Chan beguiled and Peik Lin Goh stole the show.
Sadly the male actors all rode the coat tails of the women.
Ken Jeong phoned in his performance or simply didn't connect to the role. All of the male actors were interchangeable, they could have swapped any male actor for the Nick Young character, it would not have impacted the film. Swapping Henry Golding may have actually improved the film..
Michelle Yeoh or Constance Wu both carried Henry Golding in every scene they were in together, he was just there for the ride.
In fact the scenes where only the men were present, were so bland and boring, they could have cut and not impacted the story line at all. 
Suspend your disbelief, enjoy the film for a couple of hours, ignore all of the problems, such as going the wrong way to the airport, or taking a helicopter without a flight plane in an area patrolled by 3 nations.

578,nikusik-82902,Enjoyable and deep at the same time,8,15 April 2019,"I feel like this movie was estimated for so long since is the movie with the full-Asian cast and was meant to reveal the mysterious life of Asian billionaires.This movie is supposed to show us the life of the old money wealthy Asians and their upholding lifestyle and the values they hold. That the family is, no matter what, the most important thing in their lives.The characters in this movie are very interesting, Rachel, the sweet American Asian is dating Nick for over a year, and she got invited to Nick's best friend's wedding. She has no clue that Nick's family is one of the richest in the whole of Singapore and abroad. She faces problems that she wasn't prepared to face and has to put up with the pressure that comes along with Nick's relatives.Some of the scenes are extremely spectacular. For example, the wedding scene was dreamy and beautiful and the locations were indescribable.Throughout the end of the movie, Rachel does something that only very few people would be capable of. Her love for Nick is stronger than his mother's hate for her, so she decided to step away and let his mother win, yet it felt like she actually defeated her, because she was doing what was best for Nick, unlike his own mother, who was practically forcing him to marry someone who he didn't love, just to be everything the way it should be in their circles.I liked the emotional scenes the most, because of the strength and depth they held, and the fact that this is the reality. People are blindsided by this obsession of trying to have everything in their life in order, nothing can step up and be different. You can not have an unfortunate past, you can not have dreams, you can not put yourself first, you have to be perfect.At the end, when his mother finally comes around with their relationship, it shows that you should just be yourself and never be ashamed of who you are, no matter how much would someone tell you-you're not enough, you have to hold on and not give into that opinion, otherwise you would lose yourself and if you don't have yourself, you have nothing.",Crazy Rich Asians

These people don't even think about the crazy poor Asians who work for this in their slave factories. Kids going blind then thrown out to the street to die, because they useless. No there is no mention where is this wealth is coming from. The evil in the world is not the poor guy who has to throw the kid out to die, but the owners of the factory enjoining the wealth without even knowing or careing about it. It is seriously alarming that a movie like this is popular in the western world. The world should go towards a social democratic future and not going back to despotism. Herodotus when he wrote his magnum opus about the Greek Persian war stated that this is a conflict between the European democracy and the Asian tyranny. The conflict is still ongoing and truly not between continents, but inside every one of us. Do we care what is happening with our fellow humans or we only can think about ourselves.

And I did for sure, the story line is unique but with familiar elements of a romantic comedy. But the casting is what has made me put this movie at a 10/10. Constance Wu is fantastic in the lead and made me laugh and cry and was just simply brilliant to watch as always (I love her in FOtB). But between Awkwafina and Nick Santos there were not more than a few minutes that passed without me laughing genuinely and loudly. It's a modern humor that does not rely on stereotypes at all and i felt that the humor actually did the most to develop the characters and forward their storylines. It is so good I've already plans to see it twice again next week.

I can only assume the book was more fleshed out in this regard.This film feels fifteen years out of date, and more suited to the early noughties style of rom com. Would have been a great film for representation which is still to this day starved in the industry.

593,Cidlo,Great movie but a very bad negative that other asians will understand,5,19 August 2018,"I will get to the positives first.As a movie, this is a great piece of art. Great acting; great music; the story is good and it takes you to great journey of emotions. There is no doubt that this is probably one of the best romantic films of this summer and probably in a long time. However, there is one very serious negative and it is the ""political"" side to it that only other asians will see. The title says: ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and it's whole commotion is that it is putting Asians in the eyes of western cinema. Wrong.This movie honors one Asian demographic and one asian culture which is the Chinese. To westerners, all asians are the same but the reality is they are very different from each other and there is a racist like stigma with in Asia that is so noticeable in this film. You had other asian actors such as Filipinos and Koreans being casted as chinese characters... the only asian language, music, and culture is just chinese. If this is a movie that is advertised as a break for Asians then where is the rest and why are non chinese actors playing Chinese characters, why could Kris Aquino be known as a filipina, or Ken Jeong as Korean? The reality is, Chinese culture has had so much exposure in the USA that this didn't feel like the big political deal that they made it to be. In fact, being a different asian I saw this as another thing of China putting other asian countries on the z list. We are all even here, there is no higher form of asian or more unique asian culture. This film did not push asians into the western media, it just pushed the Chinese and increasing the image as China being the only main face of Asia when it's not. I don't want politics to get in the way of this but the reality is, it is hard to appreciate it because of this dark reality that can be seen through another asian's eye. As to you westerners, we are all not the same and this did not represent asia at all but just simply Chinese asians.",Crazy Rich Asians
594,epocket-cs,This movie is telling something real,7,24 September 2018,"SPOILER --- Reviews that say Crazy Rich Asians (CRA) is about materialistic lifestyle, cheap soap opera movie, nor race stereotyping are totally missed the point of its story. I can tell you, because I am living a life quite similar to this movie. This movie is real.THE UPS
First, CRA is about Chinese family culture. I watched movies about Chinese family culture normally in documentary or news format, and mostly telling story about conservative family in the old days. CRA retells the story in the modern day, and it is rare that a Chinese family life is depicted in such detail. To the details that matches the depiction of Italian culture in the Godfather's movie, not a superficial or festival culture, but a culture inside your home. I lived with a matriarch grandma, her relations with m aunties, her with her sons, and grandsons, her role in big Chinese family, the way the prepare the food, the role mother play in Chinese family dinner, are absolutely identical to this movie.Second, Crazy Rich Bernard Tai. You think that's fictional character. I had a friend in junior high school who punched his teacher because he had bad grade, and tell the school to change his teacher. Just to let you know how screwed an Asian rich kid can be. I don't like how he lived his life and I don't agree how he treated people. But yes, Bernard Tai character is not fictional at all, at least for me.Third, knowing who is who from family names. When Eddy asked, Chu who, Chu plastic from Taiwan, Chu from there or there... Yes, Chinese can track your family background from names. Some of the Chinese families have a unique naming method to identify a person rank in the family.Fourth, the MOM (Michael Yeoh) and the AUNTIES. Oh yeah, you need to win the aunties before you win the mom, but eventually you need to win the boss, the matriarch, the Grandma, in Chinese family. This happens whenever there's an absence of male figure, but the challenge to enter a Chinese family will be the same. It has a hierarchy, according to seniority.Fifth, the treatment of WIFE (Outside female family member). Although the females in these movie are the powerful ones, you can see clearly how their roles in a Chinese family. They serves the family name. If only this movie had a male figure, you can also see that they will serve the male in the family, like the sacrifice of Astrid to Michael.I can go on and on and on... in the nutshell, this movie is trying to tell something real. It's not about the wealth, but about the culture. Although I have to admit that material possession in Chinese family matters big time, even among the family members.THE DOWNS

As far as glitz goes, they delivered big time in showing the opulence of people, the setting, and nature. As someone who has had fun online streaming Asian series depicting affluent families, I could tell the difference in budget. The glitz depicted in many of those series look gaudy and cheap in comparison to CRA. Scenery in CRA was pure bliss. Gorgeous scenes throughout.The movie was VERY Rachel centric. Hers was the most developed character and with most screen time. This was clearly HER story. Not hers with Nick's. In fact Nick looked almost secondary at times. The film did just the minimum to portrait the particularities in the Young family as well as the conflict and tension between Nick and his family. It could have gone more in depth IMHO. Some of the other family members look caricatural in comparison, being there just for comic relief. And the end was very predictable. I thought: Ooookaay!

Plot wise, it's pretty thin. But does capture the cultural aspect about the family is bigger than the self. How Asian families are superficially patriarchal but it is the matriarchs who decide and determine eveything.It's worth it for the laughs and humour. It does capture the richer aspects of the Singapore lifestyle and the divide between the have and the havenots.But as in my title, the one biggest flaw, for all wealth and money, the families have to use the local taxis to get to the airport. And they did not even splurge for the luxury version of the local taxis. Or perhaps in the view of being a Singapore, has the COE gotten so high that nobody can afford to buy a car anymore?",Crazy Rich Asians

608,rookpawn-38288,Entertaining and lots of depth,9,27 August 2018,"This movie engaged on a number of issues all woven into a pretty cohesive storyline that features the jet-setting crew of Singapore's elite. What was interesting is how in-depth so many issues were presented as well as ones specific to asian communities* what it means to be asian vs asian-American
* priorities of the ""good"" asian valuing family over self
* money and gender and relationships (Gemma Chan's character explores this with her less wealthy husband)
* exclusion-inclusion (girls club)
* indirect racism (hotel scene)Of course front and center was the focus on the relationship between the two main characters; it was always focused on how they felt which was important for any romance comedy. I have seen criticism that it went above and beyond thier relationship to highlight other things; i think that's more of a need to make a statement on a number of things publically for the asian community and less of a film ""flaw"". What was interesting was how the movie was always emotionally engaging, whether we were meeting Awkwafina's nutty family or carefully understanding Michelle Yeoh's excpetional delivery.

I, of course, would never use this expression except that I am quoting the movie CRAZY RICH ASIANS. A wonderful boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl Cinderella story set in a 'traditional Chinese culture' verses 'modern, western-influenced Chinese culture' backdrop. It highlights and challenges stereotypes in a very funny and entertaining way. The wonderful thing about this movie though is that it's so relatable because regardless of whether you are Asian or rich, most of us know what it's like to try to reconcile a dysfunctional family. Strangely enough my personal back story is almost the same as the main character's back story. This caught me off guard and even brought out a few tears. Brilliant cast headed by Constance Wu although my personal favourite is 'villain' Michelle Yeoh who's been everything from Bond girl to martial arts hero to mentor and still looks great. This movie has something everyone can relate to regardless of your background, culture or class.",Crazy Rich Asians
610,cocodiamondstar,You should watch it!,8,17 December 2018,"This movie was really interesting! It has got humour, sad moments, satisfying details. And good acting.",Crazy Rich Asians
611,luvmyoldlab,A good Romantic Comedy,7,14 February 2019,"I was expecting more over the top comedy but it was more like a Hallmark movie which was fine with me. I like Hallmark movies. The actors were charismatic especially ""Asian Ellen"". I'd definitely recommend this.",Crazy Rich Asians
612,sandrakaae,Why is everyone so angry?,10,21 November 2019,"This movie is STUNNING with a display of traditional Asian culture, which doesn't get much exposure to begin with, not to mention an (as far as I could tell) ALL Asian cast? The only white people showed were  d-bags, truly amazing. Not to mention it's GOOD and funny in its own way, a GREAT movie. TL;DR at the bottom, for those interested.Now you're wondering ""is OP an Asian with prejudice? Probably."" No. I am not. I am quite possibly whiter than the snow on your front porch. I've just experienced Singapore firsthand (lived there for years) and so I understand a SNIPPET of the strict family traditions that Chinese (and other Asian cultural groups) bear.
The movie is stunning, the actors/actresses are brilliant (and I say this knowing full well that I have before been disappointed in the abilities of Asian actors such as the ones in K-dramas, their acting style just isn't really for me, but this is the kind of acting you would see in a silver-screen western movie, and even though that sounds  it's just how it is: the definition of acting differs in different cultures)
Now. Stop being salty over the display of wealth when that's the TITLE of the movie. The whole premise is that these people masquerade behind all this money and power with their messed up lives, and yeah the plot was ever so slightly predictable because that's the plot that sells tickets!! It's a great plot, they incorporated and showcased Asian/Chinese culture within the plot this time, and the whole movie makes you feel within your comfort zone as it drags you to a completely different world. Sometimes a foreseeable plot is not the death of greatness, but quite the opposite. I dare say that almost every Western RomCom movie has MORE similar plotlines than this movie.
It's stunning. 10/10, they shouldn't have tried to pay the lead actress less than her male counterpart for the sequel, because I desperately want a sequel (all though the movie does end in a satisfying one-off kind of way)TL;DR: It shows a stunning display of Asian/Chinese culture incorporated into a recognizable frame of RomCom(Tragedy) while also showcasing its brilliant actors/actresses, not to mention the underbelly of a Rich life. Stop being angry that it's ostentatious or stupid, it's neither. It's actually quite funny and a GREAT movie over all.",Crazy Rich Asians

617,jovoh-56260,Most negative comments here are MISSING THE POINT,9,29 June 2020,"I rarely review movies but really felt I had to speak up on this one. Most negative comments made on this film seem to be viewing things through a very narrow lens: too simplistic, almost aggressive against materialism, which itself is fine but it isn't the point in this movie.Crazy Rich Asians presents a fresh, playful view on cultural differences, socioeconomic classes/norms and modern identities between individualism vs. collectivism. It's not so much about glorifying the ultra rich as it is about the deeper levels: the cultural hierarchies and nuances of such institutionalized families, that come with prestige yet also a huge amount of social pressure - and navigating your sense of self and relationships in such an environment. Anyone who understands wealthy old money families of Asia today will understand the issues this film portrays. Sure, it's extravagant and over the top but it goes much deeper than what you see on the surface. Like that friend who always jokes around but has actually gone through a lot themselves.Cinematic work is beautiful, fresh take on music/artists and character development decent enough. Entertaining, clever and enjoyable film with much more deeper message than just superficial materialism.Ps. comments on the actors being too East Asian or too western, just wanted to remind everyone we seem to be pretty comfortable with Schindler's list, the Pianist, the Gladiator or the Amadeus etc..?",Crazy Rich Asians

It's quite refreshing to watch probably because the movie took us into the world we think we already know, like Princess Diaries, and adding the confidence and intelligence to the main female lead. It's inspiring for girls in the sense that women can live smart and independently and we might as well still get the guy in the end.Also, kudos to the cast and crew for proving an all Asian movie can still make it to the top!",Crazy Rich Asians

It hit every marker a romcom should hit and the acting was wonderful. I caught a tear rolling down my face a couple of times and that wedding scene was phenomenal, along with the stunning cover performed by Kina Grannis.

Yes, the movie boasted of having an entire cast of Asians but other than that, there's nothing Asian about the entire film, so to speak. The culture, lifestyle the mannerism portrayed by the characters and the environment they lived in are nothing short of mere fantasy. Rich ppl in South East Asia don't live in such extravagant lifestyle. They look more like a typical rich Manhattan spoilt brats than a true Asian. Worst part is, I can't help but to feel that this whole movie is subconsciously promoting gold digging values to the audience, while glorifying it as true love.

How many dozen times has this theme been used before? At times, the movie seemed like little more than an excuse to have attractive people show off designer clothing. The resolution happened too quickly, as if the filmmakers hadn't saved enough time and money for the ending, so they had to squeeze something in. Still, it was entertaining.",Crazy Rich Asians
636,jp-campbell,"Boring, overrated, vulgar, spared by a few magnificent actors",5,22 September 2018,"Isn't it funny how most user reviews seem to entirely miss the point (and the tone) of this movie? While I might criticise the world it portrays, so does Crazy Rich Asians. There is no endorsement here of the vulgar displays of wealth, of the abhorrent behaviour of various characters. In fact, throughout, major plot points are illustrations that the film is criticising the culture of gold-digging and ridiculing the assumptions by various villains that the lead character has anything to do with their game. Scorn! Scorn for the tone deaf and borderline-illiterate audience who completely misunderstood what the plot is about. Shame! A shame that they were the target audience for what is a very simple, mundane romcom extolling the virtues of a fantastical & basic romance based on some indefinable love maintained by two one-dimensional characters against all the odds (avaricious competitors maligning the girl, steely villainous relatives culturally at war with this Westerner, etc.).Above par for a plodding generic rom-com, which doesn't elaborate beyond the most basic of beats - style and setting elevate it beyond its parts - but as a story there is nothing unexpected. Strictly for those who want what that genre average delivers.Performances - Michelle Yeoh transcends the material and her multi-faceted mother must be a construction of her own talent and craft, because the script and the direction offer no help whatsoever - Constance Wu is compelling, and sure as hell works hard to remain likeable despite her clunky dialogue and humourless jokes - Awkwafina is highly entertaining and manages to draw a characterless role in at least one fabulous dimension - same goes for Nico Santos. Some might feel the film avoids revelling in gratuitous wealth, but to me, while it retains an otherworldly character, the portrayal of wealth is definitely pornographic.Henry Golding can be forgiven for his wooden performance given that the character of Nick is the most anodyne Etonian old boy (""the best beer of my life, mate... would be perfect with a spot of rugby, what?""; excuse me while I empty my stomach) whose duality runs only as deep as his inability to forsee the entire plot of the film, spawned by the idiotic decision to keep everything about himself hidden from the woman he purports to love and truly wish to marry. These two leads seem to know nothing about one another, their feelings for one another seem to derive purely from aesthetics (shirt off, glasses on, suit on, dress on; look how she fits in so well; look how he plays vaguely well with kids) and therefore the entire setup for the film is implausible.Nick is a twelve year old's notion of the eligible bachelor. Rachel (Wu) is a twelve year old's notion of the female protagonist - a good role model, the Mickey Mouse version of an economics professor, who falls head over heels for the first hunk she meets without batting an eyelid that he says nothing of his entire history before college. These kids have the sophistication and emotional range of ... a twelve year old. Yet they are adults in a problematic adult situation - and so I don't believe in the fiction. We watch two actors struggle with terrible dialogue, not two characters with fates we give two figs about.Social politics - note the line about how the Yeung (Young?) family came as first generation Chinese settlers to Singapore - how their capital raised the city out of the swamp. Ignoring the fact that foreign settlement of traders in the area predates the proposed timeline, what sticks in the throat about this fact being casually thrown away as explication of the prestige accorded that affluent family, is the fact that their ancestors would have multiplied their fortunes by driving indentured (slave) labour into the mud of that swamp - the same people who are now employed in the background throughout this film as household help. We do absolutely revel in the glory of immense wealth as sprayed across hillsides and freeways across Asia (certainly after the Western fashion, but with a particularly eastern status-materialist flavour), and at no point do we find straying into shot the unliveable yet unaffordable sweltering tower block housing for the workers at the bottom of the Yeung (Young?) pyramid.This is not a film concerned by social or economic politics - and therefore implicitly it is a film concerned about helping us to ignore these things.But, instead, it's a film about the challenges of negotiating a relationship with the prospective mother in law, and broader integrations into a partner's family. On that front, it does justice to the theme as much as can be achieved in this running time. Even if it plays out in the context of an entirely implausible relationship, completely lacking in substance and at no point justifying the overwhelming effort these characters put into making it work.The story does manage to neatly tie up the conflict between western individualism and trends toward broadening opportunities and empowerment of women versus traditional family roles, values and self sacrifice to traditional power structures and greater goods that are implied to be the preserve of eastern cultures - in the final interactions between Yeoh and Wu. It was pleasing to see that there was no total resolution, as the mother in law disappears from the final party scene having conceded defeat. It was most displeasing to see that all the progress made by Rachel in maintaining self respect, dignity and autonomy, is jacked in because a plummy marionette delivers a boring, hollow and unfunny proposal to her on a plane, presents her with a massive sparkly stone and somehow this intelligent woman is overcome with the ROMANCE of it all. But at least we can rest easy in the knowledge that neither of them will be happy because of the impossible compromises required of them by this flippant decision. (Hey, who knows - certainly not them, they know nothing of one another - maybe they might be able to make it work).There are many attractive people in this film, which I suppose is another plus. Bravo. Didn't stop their jokes from making my skin crawl (up from the seat, and straight out of the theatre).",Crazy Rich Asians

If the characters in this movie were Westerners, staring in an American sitcom, in 1995, the show would be cancelled by 1996. This is a poor-man's, Chinese version of Friends, and yet not nearly as nuanced, well-written, or as clever as that show, twenty years later, by a long shot. This script is what you'd get if you paired the concept of Friends with the writers of every effing show on the CW for the last twenty years. And it's not even that good. It's so stunningly two-dimensionally shallow, vapid and sociopathic, that even though I've tried to watch this piece of garbage three times now (so I can understand what all the hooplah is about) that I haven't gotten past the first thirty minutes once. This movie is obviously, OBVIOUSLY a financial pander to China, and a money-making attempt to get picked to be one of the 35 films China allows into its country every year.

It wasn't either. At all. I don't think I smiled once. There are two people in it who are funny in other works, but not at all here. The plot is dry and simplistic and boring. At the halfway point I kept telling myself it would get better. At this point almost nothing of substance happened. Then when I reached to ten minutes left, I shut it off. I rarely ever just stop watching a movie with so little time left, out of sheer curiosity and a personal need for completion. But I just couldn't stand it anymore. It was so formulaic and basic, I knew how it ended.Now I am left to wonder how a movie that seems like it was written by a 14 year old girl, fairly poorly acted, overly long and lacking a sense of coherence or character development got a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. Are critics now required to like a movie simply because it features minority characters and stars? This mindless drivel should have been seen as just that. Completely lacking thought and with one of the most clichéd messages in story telling: wealth doesn't bring happiness, love triumphs all.Wedding Crashers has a better plot and more entertainment value than this nonsense.

644,filmreviewph,A formula Film with finer theme,5,5 September 2018,"There is only one thing that is really commendable about the film, which is the (sub) theme: discrimination. 
Whether it's colour, race, social and economic status or physiological impairment, we all experience discrimination in different shapes and forms. This made the film a notch higher and better than the usual Romance films or Rom-Coms.The Young Family experienced discrimination from the Caucasian hotel staff at the beginning of the film-- i was hooked by that sequence. While Leading lady Rachel Chu (played by Constance Wu) was discriminated by Eleanor Young (Mom of Nick Young) due to her family background. Of course, it was ""they lived happily ever after"" in the end and aside from the good play of theme, everything in the film is a formula. I and we have seen the Romance plot in the everyday Teleserye or Rom-Com movies where Boy loves girl/Girl Loves Boy; enter the antagonists (can be ex's of the loves, friends or parents) who are against the couple. etc. etc. etc. As i watched the movie, towards the middle up to the end, i felt watching a local film, (a teleserye or Rom-Com) which I am not really sure if it's good or bad--i guess it was bad.There were funny scenes where Peik Lin (Played by Awwafina) College Best Friend of Rachel Chu. Peik Lin character in very similar and always present in our local Rom-Coms, a shoulder to cry on, an accomplice in some naughty plans. Aesthetics and production, I find the audio mix and quality not so well--a bit garbled and low. I hope it was only in the Cinema that I went to--big mall in Makati. The texture and Colour of the film is graded well making the scenes look cooler but not losing the Oriental feel of Asia.Cinematography, pzrticlulary camera shots are simple, direct and not the irrational fancy shots (just to impress the audience).This film still reaffirms that formula films are still effective, of course putting new twists or (sub) themes and it will do the trick.",Crazy Rich Asians

But it was a total disappointment. The movie takes itself way too seriously, there are hardly any really funny moments and the story is an awful cookie-cutter love story with all the standard plot twists and turns that you have seen a thousand times before. Any person who has seen more than three rom-coms can predict the whole story from the first 5 Minutes in the film.Also, I had the impression that this movie was made by Asians who are somehow suffering from an inferiority complex towards westerns and thought ""now its time for paypack!"" because the movie tries hard to show how super-mega-much richer the Asians of today are compared to super-mega-rich westerners. Another sign of this ""Now its our time!""-revenge motivation is how the movie carefully puts westerners as servants in the background to subliminally underline that Asians are now the bosses. The beginning sequence in the London hotel is also testament to that and on top of it is exploiting the cheap revenge feelings the viewer might have when he sees the chinese familiy humiliated (which would never have happened in ANY upscale London hotel this way in reality).

The astonishing facial characteristics of asian actors is so worth looking at. Movies should feature people from all places of the world, beauty is not only caucasian.",Crazy Rich Asians

It's funny to watch this movie to learn how westerners regard Asians and immigrants supposed to be. I'm curious that do African Americans feel the same as me when they watch Black Panther?
Probably I'm wrong because I don't really know Super rich Asians in my real life. Hope I'm wrong.
And I have the same opinion with Yang Zi Qiong's character in the movie: we both don't like the heroine. Her acting sucks.
The only thing I learned from this movie is how to keep the RP accent not strange in an American movie. The answer is, just be handsome.",Crazy Rich Asians
661,cali-girl,Did not disappoint!,10,19 August 2018,"I was nervous going to see this because I had read the books and worried the movie would not live up to the books, and that all the positive reviews were just hype or fanfare. But I am pleased to say the movie did not disappoint. It struck just the right tone, was very similar to the book, and almost all the casting was on point (with the exception of Michael Teo...did not think the actor cast as him was right). The cinematography as others have said, is amazing. Can I jump on a plane to Singapore tomorrow? Can I eat the food there? Because it looked amazing! But I think the main thing is the film was a very modern take on family duties - and it did not hit you over the head with ""Asian filial piety"" themes over and over. It provided context, but also was on the receiving end of humor as well. I also loved (as others mentioned) the soundtrack. Just really well done film, very lush, and totally on point as a romantic comedy.",Crazy Rich Asians
662,MissCheerful,See This Movie to Support a Movement or Just to Have Fun,10,17 August 2018,"I am so happy that the movie has sparked a lot of dialogue and attention on representation, which on its own is already a great outcome to this movement. One movie can never represent and show all aspects of any culture, especially when ""Asian"" encompasses such a plethora of diverse cultures. It is just ironic that a light comedy is carrying THIS MUCH weight. This is a story about a girl being thrown into a world she's never dreamt of associating, how she struggles to fight for what she stands for against all odds and about the power of love, through hilarious and sometimes not so hilarious encounters. To me it's Cinderella meets David & Goliath in Sex in the City...I'd recommend it even if this were any other Hollywood movie because the characters are so intriguing and each had an interesting arc, there are so many hilarious moments throughout, the fashion is gorgeous and lots of the actors are too, the sets are stunning! with a wedding to die for (beyond my wildest imaginations)!, and some of the best of Singapore ie the STREET FOOD!! Of course the romance! and more! Watch it not coz it's Asian, though the Asian-ess made it unique and added flavour for sure. I just think this adaptation is brilliant. I recommend it also because I'm biased. (Not about to hide that.) If you keep seeing a repeated image or same story being told, you'll be brainwashed to think they are just like that, nothing more. Proper representation is so critical to eliminate marginalization and to create role models for the next generations to follow. The fact that you get a glimpse into how many kinds of Asians (granted this is predominantly Chinese) there are from around the world, and how differently they behave and speak is pretty fun. But back to supporting #crazyrichasians, it is important because by proving to Hollywood that there is much wider audience interested in stories of people of color, people of the minority, it will open doors to more diverse content, and a better reflection of the real world we live in. If we genuinely believe in diversity and inclusion, now is the time to walk the talk. There's not been many good rom coms in recent years, and the last one that sold well apparently was Train Wreck, although a recent one I liked was the Big Sick. Just go for a fun ride and escape into a world of fantasy for 2 hours. I think we all need it these days.",Crazy Rich Asians
663,booksrbest13,They ABSOLUTELY Killed It! I'm so proud!,9,19 August 2018,"Oh, where do I start? I really wanted to see this movie because of the all Asian cast. Also, I am Asian American. I heard about the hype of this movie but I wasn't going to see this movie because I don't watch RomComs. However, I was reminded that this has been the first Western produced film with an all Asian cast in the last 25 years - so I just had to go see it. First, I want to say THANK YOU to whomever made this happen. Everything was brilliant - from the cast, scenery, script, lighting... this whole movie delivered. While I do have some issues with this movie, which is why the 9 review, it in no way impacted how this movie made me feel. I would give this movie a 10 based on the movie, and a 9 for my personal views. While I don't know if this will get a sequel, all of these actors should be proud of their work and pat themselves on the back. They proved that an all Asian movie can work. They went against normal Hollywood stereotypes and racial stereotypes in general. YES, to diversity and YES, to Crazy Rich Asians.Now, I just want to say some negatives. I really don't like the casting of Henry Golding. This isn't a personal attack on Henry Golding, but the standards that Hollywood has for Asian males in general. First, he is not ethnically East Asian, specifically Chinese at which he is supposed to be portrayed in the movie. He's half-white/half-Iban. Hollywood has RARELY, if EVER, casted a full-enthic Asian male as the lead because they don't believe an full-enthic Asian male can sell the movie. They have white-washed Asian male roles (Dr. Strange) and would rather have a half-white/half-Asian person to do it, that ironically might look more white than Asian.Second, while it is in Asian culture - I heavily dislike the term ""Banana"" and really don't want it to become a bigger thing than it already is. I don't want this term to be popularized because it is polarizing rhetoric. The term basically means ""yellow on the outside, white on the inside"" which could define Rachel Chu. While it did fit with the message of Rachel being from America, I think that they are potentially causing more harm than good. I say this because some people don't have a say in how they grew up AKA adoption. I, for one, could potentially get someone to call me a banana just because someone made an assumption about how I grew up. I think that CRA has given Asians the opportunity to express all of these stereotypes and biases in an open forum, but this comment seems like the director took a step back. Instead of focusing on being ""white"" tell them that you're American. I don't see what's wrong with that.
 
All in all, the movie is a great Rom-Com and beat my expectations. I hope that this movie can garner a great reception from the crowd and will tell Hollywood that it's okay to cast Asians! And that we like it! We don't want stereotypes to define who we are. We hate accents. We hate martial arts. Just let us be and hopefully you'll appreciate our great acting!",Crazy Rich Asians

Will they like her? Can she survive their lavish eccentricities and cattiness? They throw amazing parties and weddings. There are mansions and jewelry and gorgeous clothes. I thought it had a good blend of humor and pathos. It was fast-paced and the music was a particular highlight. I liked the cast and felt there was chemistry where there needed to be between them. Beautiful people in super wealthy settings, but with a core of simple goodness... it's a fun movie! Universal themes and a good love story are what you'll find here.

680,escottwill,Read the book. It's a little better.,3,23 April 2019,"All in all, this movie was pretty lame. I expected that, because I read the book first, but given what I'd heard of the movie, I thought this would be the rare case where the movie was better than the book. Part of the trouble is Constance Wu. After seeing a person cast as a young but rapidly aging mother of three boys on a B-level sitcom, it's hard to imagine that person, later in their career, as the supposedly young, glamorous ingenue in a rom-com. She's not very good in her TV show but her acting is acceptable there because it's thoroughly a comedy. Here there are serious scenes, and her habit of starting off her lines at a regular pace and then spitting out the last half as rapidly and incomprehensibly as possible is painfully apparent. The fact that she was cast in this role speaks to the lack of young Asian and Asian-American actresses in Hollywood--it's as if they didn't have a choice. The rest of the acting is bad generally, although I guess I tended to find that the older the actor or actress, the better their performance. The role of Rachel's mother was particularly well-acted.
I also found the plot of both the book and the movie troubling, as it ineffectively dealt with a serious matter. People seem to interpret the story as a send-up of worship of money, and if I saw it that way I would be far happier despite the bad acting and the pandering that are the hallmarks of the movie/book. But to me the story does more to reinforce all that than to discourage it. The book glamorized wealth and the worship of wealth; this doesn't come through quite as much in the movie, actually, but the lone exception, in both, is at the end, where the couple conveniently, predictably, and mostly inexplicably has a sudden reconciliation after, particularly in the book, the girl has been devastated by the behavior of the guy's family and her own. The only two characters in the book who reject the idea of their lives being ruled by money are a professor of economics and a man who, in the movie, hasn't had to reject his family's money to get the girl but instead has received the approval of his mother so that he's actually getting both. In the book, he's at least temporarily given up his family for the girl.
There are other details that indicate to me that this isn't a parody, too. The line, ""There are children starving in America,"" in the book isn't accompanied by the visual of goofy Ken Jeong saying it, nor is it backed up by using skinny Rachel as an example to explain the joke. It comes off far more serious, to me. It is of course a paraphrase of a line Americans often use that implies their feeling of financial superiority to other countries of the world, and the irony is a bit funny, that now America is being looked down upon in a financial sense--these Singaporeans are THAT rich, so rich they can put Americans in their place. Funny, until you think, simultaneously, that America has one of the highest obesity rates in the world, especially for children, and that even the wealth of the wealthiest country in the world isn't enough to satisfy this book's characters. There's also, in the book, the line about slapping these white people in the face with your big-d*** money until they get on their knees and satisfy you, or similar, explained in one of the novel's many footnotes. These things are troubling.
Upon writing this review, I am realizing that the book, while it still does more to reinforce the worship of money, had the story of Michael, in addition to Nick turning away from the family, to go on the side against worship of money. In the movie he's just another middle-aged Asian guy who's cheating on his wife; in the book, he's faked having an affair so that his wife will divorce him because he just wants to get as far away as he can from her family and their worship of money. There's also Rachel's mother, who really only has one scene in the book, where she vomits out the horror story of all that happened to get her to leave China and go to America. Her husband was a well-to-do, spoiled government official and a bad person, and it was love that saved her. These aspects of the book are missing from the movie, where it's painfully obvious that they tried to cram a 500-page novel into a 2-hour movie. They leave out things like the back-story of how the mother got the file on the girl, how unhappy Colin is with the whole wedding lead-up, and what a condescending b**** the supposedly stately, respected grandmother is. I guess watching the movie has forced me to upgrade my opinion of the book to mediocre--the movie itself is just more Hollywood money down the drain. And I hear sequels are on the way...

Sure, the setting of the movie was mostly about lifestyles of the filthy rich but the main point really in my opinion was to view it as filthy, not as desirable, and I think it captured quite realistically the overwhelment and innocence of the lead character being suddenly in a middle of a new world that was seeming so unreal and unhumane at the same time.

688,esthertdebord,A pleasant blend of heart and hilarity,10,16 August 2018,"August 16th, 2018, IMDb 10/10: A pleasant blend of heart and hilarityTo people familiar with Crazy Rich Asians the novel: It is a fair interpretation of the novel, but don't expect to see exactly what you've read.To people who are unfamiliar with Crazy Rich Asians: You are in for a treat.Crazy Rich Asians the novel is Pride and Prejudice meets an anthropological gaze on Singaporean society. It is a fusion of dry wit and unexpected surprises. It flows like a mystery and a satire. It is a work of genius by the intuitive and articulate Kevin Kwan.Crazy Rich Asians the film condenses the novel and tones down a few characters, most notably the character of Eleanor Young. Instead of playing the stereotypical Tiger Mother, Michelle Yeo portrays Eleanor with elegance and nuances of fierce, maternal devotion and protection. The film also focuses more on the storyline of Rachel Chu and Nick Young (Constance Wu and Henry Golding), whereas in the novel, the storyline of Astrid Leong Teo, played by the graceful and gorgeous Gemma Chan, is equally significant.By focusing more on Rachel and Nick, the film highlights more of the romantic comedy as opposed to Kwan's mixture of genres. As someone who has read the novel, I can understand why the filmmakers decided to zero-in on the romantic plot, since it would have been difficult to translate from text to screen without disorienting film-goers with the confusion of 'what type of movie is this trying to be?' Comedy? Dramedy? Mystery? Yes.I can see why the plot was condensed and focused more on the love story and conflict of interests for Rachel and Nick, because it would be difficult to follow the multiple viewpoints of Rachel, Nick, Peik Lin, Astrid, and Eleanor in a 2-hour running time. If Rachel and Nick had not been portrayed by stellar such actors, then it would have been yet another boring rom-com. But they were stellar: Constance Wu has range for both comic timing and tear-jerking drama, and Henry Golding plays a gentleman with ease, because he is one. They also had undeniable chemistry.I hope that these changes in the film's focus will leave more room in the sequel to focus on Astrid Leong Teo's love life and Rachel Chu's search for her origins. By completing the arc for Rachel and Nick earlier in the trilogy, Astrid has more time to shine in China Rich Girlfriend.I personally liked the changes they made to the plot, because it makes the story more accessible both for people who have read the novel and people who are being exposed to the story for the first time. I am glad the storyline got toned-down significantly, because the novel has elements that, when translated from book to screen, would make the film rated R, e.g., the text message Astrid finds on Michael's phone, Bernard Tai's version of a fun bachelor party, Bernard Tai, and the little gift Rachel receives at the bachelorette party.I also thought the film incorporated plot changes that worked in its favor. For example, seeing Goh Peik Lin attend Ah Mah's party made my day. Awkwafina is a comic genius and said all the things we the audience would have said when entering Tyersall Park for the first time. I mean, she took a selfie on the staircase! And why would anyone not give Awkwafina more screen time?I personally liked how the gambling scene was a foreshadowing of the dialogue between Eleanor and Rachel over a game of mahjong. The parallel made Rachel appear as a stronger character.My main critiques are that the film was too short: I wanted to see more of the city and meet more characters.1) I missed seeing Philip Young, who, alongside Astrid, was one of my favorite characters in the novel, as he reminds me of a Mr. Bennet-type.
2) I wanted to see more evidence of social stratification, specifically among Mainlanders and old-money Singaporeans, as it would have helped to illustrate the Asian contemporary experience.
3) I would have liked to have witnessed the linguistic nuances in the parental relationship between Rachel and her mother. In the novel, Kerry Chu speaks to her daughter in Mandarin and Rachel Chu responds in English, both speaking a different language while comprehending each other perfectly-a mode of communication that is characteristic in some cases of parents interacting with their 1st generation Asian Americans. This would have also signified the emotional ties of language with family and the home.As a Chinese adoptee raised in the States, I give this film a 10/10, not simply because of Asian representation, but because I left the theater feeling good, especially from the catharsis of crying so much. And isn't that what films are supposed to do? Tell a story while giving us some glimmer of hope? That because we have seen someone's story through their eyes, we can become better, more empathetic human beings?My critiques are not based on the production quality, casting choices, or storytelling, but simply my own preference for the novel to the film. In this case, the book was better than the movie, only because I got to know the characters better. However, Jon M. Chi delivers a cultural milestone that has been 25 years overdue, hence the 10/10 stars.",Crazy Rich Asians

Crazy Rich Asians is more a family movie to me because they mostly talked about the traditions and family honor. Every asian family has its traditions and beliefs on what a family is all about. There is no better team than a family but it doesn't mean it's perfect. It was shown in the whole movie that there are people in everyone's family that we don't get along with.

Got bored of the same people in American films.But I really hate to give this movie a bad rating, I really, really wanted to like it. But I've just seen this entire storyline before, many times. If you watch older Bollywood films, like from the 70's and 80's, then you've seen this movie. Super rich guy falls in love with a poor girl. Mother disapproves, goes to lengths to prevent them being together. Love prevails in the end. Heck, they even had the scene where he goes on the plane to propose in time, typical. But that's just the beginning. There is NO character development. At all. Right up until the end of the movie, I didn't know ANTHING about any of the main characters, even the main girl! Usually in movies, you start to connect with the character and learn about them. This movie gave none of that, at all. I needed to know her personality. I'm sure maybe the book gave that, but I understand things are hard to transition into a book. Even when she found out a family secret in the movie, it was still really hard to sympathize with her, because I knew very little about her.I guess for me personally, I didn't like it because for me it was predictable. But that's because I watch alot of movies and read alot of books, so I expect more from films. But I mean it's great for the high school crowd I guess. I hate to bring race into it, but I primarily watched the movie because it was an all-Asian cast (being Asian myself, I had to go out and support it lol). Which is why I'm just so disappointed. At some points during the movie, I felt confused. And was getting characters mixed up with each other cause no one stood out other than the funny friend. Who I loved btw.

In fact we disliked it so much, we didn't even wait to see the ending.There was certainly no romance, or comedy here, and the story line must surely have been identical to a dozen other similar movies.The characters were weak and shallow, and I have no doubt that the manner in which they were portrayed, was an embarrassment to the average person living in Singapore. Who bore no resemblance whatsoever to any of them.In fact, I dare say that there would be many Asians around the world who would have been very unhappy with the way they were portrayed.

The plot could be considered ""cheesy,"" but to me with Chinese culture added in for the setting gives everything a unique spin and balances out the cheesiness.
Then, the Chinese cultural background of this movie is just perfect. As a Chinese with an international background I can honestly relate so much to the traditional beliefs of Nick's family and Rachel, their way of thinking and of course the food (yay dumplings).
Lastly, I loved the mahjong scene. The director integrated the ancient and well-loved Chinese ""sport"" into a typical confrontation scene exceptionally cleverly. It's not the usual showdown that I would usually expect. Everything went so smoothly, Rachel never gave up but decided to let go, which just added another different stroke to her dynamic character. Honestly, every part of that scene was on point.
Great acting, ok like I'm no professional on judging acting skills, but to me, the eyes of the characters moved me emotionally and brought me into the mood of them.
It's a movie with a happy ending, which just left me happy too.

This was actually an advantage since I was always waived though immigration, customs, and the casino entrance (the casino is free for foreigners, $100/day for Singaporeans).
If anyone asks me what the major religion of Singapore is I just tell them that they worship money. It's true. Yes they have churches, temples, and mosques - but nothing can compete with money. Starting a conversation asking about investment options is normal.
Comments on the movie: It's a loooonnnngggg plane ride. I never got first class, business class was great on Singapore Air, barely tolerable on US airlines. You may die in economy and no one will care.
The ""street food"" scenes are accurate but a misnomer. You don't buy food off of vendors on the street - they are gathered together in strictly regulated food courts. Hawker centers are outdoor and usually visited at night. Food courts are air conditioned and connected to shopping malls, slightly more expensive than hawker centers but worth it for a fat white guy.
Speaking of air conditioning, Singapore is equatorial. It's hot. It's humid. The sun is directly overhead at noon and would melt lead on the sidewalk except that you would be arrested for littering the sidewalk with lead.
Speaking of being arrested in Singapore, if you are a reasonably well adjusted human being don't worry about it. Illegal drugs and violent crimes carry the death penalty. It is rarely imposed because people have learned not to do these things. Singapore posts a lot of laws because they are an amalgamation of many cultures. If you don't know whether it is acceptable to defecate in public there will be a sign to tell you not to.

742,degan001-1,"A well written, well-acted rom-com. Didn't think such a thing existed.",10,3 September 2018,"Understand from the beginning, this is a romantic comedy. It is not Shakespeare, or David Mamet or the Cohen Brothers. It is a feel good movie with quirky characters, a couple in love facing an obstacle and some good laughs. If the basic plot had been used by a lesser writer and filmed by the average TV director of no fame, it would be just another Lifetime movie. You'll most likely see the ending coming a mile a way. 
 But this is a very funny and genuinely charming script, with a top flight cast and a director with a flare for character driven stories. It is filled with enjoyable characters you actually want to spend two hours with. And the fun is not in guessing how it ends but watching it get there. 
 The premise isn't unique. Guy and girl are in love. He is going home to be best man at a wedding and he invites her to come and meet his family. And she discovers that he is heir to one of the wealthiest old money families in Asia. And not all of them impressed with the self-made woman he's brought with him. In this story, he is from Singapore, as were her parents, and they meet in the US. And he's told her nothing about the family business and their exorbitant wealth. 
 When I say wealthy, I mean obscenely, fantastically, let's go buy 1.4 million dollar earrings wealthy. And since most of the film takes place in Singapore, surrounded by his family and their wealthy friends, you spend a lot of time seeing conspicuous consumption. And for our heroine, it is also a mine field.
Therin lies a tale.
 I am having trouble believing half of the reviews I've read here. The review board is loaded with criticism because of the opulent lifestyle portrayed. Even more bizarre are the comments about gold digging, meaning I assume the main female character. I can't believe they saw the same film I did. Were some of these reviewers out getting popcorn for much of the film? 
 First, the main female character is NOT a gold digger in any sense of the word. The story makes it clear she fell in love with him before she knew he was rich. In fact, that is part of the set up. And I will not give away the ending, but the confrontation with the mother toward the end in the Mah Jong parlor should make it clear that she is anything but a gold digger. Did people not see this scene or what?
 And yes, you will see rich people living the life of the wealthy. So what? Are people really this jealous that seeing wealthy characters on a screen drives them nuts? If I was heir to a multi billion dollar fortune, I would try to do a lot of good with that money. I would also take advantage of living in a beautiful house, with great food, expensive cars and I would throw my daughter a wedding that cost millions. The people here live the way any of us would live if we had access to this kind of wealth. I feel kind of sorry that some viewers couldn't look past the trappings of wealth displayed and see a good story well told. Low self-esteem I guess. 
 The last thing to mention is that ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is beautifully filmed.
And for being a light-hearted rom com, it still brings a few very powerful moments to the screen. It brings just enough substance to be one of the best in the genre. Seriously, if this ends up being one of nine movies that receives an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, I would not be upset (if it wins however, I'll wonder what the academy was thinking). Supporting actress and actor Oscar nods would also not be out of place for Michelle Yeoh (the mother) and Nico Santos respectively.
 Once again, you are not going to see any great revelations in filmmaking here. Just a very well made and entertaining rom com that will leave anyone with a sense of humor smiling.

The supporting characters all had incredibly strong personalities and I do wish Gemma Chan's arc had been more personified- here's to hoping for the sequel.The 3rd act dragged a bit - but the humor of Akwafina, Ken Jeong was in on point. It's defined as a Rom com but it's an emotionally charged film, one if humor, splendor and crazy Families surrounded by opulence and wonder.Loved every moment and can't wait to see it again!",Crazy Rich Asians

I hope they make the entire trilogy.,Crazy Rich Asians
752,jonathan557,"Well above expectations, a tale of undettered love clashing with familial and class tradition.",9,27 December 2018,"I didn't really know what to expect with this movie, I've heard high praise from friends and family. As an aside I am a 3rd generation American-Chinese man.The ensemble cast was well balanced, the 2 star-crossed lovers acted well and were believable. The strict mother from high society with family traditions set in generational stone played by Michelle Yeoh was done very well, with a mixture of sinister character, a feeling of living as a black lamb, and finally at the end - understanding of her own selfishness vs her son's desire. The hilarious friend, who provided comedic relief throughout the film. And also moral support and understanding. Truly an all star cast.
Note: There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the casting, particular in the leading male role being Malaysian-English. As for that, all I'll say is that he is a brilliant actor. And that I'm sure the casting was done with intent in regards to the finished project. For me, it matters not whatever race or however little ""Asian"" blood they have in them. Their talent will speak for themselves.The story was good, a little cheesy but overall I enjoyed the ride. There are quite a few unexpected plot elements, and their resolutions were done well.

If we were in '80s or '90s, I would call this movie as a mediocre cliche love story.. Nowadays, even barbie doll animation movies for children don't have such a poor script like this one has..And also, don't get tricked by the ""comedy"" genre it has here on IMDB.. Because that was my mistake starting to watch it in the first place.. There is a little effort to make one or two funny scenes, but only the effort. The result is a complete failure when it comes to comedy.. If there were a couple of moments this movie made me only smile, it would probably balance the whole other scripting disaster..I can only guess the title became ""relatively"" popular because there are some ""relatively"" famous actors are in the cast, especially on social media.. and because they obviously spent pretty good money on staging and production..

I said, I will give it a try, but I'm not too optimistic that the movie will live up to my expectations.
From the title, I knew the movie was about materialism and fashion, so I was expecting something fun and funny, along the lines of The devil wears Prada, or Confessions of a shopaholic, but was downright disappointed.
The movie seems to try to showcase Asians like they are underrated and much more cool than people give them credit for.
I couldn't laugh at any of the jokes, and it mostly made for some uncomfortable moments of embarrassment, with an audience that had a large portion of asians.
I think many of them probably got embarrassed or disappointed too, because this is definitely not the best portrayal for them.
Granted they achieved more acceptance after beating the West at the economic game at which the West seemed to be invincible, after China's shift from a communist to a capitalist of sorts country, but, did the movie have to be all about materialism and shallow ostentation?

Having been raised in a very traditional Chinese family, the portrayal of customs was lacking credibility. Eleanor would not have directly confronted Rachel to tell her that she could not marry her son. Face and guanxi are critical aspects of the Chinese culture. Any such communication would have been indirect on Eleanor's part. For Rachel and newer generation Chinese, that concept is considered archaic and even devious, but for older Asians avoiding the lost of face of others is critical. Perhaps, something the new generations should think about like the golden rule.The Mah Jongg scene was also lacking credibility. The real Eleanor would never agree to meet under those circumstances.

Constance Wu and Michelle Yeoh are excellent and Henry Golding is a great choice for Nick Young part despite what the critic said. Awkwafina and Nico Santos are perfect as comic relief.

801,michaelmillertime,Crazy Rich Asians Review,6,4 September 2018,"Im not gonna lie, I was -iffy on seeing this. While I'm not the biggest romance fan, I still can see the appeal in some great movies. I mean, some of the most well known movies, like Gone With the Wind, Titanic, and Breakfast at Tiffany's, are all centered around romantic storylines. However, most modern romance movies aren't that good, which is why I was hesitant to seeing Crazy Rich Asians. Then again, it was getting great reviews by critics, and I have recently been on a movie-seeing slump, so I wanted to see a movie that I might consider good. As I'm writing this now, I am glad that I did see this movie.Crazy Rich Asians is a movie about Asian-American woman Rachel Chu, a middle class professor at New York University, meeting her boyfriend's, Nick Young, family in Singapore for his brother's wedding.. However, it is shown that Nick hasn't told Rachel what his family is like, as, like the title suggests, they are CRAZY RICH. Now, Rachel has to survive his family's negative outlook on her in order to gain their approval and stay with Nick. Sound's cliched, right? Well, that's one of this movies faults, as it doesn't sound very appealing. We've seen this setup a million times before, so it's not really anything different. However, if you look past the plot and into other elements, you will have a good time.Three things that this movie does great is the script, choregraphy, and the characters (well, half of them). The dialogue in Crazy Rich Asians is very realistic, and it resembles some of the troubles people in the situation in the film might experience in the film. None of it felt forced, and in any situation, it doesn't feel weird or stupid. From the wedding, to the party, to meeting the parents, and to just having a conversation, the dialogue is great! Probably the best scene is the sexes bachelor's and bachelorette's parties. Rachel is talking with one of the bridesmaids at a spa, while Nick is talking with his friend on a dock. Nick's friend is talking about how many struggles Rachel and everyone else will go through due to her not being rich like them. While they are having this conversation, the bridesmaid that is talking to Rachel is showing us exactly what Nick's friend is saying, as she is slowly taunting her to the point of tears, as she mentions how she and Nick were together, and how Rachel's relationship might also end. After she runs away in tears, the bridesmaid texts the other bridesmaids in a group chat about how she ""fell for it"". Brilliant pacing.While it may not be very popularized by the film studios that made this movie, the choreography and the set designs are also very good. Again, much like the dialogue, it felt ""natural"", and it was very well made and shown. Since Nick's family is Chinese, many gestures of the culture are shown, and many other pieces are also shown well, such as the food, language spoken, and the costumes.However, some things that I didn't like very well were some of the side characters. We are introduced to Nick's siblings at the beginning, and they are all very different. One is a director that has a girlfriend, and she is very ""open"". The other is a strong and very hardworking businessmen, and the final one, his sister, is a very generous and extravagant woman. We never so much as here from them, only to be comic relief later in the movie, and this irks me, as they put a lot of evidence on how important family is. The mother, however, is very developed, as she grows from disliking Rachel, as she used to be just like her. At the end, however, she comes around to them being together, and approves. Rachel's best friend is also in this movie, an while many people liked her, I just thought that Awkwafina, the actress who plays her, was okay. There are many other side characters that are introduced that are somehow relevant to the plot, but since the film barely sheds much light onto them, other than one particular character, they are never really unforgettable.SPOILERSAlso, the ending to this movie. I thought that it was very cliched. Rachel and Nick rejoice after Nick's mother uncovers a very dark secret about Rachel's past, which leads her to split with Nick. They get back together (it isn't specified how many days or weeks it took for them to start seeing each other, which is the only moment of bad pacing in this movie) and Nick proposes. However, Rachel shoots him down, and is boarding a plane back to New York when Nick gets on the plane, apologizes, and tries again, with this time around, Rachel says yes. While this part of the ending I thought was okay, I would also would've appreciated a darker ending to this movie than that. The bad part was the subplot. One of the bridesmaids that actually likes Rachel has a husband that is cheating on her. They breakup and she moves out. This part was very underdeveloped, going so far as to not even telling us who he was cheating on her with, or literally giving us less than 10 minutes of screen time devoted to all of this. Somehow, the people who made this movie just didn't care too much about this, but they needed to make the movie longer. Crazy Rich Asians is a good movie that I would recommend to anybody interested in romances, or just want's to have a pleasant time watching a movie. If I could, I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 instead of a 7. Unfortunately, I can't, due to IMBD's rating system, and I don't this movie deserves and 8/10, so a 7/10 will due just fine.",Crazy Rich Asians

805,gdlarson,Crazy Rich Clichès,2,3 December 2018,"This was hands down the most boring movie I have ever watched. You can guess the entire plot after the first 20 minutes. Not just because of the average at best directing and lazy writing, but because of the unending number of clichès. This whole movie is one clichè after another. Everything is predictable and terribly written. A lot of the dialogue feels forced but the actors and actresses do shine at some points and show what they're able to do with even a sub-par script. My biggest problem with this movie was that there was no real protagonist or antagonist and hardly any plot. There were too many characters to keep up with and all of them are so similarly written that if you closed your eyes and listened, you wouldn't know which character is which. That being said, some great cinematography showing off Singapore and some pretty good acting. Would not recommend to anyone or ever watch again though.",Crazy Rich Asians

I am a man. I like to see women who are pretty and show off their bodies, hair, etc. This film is Taliban style. The women are so covered up in pants and long skirts I started to think they didn't shave and felt embarrassed. one scene with women in bikinis is such a wide shot i was sure body hair was indeed the problem.

Then Americans must love blowing up planes, buildings, cities based on the Die Hard movies I used to watch. Also Westerners who just can't stomach the fact that hey Asian people too can have it all and yes they don't all live in mud huts and speak bad English. If you just watch the movie and forget about the skin colour of the actors, who cares what country it was filmed in and accept it is all fantasy and Hollywood entertainment. Nobody is asking you to be crazy, materialistic and rich just like Die Hard is not asking you to take on terrorist groups and jump off burning planes.

If you've read the book then you will understand the absolute bombardment of wealth, entitlement and class portrayed. You will also understand a lot of the context that they couldn't quite flesh out in the small amount of time the movie allowed.The book is more than wealthy people (though to be fair it's 98%) and there are obnoxious characters that place their value behind their obscene wealth. But the series also dives into the characters and what it means growing up in this world, as well as what shapes our identities and of course the struggle between doing what you want vs. doing what family expects.While the wealth may be over the top it also adds to the fun of these stories. It's fiction and the money adds almost a fantastical element since most of us couldn't even fathom having this sort of wealth.

Awkwafina steals a lot of scene trying to be funny and awkward at the same time.It also features some nice scenes at famous Marina Bay Sands hotel, and authentic Chinese cuisine.But the story is very weak (if any), the characters and acting are unlikable.

837,steve-232-885747,Hint of racism and anti-Christian bias in negative reviews,10,14 September 2019,"I adore this film for its colorful characters, character growth, and lovely ending. It is predictable in the sense that it offers a positive, upbeat ending together with some sweet irony. Otherwise, to call the film ""predictable"" is extremely unfair. Yes, the context of the film is the world of the wealthy, and an encounter between ""mere"" upper middle class and ""old"" seemingly limitless wealth and power. And it just so happens that the ultra-wealthy in this film are all Chinese/Asian. This is reflective of the fact that we live in a changing world involving a transfer of vast wealth from the west to the east. This makes some people uncomfortable, and I catch a sense of this when I read many of the negative reviews that use terms like ""conspicuous consumption"" ""1%"" etc (I am willing to bet that these reviewers do not use these terms when reviewing films about wealthy white people). The other very interesting cultural aspect of the portrayal of this very wealthy Chinese family is the fact that at least some members, including, most notably, the matriarch, are evangelical Christian. This represents another very real global cultural phenomenon in which China/Asia is taking the reins from the west. While the west chooses to travel a road of anti-family materialistic (in the sense of anti-theistic naturalism) Nietzscheism which invariably leads to a dissolution of sustainable culture (mass shootings, divorce, depression, etc), China is embracing the Christianity that empowered the west's original rise to world domination. This also makes many in the post-Christian west uncomfortable, because they expressly reject the values which Christianity fosters.There are very few films that I can stand to watch repeatedly. This film is in that select group. Just a terrific, uplifting, often humorous, somewhat family friendly, piece of entertainment.",Crazy Rich Asians

As that was the opener I stopped watching and according to other reviews correctly assumed the rest of the film would be garbage too.,Crazy Rich Asians
840,ConnorTheGinger,This was good...,6,1 January 2019,"I find Crazy Rich Asians to be very overrated. The movie has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (with an average rating of 7.6/10) and a 74% on Metacritic. Had it not been for these numbers, I would never have watched the movie since I don't like most romantic comedies made by studios.If Crazy Rich Asians wasn't the first Hollywood movie to have an all Asian cast in years, people wouldn't care for it. I appreciate the fact that it is a Hollywood movie that has an all Asian cast, and respect Warner Bros. for being the studio to back it. However, I don't think my appreciation for that fact should be reflected in my rating of the quality of this movie.Crazy Rich Asians is a good movie, but nowhere near as good as most people say it is. The worst thing about it is the story. It's extremely predictable and hits all the same beats as any mainstream romantic comedy released in the past twenty or so years. The musical compositions are also very weak. It all just sounds like stock music.My greatest takeaway from Crazy Rich Asians is the acting. A lot of the people in this movie did a fine job. Constance Wu was good as Rachel, and I'm interested in seeing what else she does in the future. Michelle Yeoh was also good as Nick's mother, and I kind of wish she had gotten a Golden Globe or a SAG nomination for her performance.Overall, this is a very familiar movie that differs from the pack due to the acting. I'd recommend Crazy Rich Asians if you like most romantic comedies, but if you're like me and don't like them as much I would suggest skipping this movie.",Crazy Rich Asians

The screenplay exceeded the writing shown in the book. An additional scene added just for the movie (don't worry, no spoilers) visually puts a bow on the story.Chemistry abounds between the two leads. I hope to see more of Henry Golding, whose transition from BBC presenter to charming lead actor was very impressive. The entire cast is funny at just the right times, and direction manages pace effectively throughout. I was reminded of a 50s-era romantic comedy, and I definitely intend that as a compliment!Michele Yeoh carries the generational story admirably. I haven't read much in appreciation of the subtleties of the dumpling scene or other visual illustrations of the multi-generational aspects of the story, but this is a movie where viewers will be noticing details over multiple screenings.My husband and I both enjoyed our date night seeing Crazy Rich Asians.

I love that they told the same story in a different way. Classism exists in the real world and they were spot on in the movie. I like that it also showed strength, persistence, and lessons learned.

Surprisingly, the author is from Singapore and should read about your very respected and famous PM Lee Kuan Yew in AsiaOne by his son. His grandfather gave him an English name Harry which he discarded to show the West that he is proud of his Chinese name and heritage.

856,egdsf,Predictable glitzy fun,7,17 September 2018,"I love a good romcom and Crazy Rich Asians was just that with glitz, glam, and of course an all Asian cast! I loved Joy Luck Club and while that movie and Crazy Rich Asians showcase a mostly Chinese cast of characters, I identified with several themes mentioned throughout. Whether through making distinctions about Asians vs. Asian Americans, the American pursuit of passion vs Asian filial piety, to women's achievements and intellect not meaning much unless you're the right ""match,"" the movie was more thought provoking than I expected. I would love to see another Hollywood movie with a greater diversity of Asian actors featured, but I'm sure that day will come...but hopefully not in another 25 years!The movie wasn't so much about Rachel and Nick's love story but rather Rachel's introduction and struggle for acceptance into a world that she had no clue about. My main gripe with the film was Nick's character. Nick failed to prep her and instead had her friend had to do the work (the hilarious Awkwafina). Nick was away being a groomsmen while Rachel navigated on her own. But Constance was amazing in this role. Whereas Nick's character and Henry Golding's acting were more one dimensional and flat, Rachel / Constance were strong, powerful, and emotionally complex. Besides that, the movie did have several stereotypes, but not unexpected for this genre. While you could tell how the film would end, it was still fun to see the journey unfold in such a glamorous, ultra rich world. I did forget at points that I was watching an ""Asian"" movie because the film managed to transcend that label. In the end, it was just a fun movie to watch.",Crazy Rich Asians

The dialogue is really lame. And you'll get what you expect: gay characters are flamboyant; poor characters are wise and have good values; rich characters are plotting to keep themselves pure.

With previews done and cell phones tucked away, we waited for the funny parts of the movie to arrive...and we waited...and waited. Finally, about 20 minutes into the movie (seemed longer) we got some laughs in when Ken Jeong made his first, way too brief appearance. Awkafina was entertaining. She added much needed comic relief portraying an Asian Miley Cyrus. Overall, the cast is cute and charming. There were lots of great shots of Singapore, a place I have never been. I officially added it to my bucket list of destinations. I am all for seeing more culturally diverse movies come out of Hollywood. Unfortunately, this is just an OK product.

864,seasickdarwin,Truly Magical Film,10,17 August 2018,"Growing up asian, I have always had to stretch my imagination in trying to associate with lead characters. In this movie, it just felt so good to dream big. For people who are dissapointed, it is more than fine. Most people have a sea of American Cinema to swim in, but for Asian-Americans it is a proverbial desert. How this movie differs from other films surrounding Asians like Joy Luck Club, is that this is a fun movie with romantic and heartfelt leads that just happen to be Asian. And that's the point!!! For the first time in American Cinema, we don't have to associate with people who look completely different. This is a movie you can walk out of feeling proud and being excited about how others who are not Asian may see you. I imagine this is how many Italian-Americans felt after seeing Rocky for the first time. It may seem similar to so many rom-coms but it is important to share with other readers that this movie means so very much to me. The acting was wonderful, the dialogue was funny and sincere, and while the film is less about Chinese/Singaporian culture (see Joy Luck Club), it portrays Asians in a playful, sexy, and humorous way. This is not the Asian Black Panther, but I get the comparison. While Black Panther is a movie that so many kids need to diversify their ideas of what a hero looks like; Crazy Rich Asians is a movie that asians can take a date of any persuasion and feel good about.I am giving this movie exactly the number of stars it deserves. Rating this movie within the world of romantic comedies makes this movie a 10. It's value to many minorities out there is priceless.",Crazy Rich Asians
865,sunnyksood,Terrible movie. Not worth watching,1,7 August 2019,"I watched this with my wife as she was in the mood for a romcom and I thought, why not. I regret it. It had a shallow plot line and a terrible set of characters. I don't know why the makers of this film expected viewers to be in awe of tourist shots of Singapore and then amazed at how cool the lives of rich people are.
The way the characters are written don't inspire any empathy with any of the characters. The main plot line of a newly engaged girl trying to win the approval of a potential mother-in-law is tried and tested. In principle there is nothing wrong with this as a central plot line as I'm sure many people relate to this. But the focus of the excess of the 1% and the attempt to normalise it and generate sympathy makes the film completely unrelatable and very frustrating. Do not watch it.",Crazy Rich Asians

What makes this film different is the Asian cast, crew, writer, and director. The film takes place in Singapore and is shot is such a lush and beautiful way as to make it look like another planet, which I suppose is the point. This is a planet inhabited by the incredibly wealthy who have lost touch with their own humanity in their endless pursuit of wealth and power. How could a lowly, yet lovely Chinese American college professor marry into such a family without running through a harsh social gauntlet? There are some comedy standouts in Crazy Rich Asians that deserve praise, Ken Jeong and Nico Santos, but Awkafina, with her unbridled energy, practically steals the show.

871,lesiashyshko,Not an enjoyable watch,3,17 March 2019,"I'm not Asian or American. Probably I'm not the intended audience for this film because I don't have cultural context for whatever was going on in this movie. I just saw raving reviews of this film in the Western media and hey, people are people everywhere. So I wanted to wind down to a nice feel-good movie, where pretty people in pretty decorations solve their superficial problems. That was basically the height of my expectations.
Sadly, the movie didn't deliver. The majority of characters were vacuous and underdeveloped. There is absolutely no reason to care about them.The romance between the couple takes like 5 minutes of screen time, so we don't have time to believe in their relationship or care about it enough. Humour for the most part falls flat. The main character, played by Henry Golding, seems sweet, but I think it probably the actor's own personality that translated to the screen, rather than good plot and direction. And of course Michelle Yeoh, who is a gorgeous woman and a very capable actor regardless, gave a performance that stood out in its quality.
Notwithstanding the pretty picture of Singapore aerial views, the movie was a rather tedious affair. And it wasn't that feel-good as I expected.",Crazy Rich Asians

876,nicki_freeman-55780,Too PC,6,3 September 2018,"Having just come from living in Hong Kong I thought that this might be funny. Despite the diplomatic idea that the world's populations are all the same, the cultures are all different (i.e. we can be equal in value but different in culture) and within these differences there is much humour (and frustration and confusion etc but again - also humour). I thought that this might be the Asian equivalent of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" ..... or the Australian movie ""The Castle"" or any number of other movies that send up their own national idiosyncrasies. However, perhaps it is 10 years to early - to close to the mass arrival of Asian immigrants to the West for the script writers to truely embrace the stereotypes and pull out all stops because they started strong with the first scene from the 90's and then backed away from growing the comedy from there. In the end, it was just (and I emphasise 'just') a western rom-com set in Singapore with Asian stars. I thought the acting was strong and it was a good cast but the 'Crazy' characters were introduced and then passed over where they needed to have there own minor storylines to add comedic value...... it just lacked the confidence with the writing to push the envelope and revel in the comedic opportunities that the title ""CRAZY Rich Asians"" implied.",Crazy Rich Asians

The battle she faces with the mother of the man she loves is heart breaking and a reality check to the struggles of cultures. The 'because of me' moment brought me to my knees; the sense of the impact Wu was creating and the moment when her mother looks back. An instinct is present and the moments of women are present.

911,lefeverb-16770,Amazing,9,14 March 2019,"Nick Young's family is one of the richest and highest-platform families is all of Singapore. His parents run the family business yet he was supposed to take over in the beginning of this film. Nick grew up in Singapore and now he lives in New York and his girlfriend is Rachel Chu. Rachel is an Economics professor at NYU and is an only child, growing up with only her mother in New York. Nick asks Rachel to go to Singapore with him to his best friend's wedding, yet she doesn't know he is incredibly wealthy.When they arrive in Singapore they have a packed schedule right away. His best friend and his fiancee take Nick and Rachel to a street market at which Nick, knows all the vendors. At the bachelor and bachelorette parties Nick and Rachel have a wild time, including Rachel having a bad experience. Rachel soon realizes that a lot of people in high society in Singapore don't like her. Throughout this entire movie she and Nick face the troubles of the wealth and hate against their relationship.Crazy Rich Asians is not only beautifully scripted it also has a realistic factor. Crazy Rich Asians shows the real problems in relationships and shows us that not all movies are super unrealistic. This movie is an outstandingly casted and beautifully produced event in itself.When most people watch a romantic movie or a rom com they usually don't expect it to be realistic. The main leads find each other in a subway, both for unusual reasons and fall in love. Or they meet while one is visiting a friend in the hospital and the other has cancer, they fall in love and the one with cancer dies leaving the other heartbroken. But Crazy Rich Asians is not your typical rom com or romance movie. Crazy Rich Asians is realistic in many ways, such as the fact that Rachel and Nick don't know everything about each other's families as most romantic movies seem to portray. Most romance movies have the main characters' families love them/approve right away or they don't meet them at all. In Crazy Rich Asians, Rachel is the envy of almost every single girl in Singapore.Most movies have a big budget, Crazy Rich Asians' being $30 million, yet somehow some movies turn out terribly scripted or casted or produced in itself. So how come Crazy Rich Asians was so well produced and casted if it had the same budget as these low-quality films? I think the location chosen to film this movie was a very wise choice. It was a beautiful big city, yet they had some more rural locations such as the somewhat hidden mansion and the islands during the Bachelor and Bachelorette parties. Another reason why this movie stand out is the actual scenes that take place within the city. For example during the wedding, the isles have fake grass and the center is lined with flowers. Everyone attending had flowers that lit up when the bride walks down the aisle. The music chosen was very interesting. They had all Chinese (or what is believed to be Chinese) songs except for one, the one when the bride walks down the aisle at her wedding. I think the purpose of this is so we pay attention to the words being sung in this song. I also think that it was interesting how quiet that whole scene was, the only noise being the singer, and at one point not at all.In conclusion, Crazy Rich Asians shows a lot of unique culture that you won't find in any other recent romance movie. It shows the realistic sides to a relationship without being too cheesy or fake. Overall Crazy Rich Asians is a high recommend and a guaranteed joy at the end.",Crazy Rich Asians

917,steryna,Overrated and Predictable,4,24 July 2019,"Crazy Rich Asians is merely an overrated romance movie, using the overused Cinderella plot without any interesting twist included. The audience would most likely be able to somewhat determine the ending of the movie without witnessing the end of the movie due to the nostalgia from the typical dramatic plot. The movie also failed in depicting the clash between social class as it is merely exaggerated to fit the stereotypical upper class and is very shallow lacks tension so the matter is not as highlighted as it should be. The movie only succeeds in further enhancing various upper class stereotypes, including the importance of appearance and maintaining their social class over love.
Another thing is that the characters are not as in sync with their social class, especially the upper class. Nick being the typical Prince Charming instead of an actual heir and Peik Lin's family members who have crude manners as opposed to their supposed social class. This portrayal of the upper class comes off as shallow and is mostly dependent on the props that are actually fitting. If not for the illusion created by the props, this movie would not have gained the same recognition.",Crazy Rich Asians

It cannot claim to be absolutely authentic and represent all the features of life in Asia. The cast was assembled from popular actors of Asian origin, the keyword here is 'popular'. We can't blame the creators for this, because as I said before, the film is shown in different countries. Anyway, we can't call it implausible and dreary.It is primarily entertaining with some thought-provoking moments that show the negative and not glamourised side of a rich life. It can be a little moving at the end if you like the drama about the relationship between parents and children and about the power of love.In general, this is a beautiful high-quality picture.

924,l-92291-54435,A Film Rich In Detail,8,22 January 2020,"Rom-coms prove to provide viewers with more than just an excuse to have a girls night and drink cheap wine with the movie, Crazy Rich Asians. Viewers will be immersed in the movie rather than their drink, and will not forget the vibrancy and sophistication of the film. Some things that play a part in its success are its breathtaking setting, smooth transitions, appropriate cultural music score, and costumes that mimic the evolution of characters.Yes, and to no surprise, all of the characters are crazy, rich, and Asian.The film follows a man, Nick Young (Henry Golding), who meets the girl of his dreams, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) in New York. When Nick invites Rachel to his best friend's wedding in his home country of Singapore, Rachel joins him, with little knowledge of his family's fortune. A whirlwind of family drama, displays of great wealth, and beauty follow after they arrive. Nicks's disapproving family, especially his mother, has great hesitations about Rachel (unpredictable right?). Despite family wishes, Nick goes to great lengths to show Rachel that in the end, he will choose love over wealth.While other rom-coms, even the classics like 13 Going On 30 and The Wedding Planner, are cheesy, Crazy Rich Asians is dynamic and well thought. Don't get me wrong, it is impossible for any rom com to not have cheesiness. It is not hard to cringe at some of Crazy Rich Asians' clichés, but other scenes make up for this.The director Jon M. Chu seamlessly blends together the film by using animated pictures that overlap with scenes. In one instance during the start of the film, animated symbols are used to show phone screens and the exchange of gossip about Nick and Rachel's relationship.The beauty found in the intricacy of animation does not stop there, as the backdrop of Singapore provides a blend of luscious greenery and bustling streets. From sights of rows of food vendors to even the Singapore Land Tower, viewers will feel a part of the Singaporean way of life. Along with this culture comes the theme of being native Chinese versus Chinese-American. Nick's mother, Eleanor, believes Rachel is unworthy of her son because unlike traditional women in Singapore, Rachel is independent. Additionally, the occasional subtitles in the movie portray an element of authenticity, as the movie included a plethora of Chinese lines in the script.While the movie does display a lot of romantic moments between Nick and Rachel, there is no shortage of comedic ones too. Despite having a supporting role, Peik Lin (Awkwafina) provides humor through even the tone of her voice when she says lines like ""Damn, Rachel. He's like the Asian Bachelor. '' She is not afraid to be honest, which is pretty refreshing since most rom-coms usually butter up everything. Previous to this role, Akwafina was a background actor that blended in. She was in movies like Neighbors 2 and Storks, but you probably don't remember her from that, which is probably for the best.Don't worry, the musical score of the movie will not be forgotten. Was it annoying to feel like the music all sounded the same? Yes. But, the music matched the tempo of scenes and was filled with cultural relevance. For example, as Rachel approached Nick's grand house, the music became quiet and slow to give dramatic effect.The movie truly comes full circle through the evolution of sophistication and luxury in Rachel's clothes. In the beginning of the movie, Rachel was an ordinary New Yorker with a wardrobe of typical Gap clothing. When she wore this clothing, she was more meek and quiet. However, as Rachel was introduced to colorful designer clothes and opulent jewelry, her character was more confident and outspoken. In moments like at the wedding however, the costumes were a little stereotypical and overdone.Overall, I would rate this movie a 8/10. It was captivating through its scenery and costumes, transitions, and music. Despite hanging on to some clichés, the movie contained a lot of emotions that was attributed to a great script and acting. Crazy Rich Asians is great for those who are looking for a modern rom-com that will dazzle you with an unconventional take on family, love, and wealth.",Crazy Rich Asians
925,r-15465,"Money Can't Buy Love, But it Can Easily Harm it.",9,24 January 2020,"The title gives enough of a description of what you are getting yourself into: Crazy. Rich. Asians. Although the title may be criticized for being elementary, all three words are very substantial yet honest to the film. With the first ALL Asian cast hollywood has seen in the last 30 years, Crazy Rich Asians brings a refreshing perspective that is uncommon in most American films. Often compared to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, this movie gives an American audience insight to an unfamiliar culture.Along with a refreshing cast, Crazy Rich Asians has an impeccable romantic story. I, myself, am a rom-com fanatic and this film is beyond anything I've ever seen. It has a mixture of the enchanted feeling that you may get when watching a movie like Notting Hill or My Best Friend's Wedding, yet also has more layers than these other films. New elements of culture, scenery, and family complications make this movie stand out in comparison to other rom-coms.The leading female role, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) visits Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding) for his best friend's wedding. While here, Rachel is greatly scrutinized due to the fact that she comes from a underprivileged Asian/American family, while Nick comes from an affluent dynasty, the Young family. Although Rachel has the normal nerves of meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time, she has no idea what disaster she is getting herself into. Rachel quickly finds out that he is not only the heir of the wealthiest family in Singapore, but also one of their most desired bachelors. While not only having to worry about catty socialites, Rachel also struggles to find approval from Nick's traditional mother. Rachel's every move is judged in efforts to protect the precious Nick Young from a run of the mill American girl. Although the saying that money can't buy love still stands true, it can easily harm it.The setting in Crazy Rich Asians is different yet refreshing to an American audience. While Hollywood movies primarily take place in New York or California, Crazy Rich Asians is filmed in the bustling, vibrant country of Singapore. Along with the setting, the cinematography in this movie is quite breathtaking. The filmmakers are able to show the elite parts of Singapore as well as the simple towns. The filmmakers often pan from the wealthy skyline and fade to the quaint towns that Singapore has to offer, meanwhile, playing traditional Asian music in the background. Some may argue that this movie over glorifies Singapore, but I feel that's what brings extra enchantment to the movie.Nick's best friend's wedding is one scene is particular that screams cinematic eye candy. From the beautiful guitarist singing the mushy ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" to the extravagant gowns that the women were dressed in, this scene screams romance. Fitting the common theme of this scene, Rachel and Nick share a sweet, loving moment together. Even after a draining week, at this moment everything comes together and seems calm and perfect. And I guarantee there won't be a dry eye in the audience.In addition to the lovey dovey parts of this movie, the comedy is equally important. Many supporting roles in the movie give this stressful time some well-needed comic relief. Rachel's best friend in the film, Aramita, often brings this relief while also being one of Rachel's biggest supporters. In addition, with a huge zillionaire family like Nick has, there are bound to be some messed up characters who always know the wrong thing to say at the wrong time.Crazy Rich Asians has an underlying theme of perseverance in the efforts of love. Rachel and Nick are forced to defy all odds. In addition to the tumultuous yet romantic love story, the comedic relief is impeccable. This film not only has the perfect balance of romance and comedy, but also deeper elements of cultural diversity and cinematic perfection that make this film one of the best rom-coms of the decade.",Crazy Rich Asians

That implies that there should be some romance, and some comedy in the film - there was none of either. Not one little bit.This is the second-worst film I have ever seen (Closer was the worst), and the only reason why this was marginally better is because it didn't have all that double-crossing tedium that went on in Closer.Seriously, this film offered absolutely nothing. I cannot think of one reason why anybody would want to watch this. At the time of writing this review the average rating on imdb was 7.5. Don't believe it. I get that rom-coms are not to my taste, but others are at least watchable, and have an element of comedy.

I mean I feel like the intentions of including more diversity into Hollywood was completely butchered here. It doesn't depict authentic Asian culture and perpetuates sexist and racist undertones implicitly while using humor and the 'fairytale-like' storyline as a facade. Sexism was super evident when the members of the bachelorette party went crazy about a 'free shopping from' and were acting as mean girls towards the main character, Rachel; whereas the bachelor party was a lot less hostile and actually pleasant for the second main character, Nick. As for the storyline itself it was super predictable and also consisted of many holes. SPOILERS: In the end when she realized she couldn't be a 'chicken' to her potential mother-in-law she decided to not accept her boyfriend's proposal because it would be her to thank when her mother-in-law gets the daughter-in-law she desires. However this is just giving the mother-in-law all the power as she isn't taking things in her own hands and actually deciding for herself.

936,ridwanjunus,Crazy Rich Asians - A fun potrayal of Rich Asian Family 'Problem',9,15 October 2020,"First of all I am an Chinese Asian. I have a big family, event though that I am not come from rich family, however some of related family are quite rich. So I can say I know a little bit about real Asian family tradition.
I have watched this movie twice, and after the second view, I can catch several better understanding regarding things and other things that tried to be portrayed in this movie.
A little bit background story about this movie. This movie is based on novel written by Kevin Kwan. It tells about a young couple, Nick Young and Rachel Chu going another step with their relationship channelled by Nick Young best friend Colin invitation to Singapore, ask Nick to be his best man for the wedding. Nick ask Rachel to join him to Singapore for the wedding. In Asian culture, if a man invite you to join to a inner family party, it is a guarantee that he is ready to take another step with your relationship.
At first Rachel do not know that Nick is rich, and it is start revealing by itself. Even at first she did not know that he is not that rich, but a really rich.
As being stated by Rachel friend Peik Lein, the Young family is an old rich. It is being well portrayed in movie, by the mansion. It is seemed to be built from wood and has traditional kind of furniture inside. I am talking about the wood dresser that Nick has in his bedroom, or an old radio in the kitchen scene, or the head of tiger that was hunted at initial time of the house, where it is still all forest. Contrasted with Peik Lein new rich, which is all about bling, and gold, or as being said tried to mimic Versailles or Donald Trump bathroom.
The story start to built conflict. This is a very typical rich Asian family problem. It seemed to be stereotype, however this is a real deal and a real problem. Here are some thing, if you are asian, or you know asian, you will know this is true to some extent
1. For asian family is everything. Do you know why china have a lot of people? Because they believe more children more fortune. And family is everything. If you have business, you will gather all of your family member to be in part of it. No matter if he/she have a real capability. Some of course really have a desperate members of family, so they will really depend on their 'brightest' son to inherit their business tycoon. This kind of family stuff, is not a really big in American culture. This is one of the concern of Nick Young mother, that her son would not want to inherit their family business is he choose to have life with Rachel.
2. As being rich Asian family member, your life mostly will be controlled by your parent. Asian rich old culture, they will usually shaped their son/daughter to be their successor. And as being rich Asian they also really care about their family image. So not only that your education being controlled ( usually that can be applied directly to manage the family business), your partner also usually being controlled. What else that rich asian family want, except to be even richer? That is why planned marriage usually happened. They need to have a similar or even greater worth of fortune from their son/daughter spouse. And this movie this is being realistically portrayed. It is not that Nick Young's mother is all antagonist and only despise other lower level of life. ( This is usually portrayed in my country opera soap) . It is just a concerned mother that there will be no successor of their family business, and his husband need to work forever until death.
3. Stern stepmother and jealousy. as usual if you somehow manage to marry with the rich, stepmother will always do not agree. The reason is the same with the above reasoning, it is kind of a vicious cycle. Like Elaeonor Young said in the movie, she need to work it out with her stepmother for a very a long time for recognition, and it is never enough. At least for the dumpling making stuff. It seemed that Elaenour Young is a little bit jealous when the grandmother is kind of welcome with Rachel young at the first, and even ask her when you will marry grandson? From my standpoint and history with Asian parent, generally granma will not as strict as to his son, to their grandson, about choosing their life partner. After all it is too big gap of age , you know. However of course, still in the end if your family background a little bit mess up according to her threshold, she will still confront you anyway.
4. This is not a really asian family problem, but this interesting. I love Astrid character. She is a very perfect women, smart, rich and humble. Despite of her extravagant hobby to collect expensive items. She is always try to hide all these stuff in front of his husband, who is obviously a little bit less self confident with the perfectness of his wife. And this is actually create problem. A man ego is everything. That is for sure is a fact. So when you are being felt less from your wife, even though your wife is struggle to make you not to feel so, but still you know the truth. Astrid's husband felt he is not being valued as his husband, and the climax is when she is not excessively angry when she know that he is cheating her. usually a husband will be really relief if he know that his cheat is not being heavily confronted by his spouse. However this case is different. He is angry because, in his position, he is felt being condescended as husband. He felt that he has no value, that even when he is cheating, his wife is not fully angry with him. He felt unnecessary part of her life, that can be easily removed. The interesting thing here is that, there is nothing wrong with Astrid. She is perfect. She is really try hard to make her husband to be felt more empowered, by let him to run the Company for example. So this is more just an ego problem with Astrid husband.The movie also portrayed most iconic places in Singapore, and I will a little bit nostalgic, want to visit Singapore again, which is now a little bit difficult due to pandemic. The Chijmes, where the church blessing happened, the garden bay the bay, marina bay sands, the raffles, Changi Airport, and the Newton Food Centre. Restaurant at Bukit Pasoh road, that show iconic chinese shophouse in Singapore. While you can argue that this is not enough to represent Singapore ( Marina Bay Sand is american owned by the way) , however it is still beautiful.I love all the cast. Henry Golding is fit, according to me to potray the character. Constance Wu as Rachel also brilliant. I love Gemma Chan as Astrid. She is a unique character. I really hope to see how her character being more developed in next movie. Michelle Yeoh, you cannot argue how good is she, and I love Ken Jeong, Awkwafina to spice up with jokes, Ronny Chieng, and Jimmy O Yang to spice up with the comedic side.I can't wait for the sequel to come. Honestly I am not yet reading the novel :p",Crazy Rich Asians

However, the movie panders at every take and turn, to get it as wide a popularity as possible. It was formulaic. I also mentioned that the night it played here before it released nationwide, most of the audience was Asian, a fact, not an opinion.

949,ShinVolley,The struggle for Approval: Review of Crazy Rich Asians,10,5 October 2021,"In the beautiful country of Singapore where there is amazing food, alluring scenery, and a present divide between the dilemma of new money rich and old money rich. Crazy Rich Asians is a romantic comedy that focuses on economics professor Rachel Chu who goes on a trip with her long-term boyfriend to meet his family unknowingly of his social and wealthy status. Little to her knowledge this trip would have unforeseen revelations of not only her significant other and his family but also within her cultural identity as a Chinese American. Will Rachel be able to handle what's about to come her way and will she stay despite these challenges?In the movie, Crazy Rich Asians Rachel and Nick take a trip to Southeast Asia in Singapore and this is where the film is centered around. An important characteristic of the movie is the entire Asian cast. The Director Jon M. Chu stated in the Crazy Rich Asians cast call the video ""that this is an all Asian cast for America's Hollywood studio in a really long time and that it's a huge step for representation and an opportunity for Asian actors to show their talent"" then you have the main Characters Rachel Chu and Nick Young played by Constance Wu and Henry Golding the funny and loving best friend Peik Lin played by Awkwafina, Other notable actors such as Michelle Yeoh, Ronny Chang, and Gemma Chang are included in this cast. As this is an all Asian casted movie in a really long time the director did a good job in showing representation especially with an all asian cast and shooting the film in a place like Singapore where the Asian presence really shines.Red in Chinese culture is seen as a color of good luck and while Rachel Chu is preparing to attend a party that Nick has invited her to, that color of good luck was merely an empty symbol. Rachel in an attempt to satisfy his family and to make a great impression, wearing the red dress is changed into something of the complete opposite and something fancier and more expensive in order to fit in. Chinese culture didn't matter in this instance and it was just all about how expensive you look and your family background. Her being a born Chinese American leaves her feeling left out as she not only fit the social status of Nick's world but feeling guilty for not being as connected to her ethnic roots as well and being ostracized for it. It was a good effort that Rachel was trying to make a good impression by wearing the color of good luck red but it was only seen as the red envelope you get on Chinese New Year.Tyerssal park is the place Nick grew up at, and from afar a great house that looked like a palace that when you first see the only thing you feel is shocking. It was especially special because the Tan Hua was blooming and this only happens once a year. Rachel, in awe of the place, met all of Nicks's family including his Ah Ma (Nicks Grandmother) and his mom. In almost all of Southeast Asia locals usually don't like foreigners and don't really accept someone when they have no background of the person and this was the case for Elenor. Knowing that you'll never be approved as part of the family leaves her worried. Rachel knew that because she was a foreigner and that even though she's Chinese by blood she isn't by heart and felt it would be much harder for her to be accepted. Throughout the film, Rachel try's really hard to get approval from Elenor but she still doesn't approve of her. She is still trying to reconcile the two sides of her cultural identity as a Chinese-American which is harshly looked downed on by Elenor. Rachel meets with Elenor, Nick's mother at a Mahjong parlor. Mahjong is a traditional game played in Chinese culture. As they play the game the significance is that Rachel was trying to prove that your background doesn't define who you are and she's showing that she's worth more than she was treated. The movie really showed a great deal of the struggle of fitting in and cultural identity it was clear that Rachel didn't fit in because she was Chinese American.Rachel is seen as a gold digger for dating Nick by not only his family but those who are in the same social standing and those who follow the family in the public eye really shows us true love and her true intentions. No matter the obstacles that come her way and the hate that she gets, it shouldn't matter as long as she loves him for who he is. Nick was very willing to leave his wealth behind for Rachel. Even when she's told she'll never be enough, or when she finds a dead fish gutted in her hotel room she pushes along and even shows up to the wedding she didn't want to attend. There are so many scenes in the movie that show that Rachel is able to overcome the obstacles and not give them the satisfaction they all hope to get. It is understandable for Rachel to be seen as a gold digger because no one knows anything about her but it was truly inspiring to see her not be affected and her continues love towards Nick despite the hate she got.As one of the first all Asian-casted movies in a long time, Crazy Rich Asians takes us on a roller coaster of emotions we can relate to. We can see the representation of culture, true love, the consequences, and true worth. It's a typical romantic comedy we all love, where it all works out and they end with a happy ending.",Crazy Rich Asians

The book was way more appealing than I had first imagined it would be, and I'm happy to report that Jon Chu's screen version has surpassed my hopeful-but-wary expectations. Not to make it sound too simplistic, the movie was beautiful and very, very funny. Go see it!Yes, it is a romantic comedy - but this has such intriguing social and cultural undercurrents that it tempts even the fairly observant watcher away from taking the ""Cinderella"" story at its glitzy face value. While the numerous characters had to have their backstories compressed to fit into just two hours, we are given enough great dialogue, effervescent or slightly evil portrayals, and sumptuous visual clues to make the friends and family members in Singapore come alive. All the aunties, cousins and ladies-in-waiting may be slightly overwhelming for people who haven't read the book, but anyone with wacky friends and pompous relatives should get it, even if they are not Asian. I liked film's especially clever use of graphics, as well as the smooth-to-rocking score, the lush and verdant locations, the perfect designer costuming, and pretty much everything else. One of my favorite lines was about having attended Cal State Fullerton; but you must to watch it for yourself. I honestly have not laughed out loud during a film this much in decades. Oh, and I rather liked Chris Pang, too. A totally hot actor, even though I'm old enough to be his mother.As soon as Crazy Rich Asians officially opens, I'm going to catch it again. The preview was not enough, and there were so many little moments that deserve a second or third look.

The story is very ""cinderella""-like but in a way that is very identifiable. The villains aren't pure evil, you can see why they are so protective or conniving. While the film isn't convincing with every character development, it does well with the lead characters, particular Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) and Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh).

The main character is more of rich in culture but the other characters surrounding him like Colin or even Bernard could be flashier. I can't even remember that Bernard actually did a 'make-it-rain' scene but was told he did. If a really crazy rich Asian has a wedding, it's really all out. You can see it even on instagram. The cars, the fresh flowers and the fashion - it says it all. To me, I just felt it's under delivered in regards to the film title.

I've never read the book, but still I thought this film flowed really well, good natural dialogue and solid pacing. I'm not a fan of rom coms but I thoroughly enjoyed this film and even got a little emotional at the end. You know a movie is well written when you feel for a character. And that's what was so special about this film... each character is well rounded and has goals/motivations that make them do what they do and that's not easy these days in Hollywood. Even the strict mom (Eleanor Young, played by Michelle Yeoh) has very relatable and valid reasons for her distrust in our main protagonist, Rachel Chu (Constant Wu, omg <3)... I wouldn't even consider her a villain character. Of course the film has it's flaws, it's not very original, it has gaping holes that are never answered (exactly how did Rachel not know the man she was dating for A YEAR was the son of a famous billionaire family? Does no one do Google checks on people anymore?)Anyway, I highly recommend this film. Very feel good, perfect date movie.",Crazy Rich Asians
997,bdon-guma,"Take it for what it is, not what you want it to be",8,30 August 2018,"This movie is a romantic comedy based off of a book with an all Asian cast. It is not a political statement, it is not a satire aimed at the gross disparity of the wealth gap, and it is not a rally cry for Asian empowerment. The problem with critics is their tendency to read further beyond the purpose of a film: entertainment. Sure, some films are meant to incite thought and invoke serious discussions of real world problems; however, this film is hardly one of those. That said, the case can be made that Asians are underrepresented in American cinema and the portrayal of Asians have been primarily based on negative stereotypes and are essentially caricatures of the Asian race. Other than that, it is what it is. I enjoyed the film because I was able to see parallels with Asian traditions that my family holds (I am Filipino) and it was nice to see that portrayed on the big screen. The parts were acted well, however, I quickly tired of Awkwafina's character early on in the film; she quickly became distracting and annoying with her continuous commentary, although her family was an entertaining addition in the way they portrayed Hollywood's stereotypical view of Asians. Regarding the film itself, despite it's two hour run time, it kept me interested. The connection between Rachel and Nick felt genuine and it made you feel for them; although, it does get a little over the top at points but hey, it's a rom-com. This movie loses stars on the story, which was generic despite the Asian traditions, and it's comedic moments were just okay. With all of that said, this movie doesn't try to be more than what it is so if you go into it with that in mind, you will have a fun time.

1005,jckirvine-599-164392,Jane Austen Met Great Gatsby,8,26 August 2018,"This is a very entertaining romantic comedy that Hollywood has forgotten how to make. Some people call it a Cinderella story. I disagree. The heroine here, Rachel Chu, has her life together as an economics professor of NYU. She doesn't need ""rescuing"" by a prince charming. Plus, she has been dating her boyfriend, a fellow professor for a year without realizing he's the scion of a super wealthy family in Singapore. She's hardly a Cinderella or gold-digger.
 
What this reminds me of is Jane Austen. It's a comedy of manners, different social classes and clashing ""cultures"". Yes, the cultures are different between Asian American and Asians grow up in Asia. Rachel is a Chinese American raised by an immigrant single-mother. Nick's family is a traditional Chinese Singaporean family. The differences between the two form the main conflict in the film. The opulent setting, fabulous costumes, jewelry, cars...are pure eye candy. They serve to accentuate the differences between Rachel and the Youngs. I don't understand some people hold this against the film and rated this 1. Did you rate Great Gatsby 1 because of its excess? Or Downton Abbey? Wealthy people exist in the world. This is just a film portraying them. You're rating a film based on your socialist conviction??? Also, criticism about the film not representing all racial groups or ""Asians"" you know is also weird. The film makes it clear it's about the ""Crazy Rich"" Asians. In Singapore, those super-rich families tend to be ethnic Chinese and other ethnic groups are the working class. That's a fact. Is a film supposed to social-engineer the place it portrays? The acting is generally strong. The standouts are Constance Wu, Michelle Yeoh, Awqwafina. Constance's Rachel gives the film the heart. We experienced every emotions with her. (Yes, bring some tissues. You'll tear up.) Awqwafina was hilarious. Michelle Yeoh was imperious and fierce, the mother lioness who's ready to pounce on the poacher into her territory. But her back story did make us understand where she's coming from. I also like Henry Golding (his 1st film!) and Gemma Chan. They're so gorgeous and charismatic on screen that they reminded me old Hollywood stars. If they don't become superstars in Hollywood, Hollywood is really screwed up. The script has many conventional romcom plots, but the writers did make some twists to them. I like that the women were the ones who had the mic-drop lines in the dramatic scenes, e.g. Astrid's last words to her husband and Rachel's words at the mahjong table. The music was also excellent. It mixed some old Chinese pop song from the roaring 20s to modern American pop songs in Chinese cover. Gina Grannis's ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" will probably show up in many many weddings from now on. Katherine Ho's Yellow was perfect (despite some pronunciation issues) for the climatic scene toward the end. The bachelor/bachelorette party feel dragging. Otherwise, this is a solid 8.P. S. I don't understand those ratings of 1 and I find it interesting that all positive comments were down voted. It seems some people are determined to drag down the rating. I wonder why.",Crazy Rich Asians

The movie is literally showing how class differences, elitism, and extreme wealth break up marriages, families, and turn women against women. The woman who can buy 1.2 million dollar earrings with the snap of her fingers is the most unhappy woman in the entire movie. How is it a celebration of elitism and the rich? It is a hilarious social critical piece (very like Jane Austen) disguised as a romantic comedy (which is arguably more apparent in the book). And yes, I was unhappy that there wasn't anymore Asian representation, and that the malay were only shown as servants. But can we please focus on the fact that this is the first Hollywood movie that I have ever seen with all Asian protagonists, not some old caricatured man with a long beard and broken English? I'm not seeing any other Hollywood rom coms being slandered for not having a single non-white character (which is like all of them)? It even brings forth some of the most important ideas of loyalty to the family that are so ingrained in a lot of East Asian culture. Although, I do not agree with the villainization of the strict Asian mother, I can appreciate the fact that this movie is trying to represent part of my traditions.

She walked away so he would not lose his mother again...did you see the part where he said the Grandmother did not let his mother raise him.
She could not do that to him again she was not going to pull him away from his mother, his needs before her needs.So the point of the movie, what would you do for the person you claim to love?",Crazy Rich Asians

1026,tatum_rochin,What Family Doesn't Have a Little Crazy?,8,6 September 2018,"Ok...this family has a lot of crazy, but let me start off by saying I enjoyed this movie immensely and I consider myself a minimalist who lives well below my means. (I feel like I have to defend myself a little after reading some of these comments). This is a light-hearted, feel-good movie that has crazy rich characters. The story isn't about materialism and greed, it's about family values clashing and a woman who is trying to make a relationship work with her boyfriend's family. Aside from Nick and Rachel, the other characters also pulled me in. Eleanor's struggles with her own mother and Astrid's path to independence help bring the story full circle. (Remember the self-coronation earrings? Beautiful ending for her).The acting was great and the Singapore landscapes were a visual treat. Accompanied with the soundtrack, it was a very fun way to go through the story. As for some of my critiques,screwball comedy themes have never been my favorite so some of the laughs seemed a little forced, but overall I don't think it took away from the film too much. The ending, however, took away from Nick and Rachel's story because it put them right back in the thick of it with all the craziness, but I understand that it was a preppy and very ""Hollywood"" way to end the movie. If I had to chose I probably would have liked a more intimate ending. I am a little surprised by all the negative reviews out here comparing this movie to people only interested in materialism and watching the Kardashians. I felt a little guilty for liking this movie after reading some of the reviews but then I thought better of it. The crazy richness isn't the story. It's not a movie about fancy parties or cars or million-dollar dresses. It's about love and family and women standing up for themselves. It's about the clashing of generations and two people trying to find a middle ground to see if their love can last.",Crazy Rich Asians

Henry Golding definitely fit the role of Nick Young and it was entertaining from start till end. With all these negative comments about not being representative of the true Singaporean or Asian, or that this film does not portray the real wealth status of the people, or that there are only Chinese race portrayed and not the other races, bear in mind this movie was based on a book that was loosely based on the Chinese Singaporean author's upbringing. Just like how Modern Family doesnt portray every single household in America, don't expect this one film to fit into a biased understanding of the Asian society. For what's it worth, it does contain many applicable nuances that are very much still alive in the Asian culture :
having a matriarch of the household that everyone loves and respects and seems to pull the family together. having kids study abroad but longing for their return to run a family business and giving a deadline to their returnjudging anyone's new partner until the family is won over. passing down important jewellery as heirloom is still done this day over-protective moms who would do just about anything to make sure their offsprings are going to be married to the right onemaking it clear that Chinese American and Chinese Singaporean looks like the same race but are different in cultural upbringing.

1029,tobicollab69,A Beautifully Executed Rom-Com,10,19 August 2018,"100%, It was a well executed generic rom-com that was was comedic, dramatic, touching, and relatable-coming from an Asian American.This film was so ""cinderella-ey"" and a touch of ""The Great Gatsby-with a happy ending"" that it made you forget that you were watching an all Asian cast. The entire film is sort of a proof of concept for Asians to enter mainstream hollywood, and I think it accomplished that goal.The ""special"" aspect of this film was that it exposed Asian culture to the world in an entertaining way that is consumable by mainstream western audiences. This film was meant to be a big commercial mainstream rom-com, with Asians, and it worked very well in my opinion.

every asian thing is pretty accurate except the Mahjong scene.
Rachel won the majong game but she gave up, she let Eleanor win intetionally,

1049,booboo-kittiefukk,Absolutely sweet and romantic,9,31 August 2018,"I think that the people leaving such negative written reviews have missed the cultural nuances of the movie. Yes, it's about the Asian 1%. Specifically, Chinese because it focuses on one family and the people surrounding them. No one should be surprised at the level of ridiculous wealth and the stupid things done with that wealth by the young socialites in the movie. The title and trailer basically tell you that you'll see that so don't act offended about it.However, it does a damn good job illustrating the attitudes and expectations of some families. Not just Chinese, but definitely some East Asians. This movie could easily have been about a Japanese, Korean or Taiwanese family, where family and community take precedence over individual desires.I come from none of those nationalities I've mentioned, but like Rachel, I take my mum shopping for important occasions, not friends. I was raised to always respect the advice from and decisions of my elders, and family was very central to my life growing up. I understand Rachel's desire to gain the approval of her boyfriend's family, and the formal way that she speaks to the elder women and matriarch.This was the first film to make me cry in at least 20 years. My male, straight, Anglo best friend ended up seeing it while accompanying his wife and kids to Mums and Bubs, and he absolutely loved the movie too. We're going to watch it again together in the next few weeks.

1052,tine-maria,Disappointed,4,13 May 2020,"Aften reading the book i was so excited to watch the movie. The book wasn't the greatest, but it was decent. The movie however made me really frustrated. Everything in the movie was so half assed and never really dug into any if the characters and it only touched very lightly (and VERY quickly) on the different events, making it feel rushed and not emotional or making anyone understand the struggles the characters go through. I really didn't care for any of them at all and a LOT of the plot was missing and/or changed (some of which that was pretty unnecessary to change). Especially the things they left out made me genuinely confused and I should know what the plot is since I read the book. I understand that it is a lot to fit into 1 movie, but i just don't understand why they decided to make it so rushed, focusing on the big events, rather than the characters, who seem to change their minds and make decisions, without any explanation. They also made it really comedy-like, which I don't exactly hate, but it was definitely way too much, making the characters seem very caricatured. I understand that the characters should come across as shallow, but great filmmakers can create shallow characters without making them seem dumb or obnoxious. I would personally not have starred Awkwafina in the role of Peik Lin. Not that she did a bad job, but I personally did not really get the same vibe from the character described in the book.",Crazy Rich Asians
1053,andidzulrahmat,The movie is good but it is typical of a very Asian movie,8,13 September 2018,"The movie focuses on Rachel's story where she is invited to singapore by her lover Nick, without realizing it turns out Nick is a super rich person. Problems began when she entered Nick's family, the storyline was actually easy to guess.I think this movie is good but it is typical of a very Asian movie because it always uses the family theme. For me the interesting character of attention is the character of Peik Lin and Oliver, I like the bromance of Nick and Colin, they are handsome. For Constance Wu, she was very elegant and attractive, I heard that she would be Mulan. Whereas other characters in my opinion are right, no one has less acting in my opinion.The thing I want is that the story is more explored, I hope the film is more sassy and full of drama or dramatic.

1059,fortunecookie-80969,Finally - an Asian movie with actual Asians behind and in front of the camera!,9,29 August 2018,"First of all, I don't understand some of the criticism on here, and even though I NEVER leave reviews, I felt the need to defend this movie. Let me also preface this review by saying I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies, but a group of my friends convinced me to watch it. To my surprise, I actually loved it! I laughed; I cried, and everything on repeat!First of all, you claim the movie is ""predictable"". Yes, most romantic comedies ARE predictable, but the difference in this case is ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was reimagined through the Asian perspective. For once, the entire cast was Asian, not some racially ambiguous caucasian actors that Hollywood tries to pass off as Asian. That's very rare! I've had some experience in the acting industry, and trust me when I say roles for minorities are still rather limited. This was refreshing!Secondly, I found the story very relatable and authentic! Underneath all of the glitz and glam, there was a real storyline. My single-mother and I were immigrants from Vietnam, and in Asian cultures, it is very hard for a previously married woman or a woman with a child born out of wedlock to make it in society. So the fact that Rachel's mom hid that from her made a ton of sense, and her story of being an immigrant and making it in America should be relatable to other immigrants, regardless of ethnicity!
Furthermore, I hate to admit this, but when Eleanor said Rachel an ""immigrant"" because she was American and would always want to pursue her ""passion"" rather than value family and tradition, it was a pretty accurate depiction of how many Asians view Asian-Americans. I was born in Vietnam, and I still speak Vietnamese... but I'll never be viewed as a ""true"" Vietnamese anymore. Therefore, regardless of how successful or rich Rachel's character was, she would have never been good enough to marry Nick because Asian mothers are highly critical of who their sons marry. 
It's really a cultural thing - Asians judge other Asians. On a side note, I'd like to correct one reviewer who claimed the director, Jon Chu, is wanted in Singapore for dodging the draft. THAT IS TOTALLY INACCURATE. Chu was born in Palto Alto, California. The book's author, Kevin Kwan, is the person who is wanted for allegedly dodging the draft even though he immigrated to the States when he was 11 years old. 
Get you facts straight. Plus, what does that even have to do with criticism of this movie? Wouldn't that be more of a moral or ethical problem with a person rather than a basis for a bad movie review???All in all, I encourage people to watch this movie and make up their own minds. Sure, the storyline has been done several times before, but then again, with a few exceptions, aren't most movies like that? 
Just give the movie a chance. If you don't want to waste money, watch it on the discount night at your theater. Focus less on flash and fanfare, and try to look at the thoughtful storytelling and colorful characters because if you pay attention, there is a wonderful message for the audience; don't be afraid to break from tradition and give people a chance because sometimes they will surprise you!

The acting was just next level and the locations of the filming completely blew me away.

I'll just want to comment on the wealth displayed; things that punched a whole in the crazy richness: I know cars, and every single car displayed - be it a Rolls Royce or a supercar - was outdated. Old models, the whole bunch of them. I know, this is a pointless thing to comment, but it made it seem like they shot the movie on a budget, when I expected them to blow the budget on next level extravaganza because let's face it they were marketing it as a view in to the life of the super rich not secondhand shoppers.

1087,Samsmoaks,It was bad,3,27 September 2018,"Crazy Rich Asians was really gross and unspecial. The entire movie was just this really long trailer on what it's like to be rich. There was nothing really interesting about any of the characters in this movie, they had the same amount of depth as a paper-cut. The movie didn't even really spend enough time for the audience to understand these characters, it sped through ever scene while the characters just spat horrible dialogue. And that's my biggest problem with this movie: The Writing. 90% of the dialogue consist of the characters talking about how rich they are and the other 10% was either filled with these borderline racist jokes, or this unnecessary melodramatic story line between these two characters which has NOTHING to do with the actual plot. Not to mention that this is a very gross representation of Asian people. The film makes Asian people look like stuck up bitches who only care about themselves and their money, I don't why or how people think this is a good representation when there are better asian romance movies out there (In The Mood for Love is one example). The only good thing about the movie was it's cinematography. For the most part the cinematography was decent, nothing that was exceptional but there were some really cool shots in the movie that I actually liked. And thats about it for this movie. Honestly if you enjoy romance movies then you'll most likely enjoy this one, but other then that I suggest you should skip out on this one.",Crazy Rich Asians

I am not rich so it may come across as sour grapes, but I find display of wealth, driving flashy cars and showing off expensive clothes is embarrassing. It shows our society and laws have failed when some people have too much and others have too little. Watching the film it worried me that it is promoting gold digging and back stabbing. Of course, many say that the film was mocking gold diggers, but if so it was very implicit and many viewers may have missed it. Regardless, they say any publicity is good publicity so either way young (and old) women may watch this and think marrying rich, tall and handsome is more important than marrying a good man.

There is a saying I'm sure most people heard of which is, ""It's not about the destination, it's about the journey"". The journey from point A to B was smart and brought great context to society today that all walks of life could relate to. Yes, it surrounds an extremely rich family, but tradition and dogma surrounding the family is something that people can relate to.

Everyone of course was attractive and thin except the stereo typical gay person and a few others who were in the movie for comic relief.

If the movie was called Crazy Rich Westerners would we expect to see American, British, Austrian, and Australian representatives?

1109,kwatches,"If the book didn't do it for you, this will definitely will!",10,16 August 2018,"Ok. So where do I even begin?? When I read the book and heard that it was going to be a movie, I was a bit on the fence. The book had way gives out way too much information, there's way too many characters that a 120 minute movie will not be able to cover, and along with the characters they also had their own battles. I just didn't now how they were going to do it. Jon Chu and the writes did such an amazing job at picking the things that actually matter and gave the story more depth. Although it fell short in really showing the materialistic side of Asia's richest and just how rich they exactly are, it didn't really matter. In a way, we can all draw up our own conclusion in what the rich lifestyle would be like. What he focused on instead is the story of the characters and what gives those characters value: family and love. It captured everything the book was trying to convey without the unnecessary information. Even when they added certain scenes or skipped on others, every move they made just made sense. The actors that played each character played it with so much passion that you can feel every emotion they are feeling through the screen. I'm glad how they wrapped up the Rachel and Nick's love story in the end -- completely unexpected but welcomed. Peik Lin's character was completely ignored in the book, the movie showed she has so much potential and gave me the comedic relief I never knew I needed. So glad they made her appear a lot more frequently in the movie. And I adored the change in Astrid's story, the power she exuded as she took matters to her own hands made me excited for her own love story to develop in the next one. And I really do hope that there will be a sequel.",Crazy Rich Asians
1110,jansutton-23877,True Love & Comedy & Family Ties,10,9 September 2018,"The movie made me cry. Perhaps I was in a mood that day 'cause I reacted very emotionally to a warm, loving look at the conflict between cultures, between generations, and between individuals. I had read the books, the whole trilogy, so I went in knowing what to expect. The director made strong changes to the plot that rendered the story a terrific film. Movies & novels are different mediums and deserve to be respected as such. The characters are brought to life by well chosen actors: Henry Goldilng is charismatic, Constance Wu is warm and open as an American, Michelle Yeoh stood out in a difficult role as the mother bound by traditions. Ken Jeong goes hilariously overboard and his movie daughter, Awkwfina, is totally embarrassed by him, while being just as outrageous herself. A fun film. Do not pay attention to the negative reviewers here. Several criticisms are dead wrong. It was the author of the novels who refused to do military service in Singapore; his reasons make perfect sense. It is well known that the Chinese have dispersed throughout southeast Asia over the centuries. Over 70% of the population of Singapore is of Chinese descent. If you think seeing vulgur displays of wealth would offend you, don't go to a film titled ""Crazy Rich Asians."" If you feel that using the word Asians requires being inclusive of all possible Asians, including Mideastern ones (?), you are simply whining.",Crazy Rich Asians
1111,joweenee,First the basics,7,3 September 2018,"There are three complaints:1. Celebrates perversity - romance and materialism are too intimately tied together (i.e. gold-digging) that both end up being expounded in their superficiality and unreality2. Limited representation - only ""Chinese"" Asians and only extremely wealthy individuals are portrayed, undermining the efficacy and diversity of true ""asianhood""3. Shallow plot and characters - overused story-line about romance and familial tensions, a pure imitation of Western desires with a lack of oriental authenticity, leading to a paper-thin plot protracted by stereotypesThree responses:1. If you actually consider how the movie plays out, the elements that supposedly celebrate exuberance and materialistic romance are either dismissed in their possible retention of worth or confined to brief stylistic moments which throw the more intractable experience of love without materialism into stark relief. There is so much evidence of this throughout the film - every point of excess ingrains in us, as an audience, a sense of disgust or doubt - is that not then the point? Plus the title literally spells the theme out for you ""Crazy Rich"", so yeah. What did you expect?2. Now the second part of the title""Asians"". I agree, the film does not cover every individual that would be qualified under the term in an ethnic or otherwise geographic sense. But why did it have to? It is not a documentary. It does not aim for absolute objective authority, it tells a story with insight into a limited persona with limited struggles and limited breadth. The assertion that the movie is inaccurate or ""bad"" because it does not show us every type of Asian is extremely unfair - at least they showed us some (where most do not show any) and they did it in a way where the central aspects of being Asian are still on display (e.g. filial guilt, patriarchy).3. This then leads me to my next point. What is the big picture? Sure we could convert this movie to have an all white cast and the general story-line and characters would not have to be completely revised, I concede that. But, to me the appearance of an all Asian cast in big budget Hollywood - twenty-five years after ""The Joy Luck Club"" - means a lot. I think even if you take the plot at its worst - dreary, old garbage - and the inclusion of Asians as mere tokenistic market-pandering, I still stand by this film. Because to me this film is a gateway to all the things that people have been so frustrated and disappointed about, it is a film that in its very existence can forge the path for much broader and deeper representation or discussion. You will not be able to overturn all Asian stereotypes or perfectly represent all Asians overnight, it is an ongoing process that begins by giving the ""asian-face"" more airtime. Plus I thought the way females were portrayed in this film has been misconstrued and under-evaluated. Just saying.Watch the film and see what you think.",Crazy Rich Asians

The movie is tittled ""Crazy Rich Asians"" did you really not expect to see rich asian people? And no, it does not suggest that all the singaporeans are rich and materialistic; it's just that the story is about those who are. And mind you, while a good part of Nick's relatives is materialistic, the main idea of the plot is that his wealth really means nothing to Rachel. Those who still call Rachel a ""gold-digger"" completely missed the point. The movie made it CLEAR that she only found out about his wealth after starting a relationship and falling in love with Nick. RACIST: literally, how? People can't stand movies that aren't about white people anymore? Nobody was trying to put western people down in this movie. Literally the whole cast is asian people. Nothing to add, people who make such accusations are either lowkey racist themselves or SJW teenagers.Now let's move on: so is this movie good? 
A nice, light comedy; but wouldn't rewatch it. It's rather cliche, and neither the plot nor the characters are too complex. Does it bring anything new to the industry? Plotwise, not much. Had a few laughs and d'awws, and mostly the storyline was predictable. What sets it apart from the other movies is the setting - I found myself mesmerized by the Singaporean sceneries and luxorious parties. Like I said it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't watch it more than once and it is definetely not the brightest or the most innovative movie; however, it does not deserve to be called ""racist"" or ""materialistic"". *I firmly believe that it should not matter, but also am sure people would start questioning MY race: truth is, I am asian, chinese korean to be exact.",Crazy Rich Asians

Some of it is predictable. But most Rom Coms are. There has been small backlash with some of the characters not being authentic enough, with Chinese actors playing roles of Singapore people. With that I am reminded of Australian actor Hugh Jackman. He mainly plays Americans and no one makes a stink over that. I didn't like some of the crude sexual humor and some of the characters like Eddie were too obnoxious. More time should have been spent telling the stories of Astrid or Araminta.

Story: 5.5/10 
(Please keep in mind that I have not yet to read the book and I'm only analyzing it based on my thoughts of this movie!!))
Personally, I found this movie to be very well done in casting the characters for the movie. I loved the presentation, clothing, and the places they used to shoot this movie. It was very well done!However, there were some story and character flaws I would like to point out. Nick Young's mother, Eleanor wasn't as scary as she seemed in the trailer. I found this to be a flaw because she did seem a bit too soft in the film, especially being easily convinced in the end by Rachel Chu in the end. Since Eleanor wasn't the grandmother's first choice for her husband, there should've been a connection she made with Rachel instead of straight up telling Rachel she wasn't good enough for her son... ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE WENT THROUGH THE SAME EXACT THING. Realistically, wouldn't you want your child's marriage to be smoother than yours if they are truly in love? The introduction of Nick's cousins in different parts of Asia was really a waste of time for the film because they barely had those particular characters have screentime. It should've definitely be omitted. I would've personally really liked it if they focused on the plot more rather than the entertainment aspect of a ""crazy rich"" person's life. There must've been a reason why they are rich, doesn't that require hard work? Yes they used the dumpling scene to portray the essence of hardwork, however, it was glossed over very quickly. They also didn't really introduce the characters very well so throughout the movie I sort of got lost with who was who. The scene where Rachel was on the island for the party and where Nick was on the boat was really just a filler. I didn't like the scene because the prank that the women played on Rachel was very childish and pretty outrageous. Women are more cunning, who would put a dead fish on someone's bed??? The detail they didn't make very clear was about Rachel's family. The scene where Rachel's mother suddenly appeared and the whole tragic backstory seemed very misplaced. The affair that happened Astrid's husband was also very glossed over. If they wanted to add that into the movie, I'd like them to add more details about this ""affair"", one text message on the phone doesn't mean anything. The proposal was rushed, the ending was rushed. It just didn't seem to add up.",Crazy Rich Asians
1139,lanha-36647,"FUNNY, EMOTIONAL, and LIVELY ALL AT ONCE!",10,16 August 2018,There are so many comedians in this movie. I loved every minute of it! Great story line..,Crazy Rich Asians
1140,mariboots-63328,Best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time.,10,17 August 2018,"This movie had the perfect combination of romance and comedy. The underlying theme is what any and every person can relate to. There were moments of laughter, tears, and empathy. The all-Asian cast was wonderful and have changed this Hollywood forever. I recommend going to see this movie and going to see it again.",Crazy Rich Asians

The story, the gorgeous scenery, the humor was so entertaining. There definitely was a lot of love and effort put in to this colorful and beautiful film!!",Crazy Rich Asians
1148,ethanhummel,A movie definitely not worth your money,1,19 August 2018,"Although a noble feat to be the first movie with an all Asian cast in 25 years, this film lacks substance to be considered anything remotely great. This movie is the basic cookie-cutter type film, with nothing exceptional but an all Asian cast. The film lacks character development that makes the audience not relate to any of them, with it containing the stereotypical archetypes that would be found in any other non-exceptional ""Cinderella Story"". This movie is definitely not worth watching for the dreadful two hours that it is, especially there being no scene that even feels like the climax.",Crazy Rich Asians
1149,rxlbas,One of a kind!,10,19 August 2018,"OMG you guys should go see it! This is just too awesome! I have never thought I can one day see a movie with full Asian cast!! And it was one of the first times a movie really focus on discussing the importance of Asian family value, it really speaks to me since I come from a family just like that.
Everyone in the movie was charming in a different way! I love that this is not just a cheesy love fairytale, but it is about being considerate, being brave and learning to let go...this is the kind of love story I like to see!
Totally want to go back to watch one more time! I know this movie is not perfect but I am giving it extra two stars just because they are brave enough to have full Asian cast.",Crazy Rich Asians
1150,lorellesun,"Beautifully expresses the multi-demensional, deep culture of Asian people",10,19 August 2018,"This movie proves that Asians CAN act. Watching this movie has made so proud to be an Asian American with immigrant parents. This movie really resonated with me, and I related to every single character. I could not help, but cry by the end. Highly recommend everyone to watch this movie.",Crazy Rich Asians
1151,peppernimitz,Shallow Movie (Really Wanted to Like the Film but Can't..),5,19 August 2018,"This movie played out like one big party. While that may sound fun, it's a party where almost everyone is shallow/annoying and you leave feeling like there was no one there with any substance.Immediately, I was taken aback with the opening scene - Napoleon quote on China: 'China is a sleeping giant. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will shake the world.' It has no relevance to the story, which takes place in Singapore (strong alliance with the U.S.) and focuses on a Singaporean family (the family immigrated to Singapore and built up Singapore - like how immigrants to America build up America). What does that have to do with China?Then, there's the hotel scene where Eleanor was discriminated against for being Asian (in London, in 1995) so she had to hastily buy up the hotel the same night. Does that sound remotely realistic? On to Singapore itself. The city-state is rich in diversity and that was appallingly absent in the film. The audience only catches a glimpses of Singapore without seeing much more like the historical areas, hilltop streets, or the main thoroughfare itself: Orchard Road. Instead, it kept circling back to the same spots or same scenic shots again.Nick Young gives his girlfriend Rachel an introduction to his family (odd that it hasn't happened already in their relationship) and doesn't bother to mention his father and the movie never showed his dad. Rachel seems okay with it and doesn't ask questions. Maybe that's why it took her awhile to realizes that he's ""crazy rich"". For an economics professor at NYU, Rachel is left clueless or gets surprised a lot and must the only professor that get paid minimum wage in how many times the film mentions that she is poor. In fact, she even shows up for a lavish bachelorette party dressed up in Gap shorts and a t-shirt and her friend, Peik Lin spends most the movie lending her clothes. Again, this is a NYU economics professor. The script plays out to rom-com cliches. Couple is in love. Couple faces an obstacle and gets into a fight. Couple is sad that they broke up - there is no suspense on if they will get back together b/c it's so predictable already given the cookie cutter format. Film ends with Nick taking Rachel out for a night in Singapore, on top of the Marina Bay Sands where a super lavish party with a big guest list was put together in mere minutes from when he proposed to her on the plane (in the Economy section). special mention: Gemma Chan, who plays Nick's cousin Astrid, had too much screen time. Every time she came on screen, I moaned a bit b/c her acting was so robotic and her scenes were so boring that I just wanted to get through them fast so I won't fall asleep with her acting.The movie wasn't realistic in any sort of way. It felt cliche and stereotypical for the most part, which is ironic given how it's suppose to break those barriers for the Asian American community.",Crazy Rich Asians
1152,montrellscaife,Very well done,10,19 August 2018,I'm generally not a rom-com fan and I never write movie reviews so I obviously loved this movie. The cast was great and the leading characters gave you a lot to cheer for. I laughed and cried throughout the movie and found myself dancing to the music (some of which I downloaded the I got home). I really enjoyed how they used music authentic to the culture and some of the lines were to die for. It was very well written and very well executed. I would pay to go see it again and that's saying a lot.,Crazy Rich Asians
1153,jadeg-01533,Great movie to watch,9,19 August 2018,It is amazing movie. It is the movie of the year. I could not stop laughing. If you love romance this is the movie you need to watch. This movie will bring laugh and cry. Perfect movie for family get together,Crazy Rich Asians
1154,tinthanhvuong,Love it!,10,20 August 2018,It's so emotional yet comical. It's so powerful too! One of my favorite scenes were the wedding when Rachel looks at Nick and the Mahjong scene! Love this movie,Crazy Rich Asians
1155,reignsprotege,Loved this movie!!,10,20 August 2018,Just saw this with a friend and I am so happy with what this movie has done :). Didn't even realize it was almost a 2 hour movie when I walked out. Definitely would recommend!!! #Representation,Crazy Rich Asians
1156,prespabitola,GARBAGE MOVIE,1,21 August 2018,"A cringy bland twist of a Cinderela and 50 shades of grey movie for Asians. The First 5 minutes of the movie putting white people as racist villians. Typical liberal brainwashing agenda. Plus bashing America and American values throughout the film. The comedy is dry as is the caracters personalitys. There is no punchlines or sarcasim, there just acting like bunch of 5 year olds. This film also promotes single parent upbringing. no sight of the gyys father. they showing he is too busy to even see his son. plus the story of the girl is total bs. dont what to spoil too much.",Crazy Rich Asians

I recommend anyone to go watch this movie you'll enjoy it and you'll get some laugh a true Romantic and comedy movie I also think the main actress she might get an academy nomination,Crazy Rich Asians
1159,nairsrija,Boring boring boring,1,22 August 2018,Poor acting poor script and poor plot. Scenes barely made me laugh. I wanted to leave the theatre at many occasions and found my self yawning at many other moments too. So much hype for a pretty bad movie. And I must say it's an extremely inaccurate representation of Singapore/Singaporeans,Crazy Rich Asians
1160,miluskamartier,It's just a cookie cutter romcom with an all asian cast.,6,22 August 2018,"I loved the cinematography, but that's about it! This movie is so overhyped.
Many reviews said: this not your standard romantic comedy. But it totally is!
Sorry to spoil it for you. You will see the ending coming from a mille away. 
Also the pacing is off, parts just drag on. Specially after she meets the in-laws. To me the quirky asian family was just way to try hard and not funny at all. The family of the male lead is just basic. Just some rich jerks, that think the girls he's dating, is not good enough. I like romcoms, but I don't waste my money seeing them in theatre, because they're pretty much all the same and Crazy Rich Asians is no exception.",Crazy Rich Asians
1161,scottyduong,Not Just an Extravagant Movie. It's a Movement.,9,23 August 2018,"I'll be frank - I'm not into romantic comedies. 9.5 times out of 10 - if I have the option to watch something else, I will. Not to say I'm against them, there are a few that I love - Notebook, Walk to Remember, etc. ""Crazy Rich Asians' joins that pantheon. It's very fun, it's charming, indulgent, the cast is amazing and the humor is cheeky and warm. It does follow typical rom-com tropes, however.Beyond being just a movie - I need to say this. Like 'Black Panther' - this movie is so so so so important. I am and identify as Asian (Chinese Canadian). Growing up, I have never seen an Asian lead in a Hollywood movie that doesn't center on something stereotypical around my culture (*cough* Jackie Chain *cough* kung fu *cough cough*). Also, I learned that in the early talks of this movie - early developers would make the movie CONTINGENT on casting a white female lead- as if an all Asian lead is invalid. The last movie with an Asian cast was made in 1993 (almost a quarter century ago). Appalling, isn't it? The lack of representation may not seem like a big deal - but it truly is. Growing up, I would see a movie or a show and the protagonist would always be Caucasian/someone who does not look like me (this applies to other misrepresented/underrepresented ethnic groups as well). Instead, Asians would be cast as something minor or stereotypical. Villain? Yep. Martial artist? Yep. Eccentric weirdo? Yep. Asexual/ non-masculine? Yep. Nerd? Yep. Sidekick? Yep. Fetish? Yep. Believe it or not, these expectations have bled into the minutiae and interactions of my own life. I felt like popular media instilled a narrow belief in me (and probably millions of others) that I was only allowed to be a certain way, and any deviation would be weird because I'm ""Asian."" It's truly exhausting and totally unfair.This movie is important because it shatters stereotypes, with no trace of martial arts or ""Kung Pao chicken"" humor. It was contemporary, relevant and most of all - just a rom com. Not a movie catered JUST to Asians - but to everyone. Stepping into a full theater with a mixed crowd of people of all backgrounds, everyone laughing in unison; honestly it was a proud and happy moment for me. In conclusion, I'm happy that Hollywood is diversifying and moving in the right direction. I'm hoping to see more movies with better representation of ALL Groups (Hispanic, South Asian, Indigenous, etc). Truly a must watch!!",Crazy Rich Asians

1164,sodeh-68888,Predictable but awesome,10,25 August 2018,"Yes, this movie did get predictable at times, but come on, its a romantic comedy. We all know how those end.

1166,aniketsule,Cute and charming !,9,26 August 2018,"Superb movies and great acting by the entire cast. Specially Constance, Awkafina and Dr Ken ! Henry was in the movie in a pivotal role but didn't have much to do other than look good and stand in the frame ! Michelle could have been used in a better way, she is such an amazingly talented actor. Who has been totally wasted in such a small role. Over all a happy movie. Which leaves you with a smile towards the end. Had I gotten more of Michelle I would have rated it 10/10.",Crazy Rich Asians
1167,xxsuki_stubbsxx,Absolutely stunning,10,27 August 2018,This film was so absolutely stunning. The scenery and the intricate shots of the cuisine are all just so beautiful. It's really a great look into Chinese culture and life in Singapore. Not only that but it's an absolutely adorable love story. It has everything you could ever want in a romance movie and I 100% will go see it again,Crazy Rich Asians

1170,mokladek-01186,Conspicuous consumption on steroids,3,27 August 2018,"First the positive: Earnest acting by pretty much everybody concerned. That actually is high praise considering that the material they were given to work with was shallow and cliched. They all fit their characterization; pretty and nice, pretty and mean, pretty and shallow, gay (and I mean, really, truly, obviously gay) and the clueless. And all of them have nothing better to do than figure out more expensive ways to consume money that they clearly didn't either earn or deserve. The first two minutes telegraphs the rest of the story like a Disney cartoon for eight year olds. Alot of money spent on sugary cereal with nothing remotely nutritious.",Crazy Rich Asians
1171,nitsuj-05685,inconsistent asian film,2,27 August 2018,"The actors look very different from one another, some have a ""european accent"" while others dont.........it lacks consistent physical appearance among the asian group.....centers around a rich ""chinese"" family.....yet the lead male actor is malaysian/white..........that has a european accent.So its hard to grasp a sense of believably of common relatives among them..........they need to hire consistent asian actors across the board that make it believable throughout the film.....",Crazy Rich Asians
1172,natcampos-16914,Clever and funny!!,7,29 August 2018,Interesting and kept my attention throughout. Also I understood Hokkien so it was great and also for my Mom. Went to Union Sq and worth watching. Culturally meaningful.,Crazy Rich Asians
1173,felixhuynh,Another typicall WHITE favored hollywood ASIAN movie,1,29 August 2018,"As a real asian chinese it didn't give the feeling of an authentic chinese traditional romance.The head character Henry golding which is half white, you can see that he does not understand chinese, just smiling and nodding when other characters speaks chinese. And he only speaks chinese 1% of the whole movie, and when he speaks you can here that he have practiced and that he still has a foreign ACCENT. Does not even fit the role that is 100% chinese character.Henry Golding is half white half malay, does not even look chinese, it felt more like looking at an MIDDLE EAST character.
Cant HOLLYWOOD make it right for just once??Everyone favored Godfrey Gao to be head character, but he is probably to asian for hollywood, and hollywood does not want to lose ""FACE"" to the eastern countries, therefore has to have a head character that at least have some % WHITE in their blood and appearance.To bad, would be a great movie if not. But it just DIDNT GIVE THE REAL FEELING of asian culture.... Character MISS MATCH.....",Crazy Rich Asians

1175,jhammer-31221,The haters are clueless,10,31 August 2018,"A great movie, period. This will still be a great movie with an all black cast, all Indian cast, all white cast, it DOES NOT MATTER. It's simply an awesome love story with great acting that connects with the audience on the emotional level. It's a celebration of love, family, aspiration and perseverance. Sure, it depicts materialism, consumption yada yada, but this is what the backdrop and setup of the story is, and what's needed to deliver its powerful message - true love has nothing to do with how rich you are. So all the haters are missing the point. BTW, the cast came from a diverse ethnic background from Asia - Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan to name a few, if you think it did not represent you, that's too bad, deal with it, this isn't a movie about anthropology.",Crazy Rich Asians

Despite having the awesome Awkwafina on board as catastrophe insurance, she can't rescue this anymore than she could Oceans 8. One of the biggest problems is the romantic male lead, Nick, who is so Mary Sue-ish it's torture. Maybe it's the dialog he's been given. ""I love who I become when I'm around you."" What?!Some of the scenes of opulence are up to par, but others are underwhelming. 
Bachelor party on a container ship? - a nice Brutalist touch but it's hard to make that look appealing and they certainly didn't pull it off. Same with the bachelorette party on a pristine beach. You're supposed to believe that yanking batik dresses off clothes racks that are yards from the water is as good as being let loose in a high-end mall in Singapore itself.

A typical Cinderella story wrapped in Asian theme - by Hollywood (western) standard. The only character that really looks classic and belongs to that class is Nick's mother. I took my 70 years old mom to see it, she thought the portray of Asian is still exaggerated and biased. My friends told me the entire movie is retro style, I cannot agree more, it looks like an old movie. The outfit of the bride of ""century of the wedding"" reminds me of Thai traditional dancer.

It was much, much worse! Shallow, superficial, snobby, and lame! This movie, the romance was horrible, it was not very funny *at all*!! And what I cannot seem to understand is the amount of high reviews this film got!! It's great that most of the cast was Asian, truly! And refreshing that they're not the typical Asian stereotypes you see in most movies, but I don't think they did a good job as making them com across as respectable. Just really, really did not enjoy this movie and will never watch again and most certainly will not recommend to ANYONE!!!!!",Crazy Rich Asians
1193,peppathepig,Crazy for Crazy Rich Asians,10,13 October 2018,"Movies serve not only for entertainment purposes, but also to create thousands of jobs. However, racism plays a clear and obvious role in the industry. Regardless of the genre, white actors and actresses obtain about 80% of the leads in various films. On the contrary, Crazy Rich Asians features an Asian lead along with an all-Asian cast. In the movie, Rachel Chu, the main character, is invited by her boyfriend, Nick Young to attend his friend's wedding in Singapore. When she arrives, Rachel is shocked to discover that Nick and his family are very wealthy. Actually, ""very wealthy"" is an understatement. The Young family is one of the wealthiest families in Singapore. Their relationship must withstand jealous girls, various social expectations, and a disapproving mother. Released recently on August 15, the movie has already made over $165 million, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy this past decade. As opposed to a popular Hollywood opinion that a movie without a white lead will make less money, Crazy Rich Asians not only effectively combines humor and romance, but also serves as a powerful and inspiring statement to the movie industry with its success as an all-Asian cast.
 Contrary to expectations, Crazy Rich Asians has proved successful in both making money and shattering racial myths. The movie is based off the novel, Crazy Rich Asians, by Kevin Kwan. Kwan was approached by a producer who was interested, but the producer suggested to cast a white actress for Rachel and Kwan refused. Jon Chu, the director of Crazy Rich Asians, decided to act against the status quo and set an open casting call for Asian actors and actresses across five continents. The director worked together with the author to successfully make the movie from the book by considering and including the author's wishes. Prior to Crazy Rich Asians, the last major movie featuring an all-Asian cast was The Joy Luck Club in 1993; it is truly a rare occasion when a movie is shot with a full Asian cast. Whitewashing, which is the overwhelming use of white actors and actresses, is an obvious and ongoing problem occurring in the movie industry, but Crazy Rich Asians did not contribute to the ongoing racism. Instead, the movie proved many critics wrong with its stupendous success.
 The storyline is well thought out and well written. Goh Peik Lin, Rachel's friend, contributes to the humor of the movie. Awkwafina, the actress, plays the character very well; her outgoing attitude and hilarious comments will make you laugh out loud. For example, Goh Peik Lin drops off Rachel at Nick's family's house for a party. When Nick invites her last minute, she opens her trunk and pulls out different outfits labeled for various occasions. One is labeled ""walk of shame."" When telling advice to Rachel, Goh Peik Lin offers clever, funny comments. Her character throughout the movie caused the audience to laugh. Crazy Rich Asians is a well made movie that successfully accomplishes the combination of romance and comedy; the movie is very entertaining. 
 Through it's impeccable camera work, choice of setting, and props, Crazy Rich Asians allows the audience to see what the life of the elite in Singapore is like. It is such a foreign concept that is successful in capturing the interest of viewers. The movie also introduces traditions and culture that many may not know about. Every choice of setting effectively portrayed the life that the elite might have in Singapore. The place where Nick's friend's wedding took place was absolutely gorgeous. Also, Nick's family's house definitely reflected the great wealth the family has. The beautiful night-blooming flower at the family's house also contributed to the aesthetic. 
 Crazy Rich Asians is a movie everyone needs to see. It is one of the highest-grossing romantic comedies. The movie combines comedy and romance, and the director casted amazing Asian actors and actresses. This is a movie that cannot be missed. Its success proves for itself that Crazy Rich Asians is definitely a movie worth watching.",Crazy Rich Asians
1194,victorfalkon,Not great but a feel-good/decent film,7,2 October 2018,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews here. If people watch the film and all they could think of is complaining about the materialistic showcase of the riches then they're probably as shallow as their reviews, missing the entire point of the film. 
It's like judging the movie about slaves is bad because of the nature of slavery. 
Every story has a background setup and this FICTIONAL one just happens to take place at one of the wealthiest families in Asia.
For that reason, (apparently) it's not gonna represent every single Asian and their background so you can't be mad if you don't see yourself in the characters.As for the movie, even though the plot is predictable, I still think it does well in addressing some of the old/traditional values in Asian family and how they play out when challenged by those from Western countries. The way it was done might be a lil bit over the top but I understand this is a movie so I wasn't bothered too much by it.
Some of the scenes are quite emotional and I enjoy the last one the most where Rachel sacrifices her own happiness for Nick and his family, just like his mom would have done for her husband. Somehow, this earned her what she was willing to give away as Nick's mom eventually approved her via this act. A lil cliche, but beautiful to witness.",Crazy Rich Asians
1195,kld-40859,There is no fun,2,5 October 2018,One Japanese actress cannot save this film. I promise it's boring. Why just have a story in Asia if the story is the same as story in America?,Crazy Rich Asians
1196,holmesb-95132,Perfect for the Insta-gen,2,7 October 2018,"What do you get when Hollywood tries to make a British rom-com with Chinese money? If you answered ""A Cliche'd Yawn"", you have answered correctly.This is the perfect movie for a self-obsessed, Kardashian impressed, Insta-Twit generation. The pointless and unrelated opening scene, purely inserted to generate 'western' racial guilt pales in comparison of the overall message that extreme excess is not only acceptable but aspirational. ""Greed is Good"" summed up the excess of the '80's but at least the moral of Wall Street was 'don't believe it'. CRA's delivers a message that it's fine to live like a self-indulgent narcissist as long as you grudgingly accept someone from a lower socioeconomic class but as long as they are the same ethnicity.",Crazy Rich Asians
1197,keikeic,Can't believe the bad reviews,10,6 December 2020,"Why so bad reviews?! Come on, I think this movie gives me joy and i like the clothes on Astrid, and what a powerwoman, her husband is cheating on her and she is just handle it in a good way and the main character Rachel is a very smart and beautiful girl. I really like Nick as well and he is not superficial and shallow. To be honest, I think it's a feel good movie and don't deserves the bad reviews but maybe because I'm an Asian woman who like classy fashion (Astrid's style) and work hard to buy my own Chanel's and building my own empire haha.",Crazy Rich Asians

1207,tiffanysakuradye,Crazy Rich Asians,10,5 June 2021,I love Crazy Rich Asians because it's a love story between Rachel Chu and Nick Young about how Nick didn't tell Rachel that his family is rich only because he wants Rachel to know as him and not for his money and he said that the money he gets is from his family because they paid for the plane ticket and the hotel because they own it from long time ago!,Crazy Rich Asians
1208,amandavkim,Liked it more than initially thought,8,16 December 2018,"Predictable? Yes. But sometimes you just need a cliché rom-com. Constance Wu's performance is powerful and relatable. Lots of crazy spending, but what can you expect from a movie called ""Crazy Rich Asians""?! The scenes of Singapore are beautiful and rich. The cinematography itself is gorgeous and well done! Loved this movie and everything about it.",Crazy Rich Asians
1209,naomidigavriel,Fabulously HYSTERICALLY FUNNY Fantasy!,10,3 January 2019,"Fabulously HYSTERICALLY FUNNY Fantasy! .....and about true love and real family obligations. Of course, all wrapped in the outlandish-over-exaggerated world of rich people. Rich people are the same the world over; no matter what the nationality or race: elitish, cliche'ish, fashion forward, well-educated and often scions of large family businesses. This movie is sheer enjoyment by being a purely silly, fun way to experience GREAT MUSIC, the beauty of Singapore, great comedy, stunning people. Jut relax and ENJOY this gem!",Crazy Rich Asians
1210,pettybabu,Best comedy movie?? LoL,1,16 January 2019,"Watched last night knowing its the best comedy movie by Golden Glove but hance its a total disgusting movie I've ever seen, no story line no twist,how could this be a comedy movie ?

1211,addehall,Worst film of 2018,1,16 January 2019,"Very strange the amount of good reviews this film has on imdb and other places. I guess the chineese hacker army has been put to use.

1212,rbrackin-26196,A Wealth of Stars For Crazy Rich Asians,10,16 January 2019,"Crazy Rich Asians is a great refreshing feel-good movie that entices the viewer from the very beginning. Rachel Chu, played by Constance Wu, is an economics professor in New York dating Nick Young, played by Henry Golding. Rachel is unaware that her boyfriend belongs to one of the wealthiest families in Singapore. On their way to Nick's cousin's wedding in Singapore, Rachel is confused as to why they are in first-class. Nick explains that his family has money but he has always considered it to be their money, not his. Because Rachel is meeting Nick's whole family for the first time she is unaware that Nick's family is not only rich, they are crazy rich and basically Singapore's royal family. She doesn't realize this until her college roommate Peik Lin, played by Awkwafina (Ocean's 8 Star), is taken back by Rachel's outfit choice. Peik Lin helps Rachel get into more appropriate attire but, even Rachel's flawless outfit couldn't calm the storm she was about to enter. There was no way a typical New York Asian-American girl could live up to Nick's Mother's expectations. Nick's mother Eleanor, played by Michelle Yeoh, disapproves of Rachel from the very beginning. The movie brings the audience through the ups and downs of Rachel meeting Nick's family and trying her very best to prove to Eleanor that she is the one for Nick.
Based off of Kevin Kwan's 2013 novel, Crazy Rich Asians is far from a classic rom-com. The uniqueness of the plot makes it a fresh film that you are almost guaranteed to have never seen anything like it before.
The all-Asian cast does an incredible job at bringing the audience's emotions into the movie. From the dysfunctional family to the traditions the audience can relate to many aspects of the movie. Their acting played a huge role in bringing the audience in to the movie to the point where I forgot I was watching a movie when I watched it. The last major Hollywood film with a predominantly Asian-American cast was 'The Joy Luck Club' about 25 years ago. It was about time for another predominantly Asian-American casted film and they did an exceptional job.
The comedic banter between Rachel and her best friend Peik Lin made the movie in my opinion. It brought a sisterhood into the movie that is detrimental to any good rom-com. It accurately describes the true sisterhood friendship.
The soundtrack was nothing short of amazing. The combination of spunky Asian covers of American pop songs along with deep romantic music added balance to the movie. My favorite scene was the wedding when a cover of 'Can't help falling in love' was played while Sonoya, played by Araminta Lee, walked down a beautifully lit isle that was really a bed of water. No doubt the best wedding scene I've seen in a movie.
Batman Returns costume designer, Mary Vagot, did an exceptional job with the costume design in Crazy Rich Asians. From elegant high-class parties to the wedding to the raunchy bachelor party, the costume design was exceptional.
I did not enjoy the unrealistic parts of the movie. The impossible exaggerations of a bachelor party and Nick landing a helicopter on a rock were too much of an exaggeration of the crazy rich life in my opinion. I also would have liked to see more current popular Asian-American actors in the movie like, Mission Impossible III star, Margaret Quigley.
To conclude, Crazy Rich Asians is a refreshing feel-good movie that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a light and uplifting feel-good movie.",Crazy Rich Asians
1213,vshihminv,This movie is TERRIBLE,1,16 January 2019,Agree with the negative reviews. I had to watch another movie right after this so that my night didn't end on this awful movie.
