0,TheLittleSongbird,Pray let this be the last,3,1 July 2017,"Just for the record, before those defending the film jump down my throat and start accusing me of all kinds of unfounded things like they have done with their tiresome, uncalled for and disgustingly condescending critic bashing, this review is not coming from a 'Transformers' detractor. Far from it actually oddly enough.Most of the animated show are really entertaining and well made, and the animated film likewise in a guilty pleasure sort of way. Of the live-action films, the first was enjoyable, 'Revenge of the Fallen' (often considered the worst) for me wasn't that terrible but had a lot wrong with it while 'Dark of the Moon' and 'Age of Extinction' were mediocre. This is coming from somebody with a diverse taste in film and television (and a huge fan of classical music and opera), loving films of all genres old and new.Am honestly of the opinion that Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise got worse with each instalment, and having seen some describe 'The Last Knight' as the worst of the five having seen for myself with an open mind but with a little knowledge of its reception personally am in agreement. By all means, 'The Last Knight' is not irredeemably bad, none of the 'Transformers' films are. As usual the special effects are mostly of an awesome standard and the Transformers themselves are very well voiced, particularly a note-perfect Peter Cullen and Frank Welker.Bringing some welcome gravitas and fun to the film is Anthony Hopkins in one of the better performances of all five films put together. The best character is the refreshingly witty Cogman, performed with sleek enthusiasm by Jim Carter.However, Bay's direction is smug and self-indulgent and while there is some audacious stylishness to some of the cinematography too much of the editing is enough to make one get a headache. The Transformers don't have enough to do and while well voiced their personalities have been better defined before and their scenes lack tension, fun, excitement or any kind of intrigue. While the action sequences worked in the first three films, they didn't here and 'Age of Extinction', especially here, being chaotic and dull in rhythm. Aside from them being so poorly edited that it was confusing making out what was going on and to the point it was seizure-inducing, they got increasingly repetitive and dull. So instead of feeling thrilled the only feeling I got was boredom, and that was true of a lot of the audience in the cinema.None of the human characters are interesting, some are wasted and some are pointless (such as Izabella and Sqweeks). Others are annoying, of all the characters in the entire film faring worst in this regard is the complete failure of a comic relief character in Jimmy, annoyingly played by Jerrod Carmichael. Once again the script is very poor, which has the subtlety of a sledgehammer (even for a live-action 'Transformers' film where subtlety was never a strong suit and wasn't expected, but this was nauseating overkill too often) and is laden with tiresome clichés and cheap lowbrow humour that is on 'Age of Extinction' level and makes that of 'Revenge of the Fallen' comparatively tame.'The Last Knight' is again overlong by an hour, with the basic story being very thin on the ground and both rushed and slow moving. To make up for this, or disguise it more like, a lot of subplots are added, far too many and many of them are unsatisfyingly resolved or explored or serve no point at all, all giving an over-stuffed feel. Hopkins aside, the acting for the human characters is really not good, with Mark Whalberg being wooden and unconvincing at being tough and Laura Haddock is completely out of her depth. The two generate zero chemistry throughout. Even John Tuturro, Stanley Tucci and Mitch Pileggi are lacklustre.In conclusion, weak film and gives the sense that the 'Transformers' franchise has run its course. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Transformers - The Last Knight
1,Leofwine_draca,All spectacle,5,31 August 2019,"THE LAST KNIGHT is to date the most recent of the TRANSFORMERS franchise, excluding the BUMBLEBEE spin-off. It manages to be better than the original trilogy thanks to a shift away from lame comedy and juvenile hijinks towards a greater focus on epic-scale action a la the Marvel Universe. This time around, there's some half-hearted back story which seeks to tie the Arthurian legend into the Transformers universe (it never really works), which leads to the usual globetrotting and interplanetary adventures. Mark Wahlberg is on autopilot and supported by an unenthusiastic cast, with the exception of Anthony Hopkins, whose character seems to be exhibiting symptoms of early onset dementia. The voice cast (Buscemi, Goodman, Watanabe, etc.) is more interesting than the human cast. As usual, the saving grace are the special effects, which are exemplary and deliver CGI action which is all epic spectacle with barely time to draw breath.",Transformers - The Last Knight
2,SnoopyStyle,explosive muddle,3,4 July 2017,"King Arthur's wizard Merlin allied with Transformers to bring a powerful staff. In the present, an international force has been formed to battle the Transformers. In a devastated Chicago, Izabella and her fellow street kids work to save the newly arriving Transformers. They are joined by Bumblebee and Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) who has been hiding his Transformers in his junk yard. Meanwhile, Optimus Prime finds the Transformer homeworld Cybertron in ruins. Quintessa rules Cybertron and takes control of Optimus Prime on the way to Earth to retrieve her staff. Yeager and his group is recruited by Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) who reveals the secret history of the Transformers and that professor Viviane Wembly is a descendant of Merlin.So... that happened. It is everything Michael Bay. It has plenty of explosions, slow-motion action, hot babe, and big CGI set pieces. I'm willing to live with all that. It could be mind-numbing popcorn fun. There's nothing wrong with that. There is simply too much with the plot for this type of movie. Then there is the overall Michael Bay directions. His noisy muddled messy style is getting annoying. The historical Transformers leave me scratching my head. It is chaos in action and in story execution.",Transformers - The Last Knight
3,Prismark10,Knights of Transformers,3,15 September 2017,"The fifth Transformers movies has four writers, including Oscar winning hack Akiva Goldsman and has six people who edited it and it is still a bloated mess.The film starts off in legendary Arthurian times as twelve Transformers hidden on Earth give drunk Merlin an alien staff, they combine into a dragon to help King Arthur beat the Saxons. Merlin is later warned that an evil entity will come for the staff.In present day Earth, Transformers are declared outlaws by all governments of the world and a special unit is created kill them but still more alien robots arrive.Somewhere along the line Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) comes in possession of an ancient Transformers talisman and then bought over to the UK by Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) where he is introduced to an Oxford professor, Viviane Wembly the last living descendant of Merlin. She must find and use Merlin's staff to prevent the planet being destroyed by Cybertron.The film has state of the art special effects and it has plenty of Michael Bay's trademarked directorial flourishes. It is also overlong, stupidly plotted and incoherent.",Transformers - The Last Knight
4,nogodnomasters,"Without sacrifice, there can be no victory.",6,21 September 2017,"Max Payne teams up with Hannibal Lechter, Meredith Quill, and Isabela Moner to save the planet from transformers with transformers. Add in a secret society to to keep Earth's real transformer history a secret (Is that even possible?) and the wand of Merlin which is buried where only a submarine can reach it and Laura Haddock can wield it like a ""Fifth Element"" thing. The submarine used was a museum piece that didn't have to be fueled or prepared in any way. Car chases and dialogue for adolescents abound. Falls short of being a love story, maybe in the next one.Good mindless fun. Nothing more, nothing less.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. IMDb claims a robot said one. I didn't hear it. I thought Laura Haddock spoke two of them during her abduction.",Transformers - The Last Knight
5,kosmasp,Last in the line (?),5,2 September 2017,"At least for Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay, if you believe their public statements. And this has some really funny moments. Maybe I lowered the bar myself, but I really had some genuine chuckles along the way. It is silly don't get me wrong, but still works on some level. And whatever you may think (if it's negative), the movies made a lot of money at the box office.So Mark is back and gets a new friend attached to him. And then he also gets someone else he absolutely has to help and they are British and .. ah you don't care about the story anyway. You're her for the effects and the action and all that is here and then some. There is also an added scene after the credits so stay on for that ... What does that mean? You have to answer that question yourself for now ...",Transformers - The Last Knight
6,paul_haakonsen,Just another mediocre Transformers movie wrapped in dazzling special effects and explosions...,5,30 December 2018,"Indeed, where to begin?Well, I was a big fan of the ""Transformers"" animation during the 1980 as I grew up with the toys and the cartoons on TV, so of course I love this franchise. But I can't claim to be a fan of the Hollywood live action movies rendered upon the beloved childhood memory that is ""Transformers"".And this 2017 foray into the franchise didn't help to improve on my view on the movies either.While ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is a visually astounding and great movie, it was a horribly generic and stereotypical one as well. The storyline was just horribly flaccid and straight out of a singular road. No curves. No hills. No nothing. And the lack of an interesting storyline made for a mediocre movie experience, because astounding special effects and CGI can only carry a movie so far.And on a personal note, then I found it very difficult to take a robot with a robot cigar serious.I am sure that there are diehard fans out there swearing loyalty to the live action movie cash-in on the franchise. I, however, am not one so easily amused. This whole charade of movies have been mediocre at best.",Transformers - The Last Knight
7,zardoz-13,Extravagant But Preposterous Sci-Fi Robo-Carnage,7,7 July 2017,"""Armageddon"" director Michael Bay's extravagant, but preposterous, sci-fi, fantasy yarn ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" constitutes the fifth entry in the Hasbro action figures inspired film franchise. Although this fourth sequel boasts little of the spontaneity of Bay's first ""Transformers,"" this PG-13 rated installment tries to set itself apart from earlier outings. ""The Last Knight's"" larger-than-life shenanigans occur not only in the Medieval kingdom of King Arthur's Britain, but also on the Transformers' native planet Cybertron at the fringes of the Solar System. In a sense, Bay's fifth ""Transformers"" saga doubles as both a prequel and a sequel. Nevertheless, the film suffers from convoluted plotting that virtually defies synopsis. A quartet of scenarists--""Iron Man's"" Art Marcum & Mark Holloway, ""Black Hawk Down's"" Ken Nolan, and ""I, Robot's"" Akiva Goldsman overwhelm us with too much hokum. Michael Bay veers from slapstick comedy to straightforward heroics and the two often clash. Everything revolves around an outlandish scavenger hunt on Earth as well as in Outer Space. Indeed, Bay and his writers wear out their welcome as they wallow for almost two-and-a-half-hours setting up and then concluding their predictable plot. Mark Wahlberg makes an encore appearance as Cade Yeager, an intrepid but unkempt Texas inventor who sympathizes with the Autobots. Promoted from Captain to Colonel, William Lennox (Josh Duhamel) returns to the franchise after sitting out the third sequel ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" (2014). Things have changed alarmingly since ""Age of Extinction."" Basically, mankind has branded the Transformers—both the honorable Autobots and the dastardly Decepticons--as 'undesirables.' The governments of the world have assembled a multinational Transformer Reaction Force (TRF) to eradicate these shape-shifting aliens. Mind you, things went sour for the Autobots during the cataclysmic battle of Chicago in Bay's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" (2011). While the Windy City was devastated, Chicago wasn't reduced to complete rubble. Afterward, the authorities dissolved their military alliance with the Autobots against the wicked Decepticons. ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" picks up where ""Age of Extinction"" ended, with Autobot commander Optimus Prime plunging into space to find his creator.Whereas ""Age of Extinction"" opened during the Jurassic Age, ""The Last Knight"" unfolds in 484 A.D. The legendary King Arthur (Liam Garrigan of ""The Legend of Hercules"") and his outnumbered troops are waging a desperate war against the bloodthirsty Saxons. Indeed, things look perilous for Arthur, until the sozzled magician Merlin (Stanley Tucci of ""The Hunger Games"") makes a pact with the Knights of Iacon, twelve Transformers who sought refuge on Earth, who entrust him with a secret weapon. If Merlin will remain mum about their presence, the Autobots will reward him. Meantime, King Arthur's own knights ridicule him for his confidence in Merlin. Just as everything appears doomed, a gargantuan, fire-breathing, dragon with three-heads swoops in over the battlefield and scorches the Saxons! Sixteen-hundred years later, a Transformer spacecraft crashes in a ruined sector of Chicago. School kids gather at the crash site, but a man-made Sentinel robot patrolling this forbidden zone opens fire on them. At this point, we're told that all Transformers have been outlawed, and the Transformer Reaction Force (TRF) has been formed to exterminate all Transformers. This heavily-armed, SWAT-team style force tangles with a spunky, orphaned, 14-year old hellion, Izabella (Isabela Moner of ""Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life"") and her small adorable robot Sqweeks. Sqweeks and she trip up the Sentinels, and the kids elude the authorities. They stumble across another Transformer, Canopy, who relies on wreckage as camouflage. While the TRF deploy to blast Canopy to pieces, Cade Yeager careens out of nowhere like the cavalry to save them. He inspects the crashed Transformer spacecraft but he cannot help the unfortunate Transformer. Nevertheless, the dying Transformer gives him a medallion before it dies. Although the TRF know nothing about this magical talisman, a Decepticon scout named Barricade spots it and informs the villainous Megatron, the ringleader of the Decepticons. Cade scrambles back to an inconspicuous hideaway, a sprawling junkyard in South Dakota. The tenacious TRF track him down, and Cade abandons it. Several friendly Autobots who have been lying low with him vamos, too. Izabella surprises Cade with her impromptu arrival and persuades him to let her accompany him. Naturally, Sqweeks follows.Meanwhile, Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) learns that Cybertron has broken into fragments and the debris is drifting toward Earth. He locates the sorceress Quintessa (voice of Gemma Chan), and she convinces Prime that she created him. Quintessa resembles a giant necklace fairy flittering about like a malevolent Tinker Bell. According to Quintessa, a group of Transformer knights robbed her of a magical staff and entrusted it to Merlin for safekeeping. Quintessa brainwashes Prime, and he becomes her errand boy. She alters his name to ""Nemesis Prime"" and reveals that the Earth is actually Unicron. Unicron is an age-old enemy of Cybertron. At the same time, sinister things are occurring on Earth. Huge horns have emerged from the surface all over the globe, and scientists are mystified. Enough of this nonsense! Bay and his writers have too many things happening in this slam-bang, over-the-top, robot-mania. They also have too many characters. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins plays the noble, but loquacious Sir Edmund Burton, a crackpot who amuses Cade and Oxford scholar Viviane Wembly (Laura Haddock of ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2"") with the clandestine history of the Transformers on Earth. According to Burton, Ms. Wembly is none other than a descendant of Merlin, and she must get her hands on the staff to thwart Quintessa's scheme to annihilate Earth. Bay introduces new Autobot and Decepticon characters. Moreover, Bay surprises us with Bumblebee's resilience in one scene where the TRF blast him to ribbons but he reassembles himself and triumphs over his adversaries. Cade Yeager and Viviane Wembly pair up to find the staff, and find themselves in the usual number of cliffhanger predicaments. Altogether, Michael Bay proves he is still the maestro of mayhem with this improbable but high-octane opus.",Transformers - The Last Knight
8,Calicodreamin,"Good action, fair acting, too much going on",7,18 August 2019,"There's just too much going on in this movie, and it's ridiculously long. The last knight turns the world against transformers and has Cade (wahlberg) as the one of the few hold outs protecting them. First we learn that transformers helped Merlin win the ancient war of King Arthur. Cade then gets chosen to be the last knight starting the apocalyptic prophesy of the transformer world coming to consume earth... so with Optimus prime floating around in space he gets turned bad by the transformers creator quintessa. Then their planet shows up to claim the world consuming staff. So Cade and the descendant of Merlin must get it back. It's just all too much. While the action scenes are epic and awesome, some of it is a bit unbelievable. The quirky English transformer is fun, and the acting isn't terrible, but could have edited it down a fair bit.",Transformers - The Last Knight
9,FlashCallahan,I didn't leave the cinema angry......,5,26 June 2017,"........I just left slightly bewildered, wanting a Bud Light..Humans are now at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime has gone back to Cybertron. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Now, it's up to inventor Cade Yeager, Bumblebee, an overacting English lord, and an Oxford professor to save the world......The never ending franchise behemoth that bay has squirted out continues with this, the fifth, and in my opinion the most inoffensive chapter of what could be the most incoherent confusing series of all time.There is no plot, the film is just one big set piece from beginning to end. Characters come and go, we have your culturally wrong transformers (A Samurai with an offensive accent, a 'street' Decepticon with an offensive accent, and an almost embarrassing what appears to be a Transformers with slight learning difficulties), and throwaway racism, in which the film is fully aware of, so plays it for laughs.So Marky Mark is given a medallion by an old Transformer which T1000's onto his body every now and again, and talking of Terminators, while all this is happening, Optimus Prime has been taken hostage by the TX from Terminator 3.Elsewhere, Anthony Hopkins is explaining the plot every now and again, and is wonderfully over the top for all the wrong reasons. This is the perfect example of an actor making a film so he can get a new bathroom fitted. He clearly doesn't give a hoot about the narrative or the plot, he's chewing just as much scenery as what Transformers are destroying.It's an arsonists dream film, every other minute there is an explosion in glorious slow motion, and just when the audience begin the self realisation that the film makes no sense, Bay just whacks in another explosion to distract the viewer from what rubbish this is.Laura Haddock plays a Professor who may be the key to the Earths rescue, but she spends the majority of the film pouting and making her character totally unbelievable by the wardrobe Anne Summers supplied her.....And shame on Rebecca Front for appearing in this, does your lounge need decorating or something?As always, it all ends with a very confusing, but visually spectacular finale, where Marky Mark emulates a sword from his hand, and he and Haddock go down the worlds biggest slide, just for the rush.We have the talking heads of the Billy Bob Thornton from Armageddon wannabe, your atypical military folk who are looking and screens throughout the film, and other stereotypes, such as Marky Marks colleague, who channels Early nineties Will Smith, and a random girl with attitude, who Marky Mark subliminally adopts, because he can.Plus we have Hopkins try and talk street. Hearing him say 'Dude' and 'Bi***in' is worth the price of admission alone, and John Turtorro literally says the word 'Suckupuss'.Oh and Stanley Tucci plays a drunk Merlin who appears to have wandered in from Children's BBC's Maid Marian And Her Merry Men.So it's not the abomination that many have stated, but it's not very good.So to sum this film up, it's like a fast food stuffed, Caffeine infused, deep pan, TOWIE watching step sister of Lars Von Triers Melancholia.But not as uplifting..",Transformers - The Last Knight
10,trashgang,only the effects work out but a terrible story,4,18 September 2017,"Another blockbuster that failed completely in the summer and after seen this flick I understand why. It never really got my attention. Therefor the story is too weak and what is happening in the time of King Arthur and WWII is ridiculous.On the other hand, the effects are again amazing and the cars used are also stunning but that doesn't make a good flick. The good thing is that there is a summary in the beginning explaining what happened in the last flicks because it's 3 years since the last Transformers. But somehow the Transformers itself are becoming laughable and a bit stupid. Maybe it was the intention but for me that's the downfall. There are of course good moments especially on other planets but once on earth it doesn't work out. Even the characters are full of clichés, no this time it is really bad.Still, if you do follow these flicks then again it's a must see but only for the effects.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 0/5",Transformers - The Last Knight
11,mm-39,Surprisingly good,7,13 July 2017,"Transformers: The Lat Knight is surprisingly good. My wife and I had low, low, low expectations for The Last Knight. In fact, we only went for the drive inn experience. The driving by Morden is a long drive, but one of the last of last. The Last Knight worked out as movie! What worked: The humor-Hokins and the C 3 P 0 homage Transformer created a British style humor. Cade Yeager(aka Markie Mark)/Vivian Wembley sexual tension has a humor edge like the Old Moonlighting t v series. Surprisingly an entertaining story; A king Author/Merlin story involving Knights and honor. The civilized vs the savage! The modern story is the Evil prince invades an civilization can only be saved by modern Knights, special forces, Transformers etc. Humor/mixed with mid-evil honor brilliantly works. The car/special effects mixed with old Knights works. What did not work: The usual red meat for the comic book audience with the Starwars C G I special effect ending. C G I comic book ending getting old. Un-original, redundant, formulated and predictable. The original Starwars ending was great, but there needs to be a new game changer ending for the genre. Worth heading out to the sticks to see. 7 out of 10.",Transformers - The Last Knight
12,Hellmant,"I would have enjoyed this film a lot more as a kid, so I think it deserves some credit.",6,22 June 2017,"'TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT': Three Stars (Out of Five)The fifth film in the blockbuster movie franchise, based on the Hasbro toy line. Michael Bay (who also directed all four other installments in the series) returns to direct the film, and Mark Wahlberg reprises his role from the previous movie as well. Stanley Tucci (who played a role in the last film too) returned to play a new character in this installment, and Josh Duhamel and John Turturro reprise their roles from the first three films as well. Peter Cullen also reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, which he's performed in all of the other movies and the cartoon series too. The film also costars newcomers Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, Isabela Moner and Santiago Cabrera. It was written by Akiva Goldsman, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan; while Steven Spielberg once again returned as a producer (a role he's also performed on all of the other installments in the series too). The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics (like most of the other installments in the series), and it's expected to be the least impressive at the Box Office (but it's still expected to be hugely profitable). I think it's the least enjoyable film in the series as well, but fans of all of the other movies will still like it I'm sure.In this chapter Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) is once again helping the Autobots survive on Earth, as they've been made outlawed outcasts by the US government (and most other governments around the world). While helping some kids, in a war-torn Chicago, Yeager stumbles upon a dying Transformer knight. The knight gives Yeager a talisman, and he's later approached by an astronomer/historian (Hopkins), in England, who informs Yeager that he's 'the last knight', and it's his destiny to protect Earth from evil ancient Transformers. At the same time Optimus Prime (Cullen) returns to Cybertron, and is corrupted by the evil sorceress who created him.The beginning of the movie is actually pretty fun, and Tucci is hilarious as Merlin in it. The war-torn post-apocalyptic scenes (in Chicago) are cool as well. Once the film gets to the actual storyline of the movie though, it becomes a bit of an annoying headache. Towards the end of the film, during the excruciatingly long (and overly chaotic) climax, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over too. I almost want to give it an even lower rating than I am, but I have to admit the special effects are cool, some of the action scenes are exciting, and there are some fun (and funny) moments in it. I also have to admit I would have enjoyed the film a lot more as a kid, and it's essentially supposed to be a kids' movie. So I think it deserves a three star (out of five star) rating, but I admit I'm being overly generous.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE",Transformers - The Last Knight
13,FeastMode,incompetent,2,24 July 2019,"Terrible. so sloppy and awkward. i didn't know what was going on half the time, both story-wise and action-wise. none of the action was good. the dialogue was terrible. the scene editing was really bad, and i don't normally notice that kind of stuff. so many of the story points go nowhere, filled with pointless characters that do nothing. so many different parts of the story that you forget about some until they bring it back later. and you don't really care about any of them. the comedic attempts were awful. with the exception of the special effects and some pretty shots, this movie is completely incompetentwhat they did with optimus was laughable. megatron doesn't even look like megatron, if you asked me who he was i would have never guessed based on the look. and they ignored where they left off with megatron in Age of Extinction where he was made of transformium.where are the beastly action scenes with amazing music? where is the amazing music at all???? with the same composer as the previous movies, all of which had musical scores that significantly elevated the movies, they somehow put together a completely forgettable score. where were the awesome optimus speeches? they were all useless.

14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Only this franchise could take something as inherently exciting as giant robots fighting and make it utterly dull.,3,8 May 2018,"Despite all its spectacle, 'Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)' is simply completely mind-and-arse-numbingly boring. It's an utter chore to sit through from beginning to long-awaited end. It's also the kind of self-indulgent trite that goes in one ear and straight out of the other. Honestly, I felt as though I'd been sat in the cinema for years, never mind the already far too long two-and-a-half hours I actually had to endure this for. Not a single frame provided even a morsel of entertainment - which is weird because, for all intents and purposes, the admittedly impressive visual effects should've at least granted me some brief form of passive enjoyment during one of the over-blown action set-pieces. Yet, the takeaway I have from the picture is this: only Michael Bay (and his team, of course) could make something as inherently exciting as giant robots battling one another so painfully and utterly dull. 3/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight
15,ThomasDrufke,One of the Worst Films of all Time,1,25 June 2017,"With as many talented people involved in this project as there are, you would think that at some point they realized what they were making wasn't so good? That doesn't seem to be the case with Transformers: The Last Knight. However bad you thought the last few Transformers films have been, nothing can prepare you for the abomination of this film.Hearing about all of the silly subplots this film had beforehand had me very skeptical about Michael Bay's ability to cohesively tell a story amidst all of the CGI-heavy action. Not that any of the last 3 Transformers movies boasted an Oscar winning story, but they at least had some sort of focus. Plus, Bay proved once again with 13 Hours that he can make a real film with real characters. But all of that gets thrown out the window with The Last Knight. Not only is it extremely difficult to get behind any of the character's convoluted motives, most of them don't even deserve to be in the film.It's one thing to have a few humans ground this bigger than life story, it's another thing entirely to put the focus on the humans and have the Transformers be ancillary characters. This isn't about Transformers at all, it's about Mark Wahlberg's 'Cade Yeager' character being the chosen ""Last Knight"" and Laura Haddock's 'Viven Wembley' being the last surviving member of the Witwicky family. Because, you know, every important person in the history of humankind has been a secret member of the Witwicky's, protecting the Autobots from the world. Makes sense. In fact, the most popular Transformer, Optimus Prime, is in the film for maybe 15 minutes. Not that these films ever appealed to me, but I didn't go to see a Transformers movie for the humans, I went for the robots.On that note, Bay duplicates what he's always done with these movies is make some impressive action sequences. It's the one thing I can't really pick apart. Even with that said, the action sequences don't add anything new to the series. Without any emotional connection to the bots or any detailed differences between them, it's all a bunch of nonsensical slow-motion CGI. Speaking of which, the constant slow motion certainly doesn't help with the excessive runtime. Even with Michael Bay coming out and saying it's ""significantly"" shorter than the last 3 films doesn't change how unnecessary a 2 and a half hour Transformers film is. Cut out the supporting characters who add nothing (Izabella, Jimmy, that physicist guy), remove the Arthurian scenes (because that was a missed opportunity, and god help us please take out all of the misplaced unfunny humor. When the film pauses for the audience to laugh and nobody even dares to chuckle, there's something seriously wrong with the script.What's the solution here? We know Paramount will continue to make more Transformers films, and rightfully so (they make over a billion), and we know Paramount will inexplicably hire Michael Bay again (BC he's not going to retire). How can they continue to hire a guy who dismisses any nuances in the script with his own racist, sexist, and dated direction? Did they not gather a writer's room with like 10 renowned writers for this film? Well, I think the solution is to just stop going. I should have stopped going after the last film, but I held out hope one last time. As long as Bay is behind these films and directs without any care in the world, then I won't be considered part of the audience. Enough is enough. I'm done.-Horrible script-Same old lazy direction-Unnecessary characters and subplots that make the film feel like 5 hours-Even the action feels recycled-Still takes itself way too seriously0.6/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
16,ericstevenson,It never gets better,3,12 August 2017,"It was very entertaining watching the Nostalgia Critic's not review of this film and realizing how spot on he was after watching the actual bad movie. Well, there was a lot given away in the trailers. This is my first time reviewing one of these films here and I certainly have a lot to say. This movie doesn't open by saying that the Transformers killed the dinosaurs. Instead, it opens by saying that the Transformers worked with Merlin and King Arthur! Yeah, it's as stupid as it sounds. Optimus Prime doesn't appear much in the movie but he does turn evil because of brainwashing or something just like the Critic predicted.It's said the medieval stuff happened in 484 and then it says 1600 years later, but that's 1500 years later! The writers can't even do math! We get Mark Wahlberg again and a love interest with no buildup that's just stupid and pointless. It's revealed that Earth is Unicron but we never see anything that cool. It's just the same endless slow motion and explosions and robots fighting we've seen in every other film in the series. This drags on for two and a half hours. The film features Optimus Prime's creator, some floating robot woman. It's just the same old, same old and there's way more sequels planned. It's pointless, a waste of your time and as stupid as ever. *1/2",Transformers - The Last Knight

This movie is terrible. The filmmaker's approach seems to be that plot points and character's actions don't have to make sense, as long as they move the story forward.

18,lesleyharris30,"In no Way Spectacular, but I Enjoyed Myself,",7,24 July 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. While this series is in no way groundbreaking, and would really amaze me if it actually managed to do anything out of the ordinary, I continue to have a lot of fun watching the Transformers films. Mark Wahlberg makes a terrific lead man, as always, with great one liners between him and the Autobots, his romantic lead is also very intriguing, a strong female character played very well by Laura Haddock. The highlight for me is without a doubt Anthony Hopkins, he made it all worthwhile, bringing new energy to the franchise. As soon as he was casted, I presumed Hopkins would be the main antagonist, but he is actually a charming character who serves as excellent comic relief, quite possibly one of my favourite performances in any Michael Bay film.The story, like all the other movies, is far more complicated than it needs to be. The amount of time spent on breaking down every single detail of this plot to make sure it makes sense to everyone grows very tedious. All these moments are between Autobots, which is the most boring aspect of the film for me, I much preferred the human characters.Every single beat is the same. It does nothing new, there is no unforeseen event, no shocking twist, it has the same beginning, middle and end as the other four movies. All of the main characters arch's are extremely predictable, their faith can be seen as soon as we make their presence, there is truly nothing in this movie that grabbed me. Forgetfable, but fun while it lasts. While it does not offer anything new, Transformers: The Last Knight has an inspired cast, great effects and some top notch action sequences, personally, I prefer it to all the movies bar the first, and think it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good adventure, just do not go out of your way to see it. Cade and the Autobots must discover the secrets of the past in order to save the future of humanity. Best Performance: Anthony Hopkins",Transformers - The Last Knight

It's not until a robotic dragon knight from Arthurian times bestows Cade with a powerful talisman that the fugitives are able to fight back.Meanwhile, the creator of the Transformers has returned to drain Earth's quintessence using Merlin's (Stanley Tucci) staff.While this fifth chapter features some iconic cameos from the eighties animated series, it's not enough to make up for the convoluted plot line, the nauseating direction and the endless fisticuffs between warring heaps of jumbled scrap metal.Incidentally, the only medieval mechanical devices Transformers could conceivably shift into would be chastity belts.

22,The-Sarkologist,"Yep, it's number five",5,23 June 2017,"This is apparently Micheal Bay's last Transformers movie but the end suggested that there is still another one to come, and it has to do with the Unicron (which I won't reveal even though I am tempted to). I still remember when the first one appeared, it was like: Awesome, a live action Transformers movie. Indeed, such a movie was a long time coming and from what some friends were saying, I wasn't the only one who would be there with bells on during the opening weekend. However, we are now at number five and honestly, it is just more of the same.Basically the film follows on from the last four, and the world that we know and love is a vastly different place. For instance Chicago is now a no go zone, as are the badlands in Dakota. Humans aren't supposed to go where the Transformers have been shot down, but some do like to sneak in. However, more and more seem to be coming every day, and it seems, for some strange reason, that out of all the planets in the universe, there seems to be a focus on Earth.Well, the story takes us back to the time of King Arthur. In fact the guy next to me asked me if he was in the right film particularly since King Arthur is actually showing at this time. Well, surprise, surprise, it appears that Transformers have been with us for a very long time, and have also been involved in moving our history along. Oh, and it turns out that Witwicy from the first trilogy is actually a member of a coven that is dedicated to protecting an artifact belonging to the transformers, though he is no longer a part of this new trilogy.The problem is that these films simply seem to be starting to become a little long in the tooth. While the first one was quite funny, the jokes here have become really worn, and it seems that the only people who found them funny were the kids. The story was also pretty samey, in that it really wasn't all that inspiration. Also, they simply had to have Megatron appear, and he really doesn't pack the same punch that he used to in the first couple of films. Also the whole concept of transforming robots seems to have fallen to the wayside, even though that was the original focus of the toys. In the end it is fun, but not a film to go out of your way to see.",Transformers - The Last Knight

24,paulclaassen,"Unwatchable!! I mean, what the hell??!!",1,10 June 2019,"The trailer to 'The Last Knight' looked really incredible. Having seen it, though, it really is a pity the film was not as good as the trailer. I'm not sure whether this was intended as an actual sequel, or a spoof? This is a COMPLETE mess!My gosh, I don't even know where to start with how bad this was. Maybe with how cringe worthy their attempts at humor was. This film is like a very, very bad comedy, and definitely more annoying than funny. Without all the unnecessary stupid scenes taking up screen time, the film could easily have been cut to about two hours, or less. What the hell were they thinking with all this silliness??? This is a dramatic action adventure fantasy series, so how did it become so slapstick??? It was beyond stupid and almost unwatchable. Yes, I used the forward button more than once, as I simply couldn't handle some of the stupid scenes!'The Last Knight' offers nothing in action we haven't seen in the previous four films. Even the visual effects were not the greatest. (Some were actually quite bad for such a big budget film and a series known for stunning visuals). The action scenes are so few and far between, I hesitate calling this an action film. Nothing about this disastrous, ridiculous entry in the series was even remotely interesting or exciting.The characters and dialogue were just as stupid as the humor. Laura Haddock portrays Vivien Wembley, who is a professor and becomes the film's hero, but she's as stupid and shallow as can be and her speech resembles nothing relating to a professor. Mark Wahlberg, who made a credible hero in 'Age of Extinction' is a silly, comical character, equally shallow.I hated this film so much, I think I'll conveniently forget I've ever seen this. I WANT to forget this. Please, no more!!! This hideous film proves 'The Transformers' have clearly overstayed their welcome. (and I read they actually planned another 12 films... Save me!!!).",Transformers - The Last Knight
25,tomgillespie2002,"Left me feeling nothing at all, other than incredibly sleepy",2,24 September 2017,"A few years ago, after the Shia LaBeouf-starring Transformers trilogy came to a close with Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay made the welcome announcement that he was to leave the franchise he'd been working on day-in day-out for the past 5 years, causing critics - and film buffs forcing themselves to endure such cinematic waste - to rejoice in the process. This, of course, wasn't true, as he came back to the series to helm Age of Extinction in 2014, this time starring the considerably buffer frame of Mark Wahlberg. I don't remember much of what happened - other than incoherent special effects bashing each other and blowing things up - but there was certainly no extinction, and whatever happened in that film inspired Bay to explore new stories in the Transformers universe. And so here we are with number five - The Last Knight.He's tricked us before into believing that we were finally moving into a world free of Bay's Transformers movies, so there's no reason to believe his new claims that The Last Knight will indeed be his last foray into the stories of the Autobots and Decepticons (although its always been much more about the humans). There's a Bumblebee spin- off starring Hailee Steinfeld already shooting, and the climax here certainly leads us to believe that there's even more to come. The Last Knight runs at a whopping 149 minutes (which is actually one of the shortest in the series), and every one of those minutes feels like a lifetime as Bay amps up everything the majority of people have come to hate about the franchise. Huge planets are smashed into each other, characters share awkward and painfully unfunny banter, and the camera leers so much at the franchise's latest hotty (a professor who dresses like a stripper played by Laura Haddock) that you almost long for the acting talents of Megan Fox.Wahlberg returns as Cade Yeager, the inventor-turned-outlaw who still hasn't realised how ridiculous his name is, and now sports an equally ridiculous haircut. Following the events of the previous film, all Transformers have now been declared criminals, and the Transformer Reaction Force has been set up to eradicate the alien robots. Only more are arriving on Earth every day, so Optimus Prime has travelled back to his home planet to confront his maker for answers. Yeager is protecting many of the surviving Autobots at his junk yard, but soon finds himself caught up in events when a strange alien talisman attaches itself to his arm from the ship of a dead Transformer. Giant horns have emerged from the ground in various locations throughout the world, and it all somehow ties into a tale going back to the time of King Arthur and Merlin (the latter played by a game Stanley Tucci). Decepticons want the talisman for some reason, and by this time I'd given up.The first hour is spent trying to explain the plot to the audience, while the rest is spent exploring aimless sub-plots, one involving a tough orphan child living in the ruins of a previous battle, designed to appeal to the young crowd. Within the first twenty minutes, it shamelessly rips-off Game of Thrones and Stranger Things, TV shows of a quality Bay could only dream of creating. By the time Anthony Hopkins shows up to collect his pay cheque, you'll be too worn out to tolerate his bumbling, exposition-tool shtick. Bay isn't interested in correcting the mistakes he has been criticised for in the past: The Last Knight is custom-made to appease the audience who willingly pay to see this migraine-inducing nonsense every couple of years. Yet judging for the film's rather uninspiring box-office take, even they are getting tired of it. With the exception of 2007's sporadically enjoyable first film, this franchise has left me angry, outraged, depressed and physically sick, but never had I felt indifferent. The Last Knight left me feeling nothing at all, other than incredibly sleepy.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I believe that the ""Transformers"" franchise has to stop in this movie and not continue because it does not have anything more or new to add.

27,cruise01,A bit of the same but pure summer escapism of big loud action fun.,10,21 June 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight is yet again topped with loud big action and visual effects with little less on the plot. Nonetheless, it was awesome for what it is. Most of the Transformers movies by now have a recycled plot. Michael Bay is aiming to make a big summer blockbuster with lots of explosions between the autobots and decepticons. Even Paramount wants to open up this universe further with having a variety of writers tackle on for more movies. For now, this may be Michael Bays last outing with the franchise and he does go big. The plot may seem familiar with one of the Transformers movies were decepticons plan on reviving their home world of Cybertron by consuming and destroying Earth. Not sure, if they can do any different story than that. Since its nothing but setting up an excuse for Autobots to fight with the decepticons. The movie was exciting and never slowed down. It may have some sub plots about King Arthurs and the knights of the roundtable and Merlin staff that was given to him by an autobot. That staff plays an important factor to reviving cybertron which is going to collide with Earth if Cade (Mark Wahlberg) and Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the autobots try to stop them from taking over. These movies are just pure escapism blockbuster fun movies. Michael Bay never disappoints the lack of action, which he seems to go over board with explosions. Car chases, military jets battling through cybertron. For a long running time movie, I feel like its fast paced. Also, different screenwriters this time around, they have a few sub plots that merge in the climax. Cade is wanted by the TRF led by Lennox who are determined to destroy all transformers even the good guys. Then, there is Izabella (Isabela Moner) a teenage girl with no home or family but is willing to fight for the autobots and sticks to Cade's shadows. Next, there is Viviane (Laura Haddock) an English professor, who has a historical connection that can help save our planet. At last, there is Sir Edmund (Anthony Hopkins) a historian who knows about the historical encounters with the Transformers and may know the key to saving mankind. Sure, a lot goes on with the plot. And it never slows down. It entertains and is exciting to see these big action sequences. The climax was also an epic long battle with cybertron crashing down onto Earth with visual effects being quite spectacular. With fast cinematography work in capturing the action and the settings. Isabela Moner's character was better than expected, from the looks on the trailers made her out to be annoying. She is a character that is easily grown on and works well with Cade in trying to give him hope. The film does end in a bit of a cliffhanger with the mid credit scene which opens for a sequel. If that happens, it would be interesting to see the direction the movie takes if this is Michael Bays last Transformers movie. He tends to turn these movies into mindless, loud, action packed movies. Overall, Transformers: The Last Knight is an awesome film that is everything I expected it to be. Its not meant to have a big depth story. Just a reason to set these big robots to cause mass destruction with car chases, explosions and much more. I recommend if you enjoyed the others or looking for a big action movie.",Transformers - The Last Knight
28,Floated2,Distracting and lacking of suspense,2,13 May 2018,"Transformers: The Last Knight has a different feel compared to the other Transformers films in the series, and not in a good way. This film doesn't build its suspense or thrills and the outcome doesn't work. From the beginning the film starts off and has very little build up to the main climax. A lot of cut and jump scenes in the film has it become very distracting. At least with Age of Extinction there was some continuity and the beginning of that film had buildup, suspense and was engaging. The Last Knight throws too much at once and the outcomes isn't very compelling. Also including worst supporting characters, and the transformers in this film become much more annoying, giving more dialogue and silly jokes. This film shows how far the franchise has come and how far it has fallen. As we know, there will be another Transformers film later this year, in which is being considered a ""spin-off"" as Bumblebee, and for now, we are not sure how that will go.",Transformers - The Last Knight
29,eddie_baggins,The robotic shine is lost in this series worst entry,2,25 June 2017,"Most avid cinema-goers have a guilty pleasure franchise, perhaps a dark secret they hide from other film fans in fear of imminent judgment.It could be the Fast and the Furious franchise, Underworld or help us all the Resident Evil series. Personally for me over recent years, tapping into the inner boy that still lives large inside me, my guilty pleasure franchise has been the Transformers series.I'm certainly not going to argue with anyone about the cinematic qualities of Michael Bay's explosion ridden collection of what some people would call crimes against cinema, but I've found much simplistic joy watching humongous robots go toe to toe on a scale that only Bay knows how to do and no matter what his many downfalls as a filmmaker are, there's not many directors out there that do large scale spectacle as impressively as Bay frequently conjures up.In saying this, I was quietly hoping that The Last Knight, Bay's 5th film in the Transformers series, would provide some good dumb fun but it's with some form of geeky, inner boy sadness that I report this series has officially lost its robotic shine in one of the years dumbest, most obnoxious and overall bland big screen experiences.Everything that made this series fun in the first place, from its highly popular and better than many would want to admit first entry through to increasingly dwindling later entries is unfortunately lost in The Last Knight.Bay seems bored behind camera with the films few and far between set pieces barely rising the pulse, his cast seem downright unhappy to be a part of the film from Mark Wahlberg's returning Cade Yeager through to Anthony (""dudeeeee"") Hopkins cringe-worthy support as Sir Edmund Burton and you know things are getting dire when even the robot fisticuffs or Bumblebee's presence isn't enough to make a Transformers film entertaining.It's a shame that the series has lost sight of what made it popular in the first place and while Transformers fans of old may enjoy an overly complicated story that touches on series and plot lines of old, for the rest of us, this bizarrely long and exhaustive experience will create headaches rather than smiles as we try to figure out what on earth is even going on.Talking to much about the plot line of a Transformers film would be an act in stupidity but Bay and his 3 screenwriters have truly outdone themselves in creating a Razzie worthy story that includes King Arthur, a drunken Merlin, Nazi's, orphaned children who just keep showing up in inappropriate situations, robotic dinosaur babies and an organ playing transforming butler who at one stage quite literally gets called out on screen as a C-3PO rip-off (which is exactly what he is).There's more that's going on in the films plot lines and detours but one thing that can be surmised without hesitation is that this confusing and convoluted story is working hard to pick up the slack of a lack of heart and excitement factor, in a film that fails to justify its existence in this years crowded summer blockbuster market.Final Say – As is to be expected from this franchise, the robots and CGI work look fantastic, the explosions nice and explosioney (just the way Bay likes it) and Mark Wahlberg's arms are a sight to behold but The Last Knight feels like a sad death knell to a franchise that at one stage provided what we require from a summer blockbuster; A silly yet simple storyline, a cast of fun characters and some eye-popping visual spectacle that covers up many of the films various downfalls. That The Last Knight fails in all of these aspects is a tell-tale sign that you should avoid this series worst entry like the robotic plague.1 drunken Merlin out of 5",Transformers - The Last Knight
30,leonblackwood,Great CGI with a messy concept!,4,5 April 2018,"Review:
This epic movie certainly looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but from an entertainment point of view, it was a total let down. The storyline was all over the place, and the human characters became extremely annoying after a while, except for Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton), and his reliable robot Cogman, voiced by Jim Carter. Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yeager) didn't seem like he wanted to be there most of the time, and Laura Haddock (Vivian Wembley), the Angelina Jolie lookalike, didn't suit her role. Stanley Tucci (Merlin) made me laugh and Josh Duhamel (Colonel William Lennox) played a convincing soldier but I didn't see the point to the little girl Isabela Monet (Isabella), who seemed to get in the way most of the time. Anyway, with the Autobots still at war with the Decepticons, as usual, the humans are out to capture all of the Transformers, and with Optimus Prime gone, they are all in hiding with Cade helping them to survive. Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, and meets his alleged creator, Quintessa, who tells him that he needs to get Merlin's staff to absorb Earth's energy to restore their home-world. Meanwhile, Cade is given a precious mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot Knight, and while he is battling against the TRF drones, he is approached by Cogman who invites him to the UK to meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who shows him the history of the Transformers and the power of the staff. To get to the staff, he needs the help of Vivian Wembley, who is a English Literature Professor and has the power to control the staff, so they set of on there mission, with Optimus Prime close behind them. Whilst battling against the TRF and Quintessa's soldiers, there is a race to get to the staff before it destroys earth. There was much thought behind the storyline but I personally thought that it was a right mess. It also lacked wit and there wasn't much depth to the various characters. With that aside, the action scenes were half decent and the transformers looked great but it wasn't enough to save the movie. I really think that they need to go back to the drawing board with this franchise, because all of the movies haven't been that great, and they seem to be getting worse. If they do decide to release another Transformers, they really need to think about character building, more than the CGI content, even though it made a decent profit at the box office. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Michael Bay, who brought you the Bad Boys franchise, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, The Island, The Transformers franchise, the great Pain & Gain and 13 Hours. With so many hit movies behind him, I'm not surprised of the scale of this movie but I still wasn't impressed with the outcome. The corny script and poor acting has been the main problem with the whole franchise but they all seem to make a lot of money, for some unknown reason. With another Transformers movie in the pipeline, due to be released in 2019, I hope that they choose another director for the project, who will give it a fresh concept, and hopefully a decent cast. Budget: $217million

32,matthewssilverhammer,Middle-of-the-Road Transformers...Which Means It's Real Bad,3,29 June 2017,"Last Knight is, admittedly, less offensively appalling than some of its atrocious predecessors. However, it is every bit as mind-numbingly vapid. Obnoxious slo-mo explosions, constant bickering about the world ending, CGI covering loud CGI covering louder CGI. Not a single emotional or motivational moment works; everything's so unearned and clichéd our empathy disappears for the entire 150 minutes. It may be a middle-of-the-road Transformers flick, but it's mostly just really bad There's a forced connection to King Arthur lore, and a tired good-guy-goes-bad-then-(SPOILER)-goes good-again trope. Otherwise, it's business-as-usual: the world is threatened by some sort of unstoppable force of destruction, and there's only one way to stop it. Will our heroes be able to stop the annihilation? Of course. Will Optimus Prime nearly die like he has in every other film? Of course. Will the dialogue be as clunky and expository as a 90's video game cut scene? It wouldn't be a Bay film without it! It's less like entertainment and more like staring at a noisy, lit up wall. With all that, you're probably wondering how this isn't the worst in the series. Well, for all the hilarious illogic, the auteur cinematic style (yeah, I called Michael Bay an auteur) is impossible to deny. The effects (while endless) are seamless, and there a more than a few sets that are truly grand (an underwater spacecraft specifically stands out). I can't help but think if ever given a better script, Bay could make a great movie. Unfortunately these Transformer films over explain every plot detail, rarely use visual tools to say what's happening, and treat its characters and audience with disdain. It's just honest-to-God bad filmmaking.",Transformers - The Last Knight

34,southdavid,Garbage In Disguise,2,9 April 2018,"I quite liked the earlier ""Transformers"" films. They have their problems, the actual robots are all a bit generic, it's a little too creepily obsessed with shooting women and cars in the Golden hour. . but it's fun and straightforward enough. I'm telling you this so you understand that although I see a lot of films, I wouldn't consider myself a cinematic elitist, nor do I have any axe to grind. So believe me when I say that ""The Last Knight"" is one of the most incoherent shambles, I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. Despite its gargantuan running time, the plot is very much secondary to scenes of cars driving fast and robots wheeling in the air for some reason. The Transformers home planet is on a collision course with earth and only Merlin's staff (that controlled a transformer a long time ago) can fix the problem, somehow. We're glossing over the fact that King Arthur's court is at best an apocryphal story and crashing on. Anthony Hopkins blunders around, looking as embarrassed to be in this as he should, talking about secret histories and such. The US army make a deal with Megatron, the terms of which are never explained, so when he turns on them almost immediately it's not really a shock. Optimus Prime turns evil until the first time someone asks him not to be. It genuinely feels like they somehow lost every third page of the script and decided to just make it anyway. Its looks nice, like normal. Nobody could ever accuse Michael Bay of not knowing how to frame a shot but a nicely framed garbage fire is still a garbage fire. I've liked Mark Wahlberg in other things, and even in the last Transformers film his fatherhood gave him something to work with, in this he runs around pulling faces and having zero chemistry with poor Laura Braddock, who's thrown into this nonsense with an underwritten cliché role. It will be interesting if the upcoming ""Bumblebee"" movie will be able to dig the series out of terminal decline.",Transformers - The Last Knight
35,subxerogravity,I liked this one. For what it was it was entertaining.,6,21 June 2017,"Not bad at all.What is it about the odd numbered ones in this franchise that are my favorite? The first Transformers movie was OK. The Third one was my favorite (Which is not saying much). This fifth and last one is up there with the third one.Like the third one, it was an excellent use of CGI to do the action scenes. Transformers was one of the first movies that I've seen in which they did CGI scenes in the day time, and it looked really good. You can see that director Michael Bay has hit his peak in really making the CGI action interact well with the live action footage.Like the original movie, The Last Knight is an ensemble cast that revolves around the main character. It's not the best ensemble cast I've seen. Josh Duhamel, who had been in the series longer than Wahlberg felt like a strange insert done for pure nostalgia, but if you are into the Franchise or Transformers in general the ensemble cast gives you that fandom.Speaking of Wahlberg, his Cade Yeager is a much better character than Shia LaBeouf's, Sam Witwicky. I like the way Cade gets into the action more than Sam trying to get away from it. It makes for better interaction between the live action and CGI. Bay treats Wahlberg like a walking action figure.It is weird how little action is actually in this movie. You have a few giant battles leading up to the epic one at the end, and in-between it's Micheal Bay pretending to be the filmmaker he's not with funny scenes that are not really funny and his attempts to poke fun at Romance scenes in films only made his film stupid. Stick to the slick action and crap blowing up Bay.Overall, I enjoyed the film. Not one of my favorite franchises but I did like this one. It's like watching a live action cartoon, but that's all the Transformers movies isn't it?

It was the one that underperformed at the box office.The Last Knight repeats a lot of the mistakes that Revenge of the Fallen. Most of the Transformers were pushed to the background for an ,Indiana Jones style treasure hunt film, Optimus Prime was missing for most of the film and had characters who were pointless like Izabella or annoying and pointless, i.e. Jimmy. Bay's brand of sex humour was back with a vengeance with Cade getting the mick taken out of him for not having sex for a long time and Viviane's family trying to pair her up with a man. As an Englishman it was amusing to see the geographical errors in the film.The dumbest point in the film was when the US government made a deal with Megatron despite there being four films where the Decepticons being proven to be untrustworthy. They were pointless for most of the film anyway and could have been written out without much trouble. It was also a film that didn't care about the continuity of the series like having Bumblebee being on Earth since World War Two and fighting the Nazis when in the original film he was a scout sent to Earth.There were some things I liked. The opening battle scene was fun and it looked like Bay was put in charge of a Ridley Scott style epic and it was good to see Gemma Chan get a major role in Hollywood film.",Transformers - The Last Knight
38,stevendbeard,Looks Good/Hard To Follow,6,21 June 2017,"I saw ""Transformers:The Last Knight"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Patriots Day, Date Night; Anthony Hopkins-The Thor movies, The Wolfman_2010; Josh Duhamel-CHIPS_2017, When in Rome and Laura Haddock-The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Captain America:The First Avenger.This is about the 5th in the series about Transformers-robots than change into various vehicles like cars and planes-and they have all been directed by Michael Bay, including this one. The film goes into the history of the Transformers-going back to Camelot and King Arthur-and shows their creator, Quintessa, from the planet Cybertron. Mark is back for his second movie in the series and he is hiding from the government in a junk yard with some of the Autobots. Josh is a special adviser to the soldiers hunting Mark but they eventually team up, of course. Anthony plays an Englishman that supplies history on an ancient artifact from Merlin-the one from the King Arthur legends-that everybody seems to be after. Laura is the hot English teacher that is a descendant of someone from the King Arthur days that has a big role to play with the artifact-She kind of reminded me of Megan Fox. The movie looks great; the action, special effects and stunts were all fantastic as can be expected from Michael Bay but the story was a little hard to follow at times-that might be because I'm not a big fan of the series. If you are a fan, you see your favorites, including Optimus Prime, Megatron and lots of Autobots and Decepticons in great battles. There is a scene just as the end credits start but there is not one at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and intense sequences of sci-fi action, language and some innuendo-not exactly sure what that last one means-and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-did I mention that I'm not a big fan?-but it would be a good rental.",Transformers - The Last Knight
39,alindsay-al,An awful film that will hopefully kill this franchise for the time being,2,26 June 2017,"Over the years we have seen these transformers films be churned out and I've gotta be honest as they have gone on, I have decided that I am fed up of this franchise because this film is pretty awful. The premise of this film sees optimus prime gone from earth which sees transformers hunted down on earth. With a force coming to earth it sees a group of humans and transformers having to work to try to survive. Mark wahlberg is the lead in this film and he is a really talented actor but in this film he foes phone in this performance. He just doesn't seem to care about this film or role so he just does everything in a bland way and I didn't care about him in this film which wasn't completely his fault which I will get into later. The supporting cast is pretty poor, but I will get into my favourite performance because of how ridiculous it is by Anthony Hopkins. He is clearly having a lot of fun with his performance even though it won't be a performance he will look back on fondly. The rest of the cast are so ridiculously bad, whether it is the love interest or the teenage girl with an attitude or the comedy relief friend they all annoyed me in this film. Josh Duhamel from the first three films and I really believe he was underutilized in this film and it really annoys me as I really feel like there was potential there. The story doesn't really exist, There is so much going on in this film that doesn't matter that this film is just a jumbled mess with an excuse for a big action scene at it just like the last film which is a truly poor effort. The script has some of the worst dialogue I had ever seen in a film, especially when it tries to use humour. There is so much horrible humour in this film that it makes all these characters horrible to watch. The style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes in this film especially when the transformers are actually in this film which isn't that much. But this film has some of the weirdest aspect ratio ever been in a film, it changes constantly throughout the film and it actually becomes really jarring she watching the film. Also this film for some ridiculous reason is 2 hours 30 mins which is absurd when you consider all the garbage in this film. Overall this is a complete waste of time and not worth a watch and hopefully we won't have another of these films for a long, long time.",Transformers - The Last Knight
40,iquine,Why is this so long?,3,10 September 2018,"(Flash Review)Clocking it at a huge 2:34min, I feel Michael Bay had trouble managing a cohesive story line over that duration. One of which of Optimus Prime meeting his maker, Quintessas, and is chosen to save his home planet of Cybertron, which is currently in ruin. He is duped by Quintessas to believe the only way to save Cybertron is to smash Cybertron into Earth. Duped despite all his history on Earth and with humans....? In the meantime Megatron is searching for a powerful staff or talisman or something. Anyway, you guessed it, Mark Walberg, his trusty Autobots and a tough orphaned girl attempt to save the world. Will they find the talisman and save the world...again? In 2:34 I'd hope so. Being Michael Bay, there is an abundance of action and the screen is frequently littered with debris and explosions YET zero tension or emotional involvement. Portions of the film strangely attempt to link Transformers to major either events throughout history. And why did Anthony Hopkins take part in this? Feels a bit low-brow for him. Overall, this is exactly what you'd expect from the franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight
41,pixrox1,"I used to visit Detroit, MI, all the time . . .",8,28 June 2017,". . . which is why I can recognize so many of the Roman Ruins featured in TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT. This entire flick is steeped in Roman traditions, much more so than Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE series. Probably since the inception of these toys, the insurgent minds at the Hasbro Concern have presented the Autobots as the Free Thinkers of this World, and the aptly-named Decepticons as the Priests of Mind Control, Hell-bent upon stalking Our Mother Earth as Wolves in Sheep's clothing, cajoling, seducing, and generally intimidating the Masses into a Fascist System of Thought Control, burning any Disbelievers of their Creed for Heartless Tyranny in great conflagrations of Hellfire. After being exposed for the diabolical frauds they are by such vehicles as the recent ""Best Picture"" Oscar winners SPOTLIGHT (which revealed the Roman Decepticons to in Truth be a swampy cesspool of Perverts and Sexual Predators), the Romans have fallen upon Hard Times. That is why director Michael Bay ventured into the Heart of Roman Decay--Detroit--to film a major scene in the dilapidated remnant of what was once a Roman Cathedral. (For World Citizens unfamiliar with Detroit's History, a gang of Roman thugs began systematically murdering members of the Black Resistance on 12th Street in 1967; when the Truth behind the Algiers Motel ""Incident"" emerged, more than a million Roman Detroiters fled the city in fear of Just Retribution, abandoning their Homes, Businesses, and Holy Places such as the TRANSFORMERS Cathedral, during their hasty flight.)",Transformers - The Last Knight

46,adamjohns-42575,At least Michael Caine admitted that he only made Jaws 4 to buy a new house!,1,2 May 2021,"This film is a farce, full of people that will obviously do anything for money. I was so surprised to see actors that I would have otherwise respected taking part in such a terrible film and not surprised in the slightest to see others who I have no respect for that I know will do anything for money. When did Anthony Hopkins sell his soul? Did they really need Dora The Explorer in this one?There are too many characters all trying to get involved in the one storyline and they seem to have got stuck on the idea that the transformers should be evicted from Earth, without any real plan as to how to deliver that. They've also killed and resurrected Prime and Meg so often that they cannot possibly make it believable anymore.(Spoiler Alert) At the end of 'Star Wars' (1977) the goodies win the day and the wounded are restored to again, but Darth Vader is left to fly away in his Tie Fighter so that we know he can come back. This is a classic formula that works, stop trying to go against it. They didn't kill Megatron in every episode of the original Transformers cartoon series, why are they doing it here.The ""Street"" characters and comic relief elements have taken over and it's really just an excuse to blow things up with terrible jokes. They must sit at the storyboard meeting and ask where they can add the explosions and not give a rats ass about the actual plot.It's supposed to be a film about cool cars that have sentience and help to keep the Decepticons at bay with a group of human sidekicks that keep getting in trouble. Stop faffing around with All Sparks, Matrices and Staff's!!The ending gives the impression that there is a continuation of this story, but I hope to any God that will listen that they forget that this was made and reboot the whole franchise.I want to see more Bumblebee, more Optimus Prime and more Megatron. Stop introducing random gimmicky characters that are destroyed two minutes later, just so you can drive a nice car for a couple of miles.A film of pure indulgence for those that created it.

The Transformers have less screen time than ever before, especially Optimus Prime. The plot is more confusing than ever and completely ignores everything the last one set-up. The attempts at humour are just awful, only a few jokes are actually funny. It's way too long and the military have no reason to be in it.

It is literally the same movie, remade over and over again. The fact they are still making money off of these films make me worry about the future of mankind. It is recycled CGI on a screen over and over again with little to no-plot and cookie-cutter dialogue. I learned my lesson after the second Transformer's movie and stopped watching them in theaters. After this one, I might just have to stop watching them all together. The smartest thing they can do right now is reboot it and take it away from Bay.",Transformers - The Last Knight
49,rgkarim,Transformers: Action In Disguise,6,21 June 2017,"LIKES:Animation/Ending: DreamWorks animation studios still has their finger on the pulse of animation. Once more their studio proves they can make the fiction world come to life in stunning realism, filling the 2.5 hours with fluid motion, breathtaking special effects, and dynamic sequences. Bay's fixation on the special effects continues to shine through in the pyrotechnic, CGI laden visuals that fill the silver screen. This is great for the last 45 minutes, where the high speed, action packed climax comes to life, infusing adrenaline into the theater and getting things ramped up. Nice work again guys!Funny: From the get go, Bay's writing team has set out to bring laughs amidst the acting (which is about the only thing he is good at bringing). Good news, the 2.5 hours brings plenty of laughs to the mix. Bantering is certainly the mainstay of the film, but Transformers 5 has a few other bouts of whit, cleverness, and fun to add to the mix. I found myself laughing at a number of insults to the ridiculousness of the film, and some well-timed quips from a few of the robots and special guest actor Anthony Hopkins. Speaking of whichActor/Actress: I agree with my fellow reviewers that Anthony Hopkins stole the show in this film. His charming delivery mixes well with the vigor that an old historian of the transformers would certainly hold. Hopkins delivers his lines in that elegant poise he's famous for and creates a wonderful character to alleviate from the other humans that inhabit this film. Certainly, guys like Wahlberg, Duhamel, and newcomer Isabella Moner do a fine job, but they don't hold a candle to the majesty of this seasoned actor. Nice pick casting director. In addition, the new leading lady Laura Haddock is a fantastic addition as well. Trading characters that are purely sex appeal, for beautiful, respectable, and powerful woman is an A+ in my book. Haddock has poise much like her other English counterpart, and blew me away at how much I liked the character. She was a beautiful addition in more ways than one. Nice work guys. DISLIKES:Human focus: For a movie titled after giant robots, you would think there would be more focus on them. Bay once again chose to forego his expensive artificial crafted creations for his real- life actors. I just ask why? Transformers has always had human components, but not as the main focus. In the Last Knight though, it's all about the human backstories in this film, and trying to wedge them into the story to keep you engaged. Not the smartest movie, and the amidst the story, the attempt at all these new characters with backstories just didn't work. Jam packed story: Remember the last Transformers movie and the eight plots it had? Yeah, it gives me shudders too. Unfortunately, the storyboard writers didn't listen to the last set of reviews, because Last Knight once again is jam packed with multiple stories all trying to wedge their way to the front. The result is another rushed, sloppy mess that fails to put an engaging story into the midst. Part treasure hunt, part emerging threat, part character testing for Optimus on top of all the character issues floating around, was just too much to grasp. And the unifying factor tying all of them together was pretty weak again. Certainly, the Transformers have never been strong stories, but they have been better and less of a stretch than this mess. Such a deconstructed plot was not entertaining and left little to ground the action too outside of the finale. Action deficits: It's an action movie and as a result you would like to see a chunk of the 2.5 hours filled with the special effects they were so focused on. Once more this movie fails. After a decent opening sequence (amidst a hasty opening), the film starts to hit the brakes on the action department. In an attempt to story build, they extend to drawn out explanations and more comedic banter that wasn't necessary. Had the story been worth it, I would have given them props, but nope, just added fluff that wasn't that engaging to me. Certainly, there were some fast driving scenes and a quick history of fighting, but these were short lived. Not cool guys. Unbalanced Robots: Ever since the second film, Transformers movie have been awful about utilizing all of their creations. Optimus and Bumblebee take the lead again, and the rest of the Autobus have their moments to ""shine."" Hound, Hotrod, and Squirt get a few gimmicks here, but others like the dingbats and Drift are barely needed having little lines or involvement in the movie. And the Decepticons, after a major introduction were even more pathetic at being underutilized. If you're going to go to depths to recruit cars and voice actors, do something with them! The VERDICT:Transformers the Last Knight showed promised from the trailers as returning to the action roots we loved. Too bad it didn't deliver to the level the first production did years ago. While animation and acting were bullseyes, the rest of the movie is a disproportioned mess with too much going on. A weak story focusing on humans going on an extensive search and find didn't do much for engaging plot, and the inability to focus on a plot made it even worse. Throw in a lack of action and underutilizing of all the other robots and more points get derailed. While this certainly isn't the last installment, Transformers needs some repairs to bring it back to the light. Outside of the special effects, this movie isn't necessarily one for the big screen.

50,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Thankfully the last entry from Michael Bay,5,6 December 2020,"Ten years ago from the release of this entry, Transformers (2007) was never considered a deep film nor did it gain all around glowing reviews. Yet it made an impact on audiences and people loved it. Its visuals were eye popping, the action was gigantic and the music was fun. Sure, characters were a bit exaggerated and seen as annoyances, but there was some likability to them. Five entries later and it looks like mainstream audiences still enjoyed that familiar formula. People still came out to see it, despite this being the lowest earning entry in the series and that should mean something. Perhaps viewers want a little more in their robotic action romps? It's truly unfortunate when the only redeemable aspects to a film are it's visual and audible components.Picking up some time after the events of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), where Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) left Earth to find the autobots' creator(s), Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and the rest have been hiding from government authorities. Kind of strange considering like in every film, they've saved the planet from being taken over. Nevertheless, Prime returns to his home planet and is captured by his creator Quintessa (Gemma Chan). Her plan is turning Prime against his allies in search of an old artifact given from the autobots to the humans during medieval times. Surprisingly the one writer not involved with this sequel was Ehren Kruger, who was credited in the last three films and felt more like a burden than contributor.This time, the script was penned by Ken Nolan (Black Hawk Down (2001)), Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (Iron Man (2008), Punisher: War Zone (2008)). Unfortunately, these changes did not improve on the story. The only thing the story properly gets correct is referencing the events from prior films, while occasionally using characters from those films. This is not enough though to prove itself to be a cohesive narrative. The fact that each entry has had to somehow retroactively fix the history of the autobots and how they played a part in the Earth's history is moronic. This kind of lunacy doesn't permit even continuity and makes characters feel far less unique. While the run time to this feature is much shorter than the last film, the delivery of the story is just a slog. Nobody seems to remember how many times Bumblebee's real voice has been heard.Anthony Hopkins plays Sir Edmond Burton with Cogman (Jim Carter), a robot (transformer?) butler who does nothing but provide exposition dumps. It is a complete phone-in from Hopkins. Speaking of phone-ins, Peter Cullen does the same for Optimus Prime. Laura Haddock plays Vivian Wembley who also has a past she isn't aware of. Want to guess how she interacts with Cade Yeager? Everything is forced. Even new characters like Izabella (Isabela Merced) and her robot (transformer?) sqweeks (Reno Wilson) get sidelined further in the story. There's just too much to handle for this sequel. Actors like Josh Duhamel, Jerrod Carmichael and John Turturro try, but they're forgettable because of all that's going on. Voice actors Frank Welker, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Omar Sy, John DiMaggio and Jess Harnell also deserve better for their characters' development wise.From a visual standpoint, this is the one element to this franchise that maintains its consistency. The CGI special effects blend well with the physical backgrounds and the attention to detail on the robotic characters are as good as they've always been. While the cinematography has changed throughout the series, that too has remained competent. This time, the director of photography was Jonathan Sela, who also worked on Max Payne (2008), Law Abiding Citizen (2009) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Lastly, the music composed by Steve Jablonsky who has worked on the franchise since the beginning has remained true to his form. Also with producing the most music for this film, those who enjoy the music will have plenty of tracks to listen to.The technical fundamentals of this final film in the franchise have been as solid as they have ever been. The problem is, it does not make a movie by itself. The screenplay, while written by different people, does nothing to close plot holes, maintain continuity or make any of the characters interesting. Most performances are either boring or underutilized. It's sad because so much better could have come from it.",Transformers - The Last Knight
51,rannynm,"Captivating, hyper-realistic imagery. See it in IMAX!",9,30 June 2017,"This latest installment is part of the action packed Transformers series that I love because of the captivating work of the transformers' team. Seeing it in IMAX is even more mind-blowing. As well as the great cinematography, this film has hyper-realistic imagery that makes it ten times better. This film has many great things in it, but a big problem I have with it is that it has too many things happening. By that, I mean there are new characters, lots of transformers, lots of different story lines and multiple things happening at the saime time. These are all great, but there is a limit to how many things can be in a movie. This film isn't quite over the top, but close. Some of the new characters include Izabella (Isabela Moner), a young girl who is interested in transformers and quite skilled with machinery, Vivian (Laura Haddock) an teacher from England who has a large role in saving the world. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is also in this film as a returning character. He was in the fourth movie, Age of Extinction.This film has an interesting storyline and is fun and cool. An interesting name twist occurs when a main character, Optimus Prime becomes Nemisis Prime when he is evil. Nemesis Prime is the leader of the auto-bots, a good group of transformers. The strategy of turning a good guy bad is a great strategy to attract viewers of the film. This movie does a cool, sneak-peek into history. It talks about medieval times and the knights of the round table. That is a primary plot which explains why this movie is called The Last Knight. It is cool to incorporate history into the film as it adds a little extra something to it. For example, in the first film, there is a cool kind of conspiracy part which I won't describe because it would be a spoiler. It is well acted and well executed with beautiful special effects and nearly non-stop action. You don't really have a chance to reflect on what or why this crazy and confusing story bounces around from one country to another, landing deep in the ocean and then suddenly reappearing at Stonehenge, England. Even though it's hard to know who is shooting at whom or for what reason, somehow it's still enjoyable to watch and even gripping at times. Overall, this is a great film. It is cool, fun and has a lot to it, even if it may be a little too much. I recommend this film for ages 9 to 18. There are some adult jokes and violence, but they are not too bad. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Nathaniel B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Transformers - The Last Knight
52,Rob_Taylor,Transformers: Lame-Ass Money Grab in Disguise...,2,17 September 2017,"However, it is only a very thin disguise.No attempt has been made in this movie to give it even the flimsiest of coherent story lines. Knights, Nazis and some serious butchery of the Transformers nature all combine to make a movie that is nothing more than noise and light.Of course, no one really expects there to be much of a story. The Transformers movies have always been about Michael Bay's over-indulgence of his own fantasies rather than making a decent movie. Action is the best you can expect from these, but here, there isn't even the feeblest of pretences of trying to make anything more.Bay's trademarks of mindless action, combined with the truly bizarre (and downright borderline racist) ethnicity foisted on the Transformers combine to make a thoroughly disagreeable viewing experience. Remember when George Lucas was roundly (and rightly) condemned for Jar Jar Binks thinly veiled Uncle Tom routine? Yet somehow Bay gets away with almost the same sort of crap with every Transformers movie.You can't really expect much of a supposed grown man who names his favourite camera the ""Bayhem"", I suppose.More so than the previous franchise movies, this one tries for a considerable amount of comic levity. However (I'm using that word a lot here) the humour is extremely forced and lame and falls flat most of the time. It is as if the only exposure to comedy that the writer had was watching Three stooges re-runs and listening to the playground jokes of small, immature, children. There are a LOT of Transformer pratfalls, racially suspect humour and sexual innuendo that leave you in no doubt that Bay is involved.Perhaps most insulting, though, is the attempt about an hour or so in to convince the viewer that the Transformers have been on Earth throughout human history since the times of King Arthur. It is a lamentable choice that seems as shoehorned in as it sounds. A feeble pretext that serves as an excuse for more Bay action nonsense that is never referenced at all before in the franchise. Bay retconning his own nonsense.All in all, the movie is an exercise in endurance that never rewards its viewer's time investment. It is beyond shallow, with a tonal dissonance that makes you constantly frown at what you are seeing. It paints a scene of the world at peril that it constantly undermines with its clownish buffoonery. In short, it is all over the place.Speaking of all over the place...Mark Wahlberg here looks almost as befuddled as he did in The Happening. Since it seems that this franchise is the highlight of his career, you can't blame him for continuing to do these movies.As for what Anthony Hopkins is doing in this turkey, I have no idea. I hope he was recompensed adequately for his time. Perhaps Bay hoped his presence would add a measure of gravitas to the film. If so, then Bay sure went out of his way to ruin that with everything else.SUMMARY: Complete nonsense. A story that Looney Tunes wouldn't even entertain. Humour straight from Bay's inner eight-year old. Essentially Michael Bay discovering his ""excess"" knob went up to 11. A big pile of nothing that is embarrassing to watch.

Now, I'm no fan of these films, nor do I like them that much, but comparing this & the last instalment to the previous 3 if not previous 2, you see a difference! The films are badly edited, badly filmed & way too long! Age of Extinction was crap! It was long, dreary & just bad with annoying characters & dialogue! It sucked & to be honest, I wasn't so surprise when I heard this one was coming out either, though I do hope it's the last if not the 2nd or 3rd then we can finally be done with this franchise!The films plot was confusing, I couldn't understand parts of it & I only had a weak idea through 3 plot segments which I pieced together roughly, but still didn't have a solid idea! The films run time also didn't help this, & in fact, is another thing I want to rant about, 149 minutes is too long , which OK of a film of it's type can be & should be expected, but by Christ Micheal Bay or whoever edits this crap needs to know when enough is enough! Cut the shite! I mean it's not hard! And to be honest it'll keep the audience into the film & at least remembering what the plot was in the first place if an hour of useless crap was cut making the film 1 hour & 40 minutes! It keeps it up beat, short & far more watchable, not to mention less of a drag which is what this film did making it seem longer!The other annoying things I didn't like was the political errors & snide digs towards people for being different, not to mention sense- mental scenes which weren't needed or threw the about! It was a mess & a lot of scenes were all over the place & very erratic! It was hard to keep track of the films which was in on itself, like a train I was having a hard time keeping up with! You thought you got something, then it went off & you didn't get it again!The film was action packed but just didn't seem good! It's probably because I'm not a fan, but I at least have to see this film once so I know I can say I've seen it & if it was as bad as it's said! It was & to be honest, the good reviews on here are clearly Micheal Bay fans kissing his arse or paid reviewers, or saddos who actual like this crap & think we negative reviewers as the bad ones, were not & you people are the trolls here!

55,moviexclusive,"The absolute worst of the 'Transformers' franchise, this fifth - and hopefully last - entry by Michael Bay lacks even the thrill of his signature action bombast",4,23 June 2017,"Michael Bay had said that 'The Last Knight' would be his last 'Transformers' movie. We'd thought at first that he would go out on a hurrah; after all, despite their barrage of criticism, the last two entries 'Age of Extinction' and 'Dark of the Moon' had each managed to clear US$1billion at the global box office. We'd thought too that the writers room, comprising such notable Hollywood screenwriters as 'Iron Man' scribes Art Marcum and Matt Halloway, 'Black Hawk Down' scribe Ken Nolan and even 'A Beautiful Mind' scribe Akiva Goldsman, would have ensured a more compelling story, a hope that was further boosted by the intriguing twist of Autobots leader Optimus Prime going rogue. Alas, this fifth instalment is even worse than all its predecessors: the plot is even more incoherent, the dialogue is even more grating, and the action is almost thrill-less.It starts off as a King Arthur/ Lancelot ripoff, going back to the Dark Ages when the fate of Britain was hanging in the balance. A hopelessly sloshed Merlin (Stanley Tucci) approaches an alien spacecraft to beg for help to save his country, and receives in return a magical staff as well as a fire-breathing metal dragon. There is no secret King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table end up winning the war, but even better, they are joined around the Table by twelve guardians who swear to protect the staff. Fast-forward to 1,600 years later and things have apparently only gotten worse on Earth despite the Autobots' victory at the end of 'Extinction': humans have gotten even more jaded of the robots, establishing a new paramilitary force dubbed the TRF to keep them in check; Prime remains MIA in deep space, leaving his fellow Autobots Bumblebee, Hound (John Goodman) and Drift (Ken Watanabe) in limbo; Mark Wahlberg's scruffy reluctant hero Cade Yeager is on the run from the authorities for harbouring the Autobots, forced to spend his days at a junk yard apart from his daughter; and there is no seeming end in sight to the robots who keep raining down from the sky to threaten Earth's peace.It will end as an Independence Day ripoff, fuelled by maniacal villainess Quintessa (voiced by Gemma Chan) who brainwashes Prime into helping her retrieve Merlin's staff to revive their once- majestic planet Cybertron. Cade, along with a skeptical British historian Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock) and a loose alliance comprising of TRF and US Army forces led by returning character Colonel William Lennox (Josh Duhamel), will eventually have to fly up 21,000 feet into the sky, evade Decepticons disguised as fighter jets, and destroy the chamber where Quintessa is using the power of the staff to drain Earth's core. Everything else in between is just filler – including a somewhat supercilious English lord Sir Edmond Burton (Anthony Hopkins) who dutifully helps Cade and Vivian unpack the Arthurian/ Transformers legend, a precocious 14-year-old orphan Izabella (Isabella Moner) who insists on tagging along with Cade, and the new Transformers additions of a smart-talking C3PO-ripoff butler Cogman (Jim Carter), a French-accented bot Hot Rod (Omar Sy) capable of freezing time as well as a cute but ugly BB8- ripoff Sqweeks that Izabella puts into service.Whatever promise that Prime turning against his Autobots might have suggested turns out to be little more than a gimmick – not only is Prime missing for about three-quarters of the movie, his confrontation with Cade, Lennox and eventually Bumblebee lasts for ten minutes at most. That leaves the rest of the story a largely crude recycled assembly: some parts adapted from 'The Da Vinci Code', some parts from 'Terminator' and even one part from straight out of a World War II movie. The banter, frenetic as ever, is shockingly devoid of humour. Besides a scene where Edmond chides Cogman for adding unnecessary dramatic emphasis to his narration of the revisionist Merlin legend, the back-and-forth between the characters is leaden and even exasperating, with often no other purpose than to fill out whatever silence is left between the clanging of metal and the overbearing Steve Jablonsky score. If there is any consolation, it is that Wahlberg proves a more engaging leading man than Shia LaBeouf ever was and that Hopkins adds dignity that none of the other chapters ever had.But perhaps the most disappointing element of 'The Last Knight' is its action, which is terrible by Bay's standards. You could argue that the sequences in 'Age of Extinction' were somewhat protracted, but they had at least proper rhythm and pacing. Here, except for the finale, Bay never seems to finish what he starts. The prologue with Arthur's army besieged by enemy forces never gets a rousing end; the confrontation between Cade and the TRF at a no-go zone in Chicago ends prematurely when Lennox shows up; a surprise attack by the Decepticons on Cade's hideout stops abruptly with the former's retreat; the TRF's pursuit of Cade, Vivian and Sir Edmond unfolds in stops and starts and never builds into anything engaging; and last but not least, a showdown between an Autobot submarine and one of the US navy's ships concludes with two warning shots. Even the climax lacks scale, scope and impact that should be expected of no less than global annihilation, reduced to aerial shootouts and a lot of weightless spinning.If the last four critically derided 'Transformers' stood for anything, it was for Bay-hem – in other words, Bay's signature bombastic, overblown action complete with slo-mo shots and plenty of explosions – and the fact that 'The Last Knight' cannot pass muster on that account makes it an unmitigated failure. Like we said at the start, we'd thought Bay would go out on a bang. This isn't just a whimper unfortunately; it's an unmitigated disaster that leaves us hoping that it will indeed be the final, the end, the last ever 'Transformers' movie we'd have to endure.",Transformers - The Last Knight
56,nancyldraper,The best (so far) of a flawed franchise,7,31 December 2018,"This version of Transformers I call, ""go big or go home"". Composite cast (some new, some original and some of the last cast (with significant star power in Anthony Hopkins, too bad they dumbed down his gravitas). Human stories as well as transformer stories. Family theme enlarged to children (human and bot). They keep expanding their myth, this time pulling in Arthurian legend. Better story, best cast, but way too long and too many plots. This was the best one so far, in my opinion (but the bar was set really low - but it keeps making money).

59,arungeorge13,"Stop, just stop! [+27%]",3,29 June 2017,"Time to draw curtains on this franchise asap!Michael Bay's fetish for explosions and state-of-the art imagery over characters and content continues to remain a curse in the fifth instalment in the Transformers series. This film mostly feels like its trying to pick up bits and pieces from various other films. Here's a list of films 'Transformers: The Last Knight' heavily reminds you of (*spoiler warning*):a) King Arthur – both the old and new one; contains umpteen references to the Knights of the Round Table, Excalibur, the wizard Merlin and so on.b) Batman v Superman – the setpiece where Nemesis Prime (Optimus, who are you kidding?) hears Bumblebee speak after ages and this all of a sudden frees him from the dominating hold of the evil Quintessa, much like the 'Martha' scene in Batman v Superman.c) Wonder Woman – Laura Haddock who plays Vivian is told to be the last descendant of the wizard Merlin and has a scene where she runs and floats (like literally) around quite a bit to get hold of the staff which is seemingly destroying the Earth (apparently melding it with Cybertron). There's even a too-similar-looking shot of Haddock holding her ground with the staff of Merlin just as Gadot does with her 'Godkiller' sword in WW.d) Avengers: Age of Ultron – The entire climax setpiece feels like a rip-off of the climax setpiece from the Joss Whedon flick.e) Independence Day (Resurgence) – Add this to the above mentioned point.f) Edge of Tomorrow – Some of the action choreography and motion styles of the Decepticons and Infernocons appear tremendously inclined towards the Tom Cruise film.g) The Mummy / National Treasure – Scenes involving a tomb and ancient relics supposedly located in a sunken spaceship. Following clues and making discoveries a.la these two films.h) Harry Potter series – The Witwiccan mansion where Sir Burton (played by Hopkins) resides looks a lot like Hogwarts.i) Suicide Squad – The villainess Quintessa is much like Enchantress seeking revenge against mankind.(Some of Bay's own films like 13 Hours) The list goes on, the sense of déjà vu is conspicuous. Even if you disregard all that I mentioned above, the film is still an overstuffed mess, with poorly written characters, unclear motives and blaring sound design (it's like listening to dub-step for a hundred and fifty minutes straight; sure to induce headaches!). Not to mention the rendering in 3D which only adds to the woes. CGI is indeed remarkable but Bay seems poised not to let the viewer slide past even a single frame without flashing fiery particles or colliding vehicles or exploding bots. The break-neck editing style complements Bay's vision perfectly (and I don't mean to say this in good intention). Mark Wahlberg (who plays Auto-bot enthusiast and trustee Cade Yeager), Laura Haddock and Anthony Hopkins put in lukewarm efforts ensuring fat pay-checks and nothing more. Optimus' role is a mere extended cameo and he keeps reinstating the fact that he is 'Optimus Prime' (as if he himself isn't sure!). Josh Duhamel returns to play Lennox (like it's an obligation!), period. There's no Tyrese and Turturro's role is more like a cameo. Even an impressive array of writers (including the likes of Akiva Goldsman and Ken Nolan!) can't seem to save this franchise from apparent doom. Hasbro, please don't let Bay conjure up more insipid Transformers films simply for the sake of keeping the blockbuster franchise alive and nipping people off their intelligence, time and hard-earned money. You will forget all about the film the moment you exit the cinema hall. In case you didn't, let's talk about it!",Transformers - The Last Knight
60,Terryfan,The Last Knight is the last draw for me as a long time fan of the Transformers.,1,21 June 2017,"I went to a special screening last night for Transformers The Last Knight. Now I got a free poster for the movie but this is without a shadow of a doubt the worse movie I have seen all year.Now I am a huge fan of the Transformers since I was a kid but this movie is a disgrace to not only fans of The Transformers but for movies in general.It just goes to show why some people shouldn't give up their day jobs and everyone in the movie clearly did it just to get a paycheck if it was me I would donate the paycheck to charity so some good would come out of this abomination. The Story is such a mess that you would be at the point where you didn't care what is going on.The characters in the movie are so unlikable they are some of the worse I have ever seen in Transformers and in movies in general the movie just really show case why you shouldn't give a blockbuster like this to people who don't know what they are doing.The ""Acting"" and I use the term loosely is beyond awful and Terrible if there were another word for it I would use it. Again you can see the case was mostly trying to collect a pay check because they didn't care about Transformers or the fans they did whatever they wanted to so it feels like they were acting like selfish brats in the movie.The music is a bore and should have been given to someone who loves to tell a story with their music. The comedy is beyond bad it feels forced and don't make sense at all and don't serve any point to have in the movie. The only thing worth while is the effects because the Transformers designs.Transformers The Last Knight is without question of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is nothing but a slap in the face to every actor,actress and crew who take pride in their jobs and I won't buy the movie when it comes to DVD.I have seen a lot of bad movies but Transformers The Last Knight out does them all.I give Transformers The Last Knight an 1 out of 10",Transformers - The Last Knight

62,Screen_Blitz,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a loud, bombastic mess intoxicated on noisy metal-on-metal action, but empty in coherency",3,30 September 2017,"Continuing Michael Bay's journey through loud, mindless metal-on- metal action monstrosity is the fifth installment of the financially successful Transformers franchise, a series that has brought out both the best and worst of Bay. The movie, rumored to be Bay's last stint with the series, is charged with just about everything you would expect from a follow-up on the franchise: loud, extended sequences of heavy special-effects action, brain-dead dialogue, and Bay's signature style of bombast clouding over development of characters and plot. The difference? It is more inane than ever. This film shows the director reaching the breaking point where a long haul of bombastic robot vs. robot action has grown soul- crushingly dull and the franchise has long run empty on even remotely fresh ideas. It is a sad misfortune that only renders its overlong 154-minute runtime exhausting before it even reaches it halfway point. So what is the story here? Roughly the same as before. Planet Cybertron has left in ruins, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) is imprisoned, and the autobots and decepticons are still at war that threatens to ravage mankind. It is up to the now- fugitive Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg) to band together with Bumblebee in a battle to defeat the decepticons before they wipe out the human race as we know it. Joining him in battle is 14-year old street girl Izabella (played by Isabella Moner) and Oxford University professor Vivian Wembley (played by Laura Haddock) hired by Sir Edmund Burton (played by Anthony Hopkins) as they set out to find a mysterious artifact from the Medieval times that is capable to bringing an end to ongoing war between the autobots and the decepticons.Bloated, messy, and lacking in coherency, this fifth installment scores for a solid demonstration why showering in an endless mound of explosions and grand-scale destruction simply isn't enough to compensate for such a sloppy mess of a script. For a film dedicating its lengthy runtime to giant robotic monsters clashing head-to-head in a noisy frolic, it feels awfully dull. But the question is: who's the blame for the severe shortage of fun that ensues. Would it be the lack of charisma from both the actors and the autobots, or Michael Bay's extravagant style of action triumphing over the plot that barely makes a lick of sense? Putting the blame on both would not unreasonable. After all, they both make up a vast portion of what this big-budget bomb represents. Sure, a few of the action scenes showing the giant robots clashing in heavy metal-crunching frenzy as debris splashes on the ground are fun to sit through, but quickly grow exhausting after awhile. The story following the ongoing war between the autobots and decepticons has grown increasingly dull, and the premise showcasing the robots involvement in the age of King Arthur barely adds any steam to the already convoluted plot. As for the cast, it most certainly doesn't help that everyone is left adrift with dialogue that shows how desperate Michael Bay is to make us laugh. It's all just one unfunny one-liner after another. If there is any moment of laughter, one may give that credit to a scene of Mark Wahlberg yelling and scolding at the minibots. Everything else is just an eye-rolling attempt at comedy, ones that make racy innuendos from the previous films sound funny. Even worse, what is Anthony Hopkins doing here? With such laughable dialogue he is given, it is hard to believe why he would commit to this role other than to land a paycheck. If you are looking for actors giving grounded performances, you most certainly are not gonna those here. Transformers: The Last Knight is a loud, bombastic science-fiction fiasco that finds itself drowning in a sea of mindlessness and shows Michael Bay slogging to an all-time low. The film is a sour excuse of a summer blockbuster to shows the franchise is long past its retirement point. Unfortunately, the end implies evidence that there is still more coming. One can only hope that the next entry isn't just more of the same. But how can revive a franchise that has gone empty on ideas?",Transformers - The Last Knight
63,Troy_Campbell,"Better than expected, but still deeply flawed.",6,23 June 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight Released: 22 Jun 17 Rated: M Runtime: 149 mins Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first: the plot is crap and full of holes; the characters are so clichéd they may as well walk around with signs around their necks ('plucky teen', 'stoic hero', 'crazy old Englishman', etc); and, shock horror, it goes for way too long. Now that the usual, and most definitely deserving, Transformers gripes are out of the way, how does The Last Knight stack up against other instalments in the franchise? And, more importantly, as a big, loud and dumb blockbuster in general? The good news is that it's a big improvement from the series low of Age of Extinction. The bad news is that it's still stuffed from head to toe with the sort of rapid fire editing and shaky-cam movements that have increased in direct proportion to the speed at which these movies are released. The set pieces are a mixed bag; the opening Bumblebee-centric sequence is exhilarating and inventive, while an abandoned Midwestern town showdown is lots of fun, but the finale is a tedious, save-the-world CGI mess that encapsulates the major issue plaguing big-budget blockbusters today. Yet for all the Michael Bay-isms that are still very much on display, this latest entry feels somewhat fresher and more lightweight than previous sequels. Juvenile humour has always been a staple of this series, but here it works more often than not. A Suicide Squad-esque villain intro montage is enjoyable, Stanley Tucci's cameo as a stonkered Merlin is hilarious and Mark Whalberg's culture clash repartee with spirited Brit Laura Haddock is consistently amusing. It won't garner any new fans nor turn the tide of the critical onslaught, but the fifth Transformers is a minor course correct for the franchise thanks to some invigorating set pieces and well-delivered humour.",Transformers - The Last Knight
64,kz917-1,At this point you either like these movies or you don't.,6,16 November 2017,Either you are a Transformers fan or you are not. I found the dialogue to be witty and banter filled with pop culture references and inside jokes. I appreciate that and enjoyed it immensely! My one big problem with both this film and the last one in the Transformers franchise was that they were both almost three hours long. Really...really?! I watched this particular movie in two sittings due in part to the length alone.,Transformers - The Last Knight
65,one9eighty,"WOW! Either this film is dumb, or I'm dumb for not getting it!",3,12 March 2018,"Wow!I read the other reviews after watching the film to see if anybody shared my thoughts about what I had just watched and wow. I can't believe anybody would give this 10/10, but likewise I don't think this warranted a 1/10 either. It looks like this film has created a complete rift and generated such diverse reaction that it was difficult knowing what to read. Instead I gave up and hope that my own review will give a more neutral reaction rather than the extremists that have written things before more. Ok, so this is the 5th film in the series, I can't say I particularly love any of them, for me the pinnacle of success would have been the 80's animated film. If I were forced however, I'd probably suggest the 3rd film and the downfall of Chicago as one that stands out for me. This 5th film however, has to be my absolute least favourite of the 5 films. Don't get me wrong, I have seen worse films, but I have also seen better films which were just average. The thing that stands out for me was that there was no cohesion, what you saw one minute, didn't necessarily tell a story or mean anything by the time you had blinked. It was like a merge of lots of small ideas, all pushed together into a film. For that reason the script, the plot, the continuality, the pace - everything felt off. It was like watching something happen under blinking laser lights at a rave, every time there was illumination something had changed. It actually made me feel sick and very old at times trying to keep up with things. Just when I thought I'd seen a continuality mistake I had to remind myself that there was probably about 20 mins worth of action cut out that would have made the error make sense. For example, people's clothes changing, or people not having to hand what they did a few seconds ago (guns/amulets, etc), even as far as transformers being in robot form one minute then without warning, sight or sound they'd be in their vehicular form when the camera panned back around. It felt like all the punctuation was removed and this was just a screen dump of an idea cloud from the writers table committed to screen.As mentioned, the plot wasn't great (understatement); it felt like a retold story when the franchise isn't that old really. I suspect the writers basically got drunk and looked through their DVD collection deciding that ""we should include something like that bit in X (film) where X does X"". It honestly felt tired but also like a bastardisation of other films (Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Suicide Squad, King Arthur, Wall-E, Iron Giant, Game of Thrones, The Rock, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, X-Men... I could go on!) . The lack of plot made any script pointless, whatever script there was spent too much time focusing on the nothing moments rather than driving the film forward. I was shocked at how low Anthony Hopkins and Mark Wahlberg must have sunk to be in this film, I thought they had more about them - I suspect the reward was the pay packet because this film isn't going to win them any performance based awards. By the end of the film I didn't care about anybody anyway so they might as well have cast nobodies and killed them all off for all I cared!
I feel as though I'm just writing about negatives at the moment, so perhaps I should discuss some of the positives.Visually the film was good looking; the CGI was top notch to the point that you could make out expressions on the transformers faces. This is in contrast to the first film which felt as though it was more difficult to make things out clearly.
It was nice to see (well, hear them anyway) some of the iconic voices from Transformers in the film (Peter Cullen and Frank Walker).What else can I say about positives - well, you didn't need to think much... there were a lot of explosions... err... it was a long film so you don't need to plan for anything else in an evening... I'm honestly struggling. I can see why people have quit the franchise after this. As promised, this is not a 1/10, nor a 10/10. For my ratings it's a 3 out of 10, and that's being really generous.

66,rockman182,Transformers: The Last Knight (2017),4,13 September 2017,"Where do I even begin? Michael Bay once again returns with this loud, overproduced, overlong, over-plotted summer blockbuster. There was a time where I did enjoy the series. It was always dumb but the first two films were highly enjoyable. Even Dark of the Moon had its fun moments. That's where the films should have retired. The fact that we had a haul of the characters and got the giant mess that was Age of Extinction was bad enough as it is, but now we've got an equally bad, no wait, actually worse film to talk about.The plot is the same old. Humans and transformers at odds for the millionth time. Optimus Prime stumbles home to Cybertron where he meets Quintessa,  a being who controls him and makes him attack autobots. There is also a terrible tie in with history as King Arthur and Merlin are both tied in to the story of ancient wars of the Transformers. Some members of the original three films returned, the rest were wise to stay away from this.The film is once again clunky, mindless and loud. I was able to enjoy the first few films even with all the overbearing action because there was a fun element to the plot and the characters and also because the plots made sense. Now things are so garbled, there are way too many robots (more than you can ever care for), the humor falls completely flat, and the action literally bores you to death. As always the fight scenes are of epic nature and mostly look nice but I think we've all collectively had enough.These films are still way too long. Its ridiculous how they try to tie these Transformers into other events of the world. Michael Bay has done some decent stuff back in the day but he's lost the plot carrying on this nonsense. Thankfully this is the final Michael Bay film in the franchise. However, on the other hand this series is unfortunately not dead yet because they've got a Bumblebee spin-off and more possible films coming.  Kill it with fire!4/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
67,RforFilm,"Transformers: The Last Knight is the same, explosion-filled cinematic junk food from before. Autobots; I'm done",3,21 June 2017,"Transformers; more then meets the eye. TransformersughI'm honestly really light on what to say. We've gotten to the fifth Transformers film in the franchise that is not well received by critics but it keeps making money. I'm already gonna say that it feels like I got the fifth retelling of the first movie. I'll be honest, I still enjoy the original Transformers as it was dumb, but I had fun with it. The rest (especially the last one Age of Extinction) were just the same story with a different slap of paint on it. It seems to get a lot of people into the theater, so there is something that they likebut not me.Aside from the typical style that Michael Bay is known for, all of these movies feel like their made by committee over at Paramount. They must have a check-off list of all the elements that a general audience would like such as cool actors, hot actresses, an acclaimed actor, the military, American flags, and as much product placement as possible to pay for it all. Add a bunch of alien robots and you get something that's nothing more then cinematic junk food. Transformers: The Last Knight is more of the same, lets talk about it. We open in the Dark ages where we find out that Transformers originally helped out King Arthur and had given Merlin the Wizard (played by Stanley Tucci) his staff that gave him his magic powers. Cut to present day where the world governments have now outlawed any Transformers, whether autobot or decepticon, with a military task force, the T.R.F., run by Colonel William Lennox (played by Josh Duhamel). It seems that despite the governments telling the people that the robots are evil, inventor Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg) is keeping some of the autobots safe while Optimus Prime is still looking for Cybertron.Not only does Optimus find Cybertron in ruins, but a sorceress Transformer Queintessa, who wants to take the planet Earth and make it the new home, brainwashes him into going after the autobots. Meanwhile, Cade, Professor Viviane Wembly (played by Laura Haddock) are taken to England where they are introduced to Sir Edmund Burton (played by Anthony Hopkins). Here they learn that history has covered up the fact that the Transformers have helped out for years and to stop Cybertron from destroying Earth, they need to find Merlin's staff. The humans and the autobots like Bumblebee, Hound, and Cogman team up to find this power and stop the great danger.It all sounds like a mess and stuff we've already seenand it is. Two things I will say is that it is shorter then the last movie (its about two hours and ten minutes) and I did get a laugh every now and then. Aside from that, Transformers: The Last Knight has the same ADD tone where we have almost no time to slow down from the explosion-filled action scene to the next. These are exhausting movies and I simply find them boring.A lot of it has to do with Michael Bay, who can make good movies like The Rock and Pain & Gain, and the choices he makes. I noticed that about ninety percent of the shots are hand-held and the majority of action shots have so much clutter, that it's hard to tell what's going on half the time. This makes it another reason why I would not recommend watching these movies in 3D. The tone is all over the place with scenes of massive death that segway to the robots making a bad joke or cursing. While the acting is alright, the humans are not what the people come for. They're here for the Transformers, and they are still the same cutout personalities that they've been from day one. Why should I support these characters if they never learn anything? Just what are these stories about anyway? I'm just done with these movies as I know people are smarter then this and deserve better. It's clear that if this makes another billion dollars, Transformers 6, 7, 8 and so one will be the same movie. I'll give this three destroyed Transformer toys out of ten. If you enjoy this sort of thing or simply want to enjoy some action scenes, I guess you'll be fine with this. It's just that I really want to see something new here and Transformers has made it clear that their going to keep doing the same thing. Autobots; I'm done.",Transformers - The Last Knight
68,bankofmarquis,Because...TRANSFORMERS!,6,30 June 2017,"I've realized why most critics are not enamored of the TRANSFORMERS films.  They are watching them all wrong.  They try to watch these things and work real hard to understand the plot, motivation and underlying emotion of the characters on the screen.  This is a big mistake.  These films are spectacles of sight and sound, to be seen on the large screen in Dolby Atmos (or whatever ear-drum blowing sound system there is), marveling at the special effects, colors, CGI and EXPLOSIONS.When watching these films, I let the plot and characters wash over and past me like water in a river and when something is really baffling and makes no sense, I utter one phrase to myself...Because...TRANSFORMERS!Case in point, the latest creation in this series by good ol' Michael Bay - TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT.Why does the film start with King Arthur and Merlin (played by Stanley Tucci of all people)...?Because...TRANSFORMERS!How can Mark Wahlberg (the hero in the previous Transformers film) be able to phone his daughter and the phone cannot be traced if he doesn't speak...?Because...TRANSFORMERS!Why is Wahlberg THE LAST KNIGHT?Because...TRANSFORMERS!But, if Wahlberg is THE LAST KNIGHT, then why is it that the Megan Fox fill-in for this film, Laura Haddock, is the only one that can wield the sword (or whatever it is) that will lead our ragtag group of heroes to victory?Because...TRANSFORMERS!Why is Sir Anthony Hopkins frail, grandfatherly figure character suddenly in the middle of the action and then pulls out a pea-shooter gun out of his walking cane and shoots it (for no apparent reason) at the Transformers?Because...TRANSFORMERS!Why is Josh Duhamel in this film?I can actually answer that one - because he was in all the other ones and...because...TRANSFORMERS!You get the idea.I have only scratched the surface of the number of times I had to say to myself this phrase during the course of this 2 1/2 hour film.To be fair, once I totally gave up on understanding - or caring - about any semblance of character or plot and just sat back and took in the spectacle of CGI Battles that were unfolding in front of me, I actually had a pretty good time at this film.  Give Bay credit, he knows how to do these kind of over-the-top battle/action films (remember Armageddon?).  They're fun, colorful, loud and busy, busy, busy.Just don't expect the writers or actors to win Academy Awards.Letter Grade:  B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)P.S.:  I will now go seek out an ""uber-nerd"" who really knows and understands the intricacies of the plots of this series (who is this guy, why is that guy an enemy of this guy, I thought Optimus Prime was a good guy...) to see if I can make any sense of the plots of this series...wish me luck.",Transformers - The Last Knight
69,rbrb,The worst movie I have seen in the last 50 years +,1,23 June 2017,After less than 1 hour I and my companion walked out of this film. The movie is a total mess and something to do with metal machines (transformers) taking over the world or being prevented from doing so. It looks like a third rate cartoon and seems to be aimed at 2 year old children with learning problems. Goodness knows what the story is about as it is totally all over the place and gives the impression it is being made up as it goes along with some odd and unfunny special effects added in....

70,fernandoschiavi,"Transformers series is like an injection of adrenaline, in which the body quickly assimilates something totally synthetic without passing through brain consciousness",5,26 May 2020,"Despite a restart with several caveats in ""Age of Extinction"", obviously the box office corresponded and a new sequence was sent. ""The Last Knight"" once again brings Michael Bay in the direction, who directed the previous films, being his last work in the saga as a director. The feature was written by Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan. Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci reprise their characters from the previous film. It is difficult to reinvent yourself in a franchise that, in truth, wants to do everything exactly the same. At least that is how the films that have been released have been, not by chance all directed by Michael Bay. Visual filmmaker by nature, Bay loves the giganticness of special effects amid beautiful landscapes, always to the detriment of more in-depth scripts.In this fifth part of the series, humans are at war with the Transformers, who need to hide as far as possible. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is one of his protectors, leading a resistance core located in a junkyard. It is there that he meets Izabella (Isabela Moner), a 14-year-old girl who fights to protect a defective little robot. At the same time, Optimus Prime travels the universe towards Cybertron, his home planet, in order to understand why it was destroyed. Only, on Earth, Megatron is preparing for a new return, once again willing to make the Decepticons the new sovereigns of the planet.the greatest attraction of this new Transformers - perhaps the only one! - It's just the director's new toy: the IMAX cameras. At the opening of the feature film, it is possible to notice the difference, thanks to the detail and visual beauty of a pitched battle located in the times of King Arthur, 1600 years ago. A beautiful business card that, unfortunately, does not hold up for long. The story of going back in time and talking about the transformers that inhabited the Earth is commendable, even more if we consider that Cybertron is millions of years old, so there is no doubt that the creatures there had already passed through here in previous times. However, if on the one hand there are successes in recreating the past, the more reinforced footprint in the joke and some inconsistencies may not help much to make this link.The new chapter of the saga misses when trying to introduce many new characters. First, we have the arrival of young Izabella, who comes to make a link with the teen audience. It happens, however, that she participates in shallow dialogues and has a very weak presence in the plot. The character Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) has more to add to this mess, but it is a waste for the actor's career to propose to get into this mess. Basically, the character acts as a guiding thread of the story, which needs to be restructured little by little with so much news. To complete the main team, we have the beautiful Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock), who is here to be the damsel in distress. The script ends up creating some of the most backward and sexist situations by turning Laura Haddock's historian into a true parody by surrounding her with macho comments and a core where the biggest concern of the ladies around her is finding her a boyfriend. And when the script really tries to offer a strong female character, it delivers the young Izabella, who sins because she is a forced, exaggerated character and who always seems to try to show herself as superior to her male companions. A completely hypocritical decision in the text, in addition to the fact that Bay's leadership is blatantly sexist and exploits the bodies of both.In the midst of this tangle of subplots, it draws attention as the script presents, forgets and discards characters with impressive speed. Transformers lives off situations that border on the surreal, like a sequence of treasure hunts in the worst Dan Brown style, in a search full of clues and forced dialogues about the whereabouts of the wizard's staff and the relationship between history and Transformers. The feature makes, through these several multinational narratives, that time is felt, that the two hours and 30 minutes seem like a lot. Not even the old excuse of frantic action justifies all this splint time. The fact is that if there is a tangle of cuts per second, as a whole ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is a film without a filter, where all the information follows on the screen in a misaligned way and without any concision. Even franchise veterans rescued from limbo, such as Josh Duhamel and John Turturro, have a minimal screen time and could even be eliminated relatively easily. The film seems to be a jumble of information and images that sometimes manage to associate themselves to really create a narrative, or a cinematographically worthy sequence. Honestly, there shouldn't be a single scene with a static camera for more than a minute. Dinobots, Autobots and Decepticons appear and disappear at the same speed as sudden scene cuts, and you barely have time to memorize their names before they disappear amid the chaotic action of the feature.
The duration of almost three hours seems justified when we take into account the amount of things to be explained, but the time seems to count against, not in favor - it seemed almost three years in the cinema. The film drags on much more than it should and ends up being quite confused when trying to present so many conflicts at the same time. Michael Bay, who directs his fifth film in the franchise, applies his drastic cuts and inserts explosions here and there, in the way we already know and that made him known among the industry. The driving style makes the story tiring and extremely long, although it also produces fights of epic proportions and exuberant scenarios. The jokes are forced and the characters are many, but not very memorable, since most of them are being introduced to us for the first time and do not have enough screen time to captivate us. Even the protagonists are shallow, generic and stereotyped - although in theory it has time to develop them, the film prefers to show destruction and ready-made jokes rather than delving into their personal motivations and personalities.Always very safe in his direction, Bay returns to command explosive action scenes and of an impressive scale, and even his greatest critics have to cheer on this: he simply knows how to run a show, and several passages are remarkable for his scale and care in art direction, especially when offering human features to the villain Quintessa. We also don't have battles as excessive or confusing as in the previous films, yielding good moments like the fight between Optimus and Bumblebee, but it's just a breath of breath between the most grandiloquent sequences, which sin by exaggeration and megalomania in the endless final act, which even involves the ability to freeze time for one of the characters and which still loses its way by betting on numerous parallel actions and different players lost in the middle of the action.""Transformers: The Last Knight"" slowly creeps into its final half towards an obvious outcome, no matter how aesthetically it benefits from the IMAX footage. It is in the technical aspects that are the few qualities of this feature film, which urgently points out the need for some jolting in the franchise. Whether Bay is finally leaving or with a possible reboot, something needs to be done so that Transformers can at least regain the interest of its target audience. Because, those who turn their nose at the formula used, have long since abandoned it. Transformers is like an injection of adrenaline, in which the body quickly assimilates something totally synthetic without passing through brain consciousness. If, just in case, a look comes out of the trance of stimulating images, the film still opens the door to distraction via an easy humor based on comic strips, or even the sensualization of its female character embodying the sexy intellectual. In fact, it is difficult to understand why Transformers is still so successful, it is better to believe that, in fact, it is hypnosis.",Transformers - The Last Knight

74,Snootz,Someone reign in Michael Bay,5,16 September 2017,"I came here hesitating to rate this movie only 5 stars, but was gratified to see the average was 5.2. Seems like there are more people of demanding taste than I expected. Two thumbs up to the audience.This flick started out being an ""interesting"" movie. I thought, hey, maybe for once Michael Bay learned from critical reviews of the past movies and decided to pay more attention to plot and acting. Unfortunately it seems they have no leash on this guy.Pros: incredible CGI, good acting (if one likes standard cliché Michael Bay military characters), and an interesting story line-- to begin with.Cons: Everything else. A story line and plot that falls apart, jumping the shark that jumped the shark, conceptual stupidity , and total loss of any believable elements.Yes, I know some may say ""This is Transformers and you want believable?"" Agreed, accepted, valid argument etc. But YES, for any movie to be acceptable it has to have a degree of believablility. Yet despite past reviews and failures once again Bay loses all sense of common sense in his seemingly endless quest for bigger and more dramatic explosions. Throw physics totally out the window, drop everything we know of gravity, and absolutely, above all, completely ignore how far the human body can fall or how hard it can be hit by solid metal without sustaining significant damage.This is a movie that will appeal to adrenaline junkies, people age 10 or less (if they're adrenaline junkies), and those who don't care about plot elements as long as there's lots of ridiculous action all the time. For people with any degree of discriminating taste-- leave that hanging at the door. You won't be needing it here.Yes, I sat through the entire 2 1/2 hours, finding myself somewhat questioning that decision about an hour in, seriously questioning continued watching half an hour later, and questioning my sanity at the 2-hour point for allowing myself to get sucked into yet another Michael Bay hyperactive CGI mashup. According to the ratings on this monster (and I use that word accurately) a lot of other people feel the same. Anyone who rated this 10 stars... seriously? To everyone who had the integrity to rate this thing accurately-- the current 5.2 average is one IMDb rating that hit the nail on the head.",Transformers - The Last Knight

76,Carycomic,"Not bad! Although, the franchise might be starting to get a little derivative.",7,23 June 2017,"I just got back from seeing this tonight. And, I had a good time watching it...for the most part. Basically, the plot is this. Transformers have been coming to Earth since long before Sam Witwicky's great-grandfather found that giant robot in the Arctic. Since the time of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, to be exact! And the descendants of Merlin the Wizard, himself, have been entrusted with a staff coveted by Autobots and Decepticons alike.Enter Quintessa; basically the robotic equivalent of sorceress Morgana LeFay. She brainwashes Optimus Prime into bringing planet Cybertron to Earth...so they can pull a Galactus!Re-enter Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg); inventor-turned- farmer- turned Robin Hood. Only he doesn't steal from the rich to give to the poor. Instead, he rescues fugitive Autobots from the anti-robotic bounty hunters called TRF (which I'm guessing stands for Transformer Resistance Force). Anyway, he's given this medallion by a dying Jedi- like Transformer and gets taken to England where he meets Vivian (a blue-eyed version of Megan Fox played by relative newcomer Laura Haddock).After that, things become action-packed if mish-mashed.Don't get me wrong! I _loved_ the action sequences!! But, the globe- trotting and the mixture of STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES-type stuff got so dizzying, it kind of nullified all attempts at occasional comedy relief. Which, by the way, came mostly from Anthony Hopkins rather than Jerrod Carmichael (the Eddie Murphy ""wanna-be"" playing Cade's second-in- command at the South Dakota junkyard). In short; this is a pleasant time-killer. But, after the completion of this second trilogy (circa 2020), I don't think there'll be anymore entries in this film series. And even then, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg are going to have to do an awful lot of talent searching to find someone who can sound more sinister than Orson Welles (voice of the original Unicron)!",Transformers - The Last Knight

The Last Knight is a gigantic mess of mythology building, and bizarre arc creation. Character's tend to be left without much to do and only return when their needed to push the story beats. Transformers hasn't been a critical darling and the fans have only been there to support Bay's action scenes, which are still incredible. This looks to have killed the current franchise, and that's a shame. The biggest issue was Michael Bay and his reluctance to hand the franchise over. Not a good film, with only the action packed finale to recommend it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

If yes, then ignore the critics and enjoy yourself. what can i say from a Michael bay transformers his story has an actual story line and he gets the best story of the lot and good acting from his cast with Anthony Hopkins he gets an actual good story to tell Michael bay is given his lead actors and reamigining of the Arthur and the knights of the round tables with the transformers been involved so we kinda gets another king Arthur of the summer and also ww2 story in there two this film is 2hrs25mins long and a closing credit sequence just in case the make another like the rumored bumblebee spin off Anthony Hopkins character has been guarding a secret so the decepticions his character shows a bit of comic timing don't get the it hands on a so we see mark whalberg back as cade Yeager minding his robots at a junk yard the film takes place in parts in Chicago mostly in London and Africa. its a nice welcome from America getting hit to spread it out as a globally war Autobots and Decepticons are at war, with humans on the sidelines. we see Merlin his mystical power but he comes good as Arthur in medieval times losing the battles but we see the dragon from the artifact that Merlin's has been given so its lost to time and nobody knows where the artifact as mega tron is on the lookout for it as as we see barricade give cade a special item as we as we see the josh duhamels character is group take down the transformers comes to alliance with cade as they find his group in the out of bounds part of Chicago but strange things hap-ping to optimums we see the army helping mega tron find cade follow him to a little town as as they give chase and battles the other auto bots as well as drones so cog man get cade o his plane to England to help his search as the police give chase to him in London as wheels brings the professor and Edmond Burton to explain his mythology and secrets he keeping but all these stories make sense as there is 12 robots guarding a secret as we see the the group get to a submarine this sequence is impressive underwater to a ship of importance that leads to an all out assault in Stonehenge with everyone gathering the support the flying sequence the action are top notch with cybertron here on earth like the way they tried in transformers 3 this time they succeed please Michael bay come back when you have another story there police chases through London submarine chases as well this film has everything Optimus Prime is gone to search for his maker he comes across the dead cybertron and quintessa is going to play her cards right and get the artifact. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Unlike the first three films where Sam was always ""The Chosen One"" and his girlfriend's job was to just run in slow motion yelling ""SAAAAAM!"". The main group of Decepticons were actually given personalities and unique identities. Though completely under- utilized. They make a big deal of giving them Suicide Squad-like introductions and their screen time amounts to maybe 45 seconds each . I was actually surprised how much screen time Anthony Hopkins had. I figured he'd slum it for two or three scenes, of exposition, grab his paycheck then disappear.But he's actually a prominent character and he seemed to have a lot of fun in the role. this film has a budget of 217 million wow it really shows being the last film despite the bad review here i gave it 10 out of 10 i hope they make more here is the list of transformers Peter Cullen ...

There were a lot of stuff I actually liked in this film but would've only worked if they were 2 or 3 different films. There are a bunch of names in the credits as editors but it seems like they just gave chance to anyone that came into the editing room to edit. The last time I was disappointed with editing was Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice theatre cut, but that looked great compared to this abominable editing. I am one of the few who likes both the first and second Transformers films and while the aspect ratio change made the action sequences in the second film look epic here they are just doing it randomly anywhere they want to do it. Nothing makes any sense. The plot is such a mess that there are no plot holes instead there is plot in hole. Any humour they tried to put in between serious situation felt retarded in here.

81,Antagonisten,A jumbled mess,4,3 October 2017,"I have sort of enjoyed all the previous installments in the Transformers saga. I'll admit it's part nostalgia for me, but it has also been a nice set of Blockbuster-movies with great special effects, big robots and good action scenes.I would say the movies have been getting progressively worse throughout the series, I'll also admit that the addition of Mark Wahlberg didn't really help my opinion. But there has been a certain floor as to how crappy the comic relief has been, how jumbled the story was allowed to become, how much suspension of disbelief they allowed when it came to physics and worldly constraints (still allowing of course for the fact that it's a SF-movie).In this movie though, screen-writing and continuity has been thrown out the window. The story is completely disjointed with no proper time- line and no real coherence. There are some decent concepts and a few funny characters, it's not a boring movie as such although it's at least 30 minutes too long. Without giving any spoilers, all these movies have felt a bit like they are repeating themselves, and this is no exception. I hope that this is the final installment to be honest, this movie series has survived itself.",Transformers - The Last Knight
82,CANpatbuck3664,Transformers: The Last Knight is Ludicrously Plotted and Sometimes Painfully Unfunny but It's Still Not the Worst Transformers Movie,4,1 July 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Transformers: The Last Knight begins surprisingly enough in the Dark Ages (aprox. 5th century) where Arthur and his knights are battling the Saxons. The fight is looking grim as Arthur's men are badly outnumbered but Arthur tells them to keep the faith as Merlin (Stanley Tucci) is looking for help. Merlin stumbles upon a cave that looks like a crashed alien ship. He pleads for help, begging the Autobots for a solution to save Arthur's men. They give him staff which gives him control of a mechanized 3 headed dragon. They use this dragon to win the battle and we then flash forward to the future.A lot of the positive reviews for this movie have claimed that by this point in this series, you know what you're getting into seeing a Transformers movie in a theatre. I get that point of view and trust me, I knew what I was getting into when I went with a friend to see this at the local theatre. But you still have to try to judge a movie without making excuses for its flaws. This is by far the most crazy and nonsensical plot this franchise has ever put up on the big screen. According to The Last Knight, Transformers have been fighting in human conflicts for centuries including both World Wars. Really? Yet everyone was so surprised when they showed up in the first movie. If that was the case, why? I don't think any cover-up would be that good. Another note on that, if the Autobots have been so crucial to the journey we've taken throughout history, why the hell would we form the TFA and try to exterminate all Transformers whether they're Autobots or Decipticons? Some of these beings are heroes but since they cause lots of damage fighting for our survival, screw them? These are just some of the many questions I had watching this. How did Bumblebee gain the ability to break apart and beat up multiple enemies and reform? Why didn't he use that ability before? How are there baby Dinobots? Aren't they thousands of years old as a species? Why does Hound smoke metal cigars? Where do they come from? I could go on and on but the point is this movie is just plain ridiculous and even limbos under the low bar I have for story in this franchise.One of the things that the Shia LaBouef entries in this series had over the Mark Wahlberg ones is that they had some characterization that made thing relatively interesting. Being relatively the same age as Sam Witwicky, I could identify with his teenage awkwardness and his bond with Optimus and Bumblebee helping him get through it was something you could empathize with. I don't hate Cade Yeagar (Mark Wahlberg) but he's not the most interesting protagonist. This movie furthers his development but you don't really like him anymore, he's even really rude to his love interest Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock). Vivian is very much a blank slate with few interesting traits even though Laura is trying her best. They bring back some of the previous characters that really don't have a reason to be there; Agent Smith (John Turturro) was completely useless. Another small bone I have to pick with characterization is that Megatron is able to negotiate some Decepticons out of prison and they all get Suicide Squad style cut scenes (except done way worse). They are in the movie for maybe 5 minutes until they are killed. Why would they tease something like that? Transformers relies on big CGI action (which is fine) to propel the plot but like any modern blockbuster, there is always an attempt to deliver some laughs along with these set pieces. Much like Age of Extinction, this movie is devoid of funny jokes. Most of the time you could have heard crickets chirping in my theatre and the jokes are really aimed at the lowest common denominator. I maybe got 3 or 4 chuckles and they almost exclusively came from Sir Edmund Burton or Cogman.Most movies I review, I like to pick out the performances I like and didn't like. I'm not going to do this here because most of the actors/actresses were made to look bad here but I don't think this was their fault. What could they do with this material? I will say that Anthony Hopkins' performance as Sir Edmund Burton upped my enjoyment of the movie. He's given terrible dialogue but he seems to be having such a good time that I couldn't help but enjoy his acting. I also want to give credit to Isabela Moner who was pretty good as kid actors go. Her dialogue is also crap but she really looked like she was giving it her all.The action in this movie has its moments and I will still give credit to Bay and the studio because the CGI work is top notch. There were some cool bits and the action was easier to decipher in this entry. I also will concede that while the movie is too long, I was interested to see where it would go. One of Age of Extinction's big problems is it was pretty boring for long stretches. The Last Knight wasn't boring, I'll give it that. I would still award the distinction of the worst Transformers movie to Revenge of the Fallen but this isn't far behind. This franchise needs to re-invent itself quickly or as the box office receipts show, it could be put out to pasture.

I heard the director, Michael bay, is bored, there is no story, or there is too much story, it's convoluted, it's too long. whatever. I didn't find this movie to be any of these things. I enjoyed it. I thought it was exciting, fun and I did not think it was too long. and I have to say it made just as much sense as the star war movies, or any other of franchise films. and it's fascinating what they can do with computer images. the audience certainly enjoyed it. go. enjoy. peace.",Transformers - The Last Knight
84,trinaboice,Special effects over substance,7,23 June 2017,"Movie Title: Transformers: The Last KnightGrade: CRating: PG-13In a Nutshell: Michael Bay says this is his last Transformers movie. Even fans hope that's true. This Transformers blockbuster franchise seems to have fizzled, disappointing movie-goers with a weak story and paper-thin characters. Having spent 260 million dollars on the film, Director Michael Bay seems to have chosen special effects over substance. If you have kids who love the auto-bot franchise, they'll still be entertained.Uplifting theme: ""Without sacrifice, there can be no victory."" – – Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) ""Funny what you can do when what depends on you is all you have."" – Izabella (Isabela Moner) ""We all want to believe we can be heroes in our own lives."" – Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock) ""Magic does exist."" – Sir Edmund BurtonThings I liked: Anthony Hopkins is always great. I loved his beautiful British home in the film. There's also a lovely British cathedral that gets painfully destroyed by Transformers destruction. You get to visit Stonehenge...sort of. He wanted to set off an explosion at the real site, but was denied, so he had to create a set that looks like the real thing. Seeing it was on my Bucket List and I finally visited the site a couple of years ago. Very cool!I appreciated some of the slow-motion scenes. One of my complaints from the previous films in the Transformers franchise was that the action sequences were so fast and jumbled that it was difficult to actually see what was happening. I thought ""Canopy"" was a cool Transformers that I would liked to have seen longer. I love Stanley Tucci in anything. I almost didn't recognize him as Merlin. TONS of action sequences and you get to see a lot of your past favorite transformers, as well as some interesting new ones. Mark Wahlberg works pretty doggone hard in this flick. Laura Haddock is the newest beauty to save the world, but with a higher IQ than her gorgeous predecessors.Things I didn't like: The very first scene features England in the Dark Ages when some knights were fighting. The CGI fire looks totally fake and so I worried that the whole film would have terrible special effects. It definitely got better. By the way, King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) looks like Josh Groban. The legendary Merlin the Magician is a drunkard, intended for comic relief, but the jokes fall flat. I definitely appreciate humor in movies, but most of it doesn't land in this one. The jokes fly pretty fast, but land with a thud. If you're hoping to see Optimist Prime, you'll be disappointed with his little screen time. I'm sure Michael Bay thought that a new twist to spruce up this installment of the franchise would be to throw a bunch of foul-mouthed kids in it. Nope. They were all super annoying. Like the other Transformers movies, it's often difficult to understand what everyone says because of their garbled voices or due to all of the background noise. It drove me nuts that Izabella had carefully placed strands of hair down her face in every scene. I just wanted to comb it back sometimes. It seemed super manipulative. Girl power! Um...like every other movie lately. The aspect ratios kept switching around, which was super distracting. The movie contradicts itself constantly. For example, we're supposed to believe the world is in chaos, yet Vivian has time to play polo in an idyllic British field before teaching children in a museum. Product placement that features Mark Walhberg drinking a Bud Light, just like in the last Transformers' installment. Some of the edits are too fast and choppy. The little leprechaun robot is a C3PO rip-off. Even one of the transformers points it out.Funny lines: ""You get back in your hole and think about what you did."" – Cade Yeager ""Love that guy. Goosebumps every time."" – Transformer with a Cockney accent (What's his name?) ""So, is this a kidnapping situation or her first transformer experience?"" – Cade ""A mojito needs ice. Ice! We are not animals!"" – Agent Simmons (John Turturro) Tips for parents: Lots and LOTS of destruction and fighting. There is a lot of profanityin fact, a surprising amount of it. What makes it even worse is that it comes out of the mouths of children and even Sir Anthony Hopkins, both equally disappointing.@trinaboice",Transformers - The Last Knight
85,dilipbts,Transformers: The last knight,9,8 August 2020,"I have been seeing so much hate on this movie and decided to just put out my own personal opinion. I won't be spoiling the story, don't worry.This film, compared the others, is quite different. Watching this didn't but also did feel like a Bay movie. Your usual explosions and cheesy humor. But this, this wasn't different in a BAD way. This one actually had a GOOD story. Nothing being spoiled, again, but it isn't a bad one like in the past. The robots actually transform and get a ton more screen time, coupled with a lot of action. The jokes actually got a laugh out of me and the audience as well, unless it's just that we have an odd sense of humor. They cut down on screen time, although it does feel a little long, and I do feel some scenes could have been cut, but that's okay. Although I'll admit the movie is a bit too fast paced for me, it was good, and fun to see. Robot action eye candy as usual.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I dunno, but this one is definitely even worse than Extinction was, and I couldn't stand that premise...To give you an idea how poorly done this outing was, they spent more time trying to deliver snarky funny lines, than actually plotting a story to hold onto...Yup, this is definitely the worst Transformers movie...it has no ties at all with previous entries, and I can't even use 'choppy' to describe it.

92,funtasticfour,Why have I seen all these movies?,5,1 April 2018,"I've never been a big fan of transformers. I was a bit too old to play with them, though I did admire them from a distance. I thought making a movie with them was a dumb idea, and also impossible. I was mistaken, as the first movie was quite good and surpassed my expectations! But that magic was never recaptured in the following movies. Part 2 and 3 dragged on too long, and were very forgettable. Part 4 is my second favourite as it felt like a new beginning, but still was nothing special. This movie is bloated and chaotic. They are all too long, and try too hard to be too many things. There may have been a laugh or too in here, but Anthony Hopkins didn't fit. The effects are always fun to watch, as the vehicles scenes impress and look pretty good when they transform. But closer to the end it gets too crazy with CG taking over every inch of the screen. These movies make a lot of money, and I can see they cost a lot. I'm sure I'd enjoy them a lot more if I were still a kid or young teen, but as far as these Hasbro movies go, I enjoyed GI Joe, Ninja Turtles and even Battleship more than most of this series.",Transformers - The Last Knight
93,maxglen,The Worst Edited Film I've Ever Seen,3,21 August 2020,"This film is a failure in practically all aspects. Honestly, I have no idea how a film with this high of a budget can be as incompetent as it is. Editing. Editing is basically everything when shipping your film out to audiences, it can mean the difference between a good film and a great one. But this... I don't want to sound dramatic but The Last Knight has around 4 aspect ratios and I'm not exaggerating when I say it switches between them at least every other shot. It's headache inducing. This wouldn't be too unforgivable if they let a shot go on for longer than 3 seconds but I swear there are so many cuts, one movement or action has about 5 cuts each, it's ridiculous. When it comes to story this film is essentially the polar opposite to the previous four. Transformers is usually beaten on for having extremely surface level, unambitious stories whereas The Last Knight has FAR too much going on, I'm not even going to try and touch on all the things it tries and fails to do. The dialogue is the worst in the franchise (Yes... worse than RotF) with some truly cringe worthy humour and attempts at making characters likeable which in turn does the complete opposite. Every character in this film is abysmal. Also, they brought back a bunch of the original cast just to have them do either virtually nothing or something literally anyone else can do, really felt like they were just trying to pander to fans of the original. The film also manages to have a villain even more useless and boring than the Fallen which is bewildering and speaking of villains, Megatron basically isn't even Megatron, he's a complete lackey and a betrayal of the character they had built up over the franchise. The world building is pointless and ridiculous, literally none of it works which would be bad enough if they weren't shoving it in your face at every opportunity, which they do. The film also introduces the interesting concept of an Evil Optimus in the form of Nemesis Prime, but don't get too excited because he has one scene and then he's back to being Optimus again. And Unicron? Probably the coolest Transformer ever, originally voiced by freakin' Orson Welles?! This film manages to make him not cool. How do you mess up a giant Transformer that eats planets?! this is Galactus from Rise of the Silver Surfer all over again. Finally, the action which had been the saving grace in some of the weaker entries, is tosh. It's really boring. But even if it had the action of John Wick it wouldn't save it from being practically unbearable to sit through in one sitting, I actually had to take breaks. 3/10 Just... I got nothing.",Transformers - The Last Knight
94,p-jonsson,Much less crappy than I expected it to be.,8,11 November 2017,"Not surprisingly I expected this, the fifth installment, of the Transformers franchise to be pretty much crap. Especially after the abysmal fourth installment. To my great surprise I found it to be much less crappy than I expected.I honestly do not understand why so many people seems to think this is one of the worst movies ever. The critics sure, especially the ones at Rotten Tomatoes, but I do not really care about those self proclaimed ""critics"". Ordinary viewers is another matter.I mean, this is a transformers movie and it is directed by Michael Bay. That pretty much defines the movie from the start so what the heck did all those people complaining actually expect? That Michael Bay should suddenly care about things like script and stuff or anything else except big robots, special effects and explosions? Personally I quite enjoyed this movie. Well, enjoyed in the context of watching a Transformers movie that is. I enjoyed the special effects, the robots, even the lousy jokes.I did enjoy the tie in to the Pendragon myth and I thought the somewhat bizarre Sir Edmund Burton and his even more bizarre robot butler was great fun.I laughed outright when I saw the World War 1 tank transformer. I was expecting the submarine transformer to actually transform though.Maybe all those detractors of this movie are missing the bimbo with two and a half brain cells (yes I am being generous now) that used to be the lead female character in the Transformers movies but personally I quite liked that the leads in this movie was much more mature and actually showed some evidence of intelligence.The story? Well, for a Transformers movie it is quite good. In any other context it would be somewhat...lacking. It did screw quite a bit with the Transformers timeline established in the first movies though. Oh, and for some nitpicking, the maximum operating altitude of those airplanes they used is 21 000 feet, not 12 000 feet.Bottom line, I had great fun when watching this movie. With my low, and I mean LOW, initial expectations I was very pleasantly surprised. It is definitely a huge improvement over the fourth instalment.",Transformers - The Last Knight
95,EthanBJones_03,"Fool me once; shame on me. Fool me twice; shame on you, Fool me thrice; this is getting old Bay. Fool me FOUR TIME; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH",1,27 June 2017,"* Please note I'm not rating this movie a 1/10 purely out of spite or to be a troll, I sincerely believe this movie is utter trash and shouldn't be seen by anyone.'TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT' was directed by Michael Bay and stars Mark Walhberg, Laura Hadock and Anthony Hopkins. ​Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Now, it's up to the unlikely alliance of inventor Cade Yeager, Bumblebee, an English lord and an Oxford professor to save the world.(Just so you know, I had to google the plot of the movie because screw me if I could figure it out)It's really sad that, completely accidentally, the last film I watched before this was 'The Rock'. That movie was Bay's last great movie and probably one of the better action movies of the 90s. That is all thanks to the stellar acting, characters and DIRECTION. Bay can direct good movies so it baffles me how he's gone down this rabbit hole of explosion porn and creepy, perverted female sex objects. I don't believe a director is completely lost and I never will; the old Bay is in there somewhere and he will resurface. But today is not that day. The Last Knight is an abomination on all counts, and I don't say that lightly. In every movie I review, I try to find a flaw in a masterpiece and a strength in gutter trash just to show nothing is flawless or completely lost but I genuinely struggle to do so with this movie. Perhaps the visual effects were nice to look at but that isn't really a strength when they've been done infinitely better. I wont ramble on much longer and will try to focus on some aspects of the film.Let's discuss the story for starters(if there even is one). I had to google the story for this movie because I couldn't understand it. No that is not me being stupid either, everyone I watched this with didn't understand it. I didn't miss a single thing and gave it my full attention at all point but I just couldn't get the film. If it's fan service, fine. But I still expect for people like me to understand the plot. Top that fact of with the fact that there is more exposition in this movie than there are minutes of screen time and you have a nonsensical script that was clearly finished in a weekend by... idiots. Don't want to sound overly harsh but if you think the story for this movie passes as quality entertainment, you need to watch A LOT more films.Enough of the story, how about the acting. Well, Mark 'What? No!' Walhberg was very poor in this movie but I don't blame him. It's mainly down to the script and I think he could tell the movie was gonna fail so he didn't even bother. Laura Hadock was pretty weak as Vivian and I don't understand her purpose to the story. She's there but makes no logical sense. She had no arc and her undying love for Marky Mark(that's not a spoiler; if you didn't think that'd happen by the time you first lay eyes on her you don't watch enough movies) makes no sense. How did Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest villains and performances of all time, get dragged down to this level. I'm sorry Anthony but you don't need the money thus this is inexcusable. None of the characters, old or new, are likable. And who in God's name is Lennox? Was he a character in the other movies? Is he THAT forgettable?Aside from the semi-competent visuals, this movie is also technically flawed. The editing is abysmal and the cinematography as a whole is very weak. Set and costume design is irrelevant. The action is horrendous, the comedy is abysmal, the visuals just barely squeak by. I only saw this movie because it was free and I do not wish that burden upon anyone else. Please, let this movie die. It doesn't deserve the billion it'll probably make. I'll begrudgingly rate it 1 'DRAMATIC MUSICs' out of 10, and that is only because I don't deal with half values.",Transformers - The Last Knight
96,Mike_Devine,Bay has finally out-Bayed himself,2,24 June 2018,"As if four bloated, big-budget Bay-helmed movies were not enough for the 'Transformers' franchise, we were treated to a fifth entry in 2017's 'Transformers: The Last Knight.' In what can only be described as a strange mash-up of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table with everyone's favorite sci-fi bots, we see what happens when Earth is under a sustained attack by the hostile transformers (I guess the Decepticons?) and when Optimus Prime is not a friendly.There really is nothing positive to say about 'Knight.' Think about how bad 2014's 'Age of Extinction' was and it's way worse than that. Aside from the horrible dialogue (expected), needlessly long runtime (expected), excessive slo-mo scenes (expected) and non-stop CGI and mechanical sound F/X (expected), we also see once great actors like Anthony Hopkins (and mediocre ones like Josh Duhamel) show up because they are in need of a paycheck. Mark Wahlberg doesn't have an excuse this time - this is his second stint in a lead role, and he just doesn't work in this franchise. But then again, no one really does, as there's nothing that makes sense about the plot, even compared to what is usually expected for 'Transformers.'Part of the reason why 'Knight' has such a long run-time is because there are so many scenes that are just unnecessary and clog everything up. This is a hallmark of sorts of 'Transformers,' though, so it's not out of the ordinary. But it's this combined with the cringe-worthy gags that are tossed into the script that really drag things down - it's as if Michael Bay was dared to out-Bay himself and he succeeded in taking the bet.If you're debating whether or not to watch this, do yourself a favor and re-watch the original 'Transformers.'

98,W011y4m5,"Terrible, but visually stunning",5,18 September 2017,"The script is terribly written, the humour is immature & the dialogue is awful - the story plays out like a bad piece of fan fiction & loose plot threads are left dangling in the remnants of the utter CGI carnage left in its wake. Pacing issues are unbearably apparent, the scenes that take place defy all sense of logic & are unbelievable, even in a movie about robot aliens that can transform into vehicles. The only watchable part is the third act, which is its only redeeming feature; an epic, global spectacle on a scale I've never seen before in cinema - truly breathtakingly stunning visuals & enormous fight scenes that out-do any Michael Bay explosion filled battle we've ever seen before. It's clear that's what he excels at shooting & it shows. The stupidity & ridiculousness of it all is still blatantly obvious, but when it finally gets to the part he spent most of his time focusing on, it's more enjoyable to watch, though that certainly doesn't excuse the tedious snooze-fest leading up to it & the hammy characters needlessly forced into scenes when they're of no importance or consequence to the story & add nothing of any value to the part they're in. It's a popcorn movie that doesn't take itself too seriously - sometimes to the detriment of itself, hindering some potentially emotional scenes, to the point where the comedy is over done & grating. To summarise, it's garbage & an absolute mess - it feels like the film makers have written ideas on pieces of wet tissue paper, thrown them at a wall & have used any that stuck. It's rubbish, all over the place, has absolutely no pacing or sense of logic, but it has enjoyable, mindless violence & some unforgettable scenes performed by Anthony Hopkins...

99,dvc5159,A response to ronbraverman from Toronto,2,22 June 2017,"Apparently, ronbraverman thinks all movie critics are big bullies out to destroy movies for the masses in order to make up for their own lack of filmmaking skills by using other popcorn films as punching bags. He is so infuriated that he has apparently created a new account out of the blue just to call critics out on this apprehensive behavior.He is right - for those who do look forward to these movies just to lambast them. There are other critics though, who do not seek to hate them for the sake of hating them, as you implied. These people may not be born filmmakers, but it's their duty to call out the nonsense that's being spoonfed to them, usually (but not always) made by the Hollywood template-generating factory. Hence, the frustration.See, the best critics are the ones who champion the underdog films, the one which suffered from under-marketing or getting misunderstood by other critics. The late Roger Ebert, who mostly judged movies based on their genre conventions and filmmaking skill, and not by an overall spectrum, championed then-unknown films like ""Better Luck Tomorrow"", giving director Justin Lin a Hollywood career in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. That's not to say he was right all the time - he hated films like ""Death Wish 3"" and massively missed the point of ""The Hitcher"" (1986), both of which I greatly enjoyed. It's also a matter of personal preference at the end of the day.I'm not a Bay defender nor hater, in fact I think he is a notable action filmmaker, and for the most part his non-Transformers outings have been pretty darn good of late, with the massively under- appreciated black comedy ""Pain and Gain"" and last year's intense ""13 Hours"" more than proving that he is a capable filmmaker with a weird, wonky but undeniable auteur style of his own. I didn't even hate the last four ""Transformers"" movies.I hated this one.Not because I was vindictive, no, but like the masses, just wanted a brainless, fun time at the cineplex with some buddies. Even in Bay's earlier action stuff, there's always something to be appreciated, whether at the audacity of the ""tasteless"" humor, or the sheer energy of seeing a Hong Kong ferry being airlifted before crashing onto Kowloon in high-destructive style.Here, Bay is going through the motions, and this will be boring even to the common moviegoer. The jokes are lazy, the action sequences are repetitive, the twists are predictable and can be seen from a mile away. How many times can you see giant robots clanging and banging against each other? How many times can you hear the cliché machine spewing out lines such as ""No one gets left behind!"" or ""I'm not gonna leave you!"" It was a boring, $200 million cartoon episode (a bad one) with no heart, no soul, and at 2 and a half hours with about $20 spent on a ticket and popcorn, it is unforgivable. It was all sound and fury, signifying nothing. I owe an apology to John Moore for ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" after watching this boring, poorly edited mess.In conclusion, there is no shame in liking a film others hate, or vice versa. But don't assume all critics are out for blood. For the ones who are forced to sit through this to fulfill their editor's assignment and get paid, the frustration is understandable. It's their job. It's dirty, but someone's gotta do it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

101,Puroo,Hahahahahahahaha... What?,3,8 August 2021,"After the disappointment that Age of Extinction was, my hopes from this franchise had fallen to zero. However, I still had one ray of hope - it couldn't be worse than that, right? The story is already bad, the characters are no longer interesting, the continuity doesn't matter anymore, and hey, just one more movie is left after which I'll get to watch the super-awesome Bumblebee, so let's just tolerate one more movie. And boy, was I wrong when I didn't take one more factor into account: At least the cinematography was good in all the previous movies. Here even that fails.The most distracting thing in this entire movie is the continuously changing aspect ratio. There's a very important rule in filmmaking, that your jump cuts should be so seamless that the audience shouldn't realise when the jump cut takes place. Look at Marvel movies. When Black Widow fights there are like a gazillion jump cuts in just one somersault. If that is supposed to be silently moving across the room, the jump cuts of The Last Knight are like dragging an almirah across the room hoping no one would notice. You can literally see the jump cuts happen!And speaking of jump cuts ruining the mood, whenever the jump cuts happen in the same scene it feels like it is a completely different scene. Like in the scene where they are in the elevator and they see the butler bot over there, it feels as if the scene outside the elevator is a completely different place. The lighting is also so bad, it doesn't even feel like there's continuity until the jump cut happens again and the camera goes back to Cade and company.Apart from that there is also a scene where Cade stops his car in front of the sheriff and when he's stopping the car there's a lot of dust. But when the jump cut happens the dust is all gone. And while he's still stopping his car his voice starts coming. Like, he isn't even moving his mouth and the words are coming out louder than the car's engine. Another time the ADR ruins the mood is when the butler bot is playing the piano when the story of the Transformers is being narrated. He is asked to stop playing... Twice! A bad joke is repeated twice in just fifteen seconds!Then of course there's the fight between Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the legendary fight for which everyone came to watch it. Because the movie had been advertised by saying that Optimus Prime is the bad guy in this movie. And guess how their fight ends? Martha! No, not by saying those exact words, but something similar. Just as Optimus is about to stab Bumblebee, he says, ""I'm Bumblebee. I'll lay my life before you!"" And that changes Optimus Prime's mood. First of all, why did it change his mood? He's a robot not a human. Emotions can't alter his programming. And secondly how on earth did Bumblebee suddenly start speaking? It's not like his voice suddenly fixed. It was permanently damaged.It's kinda weird that in this movie the humans are not the bad part. In fact I really liked its starting, where they were showing Merlin take help from the dragon Transformer to win the battle. I also liked how those kids were collecting spare parts to survive. Even showing Optimus Prime on his planet looked so cool. The way it began I was really wondering why on earth this movie has such bad reviews. If the movie focused on either of the two things it could have been a great movie. I really wanted to like it, but the jump cuts were making me laugh even on the serious scenes. I'm sorry, Michael Bay. But I think you've ruined a good movie by hiring a bad cinematographer.",Transformers - The Last Knight
102,DeBBss,Not Shocked...,5,2 October 2017,"I wasn't surprised that Transformers: The Last Knight wasn't going to be good, I was expecting it to have a 4 or 5 out of 10. When the the first Transformers was released by Michael Bay, it was great, but know I feel like Michael Bay is just doing it for the money, and not doing it because he loves the Transformers universe.Story: 6/10The story is decent, I liked how they showed the sacrifice Prime had to do for earth. They also added that Transformers have been on Earth for hundreds of years, and that one of the characters has been hiding that fact from the public, which I believe is impossible, and what's the point of hiding it if everyone knows about Transformers?. They also added that Merlin's staff was made by the Transformer knight's, that is an interesting idea. Those knights stole that staff from their home planet, and one of the Transformer Gods wants that back to revive her world, so she brainwashes Prime to retrieve that back, and end Earth. I understand the plot, it's just that every Transformers movie always has an end of the world plot.Characters: 5/10Cade Yeager: Cade is a complex character, he's very serious, but he's also a jokester. I think this character has to go, I think Shia LaBeouf did a great job with what he had.Edmund Burton: Burton is an OK character, his character isn't really set up that much, all you know is that he collects, and hides the Transformers artifacts from hundreds of years ago from the public.Vivian Wembley: Vivian is an exact ripoff from Megan Fox, she is not important to anything in the story. Vivian is just in the movie because in every Transformers movie there has to be a hot girl, and a stupid romantic relationship.Izabella: Izabella is even more less important that Vivian, I honestly don't know why she's in the movie, her screen time is like five minutes.Action: 6/10I mean it's Michael Bay, he has a reputation he has to keep. There is a lot of EXPLOSIONS, and SLOW MOTION. The action is pretty much what you would expect, it's kinda of getting annoying with the EXPLOSIONS, if Michael Bay went a little easy on the EXPLOSIONS, I would have enjoyed the movie a little more.Overall I was kinda of expecting Transformers: The Last Knight to have all of this issues, because of Michael Bay's reputation. If Michael Bay makes another Transformers movie, or any other movie, he has to calm down, and do something that he has never done before.",Transformers - The Last Knight
103,thebricks,What is wrong with Michael Bay?,1,23 September 2017,"Another terrible Transformers movie, complete with robots fighting and shooting at each other, nothing like the Transformers from the comics or cartoons, obligatory military advertisements showing the military taking down Transformers with ease in romanticized, stylized sequences complete just so the shoot can get the shots of military equipment it needs, all shot the same way military ads are, coincidentally. The Izabella character also bothered me a lot for some reason. I won't go into detail but if you watch the movie, you'll understand. Michael Bay is a creep.It's time to reboot these movies, I'm sorry. Enough of Bay.",Transformers - The Last Knight
104,kermitkid,"Big, dumb, loud fun! Taco Bell Movie!",9,30 March 2020,"This is going to be a very unpopular opinion and I may lose followers for this. Most of you will think me an idiot. But I loved this movie! It was absolutely fantastic! It's the best one yet! After 10 years they've finally learned: Whiny, millennial college kids are annoying. There are none of those characters here. Just Spielberg-esque precocious kids and other characters that are actually likable and well-written. And yet it still has the ""12-year-old boy"" mindset that brings explosions and epic battles. As far as plot goes, it is kind of silly, all over the place and doesn't really make sense. But it's a ""Transformers"" movie, you kind of expect that at this point. It does contradict the first one as far as the Transformers' origins, so I'm guessing this is a reboot, much like ""Age of Extinction"" was. The one thing that annoyed me about this was the way it was filmed. The aspect ratio changes literally every shot. Widescreen, then full screen, then widescreen, then full screen, over and over. It was really annoying. Who knows why they did that. Hopefully they fix this by the time the Bluray comes out. Overall, I'd say this is actually my favorite Transformers movie, and I highly reccommend it. Just don't expect it to be thought-provoking, intelligent, or Oscar winning, and you'll be fine.

105,rollernerd,More than meets the eye,4,18 June 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is Transformers: The Last Knight (2017), the fifth and possible final entry to the series??? In the previous film, the last scene was Optimus Prime flying out in space coming for his creators - and boy was I expecting so much from this new film. And yep, you guessed it, totally disappointed.Mark Wahlberg returns as Cade who is somewhat of a fugitive and can only chat to his daughter for less than a minute. He is trying to protect the Autobots from humans, while himself, another bloke he has hired and a young stowaway chill with the Autobots until Optimus Price returns from his sole mission to find his creators and see whats happening with his dead home planet, Cybertron. At the beginning of the flick, we have the golden days of Arthurian Britain where Stanley Tucci returns as the drunk wizard Merlin who helps King Arthur win the war against evil with a three headed Autobot dragon...straight away I knew this movie was going to be a disaster. Excalibur??? The talisman?? Like comonnnn!!!!The Last Knight is super messy with poor action sequences which is a shame as the previous film really took the franchise to new limits with the action sequences both with humans and robots. And yes I am dissing the fight scene between Optimus and Bumblee. The dialogue was very questionable, throughout the whole film you have jokes around 'whooppe', weird innuendos from mature Brits who talk about bbw and there are awful chemistry with some of the main characters. Lennox played by Josh Duhamel returns and honestly not sure why? His character did not contribute to the story at all. Even the stowaway kid - she had potential of a cool character and you hardly see her. You don't see Optimus until the last 30 or 40 mins and throughout the entirety of the film you have robots running, shooting and running whether on land or spaceship.You have inconsistencies with the franchise on whether Bumblebee rocked up to Earth earlier as there is a story where Bee was helping the Allied forces against Nazi Germany during World War II. The quick phone chat between Sir Anthony Hopkins and John Turturro was funny and fun but too quick so why have Agent Simmons in the first place??? Gemma Chan as the CGI villain Quintessa is wasted and other than creating a new Cybertron, doesn't really have true substance as an antagonist.The female lead...i guess as a model looking woman who is a professor and is the descendant of a magical wizard is where Hollywood is trying to imply - yeppp more than meets the eye kind of tag line but we get it!!! Not dissing the actor but with what she had in the film including script and character plot, might aswell just scratch her out of the whole film!! And this whole sequences between herself and Marky Mark around chaste and chasity - awkward!The butler robot character was funny at the start where he was playing the organ but did get annoying when the gag of how he is a sociopath was repetitive. Now Sir Anthony Hopkins...to me during the film either he didn't care or was having fun, who knows had his cool moments including shushing the English Prime Minister and flipping the bird of to the police department. Hotrod - the French speaking Autobot was also underused. Overall 4.5/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight

OP getgs brainwashed into thinking earth, his autobot allies and humans are the enemy and that earth is Unicron and leads the attack until his oldest friend Bumblebee speaks for the first time since the end of the first film and sees that OP sees reason and rejoins the earths defences. This film once again suffers with shocking writing to the point that they tried to rewrite history showing that Michael Bay not only is a lowsey writer but lazy in research too.

107,EvanKevelson,"Critics, feminists I think need to relax.",7,19 April 2021,"Unlike 2-4 I felt this was the second best Transformer film after the very first. Not as comical, but not as chaotic either. I was glad they put John Turturo in albeit briefly because he stole every scene he was in in the first two.Didn't understand Optimus Primes amnesia when reaching the ruins of Cybertron and how easily he was coerced or brainwashed until he was woken from his hypnosis.Like the tie in to King Arthur Legend, and enjoyed the Star War Jabs which were lame updates of the original three. Anthony Hopkins mania was excellent and the story had meet to it.There were no dragged out CGI battle scenes....liked the incorporation and jab at Stone Henge being that there are conspiracy theorists that it was aliens, but it was a bit repetitious of the second with the pyramids they could have used Easter Island or a Mayan pyramid also (though the later wouldn't fit well with Arthur and Celt mythology).Overall it was a fun entertaining film that was definitely no less ridiculous than ""The Last Jedi"" or ""Rise of Skywalker"".But critiques in general with the progressive media really hates Michael Bay.I loved that the droids were shaped like imperial ti-fighters, and that Anthony Hopkins transformer butler was a clear upgraded less irritating mockery of 3-CPO.In all five installments I do wish to see what Cybotron was like before their Civil War.But watching the five films the only one that was as unbearable as a Zack Snyder DC film was the third film.I thought it would have been better if 4 & 5 were branded as the next chapter, or an explanation as to what happened to our human transformer relations department in the first three films.",Transformers - The Last Knight
108,ritera1,"Some great stuff but, yes, stupid as s't.",9,1 October 2017,"I have continually been perplexed by the insistence that all the Transformers movies and Michael Bay are bad.Although if I was an executive and heard the premise, I would have laughed Michael Bay out of the building. That much is true.But they consistently turn out to be very impressive.And this one no exception. Actually the best yet. Continually visually stunning and exciting. Consistently funny. Anthony Hopkins was great throughout. Walberg is very good at that improv comedic riffing (which was evident in Pain & Gain and many other Michael Bay films with different actors).But silliness. Melodrama. Plot holes. I can't deny.And there is a prevalent Chinese influence on the storytelling (being that Chinese money is more and more in Hollywood productions). I don't have the nuances down but they opt for strong elements of effect over coherence. Walberg's junkyard sequences are great if they made the slightest bit of sense vs. the Transformers being illegal. An emphasis on ""family"" as soon as they meet the little girl. (And I didn't really care for a busty 14 year-old girl in plunging necklines.)",Transformers - The Last Knight

I was conflicted on even putting this review up but I figured I endured the brutal two plus hour running time so I figured I'd vent very briefly about this film. This is not even a movie. This is a CGI spectacle of epic proportions that succeeds as a mindless, action driven cartoon show made for a crowd of toddlers. I contemplated walking out after the first ten minutes in which a voice-over so horribly and distressingly bad overtakes a story set up that can only honestly have been concocted by an eight year old and written in crayon. The cast is exceptional on paper but ends up hitting every dull note in the book. Even the most hardcore of Tramsformers fans will have to dig deep to enjoy this one. If this is any indication of what passes for a summer blockbuster then I think the 2017 summer season is in big trouble. Watch at your own risk.",Transformers - The Last Knight

111,fcabanski,Good Story Disguised as Crap,1,3 October 2017,"Somewhere in this movie is a good story. But thanks to awful direction, that good story is buried in a jumbled, un-entertaining mess.For the most part, nobody speaks in this movie. They banter. They deliver rapid fire one liners, quips, rather than lines. Crescendo becomes meaningless if everything is a crescendo. Quips, one liners, funny moments become cumbersome when every moment is filled with ironu and poor attempts at humor.There's a young girl character called something with a z. I can't remember the name. But the actress is awful. She doesn't speak her banter, she poses it. Even when she stands still, she does it in a deliberate way. Everything from her is forced, unnatural.There are flashbacks and even flashbacks within flashbacks, so it's hard to keep track of an ongoing story. Bay, as usual, makes use of too much slow motion. In one scene, one of the Transformers fires a time slowing weapon. But the effect is lost because it blends into all the other slow motion action. Some people caught in the weapon's range are moving slowly, but everyone moves slowly when there's action. So, um, what's happening? A lot of the effects look like something out of a theme park attraction. There are lots of explosions, bullets ricocheting, and sparks, but nothing seems close to the people who are the targets of the massive fire power. Once in awhile the action goes to super slow motion (that's why the slo mo weapon is confusing) as something barely misses a ducking and dodging human who shouldn't be capable of moving fast enough to get out of the way. Transformers roll around, losing pieces of their bodies. The action is shown with an always moving camera, with time jumps, and zoomed in to the point it's impossible to tell how the fight is progressing. Are all those pieces flying off a giant robot important? Is the robot winning or losing the fight? Did that part fly off before now, or is now a flashback, or is it a time jump? Is a robot hurt? Who knows? Speaking of time jumps, Bay loves to approach a scene then jump past the beginning, into the middle of the action. Someone is walking out of a building, a car approaches, then suddenly the person is inside the car in the middle of a chase scene. There's a lack of continuity. It's hard for a viewer to get his bearings, and thus it's hard to enjoy the scene. WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!???? It doesn't help that the minds behind this movie pasted Transformers on top of King Arthur.The whole movie feels rushed, or feels like it has too much cut out of it. Bay makes action in a disjointed way, and the overall movie is delivered in a disjointed way.It's hard to watch and even harder to like.Michael Bay makes the song a complicated mess.Transformers! More than meets the eye. Transformers! Robots in disguise. Transformers!Autobots wage their battle To destroy the evil forces Of the DecepticonsTransformers!Autobots are King Arthur's Knights And an evil queen Wants to destroy the Earth But it's called Unicron And there's a chosen one With a moving talisman But there's another chosen one Who wields Merlin's staff It was given to him By the Autobots",Transformers - The Last Knight

113,darkreignn,"Worse than ""Age of Extinction?"" One of the worst movies of all time? Please",9,9 August 2017,"I don't like the fourth film in the ""Transformers"" series. I thought it was long and dull and incredibly boring, so as you can probably imagine I was not looking forward to this. Imagine my surprise when this film was the most entertaining and action-packed popcorn flick I've seen in a long time. This movie was pretty much non-stop entertainment from start to finish. It was very fast paced and funny, and it must have been exactly what I needed on a long summer day because I walked out of the theatre absolutely loving this film.Let's get to the bad stuff first because I know that's what all of you want to read. First off, the constant, I'm talking CONSTANT changes of the aspect ratio were so distracting. At first I thought they were just switching the aspect ratio when the action was coming, but seriously they changed it for literally everything. Anthony Hopkins takes off his glasses? That's an aspect ratio switch. Someone drinking a Bud Light? That's an aspect ratio switch. A little girl waking up in the morning and staring at the rising sun? You better believe that's an aspect ratio switch. It almost seemed like every single cut came with an aspect ratio switch and it was super distracting.Also, the film kind of seemed incomprehensible. I don't think I'm dense, but there were points where I was paying explicit attention to the film and I still didn't know what was going on. Like, a giant robot dinosaur bursts out of the ground and demolishes a bunch of cars, and then ten seconds later it's gone and people are talking about the casualties. Was that scene a flashback or did the movie just move at a brisk pace? I don't really know. But other than that, Michael Bay really came back to form with this one. The special effects are top notch and beautiful, and the action is big and slick and clean and beautiful to watch. Optimus Prime is a bad ass like usual, and so is Mark Wahlberg. Honestly I don't know what else to say, in my opinion this is just a straight up fun and funny action movie that I really, really enjoyed, and I think you will enjoy it as well if you know what you're getting into. ""Transfromers: The Last Knight"" is as good as the first ""Transformers"" movie, if not better, and if you're looking for summer FUN, then this is the movie for you.",Transformers - The Last Knight
114,pranayjalvi,The Last Knight should be the last of the franchise.,5,3 July 2017,"It's an unabashed freewheeling mess of CGI explosions, fast-talking strategies and shiny metal monstrosities clashing in epic battles. And it's actually kind of fun, in an infuriating sort of way, to watch the most ridiculous Hollywood movie of the year do its thing.Even at its best, The Last Knight feels like a series of action scenes wrapped up together in a thinly stretched narrative. The characters are always in some sort of mortal peril, whether they're being shot at, nearly getting crushed by errant bots, or on a free fall collision course with solid ground.Transformers never asks whether viewers want more. It just force-feeds the audience the same ideas this series has been rehashing for the last decade.My Rating :2.5/5",Transformers - The Last Knight
115,mardalsfossen01,Best 'Transformers' out of the first 5,9,14 February 2019,"First off all, I am not a Michael Bay fan and Transformers hasn't been the greatest of franchises and it's easy to hate on it. But this movie, I liked it.I am glad they decided to cast Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yaeger) for Transformers 4&5. His character is mature, unlike Shia's and overall more enjoyable to watch. People who say he's not acting well, I can't agree. I've seen 300+ movies and he's honestly doing a good job.Talking of more mature, with Laura Haddock (Vivian) finally(!) the woman this franchise needed shows up. Megan Fox (Transformers 1&2) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers 3) can't keep up with her in terms of charisma and personality. Her character is naturally good looking, very smart and likeable in every way.
'The Last Knight' fixes a lot of the problems prior Transformer movies had and is actually watchable throughout the whole time.
Good, self-reflecting characters and well written dialogues with the right amount of humor. Plot has a nice depth. I cannot understand reviews saying the first half wasn't easy to follow or incoherent, since every scene had a purpose and logically fit into the timeline. If you don't get the plot or the story behind it, that honestly is not the fault of the writer(s)/director.'The Last Knight' has a lot of epic cinematography, dozens of desktop background worthy shots. Also sound and music were set up well.
Casting Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton) was a MAJOR coup. He fit his role perfectly and was a joy to watch. His Transformer 'Cogman' surely reminds of C3PO but still is a great character with the right amount of wittiness, funny lines and moments and has a great voice actor with Jim Carter.
Speaking of Transformers, Daytrader and Hot Rod were successful additions. Child actress Isabela Moner did a good job and I can see her being part of future movies of the franchise.
I really don't understand why people think this is the worst Transformers movie, for me it was the most enjoyable one of the first 5. Great actors, screenplay didn't feel dragging at all, good dialogues and plot.
Only negative points are that I am not sure the physics make any sense at all, that one important skirmish wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be and that in the medieval setting there had to be explosions and sparks where it didn't make sense (typical, eh).
Transformers went a far way from the first to this one. I feel bad a lot of people didn't like it, because I can see SO MUCH of improvement. I am a little bit shocked people didn't receive it well and I'm glad I actually watched it regardless all the bad reviews.",Transformers - The Last Knight
116,FallenEye,TransForcers: The Worst Plight.,2,25 June 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight, is not a movie, point blank. The story is incredibly, just so incredibly messy, clumsy, incoherent, discursive and, bad.The special effects and action are literally nothing we haven't seen from Michael Bay before. The effects are nice, but, they are exactly what we've seen in ALL of the other Transformers installments... The Last Knight had absolutely nothing new to offer in that regard.The editing almost showed signs of the editors' growing fatigue at putting this chaotic mess together. The script, again, EXACTLY what we've come to expect from Transformers, without a single change... So now it's just tired and stupid for the most part.Transformers: The Last Knight runs on the very same premises, as Revenge of the Fallen and the original Transformers itself, Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction, in such a way that now you wonder if all this is making ANY sense at all. First it was The Cube that was the end all and be all, then The Matrix of Leadership, and then The Pillars in Dark of the Moon, followed by The Seed in Age of Extinction... And now, this... The Staff... Which was useless it seems, to be in Vivian's...Argh, why bother explaining.Transfomers: Age of Extinction was 2 hours 45 minutes long, and really, I could handle it, though it too was incredibly bloated. This one however, I was ready for it to end an hour in.Good things about this ""movie"" were Bee's solo setup, Laura Haddock's sexy accent on a very pretty face and Steve Jablonsky's composition, for the most part. From there, almost every character felt so, just so useless... Cade, Vivian, Isabella, Sir Edmond Burton, Lennox, Jimmy... Really, the lot of them, felt useless, and useless not as in they weren't necessary for what happened in this movie, but rather, the vast majority of the plot, which of course then includes characters, was useless.The worst of all 5 Transformers, the absolute worst. Amidst all this, then there's the 5 minutes of Nemesis Prime... 5 minutes. In a movie that spans 2 hours 30 minutes... All Bay could fit in of Nemesis Prime, was 5 minutes??!2.4/10 for this ridiculous and repetitive wreck.",Transformers - The Last Knight
117,austin0731,"Its a Transformers movie, what more can we expect?",4,21 June 2017,"Transformers had always been a guilty pleasure for me with the exception of the second and fourth films being completely horrible. So how was ""The Last Knight""? Well, I had expectations and I really shouldn't have because this was a complete mess, there are a bunch of random plot lines and characters added in seemingly just to confuse everyone from what is actually important. The children who seemed to have been featured quite prominently in the trailers were there for around 2 minutes, if you're looking forward to a stranger things vibe with them forget it. The most disappointing thing is that this one like pretty much all the transformers movies had great action, probably the best in the franchise, it focused a lot on the human characters which is an interesting approach; There is a great film buried in here but they just can't help adding pointless characters and humour that is just a complete turn off. The opening with the medieval stuff, that was pretty great but once they went back to modern days I sighed and realized that we are not getting a revitalization of the franchise as we did with the Fast and Furious franchise. I have come to realize that that is exactly what Transformers needs, a repackaging because there is a great concept here, but its simply not put to good use.",Transformers - The Last Knight

119,asifahsankhan,"Better than the previous ones but still ""The Last Knight"" seems like a movie Michael Bay was threatened to make at Gunpoint.",6,1 July 2017,"Okay, so nobody goes to Cinema to watch a Transformers film for it's unique story. Everyone knows it's unreal to expect too much from it, all that you ever hope for is the solid gist or material to get you sunk into it at least for a half an hour out of those two mesmerising hours while you sit there and watch a bunch of fake giant robots fight other fake giant robots. Precisely in exchange for some hard earned cash...But it's not the case for Transformers: The Last Knight .In the past ten years, we've seen four other Transformers films, and they're insufferable for film fans, apart from, what I would argue, to be the more Spielbergian aspects found in the first film from 2007. The rest of this five entry franchise is an exhaustive, incoherent mess in the eyes of fans of the old series of cartoons and toys and fans of craft of film. For a lot of those two audiences, Michael Bay's films are downright offensive to the things they'd be turning out to see in, and yet, despite the panning, despite the blockbuster fatigue, this Transformers franchise is beloved by an audience that excused it all with the mindset that they didn't care, that they'd gladly turn their brain off, and just enjoy the action. Again, it's not the case for Transformers: The Last Knight .I tried (the best that I tried!) To follow the story line for about half an hour. It was funny. Not because the story was meant to be funny, but because all the new elements. And they continued. And they all continued to appear side stories. Now it's about written history. From the Middle Ages to World War II. It came on a rod and slick?The Last Knight, however, at first seems like it is by far too interested in getting Wahlberg's Cade Yeager to develop a grating and unnatural romance with Laura Haddock's character, cementing the opinion that the writers don't understand genuine human interaction, or, if they do, Michael Bay doesn't care. It can be said that Bay's style is toned down considerably in his camera-work in this film, but not enough to not be instantly (unforgivably) recognisable in his use of telephoto shaky cam on closeups, or male gaze on the female actress in the cast that is of age. As a director, he can most certainly compose action sequences, and every moviegoer knows this if they know him by name, however his composition of the film as a whole is still as poor as every other he's produced. It just so happened that this time around there was a screenplay (unlike the second and fourth films), so it's at least understandable what is happening from moment to moment, but that doesn't mean it's any good.Since the series never succeeded because of it's logical and interesting stories, but because of it titular machines, and some memorable battles scenes that made you not forget too easily what you saw. Michael Bay's films, across the board, no longer meet a (any) standard. The action between the Autobots and Decepticons in these sluggish two and a half hour pieces of bombastic summer flicks have competition from superhero films, and generally well made action films, left and right, and not only do they beat this series in the creative composition of action, but they're streets ahead in coherent storytelling and character development, which, surprise, makes their respective action scenes even more meaningful.Bay, however, is a very gifted director. He actually knows how to handle a big budget movie, if you're a producer, Bay's the best you can get if you wish to spend a lot of your money and win it all back instantly, with 100% added interest. Bay can surprise you, he knows what you want and what to give you. But he needs to have to want to do that in the first place. He must have that desired intention. While it's better than the previous Transformers films in the series but still ""The Last Knight"" seems like a movie Michael Bay was threatened to make at gunpoint.",Transformers - The Last Knight

121,FelipeCarrillo,Two species which are not at war anymore: film critics and audience,6,23 August 2017,"The ""Transformers"" saga has come from more to less. Starting exactly a decade ago, Paramount Pictures broke into Hasbro toys, adapting them into audiovisual products, those metallic giants found on planet earth a provisional protection. Shia LaBeouf's rebellious young role, the eye candy who Megan Fox turned out to be, Michael Bay extravagances idealizing sequences as hilarious as showy and the narrative delusions implanted in a script that is out of touch, all the above imparted the rules by which the following movies would be ruled, without the possibility of an iota of irregularity. Squeaky heroic acts, sensual women appropriating of sexual roles, virile and muscular leading principal actors, incomprehensible twists and a direct ticket for a legendary actor with a mind spirit to demand his high-priced stipend and send his prodigious acting career to hell. It has become evident that complains about this franchise don't cease, however, the film studio doesn't step down by seeing the answer, ironically, positive at the box office, causing a disagreement of opinions between audience and reviewers. Nevertheless, the movie with the power to converge these two opposite poles in an exact point of embarrassing dejection, describing the most recent installment of Autobots and Decepticons with adjectives as very long, cacophonous, intelligible and sleep- inducing.Navigating more than seven scenarios, the story follows the customary leading role Cade Yeager, accompanied by unusual characters as, nothing more or nothing less, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, who are starting point for development of the plot; Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock), the only living descendant who can take up his sword; Lennox (Josh Duhamel), military captain who hinders goals of our heroes, Izabella (Isabela Moner), a girl who cures Autobots introduced to possibly inherit the unlikely franchise or the amount of coming spin-offs; Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), faithful Sentinel of the genesis of Transformers; and the ideological troubles of two races that are at war in the same world, some humans and other metallics.Openly, the salvable compounds in this sea of nooks are limited, unnecessarily, convoluted and lacking any vestige of attraction, generated by a quartet of writers with highly utopian ambitions, which strive in opposition to a narrative barrier in which no longer keep the same expectations. Such information that slides through Nazi, alien, Mexican, Cuban, European, North American and even medieval settings causes, either from water, air or earth, the feature film feels exaggeratedly longer than the previous outstretched films. Action intervals are inscribed into the plot with decisive rigidity and aren't sufficiently suggestive to pretext the mechanical yawns turning up from the middle of the run-time and is rapidly intensified over the longer final climax. As for dialogue, written at six hands by Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan; It underlines coarse update surrounding the criticized racist, misogynist manias of the franchise, which is enhanced by equipping the eye candy with Oxford University titles and doctorates, intellectual glasses and a heady black dress that makes evident that, in fact, nothing has changed. The legendary actor on duty is our Dr. Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lambs"", who paraphrases understandable synthetic scenes or performs a well-bred London informative safeguard, no doubt, the most remarkable character among all others, of course, those of flesh and bone.It's enviable the support that Paramount Pictures offers Michael Bay to quench his idealized film dementias, some grandiloquently materialistic and other exaggeratedly pretentious. I said enviable because, personally, I feel a strong connection with this directional kind, also evidenced by Jordan Vogt-Roberts in the recent ""Kong: Skull Island"", of course, referring explicitly to the visual aspect. Propagating with a striking commercial paraphernalia, the fifth installment in the saga is the first to be filmed, entirely, on IMAX 3D cameras, state-of-the- art devices that give majestic images, boasting technical capabilities that embroider the spectacular. Without a doubt, the talent of this director lies in cinematography, the knowledge to fit precise pieces that, here, are harmed by the arrhythmic editing work, emphasizing the variety of aspect ratios that the sequences ache, an unintentional distractor. Fleeting bursts, frantic chases, metal hits, shiny frames and whimsical landscapes file throughout the film, a summer cinema show lacking a good edition work and excitement.Announced in advance, the retirement of Bay and Wahlberg from ""Transformers"" franchise gives an air of hope and faith to restructure the unlikely future installments, since, what has been achieved with ""The Last Knight"", puts the plans of the studio at risk, seeing unfavorable reception of both critics and audience. However, it cannot be categorized as an absolute film disaster because, although it contains flaws equivalent to the budget in editing, soundtrack and script fields; what the director and his artistic crew do with the scenes deserves enough merit to overlap the yawns and naps attempts in theaters. Yes, this is the only reason to see the movie, you've been warned, experience it in IMAX cinemas, with the largest screen and the most suitable position.

123,kevinxirau,Does Michael Bay even try anymore?,4,28 February 2018,"It's no surprise that Michael has the subtlety of one of his countless explosions, even more so that he's been hogging Transformers to himself. While he's made some decent films in the past, as of late he's been stuck in a loop making projects that strictly appeal to a pretty low demographic by today's standards with little regards of what makes a movie actually good or even the effort to partake in such an endeavor. Granted, the first Transformers is the most well-balanced and the fourth film leaned towards a good direction story-wise, but in general these movies are not only a disservice to the franchise but are just not that well-made in general. This latest iteration is the epitome of Bay's failings.Plot: More and more Transformers arrive on Earth and, regardless of affiliations, have been outlawed. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) does his best to keep his Autobot friends safe, but gets dragged in alongside English professor Viviane Wembly in a race to find an ancient Cybertronian artifact that once belonged to the legendary Merlin, all in an effort to prevent the imminent destruction of Earth by an approaching Cybertron while avoiding the Decepticons and other dark forces.Let's get what little is good out of the way. The story parts involving Merlin and Arthur are actually interesting, Anthony Hopkins and his robot butler Cogman stole the show, some pretty cool action moments, good voice acting (Peter Cullen and Frank Welker give nice deliveries as Optimus Prime and Megatron), neat designs, and nice environments. Yeah, really scraping the bottom of the barrel here now that I think about it.Despite the great storytelling potential left behind by ""Age of Extinction"", that all gets thrown away in place of everything we associate with the director, this time presented tenfold. Lazy writing, tons of CGI, glorification of the military, racial stereotypes, unsubtle humor, a camera that rarely stays still, poor characterization of the Transformers, more holes in the plot than a screen door, inconsistencies with the whole storyline of the franchise, women being sex objects rather than people, yet another hunt for a super powerful thing from space, Megatron helping another big villain, Autobots get treated like dirt yet end up being needed, etc. Honestly, this film's biggest crime is simply being so excessive with these elements and with a runtime of 154 minutes, it really gets exhausting by the time you reach the halfway point.There's also some seriously misleading marketing, especially in regards to a push for feminism (Isabela Moner actually does very little here contrary to the trailers) and Optimus turning dark (he's barely in the film for five minutes). The Decepticons feel more like an inconvenience than a genuine threat, unfortunate and pathetic given how they started back in 2007. Furthermore, there's a lot of exposition for the human part of the story but not nearly enough for the Transformers (I mean, c'mon, they do make up the titles of these movies).Ugh, I better end it here before I lose my sanity. In short, ""The Last Knight"" is entertaining mainly because of how trashy it is and the aforementioned few good elements. I sincerely hope this is the last time Michael Bay makes a Transformers movie because, frankly, it could use a serious reboot.",Transformers - The Last Knight
124,Dragonsouls,One of the best of the Transformers films.,8,24 June 2017,"These movies never did well critically, but they make billions of dollars nevertheless, because they're not the mindless CGI films that professional critics claim they are. Professional critics are a cancer to artists, and a cancer to the film industry. Transformers films are very spiritual films and there's always a good conspiracy to fuel the story. This story is probably my favorite out of the 5 films.Just like all Transformer movies, The Last Knight infuses Transformers lore into real human history and legends, almost to the point where it seems like Earth belongs to the Transformers just as much as it does to us. This time around it's King Arthur and the Crusades, where we see that Merlin (played by a particularly hilarious Stanley Tucci) was given a magic staff by a Transformer, and that staff is now the key to saving the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron.Cybertron is an interesting planet to me, and I always thought of it as a representation of Atlantis, which is human civilization at its highest evolutionary peak, both on a spiritual and intellectual level and on a scientific/technological level. And so the movie begins in England, circa 200 A.D. during a battle between a barbaric Saxon army and King Arthur and his army. Despite being outnumbered, King Arthur and crew had one thing that the Saxons did not, and that was the magic staff of Cybertron. The staff works by calling forth a 3-headed Dragon Transformer, which I found to be symbolic for intelligence, courage, and wisdom. The Dragon wipes out the entire Saxon army with one swipe of its tail, and then the story moves on to present day, 1600 years later.It turns out, that a secret society of Wiccans have been storing and preserving artifacts for centuries, including the magic staff of Cybertron. Anthony Hopkins is hilarious and brings great energy to the screen as Sir Edmund Burton, one of the last members of an Illuminati-like secret society bent on the protection of Transformers and the magic staff (which we learn later on has an effect on DNA) When Burton learns that a missing piece of the magic staff has been found by Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg) he sends a crew of his personal Transformers to apprehend him. The film really got interesting at this point and the most interesting scene was when Sir Edward Burton takes Cade on a tour through a gorgeous castle in England, where he gives Cade lecture on the secret of Transformers and their presence on Earth, dating back to the beginning of recorded history.It turns out that people like Leonardo DaVinci, Nikola Tesla, Hitler, Einstein, and dozens of other real historic figures, usually ushers of modern civilization and technology, were all members of the secret society and every single one of these great and no so great men and women had Transformers to aid them, just like King Arthur before them. It was interesting how the Transformers aided them too, usually with the magic staff of Cybertron, (Alien DNA, or better yet, ""Transformed DNA"") which Sir Edward Burton then discusses in full detail on how the staff ""Transforms DNA,"" and if necessary, summons the help of the 3-headed dragon (Courage, wisdom, and intelligence) Burton then warns about the dangers of the magic staff of Cybertron, if it should ever fall into the wrong hands. Supposedly only those with compassion and valor deserve the staff, but in this film, everyone seems to want it...including the U.S. military, who views the staff as ""a weapon."" It makes me wonder ... this film really makes you think...about Nikola Tesla and people like DaVinci and Einstein...who I'm sure only wanted to push humanity forward with their technology, but so much of their sciences were perverted and weaponized by people with nefarious agendas and personal aggrandizement.So without giving too much away, the U.S. government decides to open the doors to a high tech Transformer prison that houses some of the most dangerous Transformers, including Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons (evil transformers). According to the U.S. military, they had no choice but to release the dangerous prisoners, because they had to make a deal with the devil if they were to ever find the missing piece of the staff of Cybertron and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.And so the movie is basically an adventure story about the Illuminati trying to keep the staff (alien DNA) away from politicians so that they don't use the Dragon (Intelligence, knowledge) for weaponry, but it turns out that Megatron prevails in defeating Optimus Prime, and takes the staff from a secret tomb. I found it interesting what they did with the staff too, which was suck energy out of Earth's core, so that they could use the energy to turn Earth into a physical Cybertron. The difference in philosophy between the Autobots and the Decepticons is that the Decepticons want to completely wipe out Earth and turn it into Cybertron, whereas the Autobots want the Earth to be shared between human and machines, because only that balance and partnership between the two races could keep Earth from crumbling, like Cybertron before it, which I found interesting because again, it's a re-telling of the Atlantis myth.And so in the end, Prime, Cade and Burton rush to retrieve the staff before its too late, because apparently, sucking energy from Earth's molten core (allegory for Big Oil) is weakening the Earth's Magentosphere, and cosmic radiation was beginning to burn people to a crisp. I highly recommend this film for its humor, conspiracy theories, spiritual overtones, and of yeah, those pretty cool car chase scenes.7/10",Transformers - The Last Knight

128,Mivas_Greece,"Although the most mature and serious Transformers movie of Bay, it is sadly the worst... Bay wanted to end with them and this film shows that clearly.",6,28 March 2021,"Fantasy/action movie. The Last Knight. Although with Age of Extinction, everything seemed to be the beginning of a new trilogy, Bay's fifth film clearly showed that for him at least it would be the last. The silly humor has subsided considerably, although there are some nice humorous elements, while overall the film is the most mature of all Transformers. Cade remains the main protagonist, as do the Autobots Transformers from the film Age of Extinction, while some characters from the first trilogy, such as Lennox, and Agent Simmons, come back, albeit in a small role. There are also new characters, the most important of which is the British Mr Falgon (Antony Hopkins) and this in combination with the story that the film builds shows that although there is humor, overall things are more serious and mature. History now connects the transformers with King Arthur and the Wizard Merlin, with The Second World War (there is even reference to Hitler's death), and even with the supercontinent of Paggaia. Even more, of the enemy's big weapons, such as as the second film's Devastator, the 3rd one's the huge robot drill and the 4th's the transformers' impressive alien spaceship, this one has an entire planet, Cybertron that invades earth and consumes earth's energy. However, while trying to make the film a little more mature, Bay reduces pace, action and suspense significantly and repeats quite a a lot while building the story, while on the other hand many things like what happened to Sam of the first trilogy, how Galvatron became Megatron again and took this form, who were the aliens who appeared in Age of Extinction, and that were the creators of Transformers as hinted from Lockdown and many others remained inexplicable. Also, when the moments of action really came and Megatron's reappearance, as well as a fairly impressive Cybertron transformer made up of many smaller ones, the action lasted very little... Also the main battle of the whole movie instead of Optimus against the arch villain of the movie such as Megatron (or the Fallen, Sentinel, and Lockdown in the previous films), we had battle between Bumblebee and Nemesis Prime (Optimus under Quintessa's control). And besides, there was no such thing as the amazing directing and music that Age of Extinction had and the previous films. Overall, Bay's fifth film was by far the worst of all Transformers. It had quite an interesting script, but it was clear that a very rough and careless job was done in the implementation and also the removal of a very important character before the end means that Bay wanted to finish with the Transformers. Too bad really because Age of Extinction was very promising and it could be the beginning of an excellent and more mature than the first trilogy. After the end I wanted to watch again the age of extinction back in order to conclude Transformers in a much better way. Well, it leaves room for continuity, though it won't continue from Bay. Still worth a watch for the fans, but far from good compared to previous ones.",Transformers - The Last Knight
129,MinistryofDoom,A big dumb stupid action movie....,5,22 September 2017,"for people who like big dumb stupid action movies. You know the kind: colossal explosions, CGI galore, slo-mo dramatic jumps from the clutches of chaos. This movie is a great popcorn flick, like most of Michael Bay's Transformers flicks. It doesn't require any in depth thought about plot lines and character development, because to be honest, there really isn't much of that going on. What little plot there is, is convoluted and stupid, but let's be honest, you're just here to see skyscraper-sized robots beating the crap out of each other....and that's exactly what you get. As for the human characters, aside from Cade Yeager (stupidest character name EVER) who featured prominently in the last Transformers film, most of the characters are new-comers with thread-thin character development. Although you still get to see one or two characters who've suddenly and awkwardly re-emerged from hiatus after having taken part in Shia LaBeouf's Transformers adventures.In the end, again, you get everything you expect and nothing more: Autobots fighting Decepticons. True Transformers fans will immediately note that the film takes major...and I mean MAJOR...liberties with the Transformers lore, still it manages to include all sorts of Cybertronians on screen including Dino-bots, Mini-Cons, and Headmasters, etc. That itself is pretty frickin' cool.",Transformers - The Last Knight

132,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,3,26 June 2017,"Michael Bay and Transformers, you know the names but know that these two don't mix together. This 5th and supposedly final installment of the film series does what it's previous films does best; recycle itself and be more garbage than it was. With a storyline that had potential but delivered incoherently, cheesy one liners that felt forced and choppy editing, camera work and loud sounds that would make you go deaf or even numbers by the end.The acting ranges between so-so to annoying, Mark Wahlberg is again at this weakest with this confused character trait from AOE, I have seen him in better films where he can expand more and be a real action man on screen. Josh Duhamel returns in a good performance that doesn't give him much to do, Laura Haddock is the 2nd best actress in the film and the series itself, having beauty and acting chops she had mix well together while the worst and annoying cast member was Isabela Moner, who was pretty much miscast for the film.There a few good things about this though: Anthony Hopkins making the best of his character, trying to explain the 'significance' of the story while getting a few laughs out along the way, the visual effects are at top notch as with the previous films and the finale that obviously leaves the door open for more films (though Bay and Wahlberg have said they are done with the series). Overall, The Last Knight is definitely a disappointment but only slightly better than Age of Extinction in terms of the final action set piece scale. With only some good comedy moments from Hopkins and the decent CGI effects from Industrial Light and Magic, this film feels like its wasted 2 and 1/2 hours (maybe longer) of precious time that I could spent elsewhere. Just hope that now Bay doesn't come anywhere near the MCU and the DCEU franchises.1.5/5 - Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.",Transformers - The Last Knight

This movie is just as disjointed as the last one. It is as though I am watching four different movies on four different time-lines spliced together to give the illusion of one film versus four.Each sequel is worse than the previous one. The first Transformers movie was awe inspiring, fun, and funny with some serious undertones. The machines actually ""transformed"" pretty frequently even when engaged in battle.This movie may as well be called Johnny Soko's Giant Robots versus Transformers. The so-called plot jumps around so much you will have to take notes in four different note pads so when they cut back to movie 3 of 4 (movies pasted together as one film) you will have a better grasp of where they left off and what they were trying to convey prior to jumping into movie 4 of 4 (movies pasted together as one). Also, please get rid of Walhberg and his steroids as he is 100% out of place in this franchise. His Jersey/Philly/Boston accent (or whatever east city) sounds even worse when he tries to mask it.

135,joshbarton15,He went full Bay again,2,25 June 2017,"Michael Bay has been delivering Transformers films for the past ten years now and in that time we've had four films full of too much controversy for a franchise based around a line of toys. Whether it be the brazen racial stereotypes in Revenge of the Fallen or actually explaining the Romeo and Juliet law in Age of Extinction, Bay clearly doesn't take the time to step back and think about what he puts in these films. The fifth film, The Last Knight, has arrived but has Bay been able to show any restraint?With Optimus Prime gone and both Autobots and Decepticons still arriving on Earth, war has broken out between the humans and Transformers. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) finds himself amidst a battle where the key to victory lies buried in the secret history of the Transformers on Earth.What I find so baffling about the Transformers films as they are now is why Michael Bay feels it's necessary for them to have such excessive runtimes. The Last Knight is thankfully shorter than Age of Extinction however, it's two-and-a-half hour runtime makes the film feel like such a slog to sit through and leaves it open for Bay to fill with the sort of nonsense that the previous films became so annoyingly bogged down with. He's massively toned down the racial stereotypes and shooting his female leads with leering camera shots but there's still the irritating comic relief that just isn't funny, at all.The story is just an incoherent mess from start to finish; opening with King Arthur at battle in a sequence ripped straight from Gladiator and finishing with a chaotic finale that does in fact link back to the opening sequence, it just there's far too much going on between that it's hard not to lose interest in anything that's happening. There's too many characters involved, Izabella and Jimmy being the prominent ones who get left out for a large chunk of the film, only to be remembered and shoved in just in time for the finale.The script is arguably worse than it was in Age of Extinction; Cade, Vivian and Edmund actually taking time out to discuss Cade's sexual activity. Actually, it's not quite the Romeo and Juliet law explanation in the previous film, so there is that. The Transformers themselves get a large chunk of the cringeworthy dialogue, most of them spouting out some rubbish after everything they do.Action sequences are something that Bay and the Transformers films can usually take pride in however, The Last Knight is void of good action sequences, bar one. The Optimus Prime vs Bumblebee fight is the only action sequence that has any sort of gravitas yet it really doesn't last long enough. As usual, the visual effects are outstanding but they seem wasted when they film doesn't possess the good action sequences we've seen previously.Coming to the performances, I can't really say there was a bad one in there because there just wasn't. Mark Wahlberg proves he can carry a film again, even if it is utterly ridiculous, Laura Haddock actually gets a chance to act unlike her female counterparts throughout the franchise and Isabela Moner acts as if she's in an Oscar worthy film, which I'll put down to lack of experience. Anthony Hopkins gets a bigger role than I was expecting and I can only imagine he's now laughing his way to the bank after hamming it up to the max for the cameras.It doesn't feel like an achievement to say The Last Knight isn't the worst Transformers film because Age of Extinction set the bar so incredibly low. I thought this was going to be the last one we'll see but then a Bumblebee spin-off and another Transformers film have been slated for release, so I guess this franchise isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Maybe it's time Michael Bay stepped aside and let some new blood into the franchise, possibly someone who hates product placement and can tell a story or is that too much to ask?",Transformers - The Last Knight

Once again, it's visually impressive, but not much more than that.I didn't hate it. It was too bonkers for that. It tried to further the story and made the whole thing crazier than it already was. Once again, it's a cheese fest, with a lot of CGI (but pretty good CGI, say what you want), jokes that fall flat (although I gotta admit a few were alright) and a thin plot that you don't care about and you lose interest in the plot halfway through, as crazy as it seemed at first. The acting is okay, in some cases cheesy, but why the surprise? It's cheesy, but still, it's fun. At least still better than The Fate of the Furious, which was a lazy cash-grab that didn't do anything new. But still, this isn't very good either, as fun as it is. I saw the movie less than 3 hours ago and I already don't remember half of it, so it's still somehow forgettable, even though it's insane. But if you're a fan of this franchise, what's not to like, I guess? If you're not, it's probably a waste of time for you. But still, you might enjoy it if you just want action and a nice theater experience.It was still fun, very visually pleasing and I liked how it tried to kinda reinvent the series and explore the universe, but it makes it tough to actually care with its poor writing, non- existent character development, a kinda tedious first half and a thin and not very gripping plot with some plot points being completely glossed over just to end the thing.

138,paulijcalderon,Uninspired Transformers on autopilot,3,1 July 2017,"Why can't these movies be better? Well, it's basically the same thing again but with some King Arthur stories thrown into the mess. Optimus Prime gets stuck on the road here while Mark Wahlberg leads the group of heroes. Optimus had potential to be developed in this one, but it's an idea that is used to trick people to watch the movie. It's like the producer said: ""Just give him a sword and say that he's evil now. It'll make an amazing poster and trailer"". In reality that's just a mini subplot that gets resolved faster than it takes you to count the explosions in this movie.Did you want more focus on the actual Transformers characters? Well, forget it. Because instead you get Anthony Hopkins hamming it up with a bunch of unnecessarily complicated exposition. The entire cast is wasted. I like many of the actors here, but not a single one of them is able to save the day. Megatron is back by the way and his design is pretty neat. Shame that he barely has a presence as a main villain. What a shame. And, yes. I get it, it's supposed to be a fun energetic blockbuster. The truth is that I have enjoyed a few of the previous installments. I know they are not good, but they have at least been entertaining ""dumb movies"" that I can have a laugh at. Here they just seem to take themselves too seriously and the jokes are all forced. It just wasn't fun. I kept checking my watch so many times while watching it. We've seen this before so many times. The action has OK moments and the effects are pretty good. Some of the Imax shots are nice to look at as well. But, it all feels so uninspired. It's like it's on autopilot.You can probably skip this one. The medieval knight stuff was alright and the ending fight with the Transformers was OK like I said. But why did have to take over 2 hours just to get there? It's not even worth it.

139,anthonyf94,Graal with robots,5,30 August 2019,"Transformers are now well known, so the mystery of the firsts film is completely absent. The problem in this chapter is essentially the relationship between human beings and aliens, with a part of man that want to help them and a part that want to destroy them. Moreover, the transformer side is at the same divided, like the previous films, between those that want a pacific live on Earth and those that don't. These oppositions create the plot development that, however, at a certain point evolves in an esoteric discours: as the prologue made understand, Merlin and cavaliers are introduced and the mechanism of the story is based on the recherche of a sword (a Graal recherche-like idea), that allows to Mark Wahlberg to become a safety medieval-like hero. So, as a lot of Micheal Bay movies, and consideringly that's the five chapter of the saga, this ""Transformers"" is just a mix of different and incoherent elements, build just to carry on the show, that's the real aim of this kind of cinema. In fact the only thing that can result interesting is the giant animation, that reveals how the interesting is just the entertainment.

I wouldn't even call it a movie because watching this it feels like dozens of trailers cut together. The previous films hat simple plots. I mean it is a blockbuster-popcorn flick so that is to be expected. But this time you need to find a plot in this mess. The story is told and edited so poorly that you never have a clear understanding of what is that needs to be accomplished. Why Anthony Hopkins singed up for that is beyond me. Nobody could make this script and these dialogues work. And because every Transformers movie needs to be 150 minutes it was by far the most painful movie experience in 2017!,Transformers - The Last Knight
141,just_in_case,Actually fell asleep,1,23 September 2017,"It's kind of painful because the 4&5 movies are interesting conceptually. I dug the concepts like human made transformers, the transformers actually being a slave class and the idea that humans would obviously come to fear and outlaw them. That never seems to be the issue with transformer movies. It's always the pacing and dialog. I watch a lot of Korean and Asian cinema generally and the dialog whether it be subtitled or dubbed is always at least a little confusing. Thats one of the hallmarks of a good film. That the scenes can convey the message well enough that you can sort out the dialog. This movie is the opposite end of the spectrum. The pacing, establishing shots and dialog are so bad I was constantly confused about what was going on. Transformers from all over the galaxy are crash-landing on earth at a rate so high they have forces dedicating to killing them on impact rather than trying to sort out good guys and bad guys. Neat. Cade has creating a haven for good ones. Neat. They're hiding out from the government, Then it all falls apart. Megatron has hostages and trades them for the freedom over the lamest possible decepticons. the task force decides to let them know where cade is so that can trap the decepticons. So they know where Cade is, have been ignoring him, but instead of warning him they show up later? and ignore the decpticons and attack cade? what? They fight off the decepticons then the task force and anthony hopkins shows up something something england prophesy, oh also Optimus thinks the makers hurt cybertron even though he blew it up in the 3rd movie and there's this obnoxious British model whos supposed to be a professor but she sucks...look I know what you're thinking ""man this review is just meandering and rambling."". Actually I'm trying to give you a sense of the confusing nonsensical plot of this movie. Also I literally fell asleep during the england prophesy stuff. I will genuinely try and rewatch it, but I really gotta admit. This may actually be the worst Transformers movie. It's dull and difficult to watch.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I could not stop thinking how many independents films could have been made very well with very engaging and original stories and this so called film transpired. I liked the transformers franchise and I was so disappointed with this film I felt I was ripped off for buying the coke and the popcorn prior to seeing this. Don't know where this leaves the franchise, but its time for an executive change or some sort. I also find kinda interesting that their star systems happens not to work. Gees I wonder why. Maybe too many people broke the one button. Anyhow, watch this mess at your own risk. I was terribly disappointed. So much so that I started thinking of all the things I had to do, and finally left to go do them and hour or so into this. Don't know what else to say.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Lots of actions but lack of solid story, which was cheesy and has similar plot like the previous ones; simply put, getting some items that could destroy or save the world that ends in some massive battles. The first transformer was best, but it's getting worse and worse the more they do it, with the 4th and 5th similarly bad, that have too many silly jokes that ain't funny at all which downgrades the movie.

144,Wililjam,"Visual eye-candy, nothing more..",5,22 September 2017,"I had my hopes up with this movie, and I was actually NOT disappointed. This movie was better than AOE, in my opinion. Its story was stupid at times and pretty cool at some times. It wasn't a masterpiece. It was more of a visual eye-candy thing, nothing more. Mark Wahlberg returns once again as the character ""Cade Yaeger"", we also see a few cameos from different characters that could've been used in a better way. Josh Duhamel returns as ""Colonel William Lennox"", and I'm sure they added him in the cast just to say that he was back because he literally did nothing except screaming commands at people. John Turturro returns as ""Agent Simmons"", and he's used as a ""here's that thing, bye bye"" -character. He was underused to say the least.The story is the usual Transformers story, ""the world will end if we don't stop (insert character name here)"" which is pretty lame. I've had enough of movies where the world will end, but wont because there's one, or more, heroes that will save the world! It's overused in big movies, and I hope that they discontinue that story-line. What I did like in the movie was the whole King Arthur thing, it was unexpected and refreshing. I also liked how they wrote Wahlberg's character, it wasn't as stupid as AOE, it was still stupid but not as stupid.The visual effects turned me on. It was the thing that made me rate this movie 6/10. You could really see how they've transformed, tihi, and improved the visual effects from movie to movie. I especially liked the latter part of the movie, that's when the visual effects are fully used. If you want to be mesmerized by visual effects, you should watch the movie. If you are easily triggered by bad dialogue, mute the movie and enjoy. It's not a perfect movie, but it's certainly entertaining if you've had a few shots.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The special effects are truly something to admire, but sadly, they are not enough to once again distract us from the film's uninteresting protagonists, stereotypical and unfunny comic relief characters and disorienting action sequences. If that wasn't bad enough, ""Transformers: the last knight"" actually manages to have a plot so hard to follow, so stupid and so nonsensical that it makes the others look well written by comparison.",Transformers - The Last Knight
146,Endless_01,"Bland and overly long, a failed mess.",5,20 June 2019,"The last delivery of the repetitive Transformers saga ended up being another vague attempt to get tons of quick money without charisma, without passion and without creativity. An incesaria sequel, (like all others) that sincerely no one remembers or mentions in just 2 years after its premiere. And for good reason.The Last Knight is another outrageous attempt to keep the Transformers saga producing money, however, this ended up being the exception to be a bigger failure than expected, both for the box office and for the critics, which was not to be expected. Perhaps the only thing salvageable in the movie are the Transformers themselves, which are still entertaining to see and appreciate, from their personalities to their effects, although at this point are no longer the best. Bay's direction, already overused, becomes incredibly slow and unnecessary, catastrophic and exaggerated, with no feeling or respect for the fans of the original saga. The performances are a disaster, as expected, none of the actors manages to give an excellent job, all seem to be worked in a forcible way. The cinematography is not saved either, it becomes a combination of explosive scenes with bad angles to appreciate the action, it also has a stupid and inncesario script that keeps adding nonsense things that seem to break the rules of the saga they have created. The only thing that can be saved are the effects, and they remain the same as always, however I respect and appreciate the work that the VFX artists do to create the Transformers, being a rather late and tedious work, they manage to do it in an exceptional way, although with a terrible artistic direction they don't have much to work with.Another point to highlight is how long this movie feels, two and a half hours that seem to be 4 hours, reaches a point where despite the action scenes, which we have seen so many times, without feeling, without action, without innovation, end up becoming quite boring for every minute that passes. It's not worth it, it's another simple indignant film with no soul.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The movie is 95 % stereotypical CGI packed, non-sensical, forced, fake garbage. But it does earn 2 stars however... for Anthony Hopkins performance which is always stellar and the fact that the beginning premise ( medieval setting, alien interference with human history etc etc.) is ""And pay attention now, Michael Bay"" DIFFERENT!!!! And interesting. I was not gonna review this because why the hell bother. Everyone else have said what needs to be said. But after hearing Anthony Hopkins tell people to quote: "" Shut up"". Screaming it, I found myself raising my hand towards the screen, nodding, thinking: ""THANK YOU... just THANK YOU."" Because that is exactly what you want everyone to god damn do in this movie. To just shut the hell up and get to the point. There is so much meaningless dialog, pointless fluff, forced, out of place attempts at staging romance, partial nudity scenes that are so weird and fake. As staged as it gets...The movie doesn't know if it wants to be serious, comedic, dramatic, historical, scary. So it combines it all. And the result is as always a complete and total cluster#### of disastrous proportions. I personally find it impressive of Michael Bay. Because its like he has not only told the same damn story 5 times now and MORE is coming. Yes. Another Transformers movie is coming in 2019, and a solo Bumblebee movie too. But furthermore... somehow he keeps suckering people to buy tickets and go to the Cinema. Hah. I didn't. I saw it online. And I'm god damn glad I did. Because if there is one way to summarize this movie it is by simply saying: This movie is made for dumb people. It is specifically created, edited, written, directed, and pieced together carefully for people who will watch ANYTHING, pay for ANYTHING and disregard talented cinematography, emphasis on consistent story telling, fleshing out interesting characters with depth and Likability. Let alone telling the story itself in a way that allows you to get invested. The plot is as basic as it gets and I was actually stunned at how the primary antagonist was displayed and for how long. Optimus goes to find his maker, for reasons... Optimus finds maker who is an evil robot maker god thingy. Maker is evil, brainwashes Optimus and demands loyalty because she is the Maker ( By the way, what Im describing all happens within the timespan of 2-3 minutes. I'm not leaving out depth or dialog. This is exactly what happens.) Evil maker tells optimus to destroy earth because reasons... Later we find out that the reason for the destruction is apparently due to some extremely old prophecy belonging to either fiction or celtic history. I honestly cannot be bothered to find out as I'm writing this because the movie doesn't go to any degree to to explain that to us so WHY SHOULD I ?! But thats Michael Bay, ladies and gentlemen. Who f'ing cares... explosions, rushed phase, overly long movies ( which I don't mind... unless its packed with fluff) stereotypes, LOTS of screaming from everyone and loud, obnoxious dialog, forced, cheap romance, nudity that makes characters act like horny teenagers because thats the intended focus group. The list goes on and you get the point. So yes. These are my thoughts. This is not a review, this is not even a rant. This is what I consider the final nails in the coffin because I just can't be bothered to give a damn about this franchise anymore. Because its so incredibly obvious that even a blind person could tell that Bay doesn't give a remote damn in hell about treating his viewers like intellectuals. And considering people keep paying to watch this... maybe he shouldn't either. Its currently earned $278,068,996 worldwide. Budget was at 217 million. Whether it'll fail or not, I don't know nor really care. Because the fact that it's already earned back its budget and more highlights that there is a market for these films regardless of this outrageous cinematography and talentless directing. Something I will never understand when I am a person who can appreciate mindless action that can be enjoyed without caring much, but see no reason at all to watch this movie ever again. Its sad. because I enjoy the idea. Aliens connected to old human history, affecting our development and all this interesting stuff. But when you have a director that portrays world leaders as indifferent jocks that call scientists geeks and have no interest in what they have to say... how am I supposed to take any of it seriously? Let alone what I've mentioned earlier... Worlds about to end but HEY. Lets have Mark Wahlberg remove his shirt and the chick get all blushy. You kidding me? All in all, I'll end on where I started. Michael Bay... just shut up and go away. Or begin making movies that cater at least a BIT to intelligent movie goers that would enjoy a movie that could at least take itself SOMEWHAT serious.Final note: This movie would have been way more interesting had it been about medieval times, different transformers interacting with King Arthur and Merlin, exploring legends, and all that good stuff. Now that would have been truly creative. Fantasy, Sci Fi, Aliens and magic. All intertwined to much greater extent. But hey. That would be creative... something I cannot credit Bay for being. Not even when he was playing with the idea at the start of the movie which just makes it even more sad when he figuratively return to streamline formula. I enjoy the action, concept. But its all ruined due to the fluff, irrelevancy, stupidity and annoyances.",Transformers - The Last Knight
153,garethvk,Easily The Wiorst Film In The Series,4,22 June 2017,"Director Michael Bay is back with ""Transformers"" The Last Knight"", and even before the Paramount logo could fade; Bay's trademark fire and explosions light up the screen.  This is a big indication of what is to come as from the start we are bombarded with fire, explosions, and lots of slow motion shots of people being thrown about. The film  stars Mark Wahlberg as  Cade Yeager who continues to try to help the Autobots despite being declared illegal for their destructive war with the Decepticons which has left a path of human death and destruction in its wake. While Cade runs afoul of the government, he reluctantly helps those in need including a young girl named Izabella (Isabela Moner), who also has a soft spot for the kind Autobots. The two warring factions are in a race to find a mythical object that they believe will restore they damaged home world but of course, will lay waste to the Earth in the process.  One would say OK with this storyline we have enough to work with. Unfortunately the film keeps cramming in plot points and subplots that do not really go anywhere. We are introduced to characters that appear important and then vanish for most of the film without contributing much of any significance. The audience is also bombarded with a barrage of chases, action sequences and of course; fiery explosions after another but without anything in the form of suspense or excitement. Sir Anthony Hopkins appears and for a few moments I had hopes that the film would start to be more coherent and gain some focus, but thanks to his erratic and annoying character and even more annoying robotic butler, the film almost becomes unwatchable. It was like watching a two-plus hour FX reel for people with short attention spans. The dialogue is groan inducing even for an action film and it seems as if every character can only say Sh*t when they are frustrated or stressed. I do not expect a great plot, acting, or writing for a film based on a popular toy series but we have seen much better examples in the prior films.It seems that Bay is so content to simply let the very impressive visuals of the film carry the day and things such as a plot, character development, and a brisker run time simply got in the way of his desire to blow more things up and fill each shot with as many FX sequences as possible regardless of how annoying they were and if they were needed at all.I am not a Michael Bay basher as has a solid track record of success and you know what you are getting with him. But if the franchise is to move forward, it will need an infusion of fresh ideas and creativity as this was borderline unwatchable at points.  The fans and the franchise deserve much better than this effort.2 stars out of 5",Transformers - The Last Knight

155,christophershobris,Glad this is Bay's Last,1,27 June 2017,"Yes, if this is Michael Bay's last Transformers film to direct or have any sort of involvement with I will be happy. Now maybe we can get a director who actually cares about the source material. This film reflects on what Bay is about, good effects, but a flat script, characters that are pointless, and awkward humor. This is the 5th film and you'd think by now it would've improved. Nope, its just as bad if not worse then the last. At least those were somewhat entertaining, this is just flat-out boring. Nothing of interest happens, and the running time is just unnecessary. The only areas I liked in the film was the opening scene. An epic battle of warriors and a three-headed dragon. It proved that Bay can direct action and epic quality. But afterwards, it takes a steep downward spiral into oblivion. Not even Anthony Hopkins can save this mess. A disappointing film indeed and a weak conclusion to a franchise that had such high hopes in the beginning.

156,thisseatofmars,"Yeah, it's dumb, but if you hate on this movie you ain't superior.",7,5 July 2017,"Ever watch a young boy smashing together action figures and making soft ""ka-boom"" noises under his breath? Ever wonder what's going on in his head? See this movie, dude. Thinking of this movie as the projection of a child's mind-- namely one of those action-figure battles-- almost makes this movie meta-art. Almost. I know it's loud and kind of dumb, but it's a movie based on children's toys. Come for the explosions and accept it for what it is.Whoa, what? This movie's for kids? No, not really-- Transformers is for anyone who wants to switch their brains off for two hours and enjoy some big noises, bright colours, and robots, man... robots just kicking the tar out of each other. This movie just-- *clips* along: boom-bada-boom-boom-bada-scene-scene-scene: blink and you've missed about ten cuts. It will never match the insane energy and pure visual storytelling of Mad Max: FR, but that's unfair; MM:FR is one of the best films of all time: but Transformers is good enough to satisfy your octane fix. If you've moved on from MM:FR and want cars and explosions and things going smashy-smash-smash you really can't do better.By the way, I absolutely loved Anthony Hopkins AND the robot butler. Those two were spot-on perfect: funny, likable, boom. I wish, wish, wish that we could have a spin off film focusing on that Butler working with Hopkins, or at least someone like Hopkins' character in this film. Can't you see it? I envision the story something like a globetrotting espionage film, the duo following a trail only to uncover a conspiracy (a conspiracy surrounding giant robots, ohyesplease.) Anyway, more Cogman, please.I have two complaints: first, too many humans. Hopkins works well not because he's the only legit actor in this picture but he's featured sparingly. A lot of the humans don't need to be here, and we came for the robots.Secondly, the scene with the Native sheriff. Early on in the film, Wahlberg's character (Cade) has a run in with a sheriff who is First Nations. Their exchange goes something like this: Cade: Hey, Chief! Sheriff: Hm-mmm. Cade: What? Aren't you the Chief of your tribe? Sheriff: Yeah, but coming from you it sounds kinda... racist....Wow. What are we trying to achieve in using ""racist"" with this guy-- the human hero of this film, no less-- in such a short exchange? Although the chief didn't do it outright, calling a person a racist is a slur. Imagine being labelled as a racist for calling a Chief a Chief: that ain't fair. And besides, why focus on what makes you different rather than what we have in common? Oh well. It's all good apart from that. I think my favourite line is spoken by Cogman: ""Of all of the Earls I've served, sir, you were, by far... the coolest."" Not the bravest, not the most kind, not the kindest... but the coolest.Yeah, dude.",Transformers - The Last Knight

158,feyipuk,"Enough material for four films, but put together as less than one",6,25 May 2018,"The Transformers films are basically a vehicle for selling toys, and this one is no different. Along with another version of Optimus and Bumble Bee, they introduce another wave of Autobots and Decepticons that can then be turned into plastic and sold. This need to reinvent the robots in disguise for every film dilutes other aspects of the film at the expense of the story. As such, this film, for the most part, plays out like a kid whose grabbed a handful of various toys - robots, knights, fast cars - and is just making up a story to fit them all in.Every film has included Optimus sending out a broadcast calling more of his kind to Earth, to the point where humans seem to have locked up an army of Decepticons, have Autobots just lying in the streets, and given free reign to sort out the alien issue to some kind of anti-Transformer army - the TRF (Transformers Reaction Force ) - who go around shooting first, asking questions later...but we don't get much information or back story about them, other than Josh Duhamel is back from the original films - apparently getting his second promotion from being Captain Lennox in the first Transformer film to being Colonel Lennox here - and though Tyrese Gibson isn't by his side this time, Lennox seems to be in the thick of the action, alongside plenty of military muscle.
At times it feels like there should have been more made of the TRF and what they've done or their actual objectives, but the film jumps so much, they end up just blending in with the American military. John Turturro - formerly of Sector Seven - is back, but there's no explanation as to what he's actually doing.
Likewise, they could have made more use of Izabella (Isabela Moner); whose backstory is slightly brushed over and shows more emotion than most of the other actors. While I'm not sure if Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael) is there to provide comic distraction with the absence of Tyrese, but they could have removed him to make more space for more development of other character.Optimus spends much of the film off on a different mission that seems lifted from an episode of Dr Who - #GallifreyRises - which seems mainly set up for another sequel. Yet, the crux of the story is Arthurian legend; dragons and swords, knights and honour, letting the production use plenty of olde British icons, which includes Sir Anthony Hopkins as a doddery old Lord - seemingly trying to bridge the first three Transformers films (the Shia LaBeouf ones) with the new series - alongside Downton Abbeys Jim Carter, basically reprising the role he played in the period drams...sort of. While the incredible Laura Haddock - who I loved in Da Vinci's Demons - is a highly educated, extremely well read, Oxford graduate...which doesn't really matter for the main reason for her role in saving the planet 
Ok, there's obvious cinematic license when it comes to filming locations in well known places. A car chase in London - that's in 'England, Uk', as opposed to just being in 'England' - will make use of well known landmarks; Tower Bridge, the Mall by Buckingham Palace, the Square Mile around the Bank of England, etc. They're a bit spread out, but it's not impossible.
HMS Alliance is based down on the south coast, in Gosport, meaning they supposedly fly from America and land near the White Cliffs of Dover, yet need to go to London to get to the sub, which they could have got to without touching the Capital. 
It could have been worse; ESA/JPL looks to have moved to London's iconic egg shaped City Hall. Opening a window there, they could practically throw a rock at any ships sailing under Tower Bridge!But then physics does seem to take a back seat to the set piece. Whether it's deep under the sea, zooming around in the high atmosphere or simply skidding around cities, the action is constantly moving to the point you forget what the characters mission is supposed to be and wonder how they're able to keep running without throwing up!",Transformers - The Last Knight
159,theemuhammede,Where were the Transformers,6,22 June 2017,"There were many high hopes for this movie, and they were let down. The trailers were too deceiving for the expectation that was set going into this. The trailers were misleading in multiple ways.The trailers made the Last Night seem like it was Optimus Prime. But he was not the Last Night. It was in fact Cade Yeager, played by Mark Wahlberg. It took away from the Transformers side of the movie, and it added more of the humanistic side to the movie. If anything, I believe it weakened the strength of the story's plot.Optimus Prime turned, and that was awesome because he seemed like he was going to be a bounty hunter similar to Lockdown in ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"". Lockdown was the best Transformers villain; he had zero mercy and he was ruthless. Now that Optimus Prime had turned to Nemesis Prime, I was expecting the same. But this was the biggest let down in the movie. Nemesis Prime lasted for a few minutes of total screen time, then he was Optimus Prime again. It was actually quite annoying and disappointing. The only good that came from it was his fight with Bumblebee, but it ended quickly.The plot of the movie was too scattered. It would show some humanistic scenes, then it would show some Transformers doing something that was not interesting. It kept on going back and forth. The movie was missing the giant showdown for the second half of the move as all of the previous movies did. I was waiting for that consistent screen time of Transformers fighting all over, but it really did not happen. This goes with why I did not like the fact that Cade Yeager was the Last Night. The last Night should have been a Transformer, if not Optimus Prime.Quintesson, the creator of all the Transformers, was cool; however, she was not as powerful as she seemed. She really did not do much to make an impact on the story. The final fight between her and Optimus Prime was pointless because she was defeated in practically one hit. What was the point of her?It was good to see Megatron again. I was hoping that they would not bring back Glavatron from ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" because he was a complete and total joke with is giant hole going through his chest. Really? But the real issue I have with Megatron is that he always has this master plan to take over the world, but he is always defeated in a few hits. Instead of focusing on taking over the world, how about you learn how to fight first.Many of the Transformers were being killed extremely easily. It was a buzzkill to see that happen. It happened multiple time to both the Autobots and the Decepticons. This really took away from the feel for the Transformers fight as shown in previous movies.Overall, I really did not care for this movie. The special effects and CGI (computer generated images) were spectacular, but the story and action kept me waiting. If you are going into this movie with high standards and expectations, you may be walking out with many of them broken.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Maybe this time around people will look past the explosions and ""cool scenes"" and see what this film truly is because even the cool looking scenes did absolutely nothing for me. This film is a mess of absolute crap. The studio, the film, whoever, they continue to throw whatever they want at their audience regardless of how pointless or out of nowhere it is. Right when I thought that it could not get any worse than Age of Extinction, The Last Knight arrives.

Together, using the tools of the past, the humans and Autobots must stop them from destroying the Earth.I'm not going to lie, I'm that type of person that just doesn't care about the Transformers franchise as a whole. I've never played with the toys, I haven't watched the cartoon series, nor have I seen any of the movies until recently. I just don't care about the Transformers series. I watched the first movie and strangely liked it as a guilty pleasure and I saw the second one and hated everything about it except the CGI, and judging from the reviews of the third and fourth, I don't seem to be missing much.Onto this movie, it copies the basic plot structure from the first two. The beginning goes into the lives of the humans, in this case, Cade and Izabella. The humans (and Autobots) are come across the evildoers, notably the Decepticons. The plot revolves around some type of plot device. The humans and Autobots work their way around the enemies and win the battle against them, the end. It is no different here except how the acts go. The first act was okay as it sets up the plot's events and has some good action with the robot, and then there's the second act. It was absolutely dull, lackluster, forgettable and worst of all, it dragged. It was so slow and meandering that I ended up being half asleep for most of it. There were very little fight scenes with the transformers, which is what people come to the movies for, not to mention the fact that Optimus Prime was barely seen in this act and that's one reason why people go to see the Transformers movies. There were kids sitting right next to me that looked completely bored watching that part of the movie.Luckily things do pick up in the third act with a well stylized finale and fantastic effects. There is a lazy cliché, however, that really bothered me while watching this act. Let me ask you this, how do you think the Autobots got Optimus Prime back onto the good side? Bumblebee talks to him, plain and simple. I'm just saying that it's a stupid and lazy writing move that just feels forced. When I saw that happen, I wanted to jump out of my seat and yell ""What?! Are you kidding me?!""The human characters all feel one note and are just forgettable except for maybe Izabella. I can hardly remember their names as a matter of face except for hers. If there's at least one good thing about the movie, it's that, like the other Transformers movies, the effects and CGI look fantastic. The battles are also very well shot too, and they don't use a lot of that shaky cam that the earlier movies use.Even with all of the great looking effects, it's still another Transformers sequel and a bad one at that. This movie is bland, watered down, draggy, predictable and clichéd and acts as yet another unnecessary Transformers movie.4/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
163,Kirollos-Noah,Here we go again! MEH....,3,13 September 2018,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a new movie in the ups and downs franchise! This franchise started very well, and then went very bad, then ""oh, there is a chance"", to the best of the franchise, and when I finally thought that there's finally a way to save this franchise, they made Transformers: The Last Knight!When the opening credits started, I was like ""oh, the Paramount logo is accompanied by a series of robotic sounds. and fireballs are flying everywhere, this definitely gonna be a great movie!"". Turns out, I was wrong! Actually it's a good movie, but not like Transformers: Age of Extinction -BTW, it's my favorite movie in the franchise-.About the opening credits.. after the Paramount logo, I was thrilled, because of the epic battle, and disgusted because of the bad start of this movie, and the bad-acting! By saying ""The bad start"" I mean why did they know Merlin and how did he have contract with the Transformers and how all of that's happening?!The whole movie was sometimes fine and sometimes very bad! The jokes were seriously unnecessarily. Until we reach to the fight of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the one that I was really waiting for, lasts only for 02:45 min. I was like ""Com'on it's 02:34:38 movie, and all what I get is 02:45 min?"" BTW, the length of this movie is so long, and that made me bored!Back to the fight, how did Bumblebee speak? And how did that change Optimus Prime? This movie is just an open-questions movie!The young actress Isabela Moner as Izabella was actually overreacting at everything she did!The soundtrack and the CGI were really good. Beside the action sequence, it was very good!So, Transformers: The Last Knight is a ""just fine"" movie! And I'm gonna give it a 6/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Human gunpowder can defeat everything. 🤣Watched the movie in the cinema. Never been a fan of transformers before. I was a totally new, and my mom is not a good commentator, she can never explain things briefly clear. So enter Transformers 5, it took me about 20 mins, figured out the belonging team of each character. The way I recognized is the eye color of each auto man, green is good, red is bad. Optimus Prime is purple because he was enticed by an evil queen. It usually took me the last few minutes to figure out Optimus Prime's team because I didn't know he was the main character since the Transformer 1.I had aesthetic fatigue with cars, guns, heroes, beauty, and love. Transformer 5 has more, they even added old man, kids, and dogs, what a terrible overload mixing.Besides, I went over the Transformers 1 after Transformers 5; simply put in Transformers 1, it challenged my logical function, the movie full of loopholes. I can't figure out a reason why boys like so. Transformers and their sequels, to me, they're like a money-making machine, earn money from their old fans passion. In hurry to make the money, it has no logic, the movie makes no senses to the bystanders like me. During the movie, I kept to doubt why human still live after every fighting, ""he should break his bone from this to that, that explosion is huge balabala, why he still alive."" Probably I am one of the worst audiences in the world who always hoping the hero to die.Lastly, great fighting screen, I like all the explosions and world destroying.

168,sujanfaster,"Roars, but a little too louder",7,9 July 2017,"Transformers series is the drug that Michael Bay just cannot get enough of. Michael Bay churns out of something out of nothing to bring yet another movie in the franchise, Transformers: The Last Knight. He has managed to retain Mark Wahlberg to play Cade Yaegar again and also rope in big names such as Sir Antony Hopkins and Stanley Tucci to up the star quotient. His new choice for the typical hot female lead is the British actor Laura Haddock and full marks to Michael bay on that. The movie begins in a historic setting showing how Transformers allied with humans ages ago. Currently Cade Yaegar is trying to save some of the remaining Transformers which are being hunted by the humans. Then there is Sir Edmund Burton in England trying to find some historic connection with an apocalyptic event that might be happening soon. At the far end, Optimus Prime returns to his planet Cybertron only to find it dead and abandoned. Add to this, there is a young rebel girl with a little Transformer of her own who tags along with Cade Yaegar coz she got nowhere else to go. So confusing already right? The movie is about how all these things connect together to a point where a small artifact can save the earth (again). Transformers: The Last Knight has some really good visuals and many gossebumps. It is thoroughly enjoyable for some audiences (including me) if you are ready to endure the 150 minutes. But for others it might be yet another boring action movie with loaded clichés (about British among many other things). The title may mislead you to think this is 'the last', but there is more coming.",Transformers - The Last Knight
169,trevor-82944,Did We Seriously Not Learn Anything?,1,21 June 2017,"It is part war movie, part historical epic, part romantic comedy, part slapstick comedy, part disaster movie, and one-hundred-percent disaster. Honestly, were we expecting anything else to criticize about Transformers: The Last Knight? Well, a lot more can be said.The film opens 1,600 years ago in the dark ages of England, where King Arthur fights in a war along with his fellow knights, using fire cannons. No explanation comes up as to what started the battle, just what ended it. Basically, the wizard Merlin seeks out a spaceship to request help from the autobots. Yes, you read that right. Cybertron, along with a three-headed metal dragon, helped the knights of the round table triumph. I fail to understand why all these big movies suddenly decided to dump all over the Arthurian legend, but unlike the barely better King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, the disrespect goes further by victimizing London's ancestry.Yeah, I know, we have to suspend our disbelief with anything big released during the Summer, but there must be limitations. Anthony Hopkins' narration wants us to believe Stonehenge's original purpose was to be a portal, for crying out loud!The early trailers wanted to press the popular ""girl power"" mentality, when, in actuality, The Last Knight, like the previous four installments, cares only about making girls look acceptable for a thirteen-year-old's Sports Illustrated calendar. The series' new forgettable sexy young woman works at Oxford University, because only in the Bay-Universe can combined beauty and brains still come off as dumb. Even the fifteen-year-old actress here has to run in a loose bra and low-cut white tank top. The men do not get much better treatment either, as Mark Wahlberg awkwardly poses shirtless, six-pack in all its glory, for no apparent reason.The mercilessly long runtime continues Bay's plague of insulting woman as well as anybody of color. The one Black guy, played by the only actor in the entire film who seems to be trying, reflects the old caricature almost to a tee; one of the returning Japanese warrior autobots continues mocking every Asian viewer; French accents are mocked for sounding unnatural; then Native Americans take the hardest beating as the sole red-skinned individual gets comically nicknamed ""Chief."" Meanwhile, the true heroes in the spotlight gleam in pure red, white, and blue with the stripes and the stars.These shallow indistinguishable characters sway the balance scale with enough frustration to make you hate the human race. The worst new addition, an Irish butler autobot; resembles C-3P0 with a mannerism reflecting the Annoying Orange, and receives way too much screen time. None of the other characters, old or new, goes through any sort of inner change from the war besides the underused Optimus Prime.None of these lousy walking cardboard figures appeared serious about acting as a career—they just wanted to star in a major production guaranteed to make 2.1 billion dollars worldwide. Though the blame for their performance lands more on the purely expositional dialogue constantly interrupted by long, boring jokes. It almost seems like the team of six editors resorted to a rushed first draft of their process.Each big action scene these editors had to work their way around felt like a climactic battle, which in turn made the final scene look pretty dang close to the infamous ""light beam from the sky"" climax. While the perfectly timed music and sound effects allow the right cinematic submersion you hoped for, Michael Bay forgets about all the Arthurian Legend fanfiction to give the visual effects crew a chance to show off (badly).All this roleplaying subliminally wants regular people to think they are more qualified to save the world than the pentagon, yet the ""regular people"" here show fewer signs of human life than the high-tech artificial intelligence. How can we resonate with an extraterrestrial robot which can turn into a car owned by a billionaire? They seem less like complex souls with fears and dreams, and more like subliminal messaging to hate the government while living dependent on expensive materialistic needs to sustain our humanity.Also, as a side note: When I went to purchase my ticket (on a Tuesday by the way) forty minutes beforehand, the house was already nearly sold out. So, we now know how our condition remains unchanged from sixty years ago: The United States is still holding itself back from the rest of the world.",Transformers - The Last Knight

172,Oneirosophos,Transformers: Goodnight,5,28 June 2017,"OK... I'm a TF fan since I've started talking. I have loved and hated series and movies of the franchise equally, because this is what a true fan does: being truthful to himself. As long as Bayverse is concerned, I almost loved the first movie, I utterly hated the disgrace & abomination of the second, I liked a lot the third and I found the fourth a bit indifferent, although I liked some new characters.The fifth has equally good and bad things. They have improved somethings but worsen others.Let's start from the few good things. They finally started building some mythology. They showed us ACTUAL combiners. And of course, they lessen the awful sex jokes and stupid nerd characters. So, as you can imagine, everything else was between disappointing to awfully rushed. The whole concept, although it was quite interesting, was hammered down by ""marketing intervention"". The kids were a huge filler, lasting about 30'! Almost nothing from this mythology is explained! Exposition is awfully rushed and Decepticons were merely supporting cast.So, about the synopsis...After Age Of Extinction events, TF's have been coming all the time to Earth as refugees, and Optimus & Megatron are missing. Wahlberg's character is rescuing and hiding Autobots in a junkyard (like that one in TF RID), until he meets a girl who is doing the same thing. A special force is trying to take down all TF's worldwide with mechs and drones. But Optimus is revealed to have gone to ruined Cybertron that Quintessa (!?) wants to resurrect by killing Earth, who is in fact Unicron (!?!?!?!). So Quintessa transforms Optimus to Nemesis and sends him to bring her the stuff of Merlin the drunk wizard, which can also use the Witwicky family, who are in fact kinda Powermasters (!?!?!??!). Then the 12 knights of Unicron intervene, while Megatron with a suicide squad of Decepticons try to steal the stuff for themselves and US marines try to help and BOOM EXPLOSIONS. Finally Earth/Unicron is saved, Optimus is saved by the power of friendship when Bee gets his voice back (probably in time for his solo film) and Quintessa is now a pretender.Somewhere in-between, we have Anthony Hopkins as a TF researcher and savior in UK, his annoying headmaster (!??!?!!?) battler and the last descendant of Witwicky family, who reminds a lot of Megan Fox. And some flashing cameos. Also, some HEAVILY SQUEEZED MYTHOLOGY.So, this is it. I hope next movies have better script, different director and NO WHEELIE.",Transformers - The Last Knight
173,lale-ba,Pushing the limits,2,22 December 2017,"Will Michael Bay ever let go of one of the most famous child's franchises of the '80s, the one about the alien robots disguising into common objects? 
If there were some doubts, after the last installment of testosterone and cash driven high end production about the Autobots and Decepticons, ''The Last Knight"", now there isn't any.
Michael Bay will film Transformers until his death. The story won't matter any more, linking Stonehenge, submarines, wizard Merlin and his Knights of the Round table with Dinobots and dragon robots spitting fire while the Earth is being plowed by gigantic... turfs falling from the sky. Budget will keep rising, attracting such acting giants as Sir Anthony Hopkins. Effects will become more and more diverse, confusing and irrelevant. 
None of this will matter, since there will be more and more retarded stories about Transformers in the years to come, attracting the numbed audience just going into the theatres from the habit or because of the childhood memories.

174,OlieRendch,"Convoluted plot, terrible characters, ignores its own continuity.",5,4 July 2017,"So this is the fifth, that's right, fifth, film in the Bayformers franchise; and this is supposed to be the beginning; they got a special writers room with all these screenwriters and story guys to build an enormous cinematic universe with an epic story arc. So let's see what they came up with...I'll start with things I like. This film had some interesting visuals for sure. The sight of Transformers in the world of the medieval knights was certainly something I'd never thought I'd see and I enjoyed the aesthetic if nothing else. In fact, the first act of this film I did sort of enjoy; but I'm afraid my enjoyment didn't last.This movie is so convoluted, stupid and non-sensical that I cannot believe how far it has come since 2007. Transformers: The Last Knight reaches a new low by having even more pointless characters that don't factor into the plot at all, introductions where the name of the Transformer appears on the screen in a freeze frame, Optimus Prime has at least 20 mins of screen time, and it ignores it's own continuity over and over again, even from things it set up in the previous film! The dialogue was either exposition or unfunny humor, and I use the term ""humor"" loosely as it seems getting sophisticated British actors Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jim Carter to say modern slang and profanity counts as funny.Even if you enjoy the craziness of what this franchise has become, and you like the humor and aren't bothered with the plot, the actual filmmaking itself is terrible, from the constant change in aspect ratio to the very strange flashing end credits that appear while the film is still going!In the end, I did not enjoy Transformers: The Last Knight. It's still cool to see giant alien robots transform into vehicles, and it was cool to see Josh Duhamel return and be a connection to the first three films but there are so many factors that let it down for me that I have to give it a 5/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I really enjoyed this movie..,Transformers - The Last Knight
177,slicedbread117,A CinemaSins Gold Mine,1,16 August 2017,"To be clear right out of the gate, I decided to see this movie with my brother solely because of how bad and laughable we both knew it would be. Boy was I ever right. Not only does this film plummet the Transformers franchise even lower than Age of Extinction, (which I truly never thought was possible), but Transformers: The Last Knight (TLK) showcases an absolute abomination of film making in general, creating what essentially is a $200 million pile of steaming hot trash, a horrible disgrace to the Transformers name and the film industry as a whole.It's a tad bit difficult to explain what the TLK is really about, because, well, I don't really know. I know that the Decepticons are looking for another ancient relic on Earth to somehow bring Cybertron back to life, but that's about it. The overall narrative is so clustered with noise (metaphorical and literal), random occurrences, numerous undeveloped sub plots, gaping plot holes, relentlessly forced humor, and atrocious pacing that for most of the film, I was literally laughing out loud in the theater and once shouted, ""what the Hell is going on!?"". TLK has the writing depth of an illiterate monkey, and the narrative focus of a child. Trying to understand TLK's story is like trying to listen to a baby complete their first sentence; it's confusing as can be, incoherent and probably pretty comical. I can't even speak positively about the Transformers themselves being cool because the Transformers are BARELY IN THE MOVIE. There is so little Transformer-on-Transformer action, I thought I had just watched a 2.5 hour trailer teasing the big action scenes to come, but all I got was more pointless, unexplained human-lead garbage who run the show in a Transformers movie. The script is a complete mess to put it kindly, a blubbering, babbling heap of uncoordinated crap, and I can't believe it's actually more disjointed than Age of Extinction. TLK goes below the bottom of the barrel, and it's script should be put on trial.At this point in the dumpster fire that is the Transformers franchise, I feel bad for any poor actor that gets sucked into these films. Mark Wahlberg, a fan favorite of mine, has sunk to an all- time low with his performance as Cade Yeager. Sure the writing of the character, and every character mind you, was sincerely abysmal, but even still, there's no heart, no motive, no passion whatsoever to deliver even an OK performance. Wahlberg was unbearable. Even worse was Anthony Hopkins, whose character was written so poorly I thought it was actually a cruel joke on Hopkins. To see a legendary actor fall to the abyss is terrible, and TLK as brought him, along with any other victims of this plague of a film, to the lowest of the low. Stanley Tucci literally plays a different character than in the previous film and it's just oh so bad, not to mention Josh Duhamel got dragged back into this awfulness again, with his character being just completely and utterly useless. The performance, writing and development of every character was horrendously awful, period.As Transformers films have gotten worse over the years, the only piece of the movies I have been able to write positively about are the big-budget action scenes, which at the least, provided some entertainment outside of the unintentional entertainment delivered by the terribleness of the films. However, I can't even write home about the action in The Last Knight. Sure the CGI still looks great, but good grief, the action is limited (when it comes to Transformers actually fighting), graceless and down right bizarre. I have to write about one moment in particular, however. Anthony Hopkins' character suddenly reveals at one point that his cane is actually a machine gun, and his cane-gun prevents Megatron from accomplishing his mission. I laughed out loud and choked on my drink, it was the selling point for me as one of the worst movies I've EVER seen.I could rant about how bad this movie is for a long time, but at this point, I just don't care anymore. I spent more time thinking about how CinemaSins will lay into the film than paying attention the main story. My hope is that I can prevent any soul from watching this deplorable display of film. Even if you want to watch for how bad it is like me, save yourself and don't. Transformers: The Last Knight is one of the worst films I've seen in my life, it's unfathomably shameful.1/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
178,holyspiritdriven,Michael bay are You Done Yet?,3,8 July 2019,"This review is about The Last Knight but will about sum up my feelings of this franchise. As an 80's kid whose heros were Jesus, John Elway and Optimus Prime you can imagine my excitement when I heard the Autobots were coming to live action big screen in '07 (As a side note I was absolutely thrilled when I heard Peter Cullen's nostalgic voice in that fist movie) But I was quickly disappointed and with each sequel in this franchise it is like salt in an open wound. There is barely a thread in these movies of the basic fabric of what it even means to be The Transformers. Admittedly these movies are visually stunning and exciting. They are fun to watch and even have some pretty deep and layered plots. All that is great, but Bay, if you're going to change just about everything about the Autobots and Decepticons....why not just go make your own thing?
The things I cannot stand about these movies include (but are not limited to):
1. Obliterating the innocence of the original. When adapting a childhood favorite, you kill the essence by bringing in crude language and innuendos. Bringing a super hot, sexy chick is fun to look at but really is a just a distraction and has nothing to do with the story.
2. Character design. This is really the most annoying thing about these movies. The characters are so damn overly detailed it is hard to even realize what you're looking at half the time. I think a large part of what we loved about the Transformers in the 80's was their character design. Modern CGI artist have the ability to knock it out of the park and bring into reality those cars & trucks transforming into robots but here they just overdid the crap out of them and on top of it, gave them all these weird insect-like faces.
3. Tough chicks. *barf* This all Hollywood cares about anymore and I'm just over it. In the real world a tough-chick is a rarity - in the movies you'd think that's how all women are.
4. The ""transforming dance"". OK, on paper it sounds kind of cool, 'hey, let's make it like a break dance when they transform'. In reality it is just needlessly showy and seems to mask the actual transformation. Look, this entire story is about vehicles that transform into robots. Slow it down and lets see how that works. And don't tell me it doesn't: they did in the 80's cartoon and I have a dozen toys from that era that DO work.
5. Relentless action. OK, we all love action, but good grief, put in a breather every few scenes. The best way to really highlight a battle is surround it by quietness, not more battles.
6. Too much going on. Along the lines of that last point, this is the same reason I just can't with the Avengers franchise. Why on earth do the writers think they need to stuff EVERY character and EVERY storyline into the same movie and then ADD new characters? Do you even realize the The Last Knight really only deals with like four Autobots?? Where's Jazz and Ironhide and Powerglide and Cliffjumper? etc. etc. etc.
7. How do the humans even hold a candle to the robots whenever they fight? This is just unbelievable.
8. In The Last Knight, they ALMOST forgot to have Optimus transform. In a 2.5 hour movie about TRANSFORMERS, the main autobot transforms ONCE.
9. Is this movie about Mark Wahlberg and others about Megan Fox and Josh Duhamel and Shi LaBeouf and Anthony Hopkins? Or is it about the freakin' Transformers?
10. Why can Bumble Bee STILL not talk?....oh he kind of did in the end. And WHY does he not transform into a VW Beetle? Again Bay, go make your own thing.I could go on and on and I would if I knew Bay would read this and just stop. If you want to make us 80's kids happy how about this. Reboot this and scratch everything Bay did. Start all over. Make a period piece so that you can still keep all the same vehicles. Make them transform into what they originally did. Simplify the animation so you can see them transform. Make the movie about the AUTOBOTS. Maybe a little about Spike and Sparkplug but they are the SIDE characters. Keep it innocent enough for 7 year olds to go see. Try to approximate their original voices or go find those actors like they did with Cullen. Keep Peter Cullen though....definitely keep him at all costs. You don't need to write new storylines or add characters. The original was fine. Hell, ALL you need to do is remake the original cartoons just use modern CGI to make it live action. Mm k? Thanks.",Transformers - The Last Knight

They focused on the story a lot more than ever before, it's clearly visible that they don't wanna make a good looking cr*p as they did before with all the previous movies and it's ended up being called the worst when it's the best.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The problem with that is the whole point of making the film is lost...The script, the scenes, the choreography, everything!And that's whats wrong with this, so much effort has been made to make as much money as possible, that everything else went by the wayside. The script is appalling, to the point of embarrassing...I can see why, they thought hmm...Game of Thrones is successful, lets capitalise on that...FAIL! If you were a scriptwriter on this movie you should be ashamed and appalled, because you clearly turned up drunk on your first day and couldn't be bothered! The choreography - what is with the jittery screens, is it supposed to cause nausea, because that's all that ever comes from jittery screens, and why? The transformers transform, that creates enough jitter, why add more?! FAIL! And lets look at the screens....Errr 1600 years ago, a drunk Merlin that finds a not so well hidden massive space ship, gets given a mast after very little explanation, then proceeds to destroy enemies thus changing history irrevocably, hmmm, I am happy to suspend belief, but please, is this really happening? Oh and thats the first 10 mins! This film is an embarrassment for those associated with it and puts those people in a very different light in my opinion, as I don't believe they read the script and thought wow, what a great movie, and think it was more, wow, what a payday!

So I will give Transformers: The Last Knight an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Transformers: The Last Knight is worth seeing if you like action packed robot films like all the previous Transformers films, Pacific Rim, Real Steel, Battleship amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Transformers: The Last Knight in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Transformers - The Last Knight
186,rogier-86785,More miss than hit,4,23 June 2021,"A film like Transformers: The Last Knight doesn't need the greatest plot ever made to entertain. You know what you're getting going into it, but you always hope that the screenwriters and the director at least make an effort to create a good story, especially since the bar isn't set very high for teenage friendly action films like these. Right off the bat: while it does work on some levels, The Last Knight fails in delivering a compelling and even a consistent plot. And given the excellent cast of actors, that hurts.You can clearly see that with this latest spin on the Transformers story, director Michael Bay wanted to make his own Infinity Wars-like magnus opus, and failed. Most of the time I wouldn't care about another badly written Bay film, but with this one, it hurt a little. Why? Well, the film has an excellent start, with a group of children trying to take it out big stumpy robots, and my expectations went up a little, hoping we'd get to see more of their younger point of view on a planet that now holds Transformers. But that of course doesn't happen.Quite quickly, we are back with Mark Wahlberg his character Cade Yaeger from the previous episode. I found this character, despite that god awful name, quite good actually. And his clichéd counterpart Vivian Wembley - played by Laura Haddock - is also very well acted. The film holds a big roster of high class actors (including Anthony Hopkins himself) that give it their best shot, but cannot save the horrendously bad script and the incredibly confusing, plot-hole-ridden editing of the film.So, the film had a great start, has excellent actors and has a long run time, which felt like a promise that maybe we'd finally get a consistent and engaging movie. That's why it hurts a little that under the direction of Michael Bay's millions upon millions of dollars, we again have a failed film.Here's to hoping someone can transform this franchise next time round.",Transformers - The Last Knight
187,jpachar82,The Fate of Human Existence,10,11 July 2017,"As we know the world will come to an end, eventually, but the question that remains on the minds of those of us, how will it come to an end? Spontaneous combustion? Jesus coming back? Alien attack? Alien robots taking over? That seems to be the question of the century. Here's another good question: Where were you when the Autobots came and helped our race from an all-out attack on our planet? Yes, you heard me correctly, Autobots. This movie review is not for the faint of heart, because this review goes back to 2007 when we were first introduced to the robot aliens of Cybertron. It has been 10 years since we were introduced to Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and their friends. But now, with this fifth installment to the Transformers franchise, all hell breaks loose. Now their world has come to ours and they will not take prisoners, they want the world called Earth annihilated and destroyed. Leading this all-star cast, Mark Wahlberg continues in his quest to help save our world. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers his best performance since Silence of the Lambs. Thank you, Michael Bay, for bringing your vision to us. We all thank you and we hope to see more of your work and talents in future films. As far as this movie is concerned, I know that the critics were bashing this new installment in the franchise, but this movie is best of all 5 combined. It is more than meets the eye.",Transformers - The Last Knight
188,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Still better than Revenge of the Fallen and Age of Extinction!!!,5,25 June 2017,"People are lying to themselves when they say this is the worst of the franchise because we've already hit rock bottom. I can't believe anyone that says otherwise I just cant, those two movies are the pinnacle of why Transformers sucks as a franchise. Revenge of the Fallen is a rushed product ""due to the writers strike"" if we are to believe that. Age of Extinction was borderline experimental for Michael Bay to see how many one of his trademarks he can fit into one film. While also shamelessly shilling out to Chinese audiences by placing the final action set piece in Hong Kong. Both are long, overstuffed, and exhausting in their third acts you just want to scream at Bay to get a better editor. So what does the Last Knight do better for me? It not only takes itself less seriously, but it kinda has fun with it? Don't get me wrong the trademarks or bayisms(if you will) are still there. I kept a scoreboard during the movie just to count. However the story was dare I say it, intriguing and creative. I like the idea of playing with history like they did with Dark of the Moon where as this time they deal with Merlin during King Arthur's time and how the Transformers have been lingering for centuries in all sorts of places. How did Hitler die you ask? Obviously it was a Transformer watch of course. Yes it's stupid but they acknowledge it. They're actually acknowledging how dumb these movies are FINALLY! They rip off Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Star Wars(they admit this one) etc. The new little girl is basically Rey from The Force Awakens, and ironically serves little to no purpose in the plot. It just proves someone's theory online that Bay attempts to make movies for specific demographics and this character was his way of getting young girls to see it. The pacing is all over the place and you could easily cut out so many characters/scenes out of the film and make it 90 minutes easily. I walked in expecting a dumb movie and I got it, but I finally had fun with it again. I do hope this Bay keeps his word this time and leaves for good because the franchise does indeed need a breath of fresh air. I have hope that Travis Knight will save it with the Bumblebee movie. If you haven't seen his last film Kubo and the Two Strings you need to watch and you'll understand why I say he's going to save the franchise if he's really directing it. I will say the most disappointing factor for me was the lack of Optimus, I swear he was in it for 5-10 minutes give or take. His action scenes are fantastic as always but it definitely needed more. It seems that the odd numbers are in this franchise's favor because so far I've enjoyed the first, third, and this movie. While I hated the second and fourth. So I expect Transformers 6 to not help any better should Bay most likely return. Go see it if you want to have a good laugh at how silly and dumb it is, that's the only way you can enjoy it. If you're sick of it then you don't have to see it it's more of the same. If you still enjoy aspects of it like myself then I'd say wait for a rental.",Transformers - The Last Knight

A lot is happening and I couldn't tell what it was all about.

Ergo: skip this one and use your money and time for something better....,Transformers - The Last Knight
195,MichaelNontonMulu,"Definitely not the best Transformers, but still worthy if u enjoy good special effects",7,21 June 2017,"Well as a sequel to Transformers movie, this one was having not so many Transformers. It had the same ingredients of the previous movies where a lead character would have a very important role to save the world and there would be support from the US armies/troops. This one was having a formula that was similar to the 3rd Transformers (Dark of The Moon) with some rather outrageous theory about the history, myth or legends. The challenge of telling this kind of story was that it kind of makes the movie to be difficult to digest. It was not helping either when it was having too many side stories. This movie unfortunately was not able to compile the whole side stories (or even the main story) into a cohesive movie. It felt like so many parts being forced to be put into 1 movie. Sorry to say, this time I really could not enjoy the storyline, and it also had too many of unnecessary characters. Perhaps if they just stick to fewer characters, the movie would be more enjoyable. My personal views, the children involved in the beginning were a distraction (including Izabella) and some of the Autobots & Decepticons minor roles were really not interesting. Even John Turturo's character of Seymour from all previous Transformers' movies felt forced to be included. The only worthy characters that I felt have significant importance were Edmund Burton and Viviane. The Autobots that were also worthwhile to see were Cogman, Hot Rod, Bumblebee and of course our real favorite, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen).Apart from the lousy story line and too many characters, the movie was certainly excellent in term of its special effects and its 3D effects. As I found out that 98% of the movie was shot in IMAX 3D camera, all those effects felt truly amazing. However, I got to say that the sound effects did not feel too spectacular. I am not sure if the cinema was only focusing on IMAX and hence it did not have the good sound system, but I was not really entertained with it. The movie did have some funny and interesting moments especially during the time when Edmund, Viviane, Cogman and Cade were in the same screen. But other than that, it did not have too much funny moments. My views is that the movie would definitely be trashed by critics though general audience would probably still be interested and attracted to see this in theaters.So if you are a fan of Transformers movies and have been following the previous 4 movies, you would definitely still be entertained with this one, even though the Transformers were not as many as the earlier ones. My wife and I still believed that the original Transformers was still the best of all 5, and unfortunately this one fell into the least enjoyable of them all. I am actually not really fussy about storyline when I watched a full special effects action movie like this one as I would not expect it as Oscar worthy movie anyway, but if it was up to the point of making it less enjoyable, then it became a downside. However, if you are a hardcore fan who do not care about the story at all, and just want to see those cool special effects and the amazing Optimus Prime in action, then you should definitely see this one. Recommended to see this in IMAX 3D (but you must be prepared to be tired as it has a duration of 2.5 hours).

197,ReelLifeReviews,One of the worst of the year,3,22 June 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight - While I may go in to some movies expecting them to be bad, I never go in hoping that they will be. I go to the theater to be entertained, to live vicariously, and to enjoy the visual art of storytelling. Heaven help me if I could do any of those here.To say that this movie is disjointed would be quite the understatement. There are multiple story lines happening throughout, but it never feels like they really intertwine. Characters will disappear for scenes at a time and then, inexplicably, be in another scene with no explanation of where they've been, let alone how they got there.It's a movie about robot cars, so I understand that the cinematic bar isn't exactly high. But even in something as ridiculous as this franchise, you should be made to suspend your disbelief only so far. My favorite franchise is about a bunch of space wizards with telekinesis for crying out loud, but not even Luke Skywalker could pull off the things that a middle-aged inventor from Texas is somehow able do in this movie.And did Anthony Hopkins lose a bet? How did they drag him into this? If the producers thought bringing him on board would add some class, they were mistaken. His character is extremely undefined, sometimes being the voice of reason, other times being overly juvenile. As for the actor himself, he just seemed bored.There are very few times when this hobby of mine feels more like work. I definitely felt like I was clocked in for this one, but Paramount got my paycheck. 3/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight

First, the movie was too long. Way too long. Cut a half hour or more and this might have been a GREAT film. Second, and this ties into the film's length - the special effects were so elaborate, so all over the place that they wore me out.

202,smetin,Borderline unwatchable,3,24 June 2017,"I have loved watching the Transformers films in the past, despite their reputation for being about as clever as a lemon. They were visual spectacles and seeing the battles and explosions in 3D in the cinema has always made these films good fun to watch. There has been a downward trend in the quality of these films since the second instalment and I was hoping that the Last Knight could reverse this trend. Unfortunately not.Transformers: The Last Knight is a prime example of studios pressuring film makers to churn out material to satisfy the masses. Michael Bay was probably the worst person in Hollywood to undertake such a franchise as he has the notorious reputation of style over substance. The plot for the film is quite interesting if you look at it from a bare bones perspective. The main autobots and decepticons make an appearance, which gives us a sense of familiarity in an ever-changing cast that barely resembles the original lineup. Seeing Optimus Prime head towards the dark side was probably one of the more exciting elements and I was looking forward to see the ensuing battles.However, despite a promising story line, this film fails to deliver on almost all counts. Michael Bay's reliance on CGI and explosions really overshadows any sense of a story. Also, despite the general plot being incredibly simple, the manner by which it was delivered was overly complicated. I found myself getting lost at numerous points and had to ask my neighbour what on earth was going on. First there was a staff, then a talisman, then a ship and Anthony Hopkins breaking into Number 10 Downing Street...I mean seriously?Another thing that really bugged me was the need for such vulgar language throughout the film. The odd use of a curse word is fine, but they were being thrown left, right and centre in this film. It certainly is not suitable for children to watch! One of the only film's redeeming qualities was that Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins delivered their performance well. But that is to be expected, since they are great actors. However, for them to even be associated with a film like this is a dark mark on their resumé. This film did not deserve them.For the first time in a long time I felt cheated out of my money in the cinema. This film was atrocious and was only redeemed by a few great actors and some visually impressive battle sequences. Other than that, there is very little to be desired by this film. If you enjoyed previous instalments of Transformers be prepared to be disappointed if you have already bought a ticket. If you haven't, I would consider spending you money elsewhere.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Sure, it has the 80's music and some cartoon editing issues, but at least it is coherent. As for this ""Last"" installment. I will compare the ""series"" to going partying for a night & All I can say is:The Transformer movie series begins with the best intentions of having a good time and enjoying ones self in guilty pleasures. The evening starts out very well. After a couple of cocktails and laughs everyone is having a good time and enjoying themselves, wondering with anticipation what will be next. Following that, the night continues and the mind becomes a bit overwhelmed. There is more going on, new things to see and twists and turns that can be taken with a bit of awe and excitement. As the night continues and the partying and cocktails flow, things begin to become somewhat confused. Perspective changes and what perhaps once made sense, is now somewhat confusing. Things tend to start looking out of place and questions about what is going on begin to emerge.By the end of the knight, all bets are off. The mind is now completely overwhelmed, just trying to make sense out of what is going on. Words becomes muddled and senses dulled, sound and light become cacophonous, actions questionable. Cohesion to any semblance of what once was is gone and dialogue seems strained at best. At this point the world becomes a tapestry of confusion and nonsense. One forgets why they went out in the first place and what the point of the evening was. The best thing one can do is go home, take a few aspirin and hope the headache goes away.

205,TheJediWay9,"""Transformers: The Last Knight"" Is Worse Than ""Age Of Extinction!""",1,22 June 2017,"""Transformers: The Last Knight,"" the dreaded fifth movie in the  Transformers series is supposedly the last to be directed by Michael  Bay and the last to star Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg plays his character  Cade from the previous one. The ""attempt"" at a plot for this movie goes  something like this: Cade comes into possession of an ancient  Transformers artifact called the Talisman and he is the ""chosen one"" to  carry out a ""quest"" for the transformers, while this chick named Vivian  has to acquire Merlin's ""staff"" because for some reason she is the  ""only one who can wield it"" and Optimus Prime heads to Cybertron to  find out ""where he and the transformers came from and what they're  doing on earth."" THAT'S this movie's plot. Lol this movie thinks it has  a plot.   This movie is completely incapable of telling a cohesive story. There  is no beginning, middle, or end. It throws plot threads at you and  expects you to roll with them. The most illogical plot devices occur in  this movie. NOTHING makes any sense. It is so convoluted that the movie  thinks the audience are idiots. How many times was I reminded of what  the plot was throughout the entirety of this atrocity? I counted at  least 32. Nothing of importance happens. Nothing is interesting,  nothing is entertaining.   The characters are so thinly written and poorly developed I didn't care  who lived and who died. At this point in the series, I DON'T CARE ABOUT  THE DAMN HUMANS! Just give us a movie about Transformers, not about  humans. None of them are likable AT ALL. Everything involving the  military, the government, Anthony Hopkins, it's all pointless! The  movie spends so much time and energy on all the stuff everyone  complains about with these movies that none of it comes across as not  appealing, but rather annoying. It's an insult to our intelligence.   The action scenes are the same lazy action scenes the other four  Transformers movies feature. It's stuff that appeals only to teenagers  who do not know how a movie is crafted. Teenagers like action and  explosions and no talking, story, characters, or emotion. This movie  appeals to those teenagers. There I said it again. Watching stuff just  blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up  continuously for two and half hours is extremely boring, especially  since it's the only thing that has happened for five Transformers  movies in a row. There is no entertainment value to be had just  watching stuff blow up for a bloated and overlong runtime.  And yes, the runtime is too long, YET AGAIN. Luckily, it is shorter  than the fourth one which was a very drab and dreary two hours and  forty-five minutes. This is about fifteen minutes shorter, but it  easily could have been an hour shorter. Nothing content wise justifies  the runtime of this monstrosity. It's still overstuffed, overlong,  dreary, boring, and exhausting, just like the previous three. I'll give  the first one a pass since I actually enjoy the first one.   This has all the Bay-isms in it. The typical stereotypes, the typical  humor, and the typical dialogue, all of which is stupid, offensive, and  insulting. S many characters are made fun of in this movie for being  different or having different accents you thoroughly understand why  NOBDOY LIKES MICHAEL BAY. He is racist, sexist, and doesn't care about  the audience. He cares only about himself and no one else. It shows.  The two girls in this movie, in typical Michael Bay fashion, are all  hotted out. The young girl is like 14. In what world is this right? Her  tits just hang out the entire movie. The other chick just looks like a  porn star. That's what this series has come down to folks, strippers  and porn stars!  Optimus Prime is literally in the movie for ten minutes to just say his  name three times so that we don't forget about him and who he is and  completely forget that this movie gives him the most sudden shift in  character motivation I have ever seen, more sudden than Batman in  Batman V Superman. If you came to see him wreck house, he is a total  waste in this movie. Quite frankly, none of the Transformers really don  anything in this movie. They all just kind of hang out and chill and  insult each other with stereotypes.  This is one of the worst of the year. I felt like I lost IQ points  watching this movie. It is a loud, dumb, idiotic, incoherent, chaotic,  soulless mess that appeals only to teenagers who like nothing but  action and explosions and die hard fans of the series. It is worse than  Age of Extinction.   I'm just gonna give ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" an F-. Yes that is  now officially a grade.",Transformers - The Last Knight
206,toddcha,"fancy visual effet as usual, horrible ridiculous pilot, fragment shot",4,20 February 2018,"Like all the other sequence, the visual effect is good, which is of course expected. However, the splendid visual effect cannot save an unreasonable screenplay with particularly fragmental shots and scenes.There are countless flaws in the plots and poorly actings:
1. the self-righteous scientists, their smug parts have 0 contributions to the movie. 
2. Cade, what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg? First time acting? Especially his tone is NOT convincing at all. He really needs to work on his facial expressions and tones. (or perhaps his shots are so fragmental? )
3. the car chasing part in London city is to make audience excited or dizzy/faint? 
...After 30 minutes, all i want is to skip to the end. The last straw that makes the whole movie doomed is Optimus' line: earth is my home.

BUT perhaps you can stop doing 300 non sens because you are not capable to mix big robots and the 12 knights, honestly THE worst mess up story i ever seen this last 10 years. Even a B or a Z movie can give you a smile or a surprise. But this is just ""trash"".Waste of time, waste of money, HORRIBLE MOVIE, give me a headache! the montage of the movie is so botched you just get action action, action, action the first 1h45 minutes who are absolutely not justified at all and who don't give us any satisfaction because it's just rush hour for explosions and emptiness.Acting is very bad as usual, big bang boom everywhere, peoples acting like retard everywhere, military do as you can call the worst choice ever to help the story to get more big bang boom non sens action everywhere. As usual the original story is just ""we don't give a sh.it"" and they have transform earth into ""Unicron"" and ""Cybertron""come to play with us.""Cybertron"" never collide with earth, ""Unicron"" is the father of all the robots good or bad, and eat planets for breakfast. It's a gigantic robot planet who can transform into a robot 3 time the size of our moon. Originally ""Unicron"" target earth and to punish ""Megatron"" ""Galvatron"" want to destroy ""Cybertron"" first but ... ""go see the original cartoon movie!!""""Unicron"" in this movie : it's just air, nothing, a name and a really bad joke replaced by a queen who have the size of a Twingo car. ""Unicron"" is on earth ah ah ah ah OF COURSE !!! hidden in my very big pocket who have the size of the planet earth core! (SERIOUSLY ???) And ""Cybertron"" want to ""fusion/melt/merge we don't really know"" with earth.WHAT ?? At this moment you thinking he can change size and be smaller? He can have the composition of the cheese cake and transform into strawberry jelly ? Or at least it can transform into a good movie? sorry to disappoint you, but NO.worst part is the duration of the movie, 2h26 minutes you can resume in 26 minutes.Michal Bay will not do transformer 6, that's a very good news. And perhaps they will be no Transformers 6 it will be an even better news.

I really don't understand how anyone could approve the movie in this horrible shape. How is this possible?

211,pokedom,"The Nostalgia Critic was right, and for once that's not a good thing",2,28 June 2017,"The fifth Transformer Movie has been made, similar to the Pirates hitting their fifth movie earlier this year. Unlike Dead Men Tell No Tales, which was surprisingly decent considering the series' track record, The Last Knight decided to opt for making the same stupid mistakes as its predecessors.I think it says a hell of a lot when The Nostalgia Critic himself made a video predicting the plot for this film a full week before it launched. And it says even more that, for the most part, he was right. ""So is Optimus Prime now a villain, destroying years of hero worship in the ultimate franchise gamble? Yes, yes he is, and Mickey Mouse is officially a terrorist. Of course that's not what happens!"" - Nostalgia Critic.This film is even worse than he predicted. Even Michael Bay, for all his failings, knew in his previous films not to screw with the aspect ratio. In this film, the aspect ratio is changed EVERY OTHER SHOT. It goes from fullscreen to large distracting black bars on the top and bottom to slightly smaller black bars and back to fullscreen, rinse and repeat for the two and a half hours you sit in the theater, or shorter if you have the sensibility to leave before it ends... oh wait, IT NEVER ENDS. They even sequel bait at the end of it like a Marvel movie!This serious technical problem would be fine if it were the only thing wrong, but oh boy, it gets worse. The story is nonexistent. Everyone does and says stupid things all the time. The characters are cardboard cutouts that scream loudly at everything. They use Stonehenge as a final battleground and turn the watch that killed Hitler into a plot device. They say that Steven Hawking knows about the Transformers. We never see him show up (but to be honest it would be incredible if his wheelchair turned into a Transformer. It would be so incredibly dumb but everyone would love it.) Not just Steven Hawking, but every historical figure you've probably heard about somewhere knew about the Transformers and was part of, basically, a secret club dedicated to covering it up. There's a robot that is mentioned midway through to be a C3PO ripoff. He leans more toward K2SO ripoff, so it's a worse sin in my book. The French robot (HERGG RERGG as they call him because of his stereotypical French accent) shouts out ""I'll stop the time!"" every time he shoots his gun, like a DBZ character without any character.That wall of text might seem extremely bad, BUT IT GETS WORSE STILL. Optimus Prime, now known as Nemesis Prime, is in the movie... for 2 minutes. He fights Bumblebee (who is even given a backstory involving Nazis for maybe 1 minute... geez what's with the obsession with WWII?), which was teased in practically every trailer... for 2 minutes. Then he goes back to being Optimus. The main bad girl exists solely to sequel bait. Instead of making the military look like idiots, Bay turns to making a top mind at NASA look like an idiot for trying to save the world using science and physics. Way to f*cking go...This movie is a failure on basically every level. If you haven't seen it yet I envy you, and please don't go do so. If you have... pray to God they don't make a Transformers 6. Pray to God they scrap the sequel bait and leave the Transformers alone for a while. Maybe one day we'll get a good Transformers movie, similar to the first. But for now... it's just a pile of scrap.",Transformers - The Last Knight
212,said-buet10,Why does this even exist?!,1,5 October 2017,"There is no doubt that any movie of this franchise is never going to be a great one. We always expect it to be bad but with some enjoyable action sequences. But this particular one was a big surprise. It surpassed all my expectation of being a pointless movie and turned out to be one of the worst I've ever seen.Firstly, how horrible the plot is!! This shows how hard they are trying to just push out a new film to make money. The story was annoying and ridiculous. Prime goes bad and then suddenly good, BIG SURPRISE!! How is the lead actors not dead after those falls and even being at close proximity of the fights between the transformers! This movie didn't care about logic at any single moment.Secondly, Michael Bay makes bad films but he makes very good action sequences. Its hard not to enjoy those. But in this film, that one thing he does best was absent.Moreover, there is an inevitable thing called 'PHYSICS'. If that planet came that close to earth, we would have massive floods all over the world. I know its an idiotic movie but shouldn't this be addressed in at least some small level!Even with very low expectations I got disappointed, thats how bad this movie is!! I think the studios should stop spending any more money on this horrible franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight
213,yannigk,A big jumble pile of mess,2,21 June 2017,"Transformers: the Last Knight is a movie which I also hope to be the last transformers movie. Michael Bay is like a kid with too many toys and unlimited money who throws all the action figures, cars, choppers, submarines, EVERYTHING, into this ridiculous mess he calls a movie. It is too long, too messy, too choppy, and jumps everywhere his whims takes him.Okay so if you're a transformers fans maybe you will like it, you will get your action hero, your sexy girlfriend, your robots, your race- cars and tanks and all the things you boys like.~~~~~Begin rant, possible spoiler~~~~~Incoherent storytelling, overused film tropes (for example: sexy- British-professor-lady vs muscular-fast talking-American-action- hero), unnecessary sequences, jumpy locations, cringe-worthy jokes that we still laugh at because they're the only ones presented after an hour of exploding dead cities. I mean, who wrote this movie.. and why isn't anybody stopping Michael Bay from his never ending thoughts being vomited out and then jumbled together. At one point I even thought maybe Michael Bay did this on purpose, just to see how far he can go.. make it as absurd as possible and as ludicrous as it can be. Make it worse than the Fast & Furious' unbelievable action scenes. How about use an English mythical legend story and put robots in them! Yes! That'll do it! No money? Take some Chinese products and put it so distractingly in focus so everyone can definitely see them. Oh, this movie isn't going to be set in Hong Kong again? Meh.. just add some leftover HK shots we got from last year's Transformers. There, you got your global disaster. Sure, we still need some of the old faces from the previous movies, get them in this film even though they're in a completely different location, let them help save the world via a phone call. A PHONE CALL.The butler robot is the most interesting, and even that was wasted when Bay decided to let the robot be emotionally off at the end. A butler, you say? Yes, a C3PO lookalike. Don't worry, they somehow got to reference him in the movie as C3PO. I wonder how much extra money they had leftover that they could still throw some at Disney. They had so much money that the female professor can change clothes so many times even though they are in a hurry to save the world. She changed her work clothes into a bodycon dress (to show off her curves to the American hero character, duh), went back to the house to look for clues and changed into a white blazer, white shirt and pants combo still with high heels, then get in a submarine, takes off the blazer, and for some weird reason, because the submarine is from WW1, changes into a linen cloth Indiana Jones kind of outfit with horse-riding pants.AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE CHANGING ASPECT RATIO!!! It keeps changing from 4:3 to 16:9 to I don't know how many different aspect ratios were used (8 different ones in the trailer).. so your field of view goes from tall to wide to tall to medium tall and back to wide.. gahhh!I get it, some shots were done in IMAX.. some others in RED cameras.. no actually I don't get it. WHY!! Couldn't the editor crop the final cut so that the top and bottom black bars can at least be of same size!What is this!!~~~~~~~~~end of rant~~~~~~~~~~~~ Good parts: CGI was excellent. But as with previous transformers films, the action sequences are so dazzling (dizzying) that your eyes won't be able to keep up. That said, I feel this time we can still see clearly who's fighting who.Anthony Hopkins: nobody can make a film sound more serious, even though it is a mindless summer blockbuster, other than sir Hopkins. and maybe Morgan Freeman.Mark Wahlberg: what are you doing man...I liked the robot butler character. A bit too much but still somewhat likable.Bumblebee is still very cool looking. Optimus Prime is still very much full of himself. (He goes into pre- battle speech 2-3 times at the end.... starting each speech with ""I. Am. Optimus Prime."") This is the part where I rolled my eyes. Yeeees, we know you're optimus prime.. yeees we know you're gonna save the world..Everything else is just sh..",Transformers - The Last Knight

215,dp-17275,Stop,3,26 February 2019,"The Transformers truly deserve better. Michael Bay directs the fifth installment in this lackluster series, starring Mark Wahlberg who would rather be anywhere else, and Anthony Hopkins who is just having fun being in a dumb popcorn movie. The plot is a jumbled mess, with era's changing and plot lines making no sense, it was clear multiple stories were just thrown together without care. The visual effects sometimes are great but overall are awful, Continuity errors with the Transformers for some reason. The aspect ratio changes nearly every shot and it's annoying, the acting is awful, the comedy is cliche and terrible. The music is alright, but utilized horribly. Optimus Prime is barely in the movie. Him being evil is lackluster and doesn't live up to what a Nemesis Prime could be. The villain is interesting but never explored. This film doesn't make sense as being apart of 4 other movies. The transformers are very good however, Peter Cullen and Frank Welker do an incredible job as Optimus Prime and Megatron. The new additions such as Isabela Moner are horribly written and not utilized well at all, there's literally a line where they ask her ""what are you doing here?!"" and she says ""I don't know!""

220,rolandjordaan2,Transformers: The Last Knight - Spoiler Free Review,4,14 September 2018,"I walked into this movie not caring and I walked out caring even less. Transformers 5 suffers from the same grave mistake as the previous entries, specifically that it invests so much time into the first two acts that by the time the final act finally arrives, you're sitting there thinking ""there can't possibly be another 30 minutes of this"", which is of course followed by 30 minutes of quick cuts, hard to follow action sequences, human characters that seem like they belong in a different movie and Optimus Prime ending it off with the same speech we've heard four times before. And the weirdest thing of all: this kinda saddens me, because I actually believe that somewhere on the cutting room floor, this could have been an okay movie. Even though his acting at times still seems like he's doing a homage to his character in 'The Happening', Mark Wahlberg is still a much more likable and convincing leading man than Shia Labeouf, the plot, although unnecessarily complicated, was interesting enough for me to at least pay mild attention and the robots look just as cool as ever. So really what destroys this film is bad pacing and a running time that simply goes on for way too long, there are whole scenes, hell whole characters who could and should have been left out of this film, jokes that are there simply as unnecessary nods to the previous films and action scenes that go on so long that you simply lose interest. Oh and Anthony Hopkins was in this, that's not part of the review, I'm just still trying to spin my head around what the hell they did to get Anthony Hopkins in this. But you know what, none of what I write actually matters, because if there is one thing Michael Bay has inexplicably pulled off with these Transformers films, it's his ability to get people who don't even like them to somehow keep seeing them - I'm one of those idiots and I'm pretty sure that in another 3 years, I'll be writing another mini review of how much I didn't care about Transformers 6...and for that, I kind of applaud him.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The previous movies, despite of weak acting and directing, at least had some sort of plausible, coherent story line, but not this one. The Last Knight is over 2.5 hours, it was so bad that towards the end of the movie it just felt like 5~10 minutes of story line was constantly cut out, the scene and dialogue simply jumped from one place to another, it was like a pizza.

225,eyefordetail,Opinions are like nostrils,7,29 October 2017,"My youngest (15) made me watch a TF marathon with him. Spending time with him was more important than the movies, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. Age of Extinction was a little meh to me but then came The Last Knight. Anthony Hopkins popping up surprised me. The explosive Michael Bay signature (after watching 4 in a row) was excellent in the Middle Age scenes. He should make a period movie in that era. Really brought the gut-level medieval war to life. After watching the movie I read the reviews. Luckily. Which just reminded me of the saying that ""Opinions are like nostrils - everyone has at least two and they are full of holes"". I found Last Knight to be one of the better Transformer movies. Thoroughly enjoyable. All the ""one-star reviewers"" should rather watch more intellectual movies than waste their precious time and then write long tedious pompous reviews on them, wasting ours. Got teens and want to spend time with them? Take them to The Last Knight. You be the judge.",Transformers - The Last Knight
226,travishouze,Transformers: The Last Nail in the Coffin,2,24 June 2017,"""They can say what they want, people will still pay to see it."" Michael Bay is pretty self aware of his foot over the neck with his Transformers movie franchise. Transformers: The Last Knight is his self proclaimed final installment from a directors standpoint, and is shockingly a couple steps forward, but it still has some hills to get over in the process.Cade (Mark Walberg) is a fugitive who is trying to stay off the radar after the events of Age of Extinction. He finds himself dragged back into saving the world as Autobots from Cyberton are after yet another ""key to the autobots"" world that latches on to his possession (yes, just like the other 4 movies).The thing that surprises me the most in this installment is that this is the most focused that any of the films has been on keeping the plot moving. The film is almost entirely shot with IMAX 3D cameras, and the format is utilized pretty well with some of the robots popping out of the screen. Anyone who complained that they spent too much time with the human characters will be surprised as they allocate a large amount of the 148 minutes towards constant moving action, which is the films biggest strength and weakness. The reason is the action begins to feel numbing as there's little room to breathe and so much time is spent running and avoiding gunfire. And don't worry, the dumb comedy that plagued the other films are here. While the comedy isn't as offensive, it's still pretty annoying.Outside of the obvious issues, another issue lays with the adult female character (Laura Haddock), where Michael Bay frames her character in a skin tight dress with her cleavage and bra exposed, where the camera always keep focus on her half buttoned shirts, but the film still always reminds us she's a Ivy League professor.The Last Knight in ways felt like the film we asked for in the first place with Transformers, but still feels incoherent as always. If your a fan of the series, don't be afraid to go see it as it might invigorate you a bit more than previous installments. As for me, The Last Knight just feels like same old, same old and we deserve better heroes for our summer entertainment.",Transformers - The Last Knight

228,tomsters,best of the series so far,6,2 August 2017,"6.5 but the system demands full numbers. each instalment changes the history of the last. really stupid thing to do. first movie they just landed. second movie has them up against ancient Egypt. third they go even father back in time to when they crashed on the dark side of the moon, a few million years or so. then they change pace to go back to the cartoon origins with walberg and then this time they go to not so far back as the pyramids or the even farther back of the moon to now to back to somewhat but not so ancient England's mythological king Arthur. of which was a better adaption to the guy ritchie movie that i hated so much. so,,,,,, i liked this movie more than all the others. if you saw this one first or you can deliberately block the other movies mentally so the time paradox of history doesn't ruin the story you will like this one. why? well, for one thing, there isn't anywhere near as much incoherent over the top close up of action sfx that i hated in all the others. that's like having a go pro on the gloves on the heavyweights boxing match. i liked the story build up, stupid and silly as it was (messing with your own story history is just wrong, but messing with earth history is OK if you make it logical, it will work) this one built up some story suspense to where i actually cared who kicked who's ass. there was still a lot of in story obstacle mistakes. the robots and humans didn't fight side by side. the robots helped the humans only occasionally and visa versa, sometimes as if the other wasn't even in the movie. what most complained about this movie is there wasn't ass kicking from the start and continuous until the end. they only go out on the weekends to drink and fight. so who cares what they think. this one actually took time to build a story that has suspense so you were able to care about who kicked who's ass in the end battle. and then that's where this one ended up resembling the previous versions where the fighting was to close up and who knows who was fighting who to know what the hell was going on. the beginning wasn't the best. the obviously vastly over matched humans were in charge over the autobots. like, come on, im an autobot conceding to ants telling me what to do no matter how much i i know they are wrong and no matter how much i can just step on them and end that nonsense. still, this one is smarter than the rest so i was able to enjoy it more. its still silly though. i wish they could get over that stuff and make it a solid story/screenplay that doesn't just want to glorify the sfx.",Transformers - The Last Knight

It's like watching a movie that has huge parts cut out and other movier parts were cut out and the different parts to different movies were mixed together. Gone are logical story lines. Gone is characters you actually care about. It says A LOT when you actually want the kids do die for being so stupid. This movie is schizophrenic. The pieces don't meld together at all. It's funny, not in a good way, how the movie with the transformer name has very little transformer action. All the robots do is sit around talking. There is way too much down time. There are too many boring slow parts. You could put paper bags over the heads of every actor and it would not effect the movie at all. Don't waste your money going to the theater to see this turkey.

But why, OH WHY good sir, are they milking the Transformers! What's left to milk?

237,rs403404,An Open Letter to Michael Bay:,2,29 July 2017,"Mr. Bay, you are a very skilled filmmaker. I remember enjoying The Rock quite a bit and the fact that you can consistently get the resources to make big action movies is something to be admired. I know you've been in the business of making movies since I was a teenager, so maybe it's not my place to judge you. However, I see you making the same mistakes over and over again. And they're all rather rookie mistakes. Here are three simple tips that could greatly improve your output.Wide Shots are your FriendsYou seem to love your upclose shots of people and things frequently employing Dutch angles and other various tricks. It makes a shot look cool, but it also fails to give the audience any clear idea of the environment around the characters or where characters are in relation to each other. This is especially crucial in action scenes. Please employ at least one wide shot for every change of scene no matter how minor.2) Use Long TakesThis is sometimes criticized as a film school thing. In movies like Specter where the beginning was one long shot throughout a Day of the Dead celebration. It looked cool but was unnecessary. Then you also have the beginning of Serenity where a long shot is employed to introduce the crew of the ship while also giving the audience the sense of the ship. I'm not asking nearly that much of you, but it's rare when a character says two sentences on the same shot in this film. Almost every sentence has a cut before the next, even when it's the same character talking. This is unnecessary.3) Edit Your Scenes ProperlyYou cut action scenes like actions scenes. So you're fine there on editing. However, you also cut character moments as action scenes. You cut exposition dumps as action scenes. When you literally cut everything as an action scene, the movie becomes exhausting to watch. Not only that, when you go to an action scene, it doesn't stand out because it's cut like every other scene in the movie. The audience becomes desensitized to it. So those cool moments you do have stand out so much less. There's more, but those are the big ones. Follow these simple steps with ALL your movies and there will undoubtable be an improvement and maybe you can even get a Transformers film scored fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. At the very least, not as rotten as the past few. I know this is your last one, but let's face it you've said that before.",Transformers - The Last Knight
238,darryl-42069,Quantity over quality,7,24 June 2017,"The Transformers franchise is one of the rare bad movie franchise that continues to entertain and made a lot of cash. They are a type of movie where you throw your brain out of the window, be entertained and have some fun. The trailer for the fifth Transformer movie did give us the impression that this movie might be good, but is it really what the trailer show us?Well, I've got the answer: It's both a very entertaining movie and a huge mess. This movie, in a typical Michael Bay fashion, is a very entertaining ride from start to finish, which is also a poorly constructed pieces of awesomeness that the movie itself cannot show it's potential to be a good movie (despite being the one with the most potential to be a good movie!)Pros: The story is the most creative and the most entertaining out of the five. Idk why but this is the most ""fun"" Transformer story so far.Mark Wahlberg is fine. Not great, just fine. Stanley Tucci, although brief, brings a good performance as Merlin. Laura Haddock who plays Vivian the professor, and Isabella Moner as (the lazily named) Izabella, both being the latest to be ""Michael Bay-fied"" also gives a good performance, in particular Isabella Moner. Anthony Hopkins is way to good for this movie, and he's one of the bright spots in this movie.For the action scenes... You don't need a review for this (because it's Michael friggin Bay.) The visuals are amazing as usual, although there's nothing new to be seen. The cinematography is just fine. The Third Act is a mind-blowing, over the top action that will (obviously) blew your mind. The small cameo by Nicola Peltz and Shia LaBeouf is also well executed.The post end credits scene (yes, there is one) is well executed (I guess), and the fact that the long typical​ styled​ credits is replaced by appear/disappear credits (that it's only purpose is to match the end of the song to the end of the credits) is a nice touch as well. Cons: Despite being the most ""fun"" Transformer story, it is also a mess. The story is so convoluted that it's very hard to follow. There's so many plot holes, I mean a lot of plot holes that makes the movie less exciting. The first and the second act was so rushed and it felt like a large portion of the story there was missing. I can bet that there's a large portion of deleted scenes removed from there.Ken Nolan, despite I have high hopes for you for the screenplay, but you're not as good as the other Nolan. The screenplay is littered by very bad and cheesy one liners and despite trying to be funny, it just don't land. Not to mention some awful characterization: Isabella Moner's character is just someone in the wrong place and in the wrong time, she's just there. The inventor guy is so annoying. Josh Duhamel as Lennox from the first three movies is, I don't know, ""useless"". Like Isabella Moner's character, he's just there. John Tuturro's Seymour Simmons is for me can be removed from the movie and made this movie 5 minutes shorter.Despite being the shortest of the entire franchise, it feels like the longest. Also in the credits I see around 6-7 editors for the movie, but the movie is poorly edited, a downgrade from the previous installment (what the hell are you doing editors?!). When introducing the Deceptions, they went for the ""Suicide Squad"" style introduction, which is very unnecessary. I hate the constant change of aspect ratio in standard theaters. Does it even necessary to ""force you to watch in IMAX 3D to see more""?. Also, is it just me, or the editors were lazy enough so that when they introducing the locations, they use the exact same font and effect from a better Michael Bay film: ""13 Hours: Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"".Overall this movie is both a entertaining, no brainier fun, but with over convoluted plot and bad editing, makes this movie not as entertaining as the previous installments. If you want some over the top, out of this world action scenes, go watch this movie and have some fun, otherwise don't watch this movie because it's definitely not for you. Just don't forget to bring some popcorns and drinks because it's going be a very long ride.Final Score: 7/10 for action sequences, explosions and more explosions.On a side note: Michael Bay, should you ever direct another Transformers movie, can you please prioritize story over visuals, cause I think that is the biggest flaw in every Transformer movie. Thank you.",Transformers - The Last Knight
239,bornagain710-331-212635,What A Joke,3,19 March 2018,Excellent actors acting in an awful sequel. Confusing mishmash of historical tales. Only watched it to see how awful Hollywood has become,Transformers - The Last Knight
240,pixiekatten,If only Age of Extinction ended with extinction so no one had to suffer this mess!,1,6 August 2017,"Firstly, I do not rip on this movie because I dislike this franchise. I actually have a major soft spot for the Transformers movies. I love the cool visuals and the CGI. The first time I saw an autobot transform I was gobsmacked and in awe over how good the graphics were. These flicks are fast paced and action packed. And who does not fall head over heals for BumbleBee!? Transformers are good films for when you need to switch off from the outside world, and be seriously entertained for a couple of hours. Yes, even Age of Extinction has a few moments of goodness. The same unfortunately, cannot be said about this scrapheap of a film! To start of with, the opening scenes featuring Merlin the drunk 'wizard' were just incredibly futile (and over acted). Don't get me started on the magic staff/Excalibur as well as the talisman as the foundations for the plot... say what!? Suddenly Mark Wahlberg is 'the chosen one' as the world is about to end! But his lady friend is also the chosen one as she is the only one who can wield the staff..! So I guess there are two chosen ones... because why not... that makes sense. Yup, it is a Armageddon vs Matrix vs Terminator rip off - mixed with a big spoon of Arthurian Middle-Age spice. The unholy mixture leaves a bad taste in your mouth, as one is unable to grasp the incoherent and unconvincing storyline that does not make any sense at any point. Transformers 1-4 do not boast any amazing scripts, but this is beyond lazy and infantile. The film is incredibly messy, and spirals from bad to worse to unwatchable. It goes from dumb, to dumber, to 'I can't believe I'm still watching this'! The Last Knight is overflowing with drab one liners and punchlines so feeble that they make you cringe in your seat. It is 2 hours of everyone going out of their ways to be rude and moronic. It is painful to watch adults constantly throw loud tantrums. I like many of the actors in other movie roles, but in this film not a single one of them bring a likable character to the round table. I actually quite hated them all...How could Anthony Hopkins of all actors sink this low!? When he walks through the submarine museum, pushing people and abruptly shouting to them to 'move their fat arses and get out' he sadly reached a very undignified low. Hannibal seems eons away - Hopkins must be out of his mind to take a role like this one! It is not funny in anyway, just terribly annoying. Wahlberg's Cade needs a punch in the face. And the only female character (as always) happens to be a pouty Megan Fox lookalike. No surprise there. So old and boring.Do not trust the 10 star ratings. The Last Knight really is a flop beyond flops. With 30minutes left of the film, my brain could not handle more torture. I walked out.",Transformers - The Last Knight
241,ashishagupta,Amazingly good movie. Transformers meets Animal Farm,9,15 September 2017,"This is a brilliantly well written movie. The movie itself is a transformer, in that it is really two very different movies rolled into one and it switches between its two forms. In one form, it is a regular big budget action sci-fi movie, true to its franchise. In the other form, it is a scathing critique of recent social and political environment.Transformers: Last Knight at its heart is a piece of art voicing out against the racism and bigotry that is increasingly enveloping the world in recent times. Like scathing satire in the past, which disguised itself in allegories with animals, Transformers does so with Transformers. Like George Orwell's Animal Farm disguised a bitter review of Communism in USSR, this movie disguises a bitter review of Capitalism + Neo-Fascism in USA.The movie could well be split into two acts, where the first act is the allegory and the second act is the regular sci-fi pop-corn munching movie. Act I: There are numerous social-political issues touched upon in this movie: the immigrant problem, ghettos, surveillance state, NSA, police brutality with racial bias, violation of civil liberties and rights of citizens, abuse of power in the name of anti-terrorism, new-world order, reneging on promise to 'friends' and 'supporters', misuse of 'support of international community' when it is really just a few imperialistic political entities, etc.The movie also touches on the topic of self-promotion propaganda by the Great Great Britain, which is Great. The perception of Americans as intellectually inferior. Did I remember to mention Great Britain is truly Great?! The movie also mentions how history began with England, (just after the Roman empire left), which is poking fun at how this narrative underlies the vast majority of mainstream mindset. Its hilarious to see the extent to which the explanation is crafted to give the totally pointless Stonehenge some meaning, finally! The movie also hints at the perception of American men as philanderers in British minds (probably a left-over from WW2 days, when a lot of American service men were stationed in England). It also credits the Transformers and the great American+English soldiers for 'turning the tide of WW2'. I guess those 27 million dead Russians and Battle of Stalingard can go suck it!If the movie ended with Act 1, I would give it a 10/10, but its aggregate rating would be 2-3! People don't like scathing allegorical satire, because they don't understand it. I wonder if it would be better if the movie disguised its critique less? The far- left liberals would cheer it, the far-right conservatives would also cheer it (since they would not understand they are being insulted and a lot of white people in the movie are exercising their second amendment rights). It is only the politically centrist who would dislike the movie as too preachy!Act 2: In the second act, the movie descends from its stratospheric heights of witty writing to regular movie fare. The movie has a good mix of action scenes with thrilling moments. The usual Deus Ex Machina makes a cameo. Even a JPL scientist using 'physics and maths' has his 15 seconds of fame. Some global landmarks are destroyed, a staple of invading aliens. In the end, a lot is owed to a few. Thanks to the insipid Act 2, the aggregate movie rating goes up to 5.5.Conclusion: Watch this movie from the start if you like allegorical critique, otherwise skip the first hour if you don't. One of the jailed Decepticons on release is saying 'free at last, thank Megatron, free at last' parodying famous quote of Martin Luther King. Oh boy! this movie isn't pulling any punches on its sarcasm of social issues, is it!",Transformers - The Last Knight

243,larrymeers,Worst movie experience i have ever had!,1,22 June 2017,"The Last Knight focuses on Cade and the remaining autobots with a few disposable people along the way that discover a secret in the earth's history, while Optimus Prime is turned evil by his creator. First of all, Anthony Hopkins does a good job at playing Edmund. Its nice to see he tries to put effort and takes his role seriously unlike the other actors. The CGI is also impressive and state of the art. But now for the bad and sadly there is a lot here. The movie is just boring. Michael Bay thinks he can make an entertaining film if he adds a few explosions here and there with some crappy dialogue and terrible slapstick comedy which is not funny at all! There is one part where Anthony Hopkin's character is telling the main people the role that the autobots played through out history and while he does this it cuts to Cogman (the butler droid) doing the background music twice, and this joke is full on stupid! You usually see this joke in kids movies but they thought it was a good idea to do this in a PG-13 film that adults and teens may be watching! The characters fall flat. I am sorry but they really do. Isabela Moner (A new coming actress) plays this stereotypical whiny teen that makes stupid choices in almost every scene she is in. In conclusion, Transformers: The Last Knight is a terrible movie probably the worst in the franchise so far. It has a thin plot, terrible actors/acting, unoriginal, unfunny and idiotic jokes, explosions for the sake of ""Entertainment"", and more prove that Michael Bay simply doesn't care about making an actual decent film as long as it makes billions of dollars. This is by far the worst movie i have ever experienced in theaters. F or 1/10 *I am so sorry to everyone who had to watch this abomination of cinema.",Transformers - The Last Knight
244,jackVSjack,Lives up to form,6,22 June 2017,"Long story not so short. TF5 is much like its predecessors. A wildly (non cannon) convoluted story which you neither can or want to understand.

(Merlin is like a Monty Python character. 🙄) Designed to be served up to a country whom chooses to elect the orange one. At times you smile briefly with the inwardly subdued claim of ""that was kind cool"" But ultimately you feel like your mind has been held at gun point while flashy bits attempt to nonsensically string something together that closely reassembles a closing story arch.

245,zaidmnomani,"The Worst Transformers Movie, And That's Saying Something",1,28 May 2020,"Transformers: The Last Knight is the fifth addition to the Transformers franchise, a pentalogy that should never have existed. Seriously, the fact that studios keep getting away with making such terrible films and still make billions of dollars sickens me.Micheal Bay might be the worst director I've ever seen. When it comes to plot, or character, or having a message, or anything with any substance at all, he completely ignores them in favor of spectacle.Transformers 5 might actually be worse than any of the ones that came before it. As always the characters are barely developed whatsoever. I'm not saying a Transformers movie has to be a character study or anything but at least do more than the bare essentials.Mark Walburg's character is the one with the most amount of screen time, and even he doesn't have a personality. We also get the stereotypical strong female character, as well as the generic love interest.The acting isn't bad. Mark Walburg has had better performances, but he's okay. Anthony Hopkins is actually pretty funny. However, none of the actors have anything to work with. The child actors say lines that no normal kids would ever say.The transformers themselves are shifted to the side here. Optimus Prime is barely in the movie until 2 hours in! One thing that has always bugged me about this franchise is the fact that none of the transformers are given any depth or personality. To Micheal Bay they are just props that push the plot forwards.And wow, what a plot. Or lack of, I should say. Most of the 'story' is just an excuse to have more action scenes. It's basically the same thing we've seen a million times already in every blockbuster of the past two decades. Hero need to find a Macguffin to stop the villain from blowing up the world. This time the Macguffin is a scepter and it's located in some ocean. The villain is some evil robot who brainwashes Optimus into working for her. Meanwhile Mark Walburg and the female character (who's name I can't remember) search for the scepter.The editing is the worst I've seen. Normally I don't usually pay much attention to the editing of any film, but it's impossible to ignore here. For one, the aspect ratio of the film keeps changing. For some reason Micheal Bay kept switching between three different cameras between filming, and it's really jarring. The film also keeps cutting every two seconds, even though it had no need to. This makes the action scenes truly incomprehensible. It reminds me of the Hulk (2003) editing style. There is one car chase sequence that has 113 cuts. Trust me, I've counted.The first two hours of the film focus on the Macguffin plot, and then it just spirals out of control into a total nonsensical third act battle. This is the longest of the Transformers films, about two hours and forty five minutes long. The thing is, it could have easily been cut down into a better paced movie. But I suppose with the way this film is edited that was to much to hope for.It's almost as though Micheal Bay is testing the limits of how bad you can make a movie to be and still be successful. Thankfully, this film didn't make as much money as the the other four, so hopefully this miserable franchise will finally end.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Michael Bay does his favorite edditing here with no shame, he likes it like that. I don't, but it's not so important. The truth is: so called ""Smart viewers"" are like members of religious sect. They can't read between the lines, and they see less than meets the eye. I don't believe in Ranks and Stars, so I gave it 10. You see, if I was able to watch 2 hours and a half movie from start to finish, I can't give it 1 star)) I watched it, I got the meta idea, I laughed a few jokes, felt excitement in some scenes - 1 star?

I'd complain about the plot or the science -- but this is a movie about transforming robots, so I guess that ship has sailed. Its story was better than average, the action was good, the robots didn't transform in the weird way they did in the previous film. It was entertaining, isn't that enough?

Well, wonder no longer because Michael Bay has done it for you. The result is a mess so bad it's awful. There's no doubt this farce is headed straight for Mystery Science Theater; I found myself laughing out loud so much I had to contain myself for fear of being that obnoxious guy sitting in the row in front of you. Yes, each subsequent Transformer flick (since the original) has been terrible but this one takes the cake. I actually forced myself to sit through to the end in order to see how ludicrous this could get. You could, I guess, make the argument that it's great summer fun for the kids. That is, if you don't mind your 8 year old walking out of the theater yelling obscenities that would make Anthony Scaramucci blush. There's nothing like watching your favorite Autobot curse like a sailor; that's storytelling at it's finest. Bay rips off so many movie themes here that it's hard to keep track. To add insult to injury, the ending credits promise yet another sequel. I for one have seen enough of this series to last 10 lifetimes.

254,drawnsupreme,Wait for it on cable TV,2,2 October 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight is not very good. The movie is basically three hours of plot holes, fancy-looking scenery, little-to-no character development and, believe it or not, underwhelming action sequences.I can't believe I'm saying this but even the action sequences felt boring and drawn out. These sequences use to be exciting, jaw-dropping and pure eye-candy all around. What happened? The action sequences were breathtaking in the previous four films - but The Last Knight completely fails to recapture the same magic of the original or even it's sequels.There are so many plot holes as well but I won't get into heavy detail because that would make this review an entire book, but I will say this: There are various things that have changed from the previous movies to this one - with no explanation whatsoever! Over all, it's as if there was no motivation to even make this movie ""good"".

The thefts continue with a number of ideas, like the little blue robot (Star Wars) the fighter drones, that look like Darth Vader's fighters (Star Wars Again), Quintessa, a ripoff of The Borg Queen (Star Trek). Historical blunders include the use of catapults and trebuchets in the 5th century CE, when they weren't used until, at the earliest, the 8th century CE. Let's not go into the idea of transformers only have swords in the 5th century, because well, the humans only had swords, right?
Mark Wahlberg looks to have reduced the Transformer franchise to 8 second action scenes with no beef to it.

Although I've never had a problem with any of the movies, it is still great to see Micheal Bay's (reportedly) last directorial effort taking into account (mostly) all of what bugged the critics before. Robots parts flinging around while they are fighting and can't make sense of the action - corrected. No human element - corrected. I could go on, but you get my point.Also worth noting that it is truly IMAX-worthy, and no other screen would do it justice. Just the sheer scale of things is enough to keep you satisfied during its run-time, especially the final battle scene.Micheal Bay has yet again proved that he is a worthy filmmaker and has churned out yet another summer blockbuster, which wastes no time diving into the action from the first shot.I urge all of you to go watch this summer popcorn entertainment, and have your minds blown.",Transformers - The Last Knight

It's the most overt example of 'pornographied' action whoring I have ever witnessed, with nary a thought to plot construction, characterization, comedy, drama, continuity... or any other scripting skill for that matter.But what else can I say? I have to be honest, if I could put this little effort to a series and have a few hundred million morons keep making me richer because of their obsession with robots and explosions, I'd sell out quicker than Google acquiesced to China's censorship laws.Despite the rhetoric its frontmen spew, Hollywood is really about nothing more than profits.

264,AStormOfSwords13,"Needs new direction, but still enjoyable (Part 1)",7,27 June 2017,"It's been years since I've reviewed a movie. I've felt quite discouraged to continue on after the multiple downvotes I received on my reviews back from 2015. However, the more I saw the reviews of Transformers: The Last Knight, the more I felt I needed to say my own thoughts of the movie, especially since I'm one of the few who still side with Michael Bay's Transformers. Throughout the years, I have come to a realization that Michael Bay's Transformers movies are one of my dearest guilty pleasures because as much as I have bad feelings every time I watch these movies and know I probably shouldn't like these movies, I can't help but enjoy them. Although I will agree that the plots can use some serious brushing up and have seen ""Bay admit his mistakes and yet do nothing about them"", I genuinely enjoy the special effects, the soundtracks never disappoint (Dark of the Moon's soundtrack in particular I regard to as some of the best movie scores I have heard throughout the entire decade), and every time I watch the final battles, I am thoroughly entertained. That is why I am always coming back for more Transformers and will continue to do so for as long as I can. If I really hated the series as much as a lot of other people, why would I even still be going to see these movies?So in Bay's latest offering, we have a King Arthur theme, and considering as I've come across a King Arthur book not too long ago, I can genuinely say that I was amped to see The Last Knight and what that movie did with the whole theme. This movie was more of what we've seen in the past, but as I've explained by saying I still thoroughly enjoy what I enjoy of these Transformers movie, I'm not too bothered by that. I will say that this was my least favorite Transformers of the whole series for a few reasons.For one thing, if you take out the soundtrack, the editing felt very off. This time around, The Last Knight had many scenes in the first 2 acts of the film in which scenes jumped from one place to the next quite a bit and I was left trying to process what I had just watched. Bay, I know you get a lot of hate, and trust me, there are many times throughout the years where I have considered you to be overhated (yes, you saw that correctly, ""overHated"", NOT ""overRated"") when it comes to your Transformers, but it is really hard to defend you when you can't even let us catch up with what happened in the movie and it's given me a headache trying to process it all in my head. It was a major pet peeve, especially when I watched movies such as Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and *shudders* Kool-Aid Cowz? Kamikaze Claus? Oh wait, it's Kod-Adi K.O.Z., which had been 1st place in the Bottom 100 on more than one occasion. Point is, the editing of those movies were so ridiculously, painfully atrocious with those zoom-ins or what have you that they thought looked cool and crowd-pleasing but were in reality god-awfully pestilent and made me want to stab my head with a pick ax, and Bay, if your editing is going to remind me of THOSE movies, then that sure as hell is NOT a good thing. If you left some of those scenes out and expanded on some other of those scenes, I can guarantee you I would not be talking about this right now and more people probably would have enjoyed your movie. Oh, and that Suicide Squad introduction for some of the Transformers? Nuh-uh! Although I didn't hate that movie on its own, I didn't particularly enjoy Suicide Squad either, and I SURE as hell did not need to be reminded of that movie here. If you get inspirations from Suicide Squad of all movies, you need to get help.Also, there were some humans they really could have left out of the movie. That guy who worked for Cade in the junkyard? Didn't need him. Some of those government idiots? Didn't need them. Izabella? She's debatable, but I would not have been sad to see her have been cut since she didn't add too much to the whole plot. I do, however, like that Izabella is a survivor of the the events in Chicago that took place in Dark of the Moon, and if in a future installment she got expanded upon and really made likable, then by all means keep her in the franchise, especially if Mark Wahlberg is leaving his role of Cade as was reported.Oh, and speaking of roles, I'm actually really glad to see some older characters return for this film. The last film really missed Lennox and Simmons, and Morshower I was actually happy to see back as well. And speaking of, remember back in film one when Lennox was about to become a father? It's not too far from the time in life where his child is old enough to become a character their self, so I wouldn't be surprised to see them get thrown in in the near future considering Izabella's age is 14 and we've been watching these movies for 10 years now.

Although it was a great action packed film, it felt like nothing came of it and it dragged out the plot of the story way too long. I mean for what actually happened in the film it could have easily been made shorter and to the point. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy a good 70% of the film but there was no real progression of what happened. it was just like all the other Transformers, they come to earth, in this case they are already there but in hiding due to governmental issues, then they are needed, bad guys turn up, they destroy everything, when all hope is lost they win and triumph the day.

I gotta tell ya when I first went to go see it I was excited out of my mind cause of how much I liked the first 3 and somewhat liked the 4th. Right off the bat, I could already tell the writing was gonna be all over the place, definitely something that I sensed a little bit in the 4th one, but I was still pretty much ready to tolerate it. After the opening scene I really got kinda bored from that woman and all the London stuff, felt very unnecessary. I was a little underwhelmed by quintessa, I expected the creators to be a little more big and intimidating. The movie just kinda drags on from there and puts in a few too many elements of certain things that just kept me from enjoying it as much as I did the first three. TOO much focus on the human characters is another thing that really annoyed me. But I gotta admit the movie did have its moments, especially the final battle.

Seriously, story in this film is terrible. It is a crime against the rules of Writing and the Logic itself.I won't say anything about planets, gravity and other science. I am sure you can tell a good story without real science involved. You can add dragons, robots from outer space, hyperspace, teleports and everything else. But the inner logic! It must be! And in a sequel it must stay the same as before.Who are these persons? Who is that guy? Why are they here? Why did you kill those guys? Where did they come from? Is this ally or enemy? Who is fighting who, finally?! All those questions will follow you on your way home from a cinema.It's never been like this before in Bayformers. In every previous movie you could clearly tell what was going on, be that Sector Seven's hunt for aliens, or Fallen's return. In TLK... characters just appear on screen one by one, have their names called and start fighting. Both human and cybertronians. And that's it.A lot of gaps in the story. A lot of loose ends. A lot of contradictions to what's been told in previous TF-movies of Bay. A lot of useless cameo characters who just show up on screen for a minute or two.As for everything else... it is still a Bay movie where everything goes BANG.

Michael Bay has done nothing but ignorance and laziness all throughout the story. No continuity, no story, just Mumbo-jumbo. I'll list it out. 1. Megatron. How in the world did Galvatron return to his old form? There was no explanation, no flashback or anything. What, so we're supposed to assume that he somehow found Cybertron (which I'll get into later) and returned as Megatron? How? 2. Cybertron. Cybertron was destroyed in Transforjers 3! How could it be still out there when the space ridge tore it to shreds, no less in five years? Even if it was able to pull an Iron Giant, it would take Millions of years to put itself back together. Poor writing3. The Autobot hate Propaganda. Again, why? We went over this after 3. They were already exiled, they're only way of transportation off Earth was destroyed, they have nowhere else to go, and they came back and fought for humanity anyways, and somehow they're still seen as the villains. Why? It's been done since 2, and it's gotten old. 4. Too many racist/sexist jokes. Enough said. I don't like talking bad about anyone, and it ticks me off that the only thing Bay can find entertaining is by insulting people by his movies. He's done it with Transformers and TMNT, and it's annoying. What else is there to say? I'm glad Bay is no longer directing Transformers.

276,Skaigear,I can think of a 100 other ways to spend nearly three hours.,4,2 July 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight is once again directed by Michael Bay and written by many people. It is the fifth movie overall in the Transformers franchise, and the second shortest one at ""only"" two hours and 29 minutes. For a movie with a running time this long, it certainly did not utilize it very well. Once again a Transformers movie juggles between seven different subplots cutting through them back and forth shamelessly with no sense of artistic merits. This movie was very pretty to look at, but it is a loud, bloated mess that ran about an hour too long. I like the Transformers franchise. I have now seen all five films in theaters. I know they are not the most well written movies, but between Shia LaBeouf's odd charisma, Optimus Prime's gravelly voice and kick-ass robot fights, the movies are just enjoyable as hell. The fourth one, Age of Extinction I have major problems with, because I felt losing LaBeouf lost the series' heart and soul, amongst other problems. This issue was sadly not corrected with The Last Knight.Mark Wahlberg, who is a tremendous actor, was just not right for the part. The Transformers series is first and foremost a franchise for kids, based off a toy line for kids, thus having the main character being a grown man instead of an adolescent lessens the emotional connection with the major targeted audience. The reason why I think the first three are way more enjoyable than this one and the fourth one is because Sam Witwicky, a teenager was the main character of the movies. Even if the plots were thin, we could still follow the young protagonist's journey and watch his growth from a boy to a man. With Wahlberg's character of Cade Yeager, he is already a man, a middle-aged one with a daughter at that. Instead of continuing Sam's story from high school to college and beyond, we get a stereotypical muscled action hero that just does not fit in with a series that started off as just a story about a boy and his first car.The best character in these movies to me has always been Optimus Prime, and even though he is never featured as much as the humans in any of them, this movie was just egregious about his absence. Optimus is probably in the movie for about 15 minutes out of its extremely bloated running time. It is not a coincidence the movie reaches its most exciting whenever Prime is on screen, and it could have used more of him, instead of constantly cutting back to subplots the audience could not care less about. Once again we get a military subplot, with generals and lieutenant characters that really do not add anything except making certain scenes sound more important as they spew pseudo- complex jargons. We also get a ton of cringey robots talking and behaving like human stereotypes and an annoying, douchebag science guy whom nobody likes or listens to. All the while I just wanted to see Optimus Prime with his heroics destroying robots in one take slow motion.I cannot knock the film for its looks, because it is really gorgeous to look at. The CGI and cinematography are both top-notch. Michael Bay can direct the hell out of an action scene and make nearly anything on camera beautiful. However, being beautiful to look at it does not mean it is exciting to watch, because the latter requires tension and good editing, something this movie does not have. To build tension, we first must understand the stakes, to have stakes we need to know and care about the characters, rooting them for them to succeed. The frantic pace of the film, jumping from scene to scene, means we never get a chance for quiet moments to develop the characters or give us a reason to care about them, outside of expositions.The movie has the potential to be very good. It looks good, the actors do try, and the musical score is awesome, so I believe a couple of tweaks here and there could have definitely fix this. One way in my opinion would be to make the little girl, Izabella the main character instead of Cade. As mentioned, it would provide the audience with a more innocent, sympathetic lens to this world of violent robots and destruction. Isabela Moner who plays the girl was extremely impressive with all the moments she was in the film, so this would be one way to have more of her instead of Mark Wahlberg. If Marky Mark really is not returning for the sequel, I hope they do make Izabella the heroine for the sixth movie. Moner will be 18 by the time Transformers 6 comes out Wait never mind, it is probably not the best idea with Michael Bay as the director knowing his track record with young actresses.This is not a very good movie, but it is not a terrible one either. It is overlong, it is unnecessarily complex with its plot, it does not have good characters and it is edited like a music video. These problems combine makes a bad film, but not an unwatchable one. It will be enjoyed by many who are just looking for mindless explosions and loud, metal clanging against one another for two and a half hours. However, for those who want a film with actual character development, tension in the action scenes or well-written plot, The Last Knight will fall way short. If your friend is treating you to the movies, or it was on Netflix, watch it for free. Otherwise, I can think of a 100 other ways to spend nearly three hours.",Transformers - The Last Knight
277,umashankarpati1997,"Two worlds collide, One survives.",8,1 July 2017,"The most awaited movie for me from a different cinematic universe, other than the DCEU and the MCU.Transformers : The Last Knight is a typical Michael Bay Movie. From the beginning of the movie it starts with MAYHEM ! BOOM !The movie opens in Medieval England where a bloody battle is underway. King Arthur, Lancelot, and their armies are fighting back against a barbarian invasion.The former was getting suppressed by the barbarians but King Arthur didn't lose hope and was waiting for some miracle in form if magic. It was until Merlin ( self proclaimed Wizard, one from the Army of King Arthur) went to the place where there laid an alien space ship.He begged the residents of that ship for help. This is where everything start.After that brief ""historical"" prologue, we're back in the present day, as mankind is working on destroying the remaining Transformers. Coming to the present Cade Yeager ( Mark Wahlberg ) , a mechanic who lives in a junkyard, where he uses his skills to repair his buddies when they break down. But during a mission - to do something, he winds up taking care of a 14-year-old orphan named Izabella (Isabela Moner). Among all those Mayhem, Cade gets picked up by a Robot Buttler named Cogman, who was sent by Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), a man claiming to know the secret to ending the war between humans and machines, last living member of the ancient Witwiccan order. Burton's autobot Hot Rod kidnaps Viviane Wembly, a professor at the Oxford University. Burton reveals to Cade and Viviane that the latter is the last descendant of Merlin, the Wizard of King Arthur and advises her to use his staff (what is described in the film as a weapon of unimaginable power) and prevent the earth (unicorn) from getting destroyed by the Cybertron. What makes Cade go for all these things are to be watched in the movie.But bumble-bee is at top-notch form. His dialogues are just perfect. One Liners are magnificent. Optimus Prime's character from the transformation at the stage being captivated by the creator of the robots called Quintessa to the stage where Bee makes optimus feel what he is and what is his mission.The Remaining plot of the movie needs ti be watched, all these moments cannot be described by writing.Optimus Prime's screen presence was brilliant.Many WOW moments.Overall, for all the sci-fi and action movie lovers who just crave for humongous action, this movie is a Must Watch.Go and Have a Watch.",Transformers - The Last Knight

6. Transformers the movie: AmazingNow remember i don't find this film terrible there are a few good things to it, so too me it's just bad. But what did they do with the trailers and the plot holes. Oh there are so many plot holes in this movie it's not even funny.Plot hole:
1. One of the best parts of the first movie was the autobots coming to earth. But in this movie it shows they have been on earth before. Countless times!
2. What happened with Galvatron why does Megatron have a new design, I know it's probably because he teamed up with Quintessa but they still never fully explain it.Also the fight between Optimus Prime in the trailers was teased up so much and it's only 2 minuets. You take basically all the scenes of the fight from the trailers put them together and it's the with we see in the movie just with a different background of frame of time. They showed too much in the trailer. One thing that also pissed me off the know end was the lack of Nemesis Prime. He was built up high in marketing and trailers and was the first thing we ever saw from anything from this trailers. He only appears in just like 6 minuets. The human characters sucked, besides Yeager they serve no purpose to the plot at all. And don't even get me started with Isabella and Squeaks because I wanted both of them to die throwout the course of this movie.Onslaught a character teased up big threw production and development only appears in one tv spot and then he gets killed in that same tv spot and only has like one minuet of scream time. So that means the the production was lying to us as well.Theres plenty of things in this movie I can hate but I'm keeping it short so here.4 out of 10This was a bad movie indeed.",Transformers - The Last Knight
279,andrew-riddell-1,Lost it's way,3,24 June 2017,"I have never been a huge Transformer's fan but they are usually packed with action, humour and fun. Unfortunately this latest instalment is lacking on all counts. Not even the stalwart Bumblebee can save it, so where did it all go wrong. The story is confusing with characters serving little or no purpose, bit parts for previously strong re occurring characters and a British Megan Fox !!!!!The Storyline in brief Optimus has gone on vacation to find himself (oh dear) the humans are killing Transformers and Decepticons but never fear Mark Whalberg is here to save the day along with the big yellow guy. So now we need a baddie or baddies, yup you've guest it ""he's back"" Megatron along with a bit of metal tottie who of course turns Optimus bad. So it's up to Mark and Hannibal Lectar to Silence the threat with lots of fighting both physical and verbal. So why does a story that has worked in all other Transformer movies fail?Because it's the same story but you don't care who wins or loses. you just want the franchise to please end. Sorry Mr Bay but this is a total and utter failure.",Transformers - The Last Knight
280,shoguncrosse,OMG! Worst and Corniest Yet!,1,4 July 2017,"Let me put it this way; This film begins good but then becomes so corny and bad that an IMDb review box probably doesn't have enough character space to give it the really 'good' bad review it deserves...Michael Bay and the Studios who produced this film altogether need to step back because this ultimately proves they are all sale outs...certified hacks and, quite honestly, thieves; using millions of dollars then hiring the laziest writers in Hollywood, and now, the laziest director/producer, then making multi-millions in return from us, the audience. Thieves of my time and money! lmfao",Transformers - The Last Knight
281,Ultra_Collectibles,Seen all five transformer movies this is the worst.,1,10 August 2018,"2 and a half hours of pain! This is the ONLY transformers movie I seen at the theater and walked out saying that was awful! Most of the movie made no sense, Optimus was in it for 7 minutes and for 6 of those minutes he was evil. Hated Anthony Hopkins every moment he was on scene. Some of the movie it seemed like the writers never seen the other 4 movies. And new decepticons and then they died within minutes they were introduced. 2 of the dinobots were in it and did absolutely did nothing. Smaller dinobots were in here and no explanation on where they came from or what they could do. Annoying little girl was awful to listen too. Some of the comedy was funny but not a whole lot of that in here. And some of the characters we didnt get toys of, Isnt that the point of these movies? Set your money on fire then buying this movie!",Transformers - The Last Knight
282,afatedcircle,"um, what?",6,20 June 2017,"Just got back from seeing this movie about an hour ago and I have to say it was at least worth the $6.95 I paid to see it, though the 3D actually hurt my eyes a bit around the beginning. While it was worth that much, it's not to say this was an excellent movie at all. 6.5/10.The action scenes were typical Michael Bay, a lot of explosions and not a whole lot of action. He's claiming this is his last one, lets hope so but he's also claimed that about the last 4 now. It felt like actual battles between the Transformers were short and you didn't see a lot of what was going on in this one. That's odd because the reason I went to see the movie was to get a somewhat decent storyline and see Autobots and Decepticons beat the bolts off of each other.The story actually played out fairly weak for a 2.5 hour long movie. Parts of the movie seemed rushed while others were drawn out. A LOT happens in the final 30 minutes and I wish we would have had the last hour and a half of the movie like that instead.Honestly I never noticed the music score at all other than when Anthony Hopkins' Transformer butler was playing the organ and singing. However, the butler was absolutely hilarious throughout.Now for the parts that made me not like this movie.At what point did anyone think sexualizing a 14 year old character(15 year old actress) was a good idea? After the opening scenes of the movie when we meet Izabella she's seen running around in a shirt and pushup bra showing more cleavage than Megan Fox did in the first two movies combined. They did this in the last movie as well with an actress portraying a teenager and it also came off as weird then. Laura Haddock's character, while integral to the plot was there for nothing more than cleavage baring eye candy as well.At multiple points in the movie Decepticons came off as funny, even likable which made it hard to feel any disdain toward them. Heck, while the Autobots repeatedly made short work of them I found myself wishing we would have seen more of them. That goes back to the incredibly short fight scene complaints mentioned above.We see Sam's face in this one! However, he looks crazy which I took as a dig at Shia Lebouf and he's also apparently dead? He's a ""witwiccan"" and Anthony Hopkins and Laura Haddock are said to be the last surviving members? Last and not least...Quintessa and Earth being Unicron....what? Overall a good popcorn flick but suffers from much of the same problems of the last movie.",Transformers - The Last Knight
283,vilaszende,"""Worse in the series""",4,16 July 2020,If you're fan of michel bay and his transformers series you will totally disappointed with one.everything almost everything has been going wrong in this movie even action is worse.,Transformers - The Last Knight
284,octagonproplex,Pardon The Interruption: A Bayhem Apologysts,7,24 June 2017,"Look, let's all agree from the outset that Transformers -- as a concept -- is absolutely asinine. It's a race of advanced alien super machines disturbingly taking on traits of human behavior and cultural affectation whilst mostly rolling around in the guise of various performance vehicles fawned over by philistines. There's no rationale where this isn't a mind-numbing conceit born from a toy line aimed at the aggressive fantasy synapses of immature brains. And that's a perfect sandbox for Michael Bay to build his arena and wallow with gluttonous abandon.So now that that's established, let me declare the main thesis point for advocacy here: He's a genius! That's right -- Michael Bay is a genius!Because Bay is one of the few commonly known filmmakers in the zeitgeist, certain glib hipster constituencies lazily feign credibility in cinematic knowledge by dropping his name in loathing as a pathetic synonym shortcut for superiority though snark. In deed, any faint praise toward Bay is often immediately shot down with hyperbolic aghast and equated to justifying Hitler by his work as a painter, or musing on the songwriting merit of Charles Manson. Now I won't dispute that Bay has an inclination for silly sophomoric humor and vapid glamorization of excess. Nor will I gloss over his propensity to indulge in stereotypes and cliché. One may not be simpatico to his fetishizations, but it's sort of pointless to criticize the very essence of the art form, especially when it's done with such gusto. At lest Bay seems to have a knowing wryness that can take a joke at expense of his brash reputation. As an artist working in the medium of moving visuals, Michael Bay is nothing short of brilliant. If he plays to the lowest common denominator, that denominator in nonetheless true to a passionate perspective set by him. These raucous boyhood reveries aren't just mercenary exploits, but expressions of what Bay truly loves and wants to revisit. Intimately personal to a singular psyche, these are massive experimental art films that happen to align with commerce as their principled dogma. If nothing else, being cognizant that what you're getting is being given with a verisimilitude that absolutely attends to the authentic aura of its own axiom, ought to eek some appreciation -- however begrudging. Just because Bay makes movies with the sensibilities of a thirteen-year-old boy, doesn't mean he ought to be demonized as though guilty of atrocities.It's fairly true that Bay's spectacular extravaganzas cater to simpletons, but the dense amount of information breathlessly presented through pure cinematic terms within them is anything but simple. The fact that most of the breakneck exposition being blasted at an audience actually sticks, is proof that Bay is profoundly competent beyond eye-popping exhilarations. It should be noted that before his feature debut with ""Bad Boys"", Michael Bay was already one of the most sought after and acclaimed commercial directors of all time, having amassed an astounding amount of advertising awards for his ability to pack viscerally entertaining stories into thirty-second to a minute-and-a-half short form films.Unlike the majority of filmmakers credited on complicated productions of vast proportion, Bay (quite uniquely) doesn't shirk responsibilities off to 2nd-Unit crews and department heads to autonomously realize aspects or sequences, but rather personally micromanages all divisions to his specified fruition. With a wicked efficiency in speed and breadth, Bay generals hugely intricate on- set sequences involving simultaneous camera setups of stunning aesthetic composition involving impressive precision in kinetics, frame- rates, lighting, lens augmentations, stunt work and practical effects rigging -- with actors performing in frame – and orchestrates all this ""Bayhem"" safely. Then without missing a beat carries that energy over to lording over every minute aspect of post-production; from the incredibly layered complexities of editing, effects, sound design, music, and even marketing. Bay is no gun-for-hire hack, he is a specific visionary of immense skill set. Although some may be bewildered by the styled nature of its non-stop sensory bombardment -- and regardless as to its vulgar pronouncement, no one can claim it's not often astonishingly beautiful and does somehow express a cohesive whole. That's an extraordinary exhaustive task that only a handful of the most adept and composed directors in the world could even dare attempt, which Bay confidently mounts on a frequent basis, to a degree perhaps unequaled. There is a reason why the often emulated, never replication, bigger than life spectacle that Bay routinely accomplishes has garnered proper recognition, accolade, and defense over the years from peers such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, Edgar Wright, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Quentin Tarantino; Because they know that action and montage is the purest form of cinema and Michael Bay is a master of that discipline -- and the fact that it seems so undisciplined is maybe even a testament too. Also they understand the overwhelming workload required to definitively command such gargantuan ventures, and the fact that Bay does it time and again with virtuoso vision of auteur aesthetic is a totally impressive feat -- even if you don't care for it.Opposing the consensus dismissal that Bay is an unsophisticated abomination that merely makes incoherent populace bombasts that lack any semblance of subtly or nuance in pensive development -- I would counter that perhaps the purveyors of that notion simply lack capacity in comprehending communication through super sophisticated rapid sensorial stimulation. Bay may be stuck in arrested development in his childish proclivities, but that child is nonetheless a supreme savant in cinematic verse.As for ""Transformers: The Last Knight"", it has the same expected virtues I've detailed as well as those defects of being excessively loud and shallow. Sure, I'd prefer Bay tone down the bro banter, silly stoicism, and frenetic editing – but such criticisms can only go so deep when what is presented is so staggeringly authentic to its aspiration. Anyway, Anthony Hopkins seems to be having a helluva time!",Transformers - The Last Knight
285,rich-874-542858,Transformers: a pile of dung,1,18 March 2019,"Someone finally took the restraints of Bay and let him go full whack at this. Everything about this film is ridiculous and they roped in poor Anthony Hopkins into this train wreck, who served as the film's only saving grace.The highly intelligent female lead ultimately goes down the bimbo route when she inexplicably changes into a revealing dress.They also took two of Transformers' most well known characters: Hot Rod and Unicron and essentially castrated them both. Hot Rod is now an emasculated French servant and Unicron has ceased to be the fearsome planet transformer he was and is now planet earth?

286,jdogkg,I have never got the hate for these films,8,25 June 2017,"The transformers movies are known for being hated. Me I personally think these movies are just fun. That's why we watch them, not for an outstanding Oscar worthy film. I know I am in the minority that I love Age of extinction. So I was pretty excited to see this film. The Last Knight is probably the best since the first! It fixes most of the problems people complain about. The racial stereotypes are lowered by a lot. There is no juvenile humor like the last 4 movies have. There are a lot of less explosions which is definitely a plus. And lastly, don't listen to these critics saying it's the ""same movie every time"". I really loved the different direction they took the last Knight in. Mark Wahlberg I love, he gives a great performance and has a great character. All the characters were really likable. And the plot, while convoluted, is still very interesting and well written. Like all transformers movies, the CGI and action is fantastic and pure fun. If you like these movies, your going to have a lot fun watching it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The film was so toxic, so awash with stupidity, that the first four rows of people in the theater died because they had gotten too close to it. I have no proof, but I highly suspect that the projectionist has to wear a radiation suit to protect themselves whenever they handle the film reels.

What is the purpose of this film? To be entertained is the answer. And even though it's 2021 and I had missed this from being incapacitated in a coma, and just now getting around to watching it I am very much entertained by this film. The story the excitement the adventure. It's enthralling. Would I really gives this film a 10 star when you compare it to movies such as Shawshank Redemption? Although those two movies should not even be compared to each other, regardless no. I would not give this movie 10 Stars. I give this movie 10 stars to offset the idiocy of the people that give it one star. The only thing something deserves a 1-star is if it was a entire film filming flies buzzing around manure and that was all of it. That would deserve a one-star. This film deserves at least seven stars.

I would like to point out that since the 1st movie, you have a plot point that negates the previous movie. Every movie is X the reason they are here. Meaning that the X from the previous movie was not the reason they were there.I would love to give the movie a 1 but if I am being objective, the acting was good, the effects were good but that's it. There is so much of the movie you could cut out and it would make it a lot better. Get rid of the whole military ark. The story would still suck but it would be shorter and more packed with the autobots, witch is the only thing that is interesting. Also, if you want to put romance, expand on it. If not then just drop it because doing it half way is just cringy.All in all, do not spend money watching this movie. Vote with your dollars so that the talent of the people working on this movie can be use for better movies. Or at the very least show that we need a better writer for the franchise but my guess is that it has been ran into the ground and nothing could save it anyway.

It is visually stunning (I saw it in 3D) and most of my rating is due to that and the presence of Anthony Hopkins who has fun and is as always a delight. Mark Wahlberg and Laura Haddock do good workmanlike jobs and it's always a treat to see John Turturro and Stanley Tucci in a film however brief their appearances may be. That's the good. The bad of course is an insane plot with scenes melded together in a disjointed manner and completely dumb dialogue. In other words a typical Michael Bay film. Sometimes I think that Michael Bay is kind of like Ed Wood on an unlimited budget. But then Ed Wood films were actually so bad they got me to laugh and Michael Bay films don't give me that same pleasure. Hopefully this is it for this series. The only reason to make another is to see if Michael Bay can break his explosions record and I'm not sure he can get enough people to come see it to justify the money the film will cost.,Transformers - The Last Knight

300,obiegimmie,'Transformers: The Last Knight' Review,2,29 June 2017,"'Transformers: The Last Knight,' is, in summary, an extravaganza of bore under the guise of a blockbuster summer action movie.The first 'Transformers' movie was released in 2007, directed by the now infamous Michael Bay and starring Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox. It was welcome to international profit and praise, boosting a dying 80's franchise to recognition among current audiences. With a budget of $147 million, 'Transformers' grossed a little over $700 million, making it an imminent Paramount cash cow for years to come. The sequel, 'Revenge of the Fallen,' released in 2009 and helmed by the same people, is hailed as a watchable, but mediocre picture. Still, it fared well with young audiences, grossing $836.3 million to a $200 million budget. The third, 'Dark of the Moon,' received more or less the same similar critical feedback. The fourth, 'Age of Extinction,' released in 2014, was slammed and loathed by critics and audiences alike. Now without LeBeouf and Fox, but rather with a tired Mark Wahlberg and his daughter, the atrocity that 'Transformers' had devolved to was, hopefully dead.Yet the disappointments of 2017 persisted otherwise. Paramount's tireless efforts to match other studios in terms of box office hits were quietly fading (ie; Ghost in the Shell, Baywatch) and they needed an immediate hit to raise the numbers. This brings me to, quite possibly, the worst movie of 2017, 'Transformers: The Last Knight.'BENEFITSWell, this is a $217 million movie, so, naturally, the graphics and effects are sleek. But 'Transformers' never was known for its story, rather, the huge and entertaining explosions that come with it. That being said, this franchise has relied on extravagancy for too long and it shows in its fifth installment. DETRACTIONSThis movie is too long. The story could be told efficiently, and quite possibly, more professionally, in a 75-100 minute runtime. Things only pick up when the film has hit its 45 minute mark, which, even for 'Transformers,' is a long time to spend on exposition. Characters are introduced into the film and play little to no part in the movie's goings, yet we spend 15 minutes learning about them. An example would be 14 year old Izabella, a character who seemingly in the first minutes will play a large part. But she does absolutely nothing, for Transformers and humans alike. I reiterate many people's complaints on this movie.THE. HUMANS. DO. NOT. FREAKING. MATTER. Since this is a franchise based off the whims of a 14 year old boy, everything is enlarged and dramatized. Everything. Now, I love watching action in movies. I truly, truly, do. But there needs to be sound, prior context in order for the action to be properly appreciated. Watching Wahlberg and Co; run around an abandoned town just isn't cutting it anymore. I don't know what to say on this film. I really don't. Usually, I love ripping movies to shreds as it fills me with unfiltered glee. This one leaves me simply empty inside. 2.5/1025%F-",Transformers - The Last Knight

I'll be honest, while I'm no fan of these movies, I don't find them too horribly atrocious like some others. Mark Wahlberg is a likable movie star, and does what he can to make the movie worthwhile. Some of the IMAX camera shots look pretty good at times, but the editing kind of ruins some of those moments, as it changes the aspect ratios so inconsistently. I will say that some of the more annoying parts were toned down when compared to previous movies. The whole government aspect isn't nearly as present, and the plot tries, but fails to make sense. Thankfully its about twenty minutes shorter than the last few movies, and doesn't feel quite as tedious to sit through.",Transformers - The Last Knight

316,johnnyjan16,I sincerely hope Michael Bay is done after this...,2,13 September 2017,"First off, i'm actually a fan of Transformers. I didn't mind Age of Extinction, even with the typically horrendous humour and mess of a plot.But this...this just took the cake and ate all of it. The Last Knight is the biggest big budget mess i've seen. I was actually looking forward to seeing this after watching the trailer but didn't manage to find it in IMAX; it was taken off unusually quickly. I can now see why! The only reason I gave two stars is that visually, the film delivers. Incredible CGI, something a little too much, but I didn't come away with a headache when it jumped from fight to fight.Instead I ended up with a massive migraine from the plot. Seriously, who wrote this!? Some staff is the most powerful artifact ever but it's taken 5 films to find it? Earth is in fact Unicron but all the action from the past 4 films doesn't get him going? It's a complete insult when Anthony Hopkin's character (oh how the mighty fall) says a Transformer kills Hitler. What the hell? This film feels like Michael Bay just sticking two fingers up to everyone and going hell for leather. The humour wasn't just bad, it was horrific. Every scene where you thought there might be an essence of seriousness ended up being a Michael Bay tribute of sex jokes, insults and some of the worst writing you will hear in any film, let alone something the size of Transformers.Megatron is a gang leader, who recruits some of the worst Decepticons you will see across the franchise. Rather than being intimidating, they're like the comedy villains who you end up laughing at. Megatron negotiating to get his pals out of robot prison? Sweet Jesus.The potentially interesting Nemesis Prime story lasts all of 10 minutes before a few words from Bumblebee turn him back into his insufferable Optimus ego. All interest in Prime goes when he starts rallying his motley crew with just some of the worst dialogue written.I'm genuinely stunned that Michael Bay has been allowed to continuing ruining Transformers all this time. This does feel like the last one he will ever touch, thankfully. They need to restart this whole franchise, get a decent director and for gods sake write a NORMAL script! You have to see this just to say you have, but just to give you fair warning: The Last Knight is the biggest joke of 2017.",Transformers - The Last Knight
317,cgrill8,Better than expected!,7,12 July 2017,"Trying not to spoil anything here. The movie was much better than I anticipated! I had spoiled much for myself before going to see it. The plot was better than Age of Extinction. There were Transformers all over the place. Some of the transformations were really cool. A few filler characters did not speak, nor transform (like the submarine!) But there were tons of little scenes that stole from Beast Wars, Transformer Prime and even the 1986 movie! Yes the movie is an explosion fest. It's a Bay film... expect it. Yes the movie is long, but it actually moved right along connecting the dots fairly well for us this time. The effects were great and better than the fourth installment. I found the movie to be rather good! And here's the rub. This would have rated R 'back in the day'. Fair warning, if you're taking your young kids (who might be collecting the sad-looking toys)... there are more curse words in this movie compared to all the ones before it. Bay went out with a blast in three ways. 1 in story. 2 with explosions. 3 and with the language. It was really cool seeing some of the older and previous actors showing up in this movie and tying everything somewhat together. Where they will go from here is anyone's guess. I want to say more, but really don't want to spoil anything. And the Decepticons have more personality (finally) than ever. Yeah, there are a few dots WE have to connect. Megatron probably hated being called something that humans named him, AND from their 'creation' from the previous movie. It's not hard to image him 'rebooting' himself. (Heck, the Creator could have!) Bumblebee may have had secret meetings with what was left with KSI from the previous movie in order for him to have some of HIS abilities. The connections are not really there, just something for the audience to put together (it's not THAT hard, people). Now remember this is the TRANSFORMERS world/universe. So check out all the previous series to understand some of these movies (you don't HAVE to... but it helps). I only had one gripe with ONE human character (the nerdy guy that shows up near the end)... This is a fun 'splosion fest Transformer movie that was very fun to watch. Loved the car chases! Don't listen to the critics! Just go see it on the big screen. Hate I missed the 3D showings... darn. It was missing some decent humor, but overall one of the better TF movies! Lots of bots! You might go ""Where'd he get THAT!?"" or ""How did they know this?"" at times, but it's just an action movie. Just go with it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

When i started to watch this one, i was indeed impressed by the opening scenes in England during the time of dark ages. Afterwards i found the theme interesting and i can say only one thing. This is by far the best Transformers movie, funny, great action scenes and 150 minutes just flow by. the most underestimated sci-fi action movie of the Year.",Transformers - The Last Knight
324,Blazs91,"Food for the eyes, but not for thought",4,15 July 2017,"It is the same old story again: the world of Transformers doesn't know the word, 'peace' (or pace), and this time social ecosystem of Michael Bay's robots is intimidated by a possibly underestimated ancient threat, which has possibly been implanted into the humans' culture. this fifth incarnation of the Hasbro toy franchise is probably the most powerful mix of action sequences and clamorous special effects, which, interestingly, could strike with a decent dose of drowsiness. it lasts two and a half hours, and watching it in IMAX 3D was a total hit for my eyes. however, it was still a traumatizing experience at the same time, because it faces the issue of reanimating the series for the fifth time with the inability of creating a narrative story, which is compensated by eye-catching explosions.Mixing the elements of human history and the mythology of the Transformers might be a cliché of the saga today, but in this sequel we are kind of pushed to the boundaries of surrealism: Merlin, Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table signifying the base of the main story (not if there was any other thread), by revoking an ancient legend which could signal serious threats to the humans and the Autobots altogether. surprisingly, this issue will be handled by Mark Wahlberg and the beautiful, ever-vulgar Laura Haddock. As the movie aspires to project a coherent picture front of our eyes, it, instead, succeeds to be lost in the introduction of too many characters. It is accompanied by action scenes so amazing which almost reach uncharted peaks, but it would still be more effective if they were a little bit more condensed in a shorter time.In sum, the movie is visually powerful, a vortex of palpitating and impacting action, which smashes your retina. From the direction point of view, this flick has, again, managed to be admired by the fans of beautifully depicted destruction. If we didn't get enough splinters flying right into our eyes in the 4th chapter, this time we should definitely wear more defensive head gears. However, if you were hungering for more, than one-hour narration of a story which can be concluded in two sentences, followed by a 90 minutes incessant sequence of action blast, then this blockbuster will not be your cup of tea, since it doesn't offer much more, compared to the previous three installments.Rating: 4/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
325,christinemartinez1976,good fun,10,19 July 2017,"As someone who has not seen the cartoons, things like Unicron, etc. are lost to me. I like seeing the different upgrades for the Autobots and the new ones they have in the current movies. Kids today may have not seen the cartoon and only know the cool toys that change into things from the movies. For someone who doesn't know much about Transformers, the movies are the best thing in the world because there is nothing to compare it to. The creators of the Transformers? I would not be able to give an answer because I did not know there was one until the movies,but someone like my husband knows because he has seen the cartoons. I do not know if Optimus becomes bad in the cartoons. These movies are for people who just want entertainment and do not really know about Transformers. Reviews are saying it is the same thing over and over again, but when thinking about the few episodes I saw of the cartoon, it was pretty much the same. Autobots battle Decepticons on Earth and humans get caught in middle, just add in different characters in the episode. In the movies, there are objects that are found from Cybertron and they battle for usage of it. The people who write badly about it should take it for what it is worth:FUN",Transformers - The Last Knight
326,peterspam-22486,"Had I known what awaits me, I would have gone drunk first.",5,31 October 2017,"It's difficult to say anything good about a Transformers movie since the franchise started up: there should only have been a first and last part, which by itself was enough nostalgia for those growing up with the cartoon series, but rather meaningless for anyone else in the modern CGI sci-fi era, except for the original concept of robots transforming. So parts 2-4 have really been meaningless heaps of CGI with boring monologues and flat humor, what would this part offer more than that? I was therefore surprised to see some actual story line and a refreshing British taint that brought the franchise out of its boring mindset for a short half hour, somewhere in the middle of the movie. But then it fell back into its usual Hollywood/US-military-loving/bullshit-heroism self with a blurry content and a ridiculous music accompanying a ridiculous amount of bullets and explosions that seem to produce less damage on the actors than a casual snowball thrown by a 5-year old. I mean, how BAD can a director get that puts a whole orchestra of strings under the most action-packed part of the movie?? They used to teach anti-climatic movie directing by showing Star Wars with Luke fighting Darth Vader and playing the real musical underscore, followed by the same scene with a waltz playing to show the blatant way how to take away all momentum from a movie scene. It's as if Michael Bay wanted to ruin his own movie by putting the worst possible musical score underneath it, to make sure no one with any taste can enjoy the final scenes, which were an absurd joke by themselves. The issue I have with the TF franchise is that it really feels like one big advertisement for the US Army, Navy, Airforce, you name it. The main hero always plays the ideal soldier in the end, fully backed by the US troops. Even Optimus Prime's one-liners are the most cheesy ones you'll ever hear in any movie. It's as if the movie cannot get rid of the curse of having to become an enlistment commercial. Not surprising though, seeing the number of commanders from the military in the credits towards the end.. Probably some serious financial backing there.. So what do we end up with? The story that we need heroes and in the end true heroes realize their mistakes and all ends up for the best. But the way to get there has never been more confusing, actually discrediting the whole concept of heroism. All in all, Michael Bay managed to discredit the Transformers and degraded them to circus clowns and nitwits, made ridicule of all the armed forces of the US and put down the most flat characters in movie history without any character development, while defying physics throughout the movie. The reason this still got a 5 from me is the stunning visual effort of the scale, the pleasant twist of putting a real actor in the game (Sir Hopkins) and the occasional story line that pops up amid the shoot-em-up chaos. Watching it on mute may actually prove more entertaining, guessing the story line yourself may make up a more meaningful story in the end!If you want to get confused by the lack of consistency, have never seen a modern sci-fi with CGI and love to shoot things, go see this movie, you'll love it. For anyone else, it's not worth the bother, unless you're drunk.",Transformers - The Last Knight
327,Neonfinity,Transfivers Five,3,25 September 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a 2017 Sci-Fi Action film directed by the one-and-only Michael Bay. Starring Mark Wahlberg and Sir Anthony Hopkins featuring the voice talents of Peter Cullen and John Goodman. This film was distributed by Paramount and I have seen it with my brother over the summer. Let's begin the review. The film starts after the events of Age of Extinction, where Cade (Mark) is now an owner of a vast junkyard keeping most of the Autobots safe instead of being an inventor. Anthony Hopkins owns a robot butler and other relics from Transformers history. The world is going to end because Cybertron is going to crash into Earth. And this all ties into King Arthur, Merlin and Stonehenge. Confused? I was.The only real notable characters of the film include Anthony Hopkins, his robot butler Cogman, and Optimus who is only in the film for 20 minutes despite seeming like the main character for all the promotional material. Everyone else can be forgotten.I felt like dying during The Last Knight. It felt impossible to keep track of due to the amount of stuff they put in and most of the characters leave the movie and come back towards the end. Not to mention the aspect ratio changes with each shot for some reason. I guess it looked nice in IMAX but this feature made the film look rushed and incomplete. I could go on, but i'd like to spare you my trouble.This film doesn't include themes so I lied about sparing trouble. I miss the writing of the fourth one no matter how odd it was. It had time to develop who Cade was and develop his situation in Age of Extinction. The editing is all over the place and it feels as if nothing is connected due to how much can go by in a minute switching from the military to Cade to Sir Anthony and then to Optimus on Cybertron.I'm starting to think that the Transformers audience is starting to drift away from these movies realizing they are out of ideas. I mean King Arthur does not equal Transformers lore. Nor did it show Hitler's hand getting blown off by a watch. I think these movies are sort of guilty pleasures for me since I grew up with the first one, this being an exception.Overall, I give Transformers: The Last Knight a 3/10",Transformers - The Last Knight
328,nmanwarren,"Not as good as the first, but still a must-see compared to Age of Extinction.",7,20 June 2017,"You would think, considering the previous Transformers films, that this movie would be a repeat of Age of Extinction and just have nothing but swearing and explosions every 10 seconds, then you are about 50% correct. This film actually had a STORY, a good story. They introduced a lot of new characters and was actually more exciting to watch then the previous 3 pieces of garbage.Out of the the entire film franchise, i'd say this one comes out as one of the most exciting, almost as good as The Dark of the Moon. Sure, it had the classics, a ton of explosions and mostly fighting throughout the entire movie, but the story made up for it.The movie also had a good sense of comedy. This comes from Cogman, a new character, who is very similar to the well-known K2SO, from Rogue One.I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the Transformers film franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I also strongly felt the rest of the theater seemed to have really have enjoyed it too. I did not see anyone leave, or storm out like some of comments here seem to be doing. I really think some of these comments and critics are like a poison to the internet. I almost canceled watching the show tonight thinking this was a waste of money but once again the ratings for another Michael Bay movie are flooding with hate and bad reviews.I just don't understand these comments and the really low rating. If the Transformers movies have such low expectations why are these people hitting up the movie on opening week and tossing out 1/10. I just don't get it, 4 previous movies have been release all about the same quality. You know what you're paying for. I really suggest anyone who hasn't seen the movie to get it in AVX, the 3D was well worth it and it was probably one of the best experiences in AVX I have ever seen.

Those who are critical of the story line just make me laugh my butt off-- how is the story supposed to be better??? LOL. It is a movie about alien machines coming to earth, per usual, but this time they tied it into the King Arthur legend. This brought a very earthy, human feel to the movie which was refreshing and gave this particular transformers movie a breath of new life. So for those who just criticize movies to make themselves feel better, GET A LIFE.From an action standpoint this movie is just phenomenal-- they have really perfected the action sequences by slowing down ""transformations"" which really allows the viewer to soak in the ""alien technology"" and the spectacular CGI.This movie is fine-- people need to alter their expectations before they go into the theater expecting an Oscar nominee experience-- this is TRANSFORMERS, lol, and it blew me away.",Transformers - The Last Knight
331,edithp-37476,A work of insane genius,10,16 September 2017,"Future generations will study this movie as the dawn of a new age in film-making. It has everything you could possibly want out of two- and-a-half hours of cinematic, action-packed gold; and so much more besides. Anthony Hopkins giving the finger to the police outside downing street and calling random people 'dickheads'? Check. A mad, four-foot robot butler who kind-of- but-not-quite breaks the fourth wall by accompanying dramatic scenes with his own incidental music, before firing himself out of a World War II submarine torpedo chute to catch a brace of tuna, cooking and preparing them and setting up the bickering main characters on an underwater date, as they're being chased by the military, on their way to the crash site of a 1600 year-old underwater spaceship, which contains the grave of Merlin. Um, check. And speaking of which; a drunken Merlin (played by Stanley Tucci) riding through the ancient and dramatic British landscape on horseback, wielding a mystical staff that controls an Autobot dragon, who goes on to destroy some Saxons and save King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table from certain destruction? Check.Historical note: the Saxons actually won that wider war, they went on to become the English. Arthur was actually Welsh, although at the time Welsh and Scottish people were all just 'Britons', of Celtic origin. The Welsh word for English is 'Saeson', which means Saxons. Most English people don't realise this, but the Celtic peoples have never forgotten how they were driven out of their lands all the way back in the Fifth-Century. In Scottish Gaelic the English are called 'Sassanach', which also means Saxon. Both languages are still spoken today. (Don't tell the English.)These are just a few of the myriad delights this mad film has to offer, there are many more besides. The fact that it has only gotten a 15% 'fresh' rating on the site that gave Paul Feig's Ghostbusters 73% just goes to show what politically-motivated snobs movie critics are at heart. This is genuinely the freshest, funniest, most exciting and emotional film I have seen in years. No wonder people don't make excellent movies any more, when original works of wonder and imagination are met with sneering and contempt, by the same people who fawn over politically-motivated rehashes that offer little or nothing in the way of entertainment. Whoever would have thought that in the year Alien: Covenant was released that two of the absolute best, most enjoyable movies released would be the fifth installment of the Transformers franchise and Kong: Skull Island.

And as someone already said, all these critics and you tubers are LOSERS who have never directed a film and never will! So yes, it was an amazing movie and let the haters hate.I went to the cinema to get away from reality for a couple of hours and entertain myself and The Last Knight gave me what I asked for. Especially the combination of real life history and fantasy is something I always love and in this sense the story of The Last Knight is the best of all Transformers movies.Should you spend your money to watch it? Absolutely! You will like it if you're not a whiny spoiled adult child.Is it perfect? Certainly not. I have two complaints:1.Too many characters, both humans and Transformers. When I watched the sneak peek with the WW1 Transformer I was excited to see him kicking ass. I was disappointed. That black guy (what was his name?) was completely unnecessary. Isabella (no I don't spell it with Z, OK?) was completely unnecessary and I also didn't like her. That physics nerd (what was his name?) was pointless too. It is impossible to develop so many characters in a two and a half hour movie which made them all a bit soulless, even in the end. The end of the previous movie was far more touching and gave me goose bumps unlike in this movie.2. Optimus Prime barely gets any screen time. There was a moment about in the middle of the story when I thought ""Where the hell is Optimus Prime?"" He appeared for the last act and kicked ass but it certainly wasn't enough. It is the first Transformer movie without Optimus showing the wise side of his character. That was actually sad.",Transformers - The Last Knight

339,jonas_bassforce,A big mess or something.,5,25 June 2017,"Alert! Alert! Spoilers ahead! OK, you've been warned.First of all: the story! I actually liked the story with its ancient mystery involving the Knights of the round table and all that. However, it's way too rushed through to make room for action. Literally two hours of the movie is dedicated to action sequences or likewise and just about half an hour to the story elements. While the story itself is quite good and interesting, when being rushed through like that it gets confusing. Not to mention it leaves a truckload of plot holes behind. Almost like Michael Bay and his screenwriters didn't watch their previous movies (or didn't care about it).Pacing: terrible! Hard to see or keep up with what's going on since the movie is cut so fast and messy. I looked away a couple of times during some action sequences just to rest my eyes and when I looked up I couldn't tell what was going on.Character development: none. The little girl who is introduced very early and we got hints in the trailers that she would have some big role to the story, is literally useless and does nothing but to get in the way. Instead the big task to save the day is given to the older woman, who we are told is the only one who can wield the great weapon (staff of Merlin). But all she really does with it is grab hold of it. What that does is unclear since it gets lost in some messy action scenes. Optimus Prime apparently was supposed to deliver some great drama since he turns to evil, but that was given only about 2 minutes of screen time during which he fights for a while and then becomes himself again. It was hard to tell if anyone actually did anything or if things just happened by themselves.Fan letdown: Being a big fan of the original Transformers since childhood, I'm kind of disappointed of the way they treated Unicron. Why did they change his role and give it to Cybertron instead? Makes no sense why they refuse to stay true to the original story elements. The same goes for Transformers 4 where they had Galvatron be man-made instead of Megatron being changed into Galvatron by Unicron. Also the way they treated the Decepticons in this movie was almost unbearable to watch. Released from prison?? Come on! And again, as with pretty much all the robots, they didn't do much. And also, who is who in this huge mess of new robots? Wasn't the Dinobots from the previous movie supposed to be ""the legendary knights""? Or are they still? I'm so lost here..Some plot screw-ups: In the first ""Transformers"" from 2007 Optimus Prime clearly states that Earth is an unknown planet. Yet Bumblebee apparently has been here since the forties? Not only that, the Transformers appear to have been here on and off since the time of Pangea according to this plot. So that makes Optimus seem like an arrogant idiot who don't care much about their history at all.The Cybertron that appears in Transformers 3 is much bigger than Earth. This one ""attaches"" itself to Earth and is now somehow smaller than our moon. Maybe there's a reason for that but they forgot to tell us.How can Unicron be inside Earth without anyone noticing, including the Transformers?Why is Megatron back all of a sudden? Wasn't he Galvatron last time we saw him?Humor: Better than the last one. In this movie the jokes are mostly funny, unlike Transformers 4 which was embarrassing at that. I especially like when the C-3PO butler ripoff is trying to score the storytelling moment with epic music! Hilarious.In conclusion: Get rid of Michael Bay and his writers team and give it to someone who is more of a storyteller than an action director, more a true fan of Transformers, or stop making these movies. While action is part of Transformers, you still need story lines to keep it all together, like the first one. I'll rate this 5/10 because I like Transformers and the story they attempted to tell here. Entertaining stuff if you're into that kind of thing.",Transformers - The Last Knight

There are literally dozens characters who's purpose Doesn't MATTER AT ALL. Like continuity in this film Doesn't MATTER AT ALL. The assumption in the arc of this film is that the viewer has no electrical impulses in the brain whatsoever. It's so bad, I mean, it makes Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look like BLADE RUNNER. It made Catwoman seem well executed. It made X-3 look cleverly scripted. I feel insulted that Spielberg or Hopkins even tacked their name to this POS. Sweet Jesus. It has everything in it: dragons, aliens, robots, secret societies, planet killers, Nazis, Merlin, the knights of the round table - it has everything except sense. It makes no sense. None.

343,KingKongKyle,"If Nothing Else, It's Entertaining!",6,25 June 2017,"I've long criticized the Transformers films. And I still hold that they could be so much better than they are. But what I can't deny is that they do hold a certain spectacle to them. There's still something amazing about seeing these gigantic robots come to life, a testament to the visual effects wizardry of modern movie-making. This new film actually does attempt to fix a few of of the bigger complaints from the previous entries. For one, our female leads are competent, capable, empowered women who hold their own, a far cry from what we've previously seen in this franchise. Also the ""racially- insensitive"" robots are scaled way back, thankfully. For the most part the voice-castings seem authentic to the character portrayed without entering the territory of offensive stereotypes. And the Michael Bay camera angles, the nauseating slanted from the ground up shots that just take me out of a lot of his work because it seems like the cameraman is drunk, those are also scaled back. In fact, there's actually some gorgeous shots throughout this film, and I can confidently say this is the best-looking film in the franchise.Unfortunately, a lot of the same problems from previous films are still present. For starters, it's just too darn long. Even movies about epic historical events don't need to be this long; so at 2.5 hours, a movie about fighting robots is bound to out-stay it's welcome, and it does. There's a lot of the middle hour of this film that can just be cut. And as likable as Isabela Moner's spunky orphan is, her character just does nothing for the overall story the movie is following. She could have been left out altogether and it would have cut out a good twenty minutes of film and the story would have still arrived at the same ending. Other issues include the horrid dialogue, a meandering story (which I'll give credit for at least trying to establish some kind of connected Transformers history), John Turturro making an a*s of himself, and a cast struggling to perform what they know is trash.That being said, Transformers is enjoyable trash, like junk food. You know it's not good for you, and you may even feel guilty eating it, but enjoying it once in a while won't kill you. Similarly, I could sit here and berate T:TLK to no end, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. The last half-hour or so of battle is quite a ride, and there's some solid editing afoot at least during that section of film as it jumbles several characters' perspectives at once. It should come as no surprise that the recommended viewing format in this case is the biggest screen you can find with solid speakers, and yes-cough up the extra cash for the 3D. This is probably the best use of 3D so far this year. The scenes with the fighter jets are particularly good, making you feel like you're flying right there with them. If you're a fan of these films already, you'll be delighted. If you think they're horrible, this one won't change your mind. If you're like me and you see them as a reasonable excuse to watch giant robots blow stuff up, you should leave the theater satisfied. 6.5/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight
344,felix-bergman,Fell asleep due to doredom and confusion,3,2 June 2019,"This is no question the worst of the Transformers Movies. This already 2,5 hrs movie took me almost 4 hrs to watch as I kept falling alseep due to boredom and had to rewind to keep up. As I'm writing this it is literaly 5 minutes after watching the movie and I could not for a milion quid tell you what it was acctually about. There was some kind of villiain wanting to destroy the world, but I could not tell you her name, motive or how (or even if) they defeated her at the end. There is some BS about King Arthur and how apparently Merlins staff had something to do with the destruction of the Earth, but other than that I could not tell you how any of that was important to the story. I think Megatron was in this movie, but honestly that is all based on the cast list on IMDB. Mark Walberg is back, and his characters name is the same and he references Age of Extinction a couple of times, but other than that there is very litte to suggest he is acctually the same person as last time. There is some kid who looked as if she was important, but then????? And there was some kind of sword (Excallibur?) that Mark used all of one time in the entire moive, and not even in any kind of battle.

But it doesn't take a transformers fan to notice how bad this is and disgraceful it is to the franchise ugh. Where the last four films succeeded this one fails. And where the last ones failed this one also fails. The plot is nonsense idiotic and literally doesn't make any sense it starts off with knights and says the transformers have been in the shadows since than which retcons the past four films DO THESE EVEN TAKE PLACE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE?!?!? On top of that the cinematographer and editors must have been drunk on the job because the cinematography looks like it was done by an eight year old and the editing by a monkey. Literally the aspect ratio changes at least five times in one scene and the film can't even do a master shot (conversation scene) right which is one of the first things taught in film school like what? Don't even get me started on how little bay and the writers understand the lore and tbh I won't its a waste of time on all and any accounts DO NOT WATCH,Transformers - The Last Knight

I think the quality remained throughout... the problem was that the 'throughout' was way too long. This is the major breaking point of the movie. as I was watching it, I found myself wondering how much longer it was going to go on for. an audience really should not be feeling that way. Also I did not care about any of the new characters especially the decepticons.... could not even remember their names. Megatron and Optimus are combined for 20 Min's. in the movie. The story may be dumb,but the 3rd act, with all those magnificent action scenes was fun.

349,ustheman,Bayhem: The Last Knight,8,24 June 2017,"Hard to define this movie. If you Mix sky diving and the roller coasters from the 6 Flags theme park, you get Transformers 5: The Last Knight. A visual bayhem experience of explosions, cars, cliché moments and women. Though compared to his previous style and movies, there was less objectification of women. If that is something that triggers you, that's one change that was noticeable in this film. The Female lead had a purpose and a role in fighting the ongoing onslaught that had evolved in the transformers cinematic universe. Though movie in itself had an impressive mythology aspect to it. It did bring about loop holes and possible plot holes that need to be explained. If you are watching a transformers film for the Oscar worthy story then you are not watching it properly. This is a franchise where you shut your brain off from the world and enjoy the adrenaline fueled rush.Acting: 5/10 (I don't know what it is, but acting felt dull. Mark Wahlberg was good and less annoying in this film but still felt it could have been played by anyone else. Anthony Hopkins was brilliant, played the mysterious British character with finesse and added a good comedy aspect to it. Laura Haddock the female lead was OK as well, again she could have been replaced by anyone but on the plus side her character had an actual role rather than being a Michael Bay eye candy. The side characters didn't hit the mark. For some reason they felt off pace with the film though they had their moments, they just didn't seem to click)Action: 10/10 (like all Michael Bay films he can't go wrong with the action. Giving him the nick name of bayhem he certainly delivers on this. The aesthetic set pieces mixed with the unorthodox cinematography and CGI was a visual masterpiece. The most explosive transformers to date)Sound: 10/10 (Michael bay is a vivid supporter of the Dolby Atmos cinematic sound. This film was specifically made in the sound mix of Dolby Atmos. The helicopters flying from left to right of cinema, fighter jets flying in and out around the 360 degrees speakers, explosions coming from all angles of the cinema speakers leaves u in awe. This is a film where you must go out of your way to pay that extra dollar to watch it in a Dolby Atmos) Story: 7/10 (Michael bay with a story? There have been critics of bay saying there is no story in this franchise or this film. I beg to differ. This movie like the second film and little of the third, expanded the transformers universe. Though there might be conflicts in plot because of the new history of earth, mythology being added to the story and various scientific inaccuracies. It served quiet well and leaves the viewer eager to know more. With new transformers being added to the film the introduction to them was spot on)Feels/nostalgia: 10/10 (This film had many heart throbbing tear jerking moments. The human emotion that Michael bay that gives to the transformers is brilliant. Though cliché at times, it is the type of film where you can accept a cliché and enjoy it rather then roll your eyes back. For the fans of the franchise there is lots of nostalgia to be experienced)Over all score of 8.4/10 #UzziReviews",Transformers - The Last Knight

354,arkrandomkindness,Could of been better (Spoiler Alert),7,30 October 2017,"Overall I give this one a handsome 7. The starting to the film seems pretty well set up with a good medieval battle and moving on from there. I will be honest its probably the funniest of the Transformers I've watched, and there is some nice short romantic scenes between Cade and the new girl which is very nice. Another nice thing was having old cast return to the film, as well as being able to see more of the Transformers actually Transform unlike the 4th film. Also get a short but epic scene with the dinobots and Cogman is both funny and annoying. I am however very disappointed in Barricade in this film. From all the trailer scenes I was expecting at least a short but decent cool battle between Bumble Bee (hopefully better than the 1st film fight). But unfortunately there is hardly anything between Bumble Bee and Barricade but a simple car chase and that's about it. Megatron was very cool looking, and pretty mean as well. I am however also disappointed the fight scenes with him are also extremely short lived compared to the 4th film where Prime fights Lockdown.Overall for the amount of effort put into the film, its also a fun edition to the franchise, and there are some much better scenes of Transformers and some very cool shots of Transformers. It also ties up a lot of the other films (ignore the plot holes if you can), it is more of a fun film, and I would never suggest taking Transformers as a serious film.

355,criticadelcinema,Please stop making these films.,2,19 July 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight fails in every aspect, proving to be an awful example of lazy film making. Please stop making these films. The writing here is appalling. Like every Transformers movie, the plot is needlessly convoluted. There are long scenes of exposition throughout this film, adding to the already bloated run time (we'll get to that later). I don't understand why the writers behind this franchise can't help themselves from over complicating a story line about fighting, talking robots. Every one of these films have convoluted plot lines, but The Last Knight triples down: giving a grand total of three convoluted plot lines. Transformers is not a high grossing franchise because of it's plot, but because of the spectacle of giant robots fighting each other. With a budget of $260 million, it shouldn't be too hard to deliver on spectacleright? Wrong. Director Michael Bay finds a way to ruin the spectacle as well.Action is sparse towards the first two acts of this film. In its place are long, painful scenes of dialogue (we'll also get to that later). When we are given action scenes in the first two acts, they are poorly done ripoffs of other movies, that focus on Mark Wahlberg and the other human characters. The action in this is unimaginative, poorly edited, and simply anticlimactic. This is not what gets advertised, this is not what sells tickets, but this is what Bay subjects us to for the majority of this film.This film is inexcusably terrible in nearly every technical facet. The editing throughout is atrocious, with quick, sloppy cuts in nearly every scene. Even the CGI is laughable at points. The aspect ratios switch, not just from scene to scene, but during scenes. There is no reason for such a high budget film in 2017 to be this lazily executed.There are a lot of poor aspects about this film, but they all pale in comparison to the dialogue. These actors are constantly spewing failed attempts at humor. Seemingly every other line is a swing and a miss, making these scenes truly painful. Even legendary actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this dialogue. The script is written so poorly that it brings Hopkins down to it's level, making the scenes in which he is present infuriating. Many big budget blockbusters are poorly written, but still end up being entertaining. Just a few weeks ago a prime example of this was released: The Mummy. The difference here is duration. The Mummy narrowly avoided overstaying it's welcome with a run time a little over 1 hour and 45 minutes. Clocking in at a cruel 2 hours and 30 minutes, The Last Knight steals precious time out of your life. There are so many better ways to spend your two and a half hours. Life is too short. Go spend some time with your family. Read a book. Exercise. Anything but going to see this movie.The sad part is, none of this is anything new. Almost every major flaw (and there are too many to name) can be said about any of the other Transformers movies. The one thing that sets this one apart however, is the lack of payoff. At least the other films in this franchise had the decency to include spectacular actions scenes throughout. The Last Knight instead opts to fill this film with overly complex exposition and long stretches of dialogue. Please stop making these films.",Transformers - The Last Knight

For what it was, it was entertaining.What is it about the odd numbered ones in this franchise that are my favorite?The first Transformers movie was OK. The Third one was my favorite (Which is not saying much). This fifth and last one is up there with the third one.Like the original movie, The Last Knight is an ensemble cast that revolves around the main character. It's not the best ensemble cast I've seen. Josh Duhamel, who had been in the series longer than Wahlberg felt like a strange insert done for pure nostalgia, but if you are into the Franchise or Transformers in general the ensemble cast gives you that fandom.Overall, I enjoyed the film. Not one of my favorite franchises but I did like this one. It's like watching a live action cartoon, but that's all the Transformers movies isn't it? Thought this one seems to be the best cartoon out of them all.",Transformers - The Last Knight
357,daddyxj-1,Done,2,12 August 2017,"OK, that did it, I'm Done with watching Transformers movies at the theater. I will just wait until the next movies are on video or ready to stream. I am a huge Transformers fan and I know the mythology well but this movie takes the mythology and flips it upside down and backward. As a movie on its own, it is a hot mess of bad writing, editing, and pacing. BUT Michael does know how to shoot a ""scene"" but they are strung together incoherently.So What I Liked were the music and the effects. That's pretty much it. Steve Jablonsky's score was over 100 times better than this movie deserves. I really like how he brought back some of the original themes but made them the sound of desperation. The confusing climax had this mellow desperate theme (you hear in the trailer) that in a better movie would have worked very well but it does nothing for you because whats on screen is in the way. The two tracks that are worth noting are ""Sacrifice"" and ""We Have To Go"". Just listen to those tracks and if you have a filmmaking state of mind you can imagine a better movie with those tones. Also, the special effects were well done compared to AGE OF EXTINCTION's hammy job. I know it's all CGI that we have seen before but the imagery that was composed is awesome to look at especially the climax with the parts of the planet hanging down and ""scraping"" earth.Now What I Didn't Like (Got Time? then read on) #1 the editing. This is by far, to me, the worst edited movie in history. Like I said Michael Bay films the scenes very well (like the opening battle) but when they are put together you have no idea what the hell is going on. And then the noticeable aspect ratio. So nobody in the editing room noticed that different shots had black bars at the top and bottom disappearing then reappearing. This happens because some shots were shot in IMAX. I do defend Michael Bay because I do think he is a better director than this (The Rock, Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) but he really dropped the ball on this film. He knows how to shoot a sequence but that's all it has going for it. If you watch a couple of shots on YouTube before seeing the movie you would be like ""wow that looks like a good movie"" NO it's just a good shot and sequence. And supposedly they had a writers room come up with a plot by using Transformers mythos, HUH? Well, a lot of things irked me. Without giving away any spoilers I'm gonna name the mythos they got wrong (if you are a Transformers fan then you'll know what Im talking about)...Nemesis Prime, Bumblebee's Abilities, Hot Rod, Megatron/Galvatron, The Quintassons, Cybertron, Barricade???,The Ark, and a very important evil transformer that I will not give away the name because it is a spoiler but once you find out what his alternate mode is your gonna flip and wanna walk out of the theater.I am so glad that Michael Bay is going to step down as director of this series because obviously, he does not care about the problems these films have. I say hire an up a coming director who gives a damn about making a good movie and not in it for the cash grab. But as for now, I am done spending my money in hopes of a great movie experience.

If you're looking for character depth, amazing acting and a brilliant story-line...first you'll have to go back to the 50s for movies. The vast majority of good acting has long since been eaten (Spoiler? like the cruiser) by CGI, graphics, lack-luster editing, etc... Even the Academy Awards struggle to find worthy recipients, imo. This movie had all the things I watch such a movie for, cars and trucks, robots, machines, military machines, cool weapons, and this one even more with battle-axe wielding robots. All for some good ole bashing, fighting, CRASH, BAM and KABLOEE with the bass turned up nice and loud! I didn't enter the theater expecting ""Last of the Mohicans"" (one of my all time favs) so I got what I wanted...and a little more. I've never been a fan of all the sarcastic, ""hip"" robots they put in the films, ruined the second one for me with those stupid robots. But I loved Extinction...loved the dinobots!

You would expect somethings about story, music, cinematography, acting, action in user reviews, but this movie fails so bad that it does not even deserve such details in the review. There is absolutely NOTHING in the movie. There is a 10 minute long scene in which autobots speak to each other cracking jokes. You wont laugh at any one of those. You just wanna get out of the screen. I literally closed my eyes during another scene but the big background music was so annoying that I again thought of leaving. There is basic film making that is missing in this movie. The protagonist Optimus Prime enters the movie towards the end. Also an actress enters the movie at half time. Mark Walberg and the superweak story (no story) cannot sustain at all. You can easily point that the scenes that have been stretched way beyond limits or added just to consume run time. The movies tries to crack over 100 jokes (literally), and I laughed at just one.This is Bay's failure. He has just made a movie for the franchise to earn money.

362,thejasvi,"Honestly not that bad, fun lazy afternoon movie",6,2 July 2018,"I'm not a huge transformers fan, but I don't dislike the series either, they have there moments, and the first was a genuinely fun comedy more than anything. I did however give up on the series midway during Age of Extinction, there was a point where it felt like everyone except for the brilliant technicians just gave up. It just became really silly. Cut to today where I wanted to turn my brain off and watch something pretty to look at, and having seemingly run out of films to see, and noticing a 4K version of the film was available on demand, and decided to just see what happened. Maybe because I had such low expectations, but I went away satisfied. The film started real lazy, you could almost sense Michael Bay sleeping in his director's chair, as the rest of the team just took care of things. It did get better about a good half hour in though. My biggest complaint is scenes don't transition well, and the constantly changing aspect ratio, I get why Nolan does it, but I have never liked it, in fact I hate it. The reasoning is so that the viewer gets the full resolution, nothing is compromised, but to me so much is compromised, it is jarring and just reminds you that you are watching something technical and man made, rather than allowing the viewer to truly escape. Nolan's films dont' have the brisk editing pace of Bay's films however, so it's not as jarring, and usually the ratio will change for a whole scene, rather than keep cutting back and forth, but in Transformers, it feels like 5 different formats are used within one quick scene or montage, it's really too much. I'd much rather have just seen the film on TV, where they would have been one consistent ratio and sacrifice the picture quality.Besides this, the film was fun, Laura Haddock had a good rapport with Wahlberg, helping the 2nd half of the film keep some momentum. And it's the 2nd half I personally enjoyed the most, the story kicks in, and it's just fun, big and loud, and not overly silly or ridiculous. I was able to throw myself in for the ride and not be taken out by some idiotic dialogue or over the top illogical action scene. I was able to be a 10 year old kid again and just have fun. It's not a 1/10 film, it's not even a 3/10.

If you didn't like them, then you won't like this one. It really is more of the same. The only thing that is different with this one, is how abruptly it ends. It also feels like they wanted to do a post credit scene and decided to just slap it on before the credits actually started rolling, which robs Optimus from his speech at the end, you know the one he makes at the end of every one of these movies. Don't worry though he makes the same speech 3 other times in THIS movie alone. Again, if you liked the other ones then you will like this one. If you didn't then you wont.

366,frederikbarndorff,I was to my own surprise... disappointed (And my expectations were pretty low),1,11 July 2017,"Spoiler Free I will start with the things i likes about the movie: 1. You can really see that sir Anthony Hopkins are having a lot of fun playing hos role. 2. The return of some of the characters from the original trilogy. I liked how the return of Colonel Lennox, for an example, bring a sense of continuity to the universe. I think continuity is one of the big problems of this franchise so it was nice to see Michael Bay try to fix that.The Things i did NOT like: pretty much everything else. I will just talk about the things i disliked the most: 1. As always the screenwriter of theme movies like to introduce just about 3.500 subplots even before the 30 minutes mark. This make for a very messy start to the movie and this also makes this movie the most incomprehensible in the entire series. Just after the movie had finished i was not sure what this movie was about. 2. The annoying characters that apparently has to be in these movies. These characters are Mark Walbergs new friend at the junkyard, and the science guy speaking about physics and math. Viviane's mother and her friends. Every time these characters were on screen i rolled my eyes so hard. 3. The complete lack of both plot development and character development. This is just such an important of crafting an engaging story but it's just completely ignored by the screenwriter. To sum op my thoughts, i did not expect a great film by any means. These movies have always been movies i saw whenever i wanted to turn my brain off, but now it's enough. This was also the most boring of the Transformers movies. The finale was terrible in every way possible. I just can't imagine myself watching this mess ever again. If you really liked the previous films then you are probably going to like this one to. It just wasn't for me. 1/10 ⭐️",Transformers - The Last Knight

368,SciFighter,Great Summer Flick,10,25 June 2017,"I love the series and this was a great one to finish it with.I think Michael Bay gets way too much flack from people who have lost the ability to just go in and enjoy a movie for what it is made to do entertain. In this day and age people go in looking for plot holes or mistakes or this and that. I have one thing in mind when I see a movie by the end did it entertain me or not. I mean movies like this are fiction films, plot holes, things that cannot happen in reality is what is going to happen it is a fictional movie. So many people think they are the gods of film making and know everything and tell you how every film should be made, when they have not done a thing in regards to making a movie in their lives but think they know it all.For me I wish the Bad Prime had lasted a bit longer as I am a huge Optimus fan, I wanted to see how that might go. At the same time though he is a hero from my childhood so of course I want him to be the hero. The movie itself was great though full of action and sci-fi as it should be and we left thinking man we could go back in and see this again.If you're looking for a fun summer movie that you can sit back and enjoy, and your a fan of action and sci-fi then this is what you want to see.Great film I enjoyed it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

370,declankearns-24728,I Don't Understand🤔🤔🤔,2,20 November 2018,"Transformers 5 is the fifth installment of the Transformers live action movie franchise and I'll be honest on my opinion people that this film is Resident Evil The Final Chapter levels of terrible. Narrating the plot of this movie shouldn't be to difficult as the movie doesn't have one to begin with.The movie opens in mideval times in a battle that is clearly a rip off of Lord of the Rings and something about Merlin, the Knights and a staff of power. It cuts to the present day where Mark Wahlberg is still a wanted fugitive, Transformers have been declared illegal on Earth and Optimus Prime is missing. He is later told by Anthony Hopkins that they have only Forty-eight hours to save the world from the evil Quintessa.The characters in this movie range from half dimensional to flat out unbearable and obnoxious. Optimus Prime is a very idiotic character as he asks what happened to Cybertron and is easily manipulated by a Final Fantasy reject (Quintessa). Unicron serves as filler for ""plot"" and is revealed to be Earth which makes no sense. Because (1) it retcons the Deceptions' motivation and the events of the previous movies, (2) the human race now faces extinction and (3) in all the other Transformers media (mostly G1 and Armada) poses as a moon and utterly stupid beyond belief.Many people say that the special effects in these movies look good but that's not the case anymore. The CGI effects look terribly bad and the explosions are very over the top for no reason. Let us not forget the fact that the scene transitions are obnoxious and the aspect ratio constantly switches from fullscreen to 4:3. Michael Bay is a complete and utter creton who tries too hard to be like Christopher Nolan but ends up on the Uwe Boll scale of directing. Even some of the worst Transformers shows (Transformers Energon, Beast Machines, Combiner Wars, Titans Return and Transformers RID) are FAR better than these movies.All-in-all, Transformers The Last Knight is a terrible movie and adaptation that thankfully gamma bombed at the box office. I advice you to just stick to the cartoons. This movie gets the final rating of 2/10.",Transformers - The Last Knight
371,kiwijinxter,"Sadly, this time the story REALLY interfered with the fantastic CGI and action...",5,5 July 2017,"*** WARNING: Spoilers ahead!!! ***OK I'll admit it. I've NEVER watched Transformers (or any movies with good CGI or action) for some amazingly gripping story in the vein of Lord of the Rings. I'm happy with a simplistic story, as long as the CGI and action is fantastic. This is why I've totally enjoyed (and defended) Transformers 1-3. Transformers 4 was starting to get a bit unwieldy but it still pretty much ""did it"" for me.Enter Transformers 5. I'm absolutely familiar with Michael Bay's style now, and yet, with Transformers 5, despite fantastic CGI and action scenes, I felt that this is the worst Transformers (and it hurts me to say this, as I'm such a huge Transformers geek - I have my full DVD set of G1, I have fanboy toys like the Transformers Masterpiece MP-10 Optimus Prime and Ultimate Bumblebee, etc.) for the following reasons:1) The story this time was so terribly broken and scattered that it actually interfered in my enjoyment of the movie. It jumped all over the place, and each scene felt like they were from different movies! Suddenly we're in the medieval age, then we're in Nazi Germany in WW2, then we're in the modern day with very little rhyme or reason.2) For the first time, I no longer felt much connection with most characters - robots or human. When Optimus Prime and Bumblebee appeared in the first Transformers movie, I always felt a connection e.g. I felt proud of Optimus Prime and I loved Bumblebee. In Transformers 5, the robots were all reduced to an afterthought... Anthony Hopkins should've added huge gravitas to the movie, but the plot was so poorly done that even Anthony couldn't do nothing to breath life into the story. The young girl was a great actress, but unfortunately was hardly used in the movie.3) I expected Unicron. I didn't get Unicron. Nuff said. Even Cybertron was such a poor lifeless, soul-less planet as it approached earth. It just felt like a planet-sized meteoroid crashing into earth.4) There's no real (or formidable) villain as such in the movie, so there was no strong opposition. Just a silly little Contessa - looked menacing but had little brains or power.It's not all doom and gloom. Cogman the sociopath robot butler to Anthony Hopkins certainly injected some character into a rather bland set of robots. And the female lead is less dumb than those from the previous 4 movies. Fantastic action and CGI, naturally.I'm not willing to rate it lower than 5 because it is Transformers, and Transformers is close to my heart. However, for me to rate a Transformers movie a 5 out of 10 speaks volumes as to how disappointed I was with how a terribly badly scripted story actually interfered with everything else. Sad, but I hope Transformers 6 (which I presume will feature Unicron) will actually redeem the series (just like Pirates of the Caribbean 5 did). Michael Bay, you should try and do just a little better - we don't need you to add more to the story, you have all the strands - you just need to tie the strands up a bit better.",Transformers - The Last Knight
372,jakob-berge,"Stunningly visuals, epic action and a ludicrous story.",10,18 October 2020,"The Last Knight (2017) is the end of the ""Bayformers"". Otherwise known as the critically annihilated movie franchise starting in 2007 with the faintly praised ""Transformers"". Few movie franchises are so split between critics and audiences. The transformers movies has earned over 4 billion dollars in terms of box office numbers. Every movie is ""rotten"" on Rotten Tomatoes, with The Last Knight going in lowest with just 15% at the tomatometer. I'm sure film historians many years from now will study Transformers as the worst blockbusters of this decade. But the many millions of fans will forever have Optimus Prime and Bumblebee in their hearts just because of this franchise.
The story focuses on Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) who gives a more grounded performance here than the last one. He is bestowed upon a talisman from a dying knight. All the while are Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen doing a more sumber and dark impression here) turning bad while meeting his creator Quintessa in Cyberton. Another major character is introduced in Viviane (Laura Haddock, who is easily the best out of the women leading role characters) who is the last descendant of Merlin. She must find Merlin's staff together with Cade and Sir Edmund Burton. The staff has ultimate power, and the villains Megatron and Quintessa is also searching for it, to restore Cybertron and therefore destroy earth.Now, this movie I actually found very entertaining. It's a big, dumb popcorn movie. I get all the dislike about it and I agree with some of it. The first act is extremely fast-paced as all the transformers movies, the editing is bad and we jump from storyline to storyline in a matter of seconds. After an exciting prologue set in medieval times (I knew I was in a Transformers movie when we was introduced to a drunken Merlin played by Stanley Tucci) we go to meet some kids stumbling in an apocalypitc Chicago and Bay seemed to open the view-point for this movie a bit, but then we never see them again. I found the history of transformers plot point to be intriguing, that they went deeper into the transformers myhtos with King Arthur, Lancelot and Merlin with Transformer knights. I am a big fan of epic fantasy tales with medieval knights so I think that's why it resonate with me. We are also introduced to some new characters in Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael) who is the obvious comic relief, just as T.J Miller was in the last movie. We also meet Izzy (Isabela Moner) who seems to be the Laura in Logan in this adventure but she also gets sidelined after the first act. The transformer dudes from the last movie is back again, Drift, Hound and Crosshairs. This movie plays like the big finale of a franchise, when we sees old characters such as robots Wheelie and Starscream, the military macho men, Lennox and Gen. Morshower, we even get a blink and you'll miss it cameo of Shia La Beouf, and of course we see Simmons again (John Turturro) cracking some jokes with Anthony Hopkins in a phone in Cuba.The movie opens up and shines in the middle act, when we travel to England and meet the eccentric aristocrat Sir Edmund Burton (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who seems to be having a ton of fun in his role. He is accompanied by the hilarous ninja-robot butler Cogman (Jim Carter). This movie is easily the funniest out of all them because of him. It's also here the movie fully delves into it's own crazyness. There are so many gonzo unrestrained scenes happening, it is much better if you just go with it and don't take it too seriously. Some examples: Burton reveals he is the last member of the order of the Witwiccans, a group containing (Tubman, Hawking, Roosevelt, Sam Witwicky to name a few) many noble historians that have kept the secret history of transformers on earth. Another crazy scene are in a chase sequence where Cogman sings Ludacris songs all the while Anthony Hopkins shows his finger to a police officer. Sure, a full on serious tone would made this movie much better but I think with the movie we had, it was better to just go all out crazy. The movie has a big reveal with Unicron being earth, and although this is a massive and exciting twist, this is merely a plot to be resolved in a later movie. The same with Quintessa surviving in the end-credits. And as we aren't getting any new Bayformer movies this was disappointing.The last act is a full on 45min epic battle. Things gets resolved too quick and the ending felt a bit rushed. And the subplot around the physicist played by Tony Hale speaking about physics instead of magic, I don't think worked well. The action scenes were grand and epic, Optimus decapitating 6 decepticons with one single stroke, Cade saves Optimus from death by the guardian knights with excalibur and the climax in the heart of Cybertron with ""We have to go"" swelling in the background. The visuals is stunningly impressive. I watched this in an IMAX theatre with 3-D, and it is hard to find a movie that does better justice to the massive scope and scale this movie offers on the big screen. I've watched this in a normal TV-screen also and I could see that people found the aspect-ratio changing constantly to be jarring. The other technical aspects is still top-notch. Filmed 98% with IMAX 3-D cameras, pure visual grandeur makes this the best looking out of all the 5. The score by Steve Jablonsky is his best and it captures the atmosphere perfectly.This movie clearly had a lot of talent and merits behind the screen, and although the movie is pretty forgettable and hated by many, I still found it to be worth watching. It captured a sense of escapism and if you want to experience a big-budget massive summer blockbuster that also is fun, this is the movie for you. Roll out!",Transformers - The Last Knight

375,Lady_Pallas_Athene,10 jobs for a cast of 50,5,23 June 2017,"These movies are a part of our family. We have been to see each in theaters when it came out as a sort of pilgrimage. We've seen the highs and lows and Bayhem and aren't that picky. Some Transformers movies were pretty good, others not so much. Last Knight is definitely the low point in the series, even worse than Revenge of the Fallen by a large margin. Every character in a movie should be there for a purpose, should have a job to do. Something to tell or an important action to perform. In Last Knight it feels like there are effectively 10 'jobs' for the characters to do and yet a cast of well over 50. What you get is that the vast majority of characters have nothing to do and are merely set dressing. Some are only in it for seconds and never seen again. There is a plot but it's lost amidst the movie's confusion over its own identity. Is it a military epic? An action romance? A Davinci Code-esque thriller? Which group of the multiple presented is the main protagonist that we should follow? Which of multiple villains is the important one? It tries to be all of the above from scene to scene. This lack of focus makes the movie disjointed and awkward. The vast majority of the movie is Cade running around from yet another anti-Transformers human taskforce. It's a very human based conflict where the robots are in the background and only serve to appear to occasionally punch things too big for humans to punch, or grab the humans out of mid-air falls.The trailer and market are incredibly deceptive as well. Optimus only has about 20 minutes of screen time (out of a 2.5 hour movie) and doesn't even appear until that last half hour. Izabella and Squeaks only have maybe five minutes screen time total, chopped up into 14-30 second appearances and single lines of dialogue peppering the movie. I would say that the movie is reasonably entertaining. There's the usual Bayhem explosions, a lot more transformation scenes, even more gratuitous military shots than normal. You can never knock Bay for special effects. But is it a 'good' movie even by Bay or Transformer standards? Not at all.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Bad story line, very depressing screenplay and most importantly terrible editing. 3. I need to emphasize on editing because it seemed like a patch work. 4.

It is the baby born from a very bad, if not stupid idea and a huge budget to waste on it.The plot is horrible and the premise on which the movie is based on is garbage (I mean, come on, when I saw medieval warfare I expected another ancient prophecy-based plot but the moment I heard King Arthur and Merlin it was difficult not to take the movie as a bad joke), but even so the movie was worth a watch. I enjoyed it even if I cringed quite a lot during the beginning. Don't expect anything from the story but be prepared to enjoy some low-rate comedy and really nice explosions with a bonus of fairly decent CGI. It's similar to a child's bedtime story to which you just add Michael Bay. Oh and...spoiler alert (not really) : this will have a part 2.Ehh - I guess I'd say give it a shot if you've got nothing better to do or watch, it's a good time if you bring a friend along to laugh it off and some popcorn to make time pass faster.",Transformers - The Last Knight

And a short turn to the dark side for one character, never for a second looked to be permanent. Another gripe I have about the film is that it's meant to be a family franchise, but I lost count of the amount of times the word 's*' was used. Yes once or twice, but every scene seemed to have it in. Maybe I'm getting a bit more sensitive about this stuff as I'm about to become a parent, but f me there was a lot of swearing! The worst thing about it though, is that as bad as it was, I'll still watch another instalment if for some stupid reason they make it.

The reason for these alien robots coming to earth is inconsistent between each Transformers movies.The chemistry between the characters is laughable and too forced. The way way they tried to match the professor, a super smart and loaded main girl with our dirt poor and jobless protagonist made me facepalm. Oh, he's a fugitive too, mind you.

No sane girl would fall for this guy the way she is.It has never made any sense too why the humans treated the autobots awfully, even though they should have known already that they definitely need their help to protect earth.

Early movies allow us to see cool transformation of humanoid robots to expensive cars / tanks / jet fighters / etc; but this movie don't have these. The transformations are hardly shown in detail. It's just Bang, Bang, Boom, Boom, Kyaaa; lots of noise and explosions with no value. Nobody died too in the midst of all that mess. Can you believe it?Don't waste your money on this movie.",Transformers - The Last Knight
392,arunk5458,The worst Transformers movie till date.....,4,6 November 2017,Well the movie is seriously pure garbage. The plot is very bad or very badly presented. There was simply no sense to how and what the characters were doing as opposed to what was or should be happening. The least I expected is a decent action but the movie fails in providing that also. The action is simply mindless maybe because they tried too much to showoff or maybe because they didn't even tried. If you can avoid seeing this movie do that but if you want to see the movie just for the sake of it well then go ahead and get ready to be disappointed.,Transformers - The Last Knight

I've given that up since the second movie. These movies have always been about explosions and big robots beating the crap out of each other, and this movie excels at it. Since this is a Michael Bay movie, it's gonna get blasted by critics (And many people) anyway. The third act's probably the best since Dark of the Moon, and the visuals are as good as you can get (Its special effect is much much better than the overrated Fast and Furious franchise). As always, the main problems are the humans, the plot, and the dialogues. But hey, like I said, I never went to the cinema watching a Transformers movie expecting any of those points to be good. Explosions and Robot fights are satisfying enough for me. We've had (Beauty and the Beast, GotG 2, Wonder Woman) and will have many other potentially good blockbusters with good story line and decent characters (War for the Planet of the Apes, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Dunkirk, Star Wars, Thor 3, etc.).

404,corey-hughes,The Fifth Instalment in a Franchise That Refuses to Die,3,25 June 2017,"Whether you love it or hate it, franchising has become a fundamental influence on Hollywood's success in film today. From the Marvel Cinematic Universe to the Fast and Furious series, movie franchises come in many shapes and sizes. Yet despite an overwhelming consensus of negative reviews from critics, the Transformers franchise is one that refuses to die down.And why should it? With Michael Bay's retail-toy adaptations being as lucrative as they are, Bay wipes the tears of negative criticism with $100 dollar bills. But with 'The Last Knight' reputedly being the final one to be directed by Bay, (fingers crossed), is there a possibility that the fifth film will defy all odds? Nope.Summarising a synopsis for 'The Last Knight' is as useful as a eunuch in a brothel. As the film begins, we are thrown back into the 'dark ages' of England, where King Arthur and the Vikings are at war. With the battle against Arthur and his men, the king seeks out the magic of Merlin (Stanley Tucci's second outing in the franchise) to tip the balance of war in his favour. 1600 years later, the fate of the human race relies entirely on the discovery of Merlin's magical staff. Blah, blah, blah; if you're really into the plot at this point, then all credit to you.This boils down to what I believe is Michael Bay's biggest flaw as a filmmaker. Barring his over reliance on slow-motioned, explosive and debris-propelling action, he is entirely incompetent at telling a coherent and engaging story. His films, especially his treasured Transformers flicks, are told exclusively through these grand, spectacular action set pieces. Narrative, for Bay, seems secondary; a grout to fill in the gaps. The action, nonetheless, does look spectacularly convincing. The use of CGI, especially for the appearance and movement of the Transformers, is unparalleled in its presentation.With the story being as convoluted as it is here, with multiple sub-plots in play, the film is desperately calling out for strong performances, but there's none to be seen here. Although new arrival Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the crude, but whimsical old Brit is amusing, it's Wahlberg's 'The Happening'-esque wooden performance that will have you shaking your head in disbelief. Yet that's the least of the film's problems. 'The Last Knight' establishes no sense of continuity from its predecessor and with the onslaught of new characters being vomited onto the screen, Bay and co. are discouraging their viewers to invest in the characters and the conflict that they find themselves in. Even the on-screen relationship between Wahlberg's Cade and Laura Haddock's highly-educated and snobby Vivian Wembley seems forced, with no eye for attention being invested in their developing attraction. It's sloppy, unconvincing, and if we didn't care about the film before, we surely don't now.In the end, this fifth outing for the Transformers franchise regrettably ticks all the boxes for a totally unforgettable Michael Bay action flick. Hot girl? Check. Unforgivable product placement? Check. Flat-lined humour with a paper-thin story? Check. Resisting the urge to pluck your eyes out from their sockets? Check.On a more light-hearted note, I've created a new drinking game for 'The Last Knight': take a shot every time Optimus Prime declares, ""I am Optimus Prime!"" That way, by the time the final credits roll, you'll be paralytic. It's by far the only way you're going to enjoy this one.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Yes, the whole main action is finished in 5 minutes after we all waited to see how it ends.

These people don't stand to gain anything from it, unlike the glory writers who're getting payed for the lies they write. Of course there's always some idiot who sees a pretty face and think it's the best movie he's ever seen.I personally liked (in declining order) all previous transformer movies except this one. I've read a dozen negative reviews and I agreed with all of them on most points. So I'm mostly going to write about things they didn't cover.(I don't know anything about Transformers other than the movies.)---------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------It's stupid to think that humans can upgrade transformers, but I was hoping to see the new transforming techniques from the 4th installment incorporated in The Last Knight, possibly ""upgrading"" all autobots. Instead we see Bumblebee auto-collect his broken of parts and rebuilding himself! Where the hell did that come from?! Or did you want us to go like ""Oh Bumblebee... Don't die... *sob.*"". Surprise? And why is Bumblebee suddenly so strong that he can face Optimus Prime in his ""best"" day and survive? Oh right, I forgot, he's indestructible now. Sure, we all love Bumblebee, but... Whatever.Don't get me wrong, I hoped for self-repairing transformers right from the 1st movie. After all, they can transform right? Think about the huge Allspark cube in T1. Even though the physics are idiotic, when you can compress a metal like that, without losing it's properties, why not self-repair? If The Borg can do it, certainly the much more advanced cybertronians can.I actually liked the part where OP gets brainwashed by a Quintesson, played by Gemma Chan, but it was totally ruined by the rest of the movie.Isabela Moner. Casting was completely unnecessary.Laura Haddock, Jerrod Carmichael. I hated arrogant stuck-up Vivian from the start, and Jimmy wasn't funny. Both were terribly miscast Imo.If they're going to make a 6th, I'm definitely going to watch it because it can only get better after this mess.I'm going to stop now because it's all been said enough, and this late review is likely not going to be read anyway. Just in case, read another 1 star review and don't spend your money on this movie.

I hope poor crew's mental health remained intact, some of the actors didn't seem to know what puzzling piece they're performing for, where to look to focus. It was madness! Expensive CGI scenes were chopped up like mowed grass, it was Quantum of Solace all over again. Photography either wanted to capture everything -or- zoomed in so close to suffocate, either way there's no room to breathe. Add camera panning on steroids and you could never enjoy a moment even if it was done so well. It was so upsetting. Continuity was nowhere to be seen but that was a puny issue at that point. This was my second Transformers movie since the first in 2007 and it felt like shock therapy to my brain. Too late to make desserts because luckily it was a $10 ticket and I could walk out without feeling too bad.Out of 10, I've given it 4 for the effort, plus some funny moments and minus 6 for the disappointment, for wasting my time and for giving me a big bloody headache.",Transformers - The Last Knight

THE BAD THINGS ARE:
1. The runtime is exhausting and tiring. I get it. They want to tell the whole story but why do they make the movies so long?!. I'm not talking about awesomely great long movies like LOTR.
2. The plotline entirely just AWFUL AND CONFUSING AT THE SAME TIME. They brought here 4 or 5 stories and you really don't get what the movies is all about and there's that girl who lost her parents and there's that awesomely hot professor which is somehow connected to Merlin the DRUNK wizard (yeah they made Merlin drunk) and then Optimus becomes evil, yeah not working. At all.
3. The acting is just annoying. Mark Whalberg here is in his most annoying performance and Whalberg is a really awesome actor.
4. The screenplay writing is something u can really see as purely awful here.
5. The editing is confusing.
The GOOD THINGS ARE JUST: 
1. The action sequences.
2. The visual effects.
3. The music.
4. The cinematography.

412,serov_oleg,Transdumbers.,1,30 June 2017,"If a work made human from the ape, ""transformers"" Michael Bay work exactly the opposite. You can check yourself by staging a marathon viewing of all parts at once. After the first film, you slightly will increase eyebrows. After the second will have a desire to run on all fours and comb out the cat. The third will reward you with a flaming red backside, and after the fourth you will find yourself hanging on the chandelier. Moreover, in the loop, although for monkeys, suicide is not typical.There is a fifth stage. Secret. To do this right after a marathon, you need to buy a ticket to ""the Last knight"" and somehow limped to the cinema. Advance say goodbye to relatives, because you will not return from the cinema. You Wake up on straw at the zoo, when inmates macaque will try to shove you in her mouth the banana. Well, or worse.Laura Haddock in ""the Last knight"" looks like a Megan Fox with an IQ greater than 70. So if a terrible Director as he is painted? Do not forget: the main scourge of all ""Transformers"" script. Eren Kruger, who would have to drive a dirty sponge right after ""Revenge of the fallen"" continued the paper to smear feces until the ""age of extinction"". Is it any wonder that time after time turned out trash? Probably not worth it. The paradox is that with the departure of Kruger, the situation has worsened tenfold. Not deteriorated, and it has worsened. Feel the difference? I wonder: what and how much they smoked and snorted to write the scene where Megatron comes to negotiations with lawyers, in order to get their accomplices out of jail? The rest of the writers are obviously afraid to break the formula of ""success"", and therefore stupidly copied the idea of ""Dark side of the moon"" falling on the Earth Cybertron and junk villain that duplicate the functions of Megatron. And the audience is drowned by the secondary and gave all his money, and even add a mandatory artifact, analogous to the ""Spark"" from the first film, the ""Matrix of leadership"" from the second ""Grain"" of the fourth. How fresh, how original! Shot to hell.The motivation of characters is really dumb, often with a fatal outcome. However, in the ""Last knight"" they are better than the fourth. Take, for example, the beautiful, aristocrat and Professor of the University of Oxford Vivien Wembley, which actually all is well. Except that Madame is clearly yearned for the staff of Merlin. When she is given the opportunity to engage in a risky venture for a couple with a muscular man, she does not doubt for a single minute. Sure...The hero of sir Anthony Hopkins is frighteningly stupid, even stupid agent Simmons guessed to take refuge in Cuba. It must be a lifetime to explore the secret history of the transformers, but to refuse to participate in the final opening, for safety reasons. And then to come to the showdown of giant robots and take a stroll in the center of the dough with a bored tourist. Not like the scenario is a miscalculation. It is planned, but empty dramatic reception.At least the empty was notorious transition of Optimus Prime to the dark side. The story-line with the brainwashing and sudden revaluation of values is a cheap lure, buy that only the Optimus Prime — the moron put him out. That there sir Burton said about senile dementia of the transformers? Humorous component is much better since ""Age of extinction"", and the jokes sometimes work spontaneously: ""Only Merlin could use magic staff. Merlin and little girls"". No, the humor has not become less flat, but he served mostly in dialogues, which is good. The brightest of all the annealed robot Butler Kogman — magically weird creature, being the fruit of forbidden love C-3PO from ""Star wars"" and Bender from ""Futurama"". The scene when the mechanical sociopath plays the organ very epic accompaniment to the monologue of sir Burton (well, Bey is not alien to irony!), truly good. About the beating salmon feet and say nothing — it's so wild that even well. It is a pity that the screen time of Kagman not as much as I would like.""The last knight"" is not the stupid movie. It is degenerative. At the end of his tyrannical rule Bay was not the biggest problem, because he is simply not able to sniff so much coke to digest deadly conspiracy scenario game with dragons and Nazis and put her in even more monstrous form.Oddly enough, the fifth part is still better than the fourth: there are better characters, a more collapsible (though fiercely chopped in the editing) narrative, and the humour is better. On the other hand, action was noticeably poorer, and for ""Transformers"" is critical. The picture is still deep and large, but the effect of the doomsday as it is not felt. But ""Last knight"" in short, ""Age of extinction"" on as many as fifteen minutes! And it is the most generous gift that Bay could make the audience goodbye.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Whatever creativity Michael Bay seemed to have has been gone for years, perhaps even decades now.Besides Peter Cullen and Frank Welker's performances, the only redeeming factor is that this movie was not that big of a hit at the box office (just over 600 million instead of the usual 1 billion plus). This means that people have finally smartened up and realized that Bay and his crew will NEVER make a decent, let alone good or great Transformers film. Even the first one isn't much of a bragging right.Al I can say now is just Reboot it already. Give it to a director and writer(s) that has talent, skill and most importantly: THE CARE! The care to make a faithful adaptation. The only three true prerequisites are Optimus Prime being pure red and blue and not flame covered and still voiced by Peter Cullen and Frank Welker as Megatron.The sky is the limit, the lore is surprisingly rich and full of detail. Someone like Joss Whedon is an obvious choice, as is James Cameron and Taika Waititi after showing his competent directing skills in Thor: Ragnarok is a strong contender.REBOOT TRANSFORMERS!!!",Transformers - The Last Knight
416,wolfybiscuts,As a huge Transformers fan I was hugely disappointed.,4,23 June 2017,"OK I make it a tradition to see all transformers movie on the first day as I am a huge fan. I have generally liked all the transformers movies so far. That is until Transformers the Last Knight has come along. I genuinely hated more things in this movie than I liked in this movie. Lets start by saying the movie was 90 percent about human characters and 10 percent about transformers. With all the available Transformers lore, it was disappointing to see it wasted with slow mo shots after slow mo shots of action that we have all seen before and a rehash of bringing cybertron to earth yet again. The Last Knight also may as well be called the Romance of Cade Yager and a hot English chick, seriously the plot focused more on that than any sort of coherent plot about the Quntessons, Decepticons or Cybertron. It was just very boring. There is no subplots involving any of the transformers at all which removes any characterisation they may have. Fans asked for Grimlock to be in this movie more since Age of Extinction, well he is completely ignored and is only in 2 parts that you already have seen in trailers and clips. He does not even transform. BOOOOO Megatron is also back and recruits a whole new bunch of decepticons, however they are literally terminated in a very fast battle with autobots in a small town. So much for any characterisation that made the cartoon so interesting. It was just such a big disappointment. The only part I liked was the robot butler and his relationship with Anthony Hopkins character, which had some potential , but was wrecked partly with some uneven pacing. The Action also got boring as there are no memorable fights between transformers they end way too quick. IE Prime vs the Predacon combiners and, Bumblee bee vs barricade Same shaky camera as always etc etc. Although I will say that Hot Rods slow motion cannon was pretty cool. I really think it's time for Michael Bay to leave this franchise and give it to someone else.",Transformers - The Last Knight
417,hristogbalabanov,Meh....,6,25 June 2017,"A 5.5 because I am generous.A very much a Michael Bay movie, it is a passable summer action film.Personally, the only time I felt involved in the movie was when Anthony Hopkins's character was on screen and it was not as much as him been a good actor(which he definitely is) as much as his been the only interesting character (him and his sidekick bot). I am not saying all others are bad actor, more along the lines of their characters been dull in comparison.The plot holes are many and glaring. Just as an example, when Mark Wahlberg's character finally 'unlocks' his powers, we seem them in that one scenes in which he unlocks them, and they are no casual power at that, him becoming powerful enough to stop a direct swing from an autobot. However, after that moment, he is back to his old, weak self with no explanation as of why he cannot use that power again.All in all, it is an OK movie if you go in expecting nothing, but a CGI and fireworks fest.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I am really sorry about Antony Hopkins but probably he was given a bag of money to act in this crap and say those lame jokes.

420,GrantTDawson,An absolute train wreck.,4,25 June 2017,"""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is directed by Michael Bay and is the fifth film in the ""Transformers"" franchise. So before I jump in I should give a little background on what I think about the ""Transformers"" films in general. I think that the four that came before ""The Last Knight"" are great assuming that you know what you're walking into. You won't get an incredible story, you won't get engaging characters, but you will get some robots fighting each other and lots of explosions. So with that in mind, I went into this film expecting the same. I did see that the reviews were not going well before going in, but I also figured it'd still be rather enjoyable. I was wrong. ""The Last Knight"" is the worst movie of the year. The usual ""Transformers"" movie issues are there, but somehow they didn't even get the stuff that made the others enjoyable right. I was extremely disappointed.PlotOh yes, the plot! One of the most important parts of a film! Well, lemme tell you, the plot in ""The Last Knight"" is not interesting, at all. The first 45-minutes of this film felt like an eternity, and it felt like the story I was being told was made up by a middle-schooler and loosely connected during an English class. It's that bad. And yeah, I am aware that I just said that ""Transformers"" movies usually do not have a great story but I still enjoy them. Well, this story is much, much worse than any of the other ""Transformers"" movies. It doesn't flow well, it is not gripping in the slightest, and the conclusion, while the most entertaining part of the movie, fell flat for me. I feel like the biggest problem with this movie is that there is way, way, way too much time given to the humans. You thought that there was too much screen time given to the humans in the other movies? Well, this one it feels like the entire story is about the humans and the Transformers are just there as side characters. I go to a ""Transformers"" movie to see Transformers, not humans talking about Transformers. In the end, the lackluster plot of ""The Last Knight"", even by ""Transformers"" standards, is one of the biggest reasons why this movie is not worth the price of admission.ScriptBesides the plot being rather bad, the script is outright terrible. They hit you with joke, after joke, after joke, and maybe two of them land. Yep, two out of the entire movie. Not only are the jokes bad, but a lot of the dialogue is poorly written. There is nothing truly insightful said. In fact, I feel like too much is said in this film. Characters continue talking when there really is no need for anymore dialogue. Again, the scripts for the past ""Transformers"" films weren't all that great, either, and they had plenty of cringe-worthy moments themselves. But this film takes the cringe to another level. You definitely need to turn your brain off for this one.CharactersI can't fault ""The Last Knight"" for shallow, boring human characters, because that's one of the main trademarks of the series. There's always the main human hero (Cade), an attractive female (Vivian), and plenty of smart people (such as Sir Edmund) and government peeps. You're not meant to get attached to them. You're meant to get attached to the Transformers, which again brings up the issue of the Transformers not getting enough screen time, but I digress.This brings me to the Transformers. Surprisingly, most of them are not that interesting, either. Some of them actually got pretty annoying as the movie went on. Bumblebee is the stand out (shocker), and if anything this got me more excited for the standalone film he's getting.Overall, both the Transformers characters and the human characters disappoint. Another swing and miss for the crew that put this film together.Potential AudienceIf you're not a huge ""Transformers"" fan, do not see this movie in theaters. Save your money and go see ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Baby Driver"", or any other movie coming out this summer. If you are a pretty big ""Transformers fan"", though, then go get your ass to the movie theater. I'm sure you'll enjoy it despite how bad it is.As far as maturity goes, I'd say anyone above the age of 10 could see this movie.ConclusionIn the end, ""The Last Knight"" is the worst ""Transformer""s film yet and one of the worst films of the year. The story is bad, there's not enough screen time given to the Transformers, there's not enough action, and it has a very mediocre ending.",Transformers - The Last Knight

424,josepx,Transformers went down the wrong road.,2,24 September 2018,"What happened over here? This movie would make you fall asleep in the middle of the movie already. For 2 hours and 29 minutes, The only action that gets average at best is in the end with both the Nemesis Prime and Bumblebee fight. That was pretty much the only entertainment in the movie. Other than that, The action was either overcliche or just boring. The beginning of the movie was even confusing and just a bad build up to the movie. Some of the scenes in the beginning of the movie didn't even connect to the plot. So by that point I was just already getting bored. Especially since the humans were getting way more attention in the movie than the transformers themselves. So why even call the movie Transformers if the humans are trying to steal the spotlight? The only time Transformers get action is in the end. Speaking about the end, The battle with Nemisis Prime and Bumblebee would have been more entertaining if the battle wasn't short. It's sad to that this transformers movie have a 2 hour borefest only then to lead to lead to a average battle in the end. So the only good scenes were the ones in the end. The rest of the movie is what I call an unnecessary borefest.",Transformers - The Last Knight
425,megamatt-80194,"If I could rate it zero, I would.",1,23 May 2020,"How this film isn't being considered one of the worst ever made is beyond me. After having the extreme displeasure of viewing it, I sat back and contemplated just how much a person must fail as a filmmaker to mess up seemingly every part about making a film. It's a rare thing these days. To find a film where by the end of it, the only positive you can find is that it had one or two cool shots.I was stunned to realize upon watching the film, that the frame ratio changes almost every other shot, from IMAX to Standard. Not only does the frame ratio change, but the quality of the image changes, with IMAX being a cleaner image, and Standard being about as appealing as a cockroach in your bed once we've already been shown the IMAX quality.Not only does the constant change in quality and frame affect the enjoyment and understanding of the film, but the characters are so incredibly poorly written and acted, that it adds a distinct and potent level of cringe to the film's already almost unbearable runtime.The comedy is forced and bland, with jokes running on too long in a vain attempt to make the audience laugh. Honestly, it would have been funnier if Michael Bay had come on the screen halfway through the film, and told us just how stupid we are for giving him money. That would have been funny. But no, let's listen to acclaimed actor Sir Anthony Hopkins say, ""Dude"", and ""Bro"", twenty more times. Just astoundingly terrible.To try and explain the plot would be like trying to explain the concept of a consistent tone to the writers of this film. By the end of the film, I still had no idea what was going on. That's not the calling card of a worthwhile film.The whole film is like an assault of the senses. With the frame ratio and quality changing every five seconds, the continuity of the film being shamefully ignored, the lack of any interesting characters and then shoving us with forced exposition and ""emotional"" scenes. The tone never finds its footing, and jumps from dead serious to everyone trying to be a comedian in a second. Not to mention that the cinematography is so lazily done, that characters magically teleport to different locations because I suppose filming shots where people are leaving rooms is too boring for Michael Bay. The special effects haven't improved since the first one, and when I say that the humor will make you want to break your TV with a hammer, I mean that from the deepest depths of my soul. The humor should come with a warning. It's so cringey, that it could kill someone.But hey, if your a regular Transformers watcher, this stuff isn't new to you. Because why watch something good, with a message and a point for existing, when you could watch Optimus Prime say his own name twenty seven times, and have Mark Whalberg have a bloated and unessecary talk about ""chastity"" with Sir Anthony Hopkins. (Seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins in a Transformers film is another thing I'll put on my list for why humanity doesn't need to exist anymore).If you want robots saying horrible one liners, watch cliche backup characters and uninteresting main characters, and overall, if you would like to be given complete garbage to pay for, because Michael Bay knows you'll spend the money on it, then have a fun time with this film. There's plenty of robots hitting each other. But a part of us should be sad that filmmakers are allowed to be this knowingly lazy and horrible with millions of dollars. A film with this much money should not have failed at the simplest steps of making a film. And these companies, knowing full well how disgustingly poor these films are, are shipping out the lowest quality of ""entertainment"", because they know that even if they replace all the characters with cardboard cutouts, people will go watch it. It's a blatant sign of disrespect, that no one is fighting against. Sooner or later, all big blockbusters will be this horrible, because we're allowing these companies to be rewarded for their childlike actions. So, don't be surprised if the next Transformers film is filmed on a camcorder, and has no editing at all. You ask for it by paying to see the film.Please...don't watch this movie. Ever.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Age of Extinction wasn't as bad as people said it was (but it still wasn't great), it was good enough to leave me hyped for the sequel. I remember the day that the first 'last knight' trailer came out and I was at the edge of my seat; it wasn't long before it was released, i went to see it on the day of release, I came out of the cinema that day insulted and annoyed. This movie is a joke, it tries to be serious about its plot but it can't due to the awful acting and annoying characters (excluding non-human characters). The movie has no structure; everything just kind of happens but by bit with no explanation, this makes the movie twice as boring as it already was. People think a lot different to me but I personally think Shia Labeouf is miles better than Mark Wahlberg, Labeouf was slightly annoying at times but at least he had good lines and played his role as the crazy teenager sam very well, his character arc in 'dark of the moon' is great, showing an angel sam attempting to cope with normal life and displaying his characters emotions extremely well. Wahlberg on the other hand is obnoxious and boring, he's that typical dad characters we've got to know and hate over the years of cinema, he's the only lead character who always seems that he's not supposed to be there. There are some things I love about this movie, such as the stunning CGI and unique character designs (especially megatrons new design), most of the voice actors of the transformers do a great job, it was great seeing Peter Cullen and Frank Welker reprise their roles as Optimus prime and Megatron (who are still as good in role as they were in the 80's). Transformers: The last Knight is a hot pile of garbage and is a disgrace to those that loved what the first 3 transformers movies were all about, thank Primus Travis Knight rebooted the franchise with 'bumblebee' (which is a great movie and fantastic return to form).

447,vhardarson,Easily one of the best Transformer movies.,8,14 September 2017,"I have to completely disagree with almost everyone reviewing this film.First of all: When watching this movie and comparing to films like The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption or some other masterpiece of modern cinema, you will be making a BIG mistake.It's a friggin' action movie. Explosions, cars driving fast, lots of shooting, lousy one-line-meant-to-be-jokes and so on. It is in the same category as most James Bond movies, not meant to be thoroughly criticized just enjoyed.So lets have a look at the week spots: 1. The acting...could be better, but I have definitely seen worse in films rated higher. 2. The plot...OK...not bad...could have been better, especially concerning anchoring the story line and the characters. Too many holes, it sometimes looses momentum, especially in the first part...i.e. early in the film we see a major weapon that comes to play later on in the movie...and is almost invisible??? With a weapon like that, wouldn't any normal person have used it to its maximum? 3. Characters. Little Isabella is OK (but WAY TOO sexy for a 14 year old, sorry Michael Bay. This was plainly stupid of you) The rest of the characters are quite flat, Sir Anthony Hopkins does what he can...which seem to be less and less these last years (Except for Westworld where he was just brilliant)Other than that, this was definitely a film I liked. Loud action packed chaos from beginning to the end. A straight 8 from me.What I found was nice also was the attempt (quite futile, but an attempt anyway) to follow in Marvel's footsteps and try to have a little more complex story line than in most action-films (I actually feel a little sorry for many of the slow reviewers here that had a hard time to follow the story...it is very simple. lol).But like I said: it's a friggin' action movie.

I guess nowadays if any Hollywood movie is just plain fun without any social message it's bound to get thrashed. Transformers is all about CGI, big battle scenes and lots of explosions. On all counts this movie gets an A. Compared to previous transformers movies, I think it was at par with age of extinction. The humor was also nice, especially the moments between Anthony Hopkins and his automaton butler. But as someone pointed out, some characters were unnecessary. Especially, the young girl Izabella's character didn't make any sense (plus she was downright irritating). Also, this movie focused more on Bumblebee than optimus prime, which I guess is on account of his spin off film. OVer the years, bumblebee's character has evolved very well and I think that his own movie would be great fun.Overall, I'll give it a 7.

450,mrcricken8,Transformers: The Last Headache (hopefully),1,22 June 2017,"I just came back from seeing Transformers 5, and I am surprised. I am surprised that Michael Bay somehow managed to make a film significantly worse than Transformers 4:Age of Extinction. I don't even know how to begin. This is by far the worst movie I've seen all year. Honestly, years! I guess I should explain the ""plot"" of this ""movie"". I won't give away too much spoilers(just in case you actually wanna see this trash).So the movie begins in ancient times and some wizard has a staff that has great power. What power? No idea. They don't tell you in the movie. Turns out Transformers have been around since the medieval times, even though Optimus Prime said in Transformers it was their first time there, but whatever. It's just a major continuity error that affects the entire movie. So, anyways, this staff can only be wielded by descendants of this wizard (even though Transformers held it like nothing, but I'm just nitpicking). Then it cuts to present time where some kids break into a military place and Mark Wahlberg is there and he finds some old Transformer who gives him some stone or something. He tells him he's the one or something. Then this stone like turns into like a worm and wraps around his arm and now he has like powers. He has healing abilities like wolverine for some reason, who even knows why. He finds some teenage girl named Isabella and then he brings her along with him because she wants to come and Mark Wahlberg was just like, ""whatever I guess."" Then Megatron is alive and he wants the staff and the military wants the staff. How they know about the staff, I don't know, they don't explain it. Why they want it, who the heck knows. So the military decides to work with Megatron of all transformers to get this staff. Then it cuts to Optimus in space who gets turned evil by some robot princess in space who can make transformers evil and stuff. Optimus gets turned evil then it cuts to some old man played by Anthony Hopkins. He's at a museum stalking some really hot girl who he believes is the last remaining descendant of the wizard. Why? Because she's smart and was talking about the wizard, which automatically means she must have a connection. So the military and deceptions finds Mark Wahlberg and the auto bots and they want to kill them for some reason. Then the old man senses that Mark Wahlberg is in danger so he sends a Transformer butler to save Marks character and the girl Isabella. Oh my lord, this movie is so dumb. Any who, he then sends some Autobot we've never seen before to kidnap that really hot girl from the museum. Then the following scene, Marks character and the hot girl meet the old man played by Anthony Hopkins. He then proceeds to tell them 20 minutes of exposition so we, as the audience, can remember that a plot actually exists in this movie. He tells ancient stories and he tells the hot girl that she is the only one who can wield the staff from the wizard as the wizard is her ancestor. She doesn't question it and just accepts it. As for Mark Wahlberg, he's just there to help the hot girl get the staff since he apparently is the last knight which actually means absolutely nothing, even though that is part of the title. So the military is looking hard to find out where this staff is and it turns out there's (get this)a book in a public library that tells them where the staff is, so the military tracked down Mark Wahlberg and then they found him at the hot girls apartment where one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in my life takes place. Mark and the hot girl are dropping stuff everywhere, making tons of noise, and saying random stuff that sounds disgusting and some ladies think Marks character and the hot girl are doing you know what, so Mark and the hot girl leave on Bumblebee and the military chases them and Bumblebee starts shooting everywhere. In Age of Extinction, the auto bots were hiding because they were afraid the military would find them but In The Last Knight, Bumblebee is a brainless auto bot, so he starts shooting everywhere. Anywho so they go into a submarine or something to get the staff because the staff is underwater for some reason. They find it and the military shows up and there are some guardian transformers who protect the staff. Then evil Optimus Prime shows up and takes the staff even though he isn't a descendant of the wizard, but whatever. That does not matter. Then him and Bumblebee fight for literally a minute. Yeah, all the fighting you saw in the trailer. That is literally the entire fight. If you wanted to see that fight, well, um, you already saw it Then Bumblebee speaks out of his real voice and tells Optimus he's his friend. Wait what the heck. Wasn't Bumblebee's voice destroyed? Well I guess not. Then Megatron shows up and then he takes the staff and uses its power and a bunch of stuff from the sky starts coming down to earth and the Autobots have to stop him. Overall, the plot is horrible. If that isn't enough to make you wanna back off from this movie, then, trust me, there's much worse. Next is the aspect ratio. It is so bad. It goes from a normal digital camera to an I max every ten minutes. This movie has by far the worst performance Mark Wahlberg has ever given. The movie is clustered with filler garbage that could easily be removed. A lot of characters, especially Isabella, have no purpose. They could be removed from the entire movie, and it wouldn't make a difference. Honestly, even the action and cgi wasn't amazing.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The thing that I felt was really ridiculous is the need to connect to old England with always mythical figure of King Arthur and his knights and inclusion of Stanley Tucci in this humorous way wasn't really a stroke of genius from Michael Bay more like a Box Office thing same with Sir Anthony Hopkins although I love the acting of the man been rusty on some of the scenes and probably the fault of the director, honestly. In general, it's a movie I wouldn't advise to pay a nickel to go and watch.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Obviously not.Introduces characters that transform into over the top exotic cars, robots in disguise if those disguises are flashy $500K cars riding through little towns in Texas.Take a bad character, Unicron, and tell 38% of his story throughout TLK and leave it incomplete.Please let a real fan make the movies from now on!",Transformers - The Last Knight
454,kerwickjosh,A steaming pile of disgustingly potent f*cking garbage.,1,11 August 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight may just be the worst movie I've seen in the last few years. While it may not objectively be a 1/10, my utter lack of enjoyment and the pain endured during the movie warrants the lowest of the low. It's been a month or so since I've seen it, and while I don't remember everything from it, there is one thing that I cannot ever forget that highlights its incompetence. Most movies have a particular aspect ratio, and if it changes, it is usually gradual, scene to scene. The Last Knight, however, cannot even keep its aspect ratio same in the same scene. Did they use different cameras for the same scene? Clearly, no even gave enough of a sh*t to fix it in post. It's disorientating, a lot like the movie's plot, dialogue and general terribleness. Maybe the different ratios are a metaphor.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Not one single bit of this movie made sense or is remote good.
it's purely disgusting. Marky Marks acting is at an alpine low. He reeks. I'm just utterly shocked. it's like when you watch a movie you thought was good 20 years ago but you can hardly stand to watch but worse. by the end you're nauseous and sad for everyone involved

I submit Michael Bay for your consideration to overtake the title. At least, Ed Wood was not profit driven, at least he regarded his work as art, and it was passion for cinema what got him into doing those hilarious films in the 1950s. Not Michael Bay, his motivation is obviously dollar signs. There would be no other justification to his insistence on destroying our childhood memories on the transformers franchise. Or am I being unfair, and maybe he really does need the money?. If he had any consideration for the craft, he would retire immediately and definitely from filmmaking and recluse himself somewhere far from Hollywood. This film is the best example of all that's wrong with his movies: Lazy directorial style, surrounding himself with a cheap production team and working with a 2 cents worth of a script. Generic characters with no depth whatsoever, a ludicrous unintelligible plot, vomit inducing action shots and the corniest of finales.1/10 is the lowest score on IMDb, but they should allow for zero on very special cases.",Transformers - The Last Knight

But they all followed a similar premise. Establish the main characters, Transformers arrive to earth, everyone starts shooting eachother and the last half hour is spent with guns, big explosions and robot fist fights. Good prevails and Optimus does his cheesy monologue ending. Age of Extinction went with a refreshed (human) casting. The Last Knight is a direct sequel, but everyone seems fed up at this point!I'll agree with a lot of reviews here. A scene would go for about 20 seconds, then all of a sudden it jumps forward. It was like watching clips from different movies for 2 and a half hours. I found it difficult to care about the characters, Optimus Prime lacked any likability and, seriously, this could have had at least an hour its runtime cut off.The first and the third films were by far the best ones of the series. Both had a simple plot, excellent villains and the right level of humour. Yes the effects have always been great, but when you think Transformers your mind automatically goes to the SFX!

The jokes were thrown in everywhere but they were the kind of jokes your distant uncle would say to try to sound cool.Writing: Sub par. There virtually was no concrete writing in this. It was just a two and a half hour empty action film with vehicle product placement and Budweiser placement. It felt like they hired a high school writing club to write this script. The only part where they even describe the premise of the movie was one 15 minute part out of 2 and a half hours.I mean...i just can't. I'm too tired.

Robotic dinosaurs and robotic knights, really? OMG.The story is quite absent so I can not really say much about that. After 2 and a half hours of CGI-stuff exploding and spectacle, you just don't care anymore and are frankly unimpressed.With a budget of 270 million dollar you can still make rubbish. How come other small budget movies succeed (and they use CGI as well)? How come transformers have human faces? It is really frustrating to look at, especially with all the CGI, you know that they could have change this.Michael Bay is able but maybe doesn't really want to make good movies? 13 Hours was nice but this have been a crime. I wonder how much they paid Mark or sir Anthony to be in this horrifying thing they call a movie. Or maybe they didn't see it. I hope so, for their conscience.",Transformers - The Last Knight

It's one bad joke followed by a bad action scene to be followed by a bad joke to jump into a bad action scene and so on.The movie tries to set up way to many arcs and then jumps in between them way to fast. You'll actually feel dizzy from the quick changes in shaky camera angles and plot line jumps.The characters feel shallow and lack any depths.The action feels fake and doesn't add up. In one scene we see a convoy of cars being attacked by transformer. It smashes a few cars and then randomly vanishes in the next shots so the cars that didn't get destroyed could make it. In another scene a man is smashed through a window by a drone, half falling towards the ground, hanging on to the drone. We cut away for a 2 second bad joke, just to see that now suddenly they're on the roof of the building! Probably teleported there by magic! When the man then proceeds to jump from drone to drone to land on the ground I was done.Stopped watching and came here to give this the rating it deserves. 1*",Transformers - The Last Knight
469,samvannuys,This film is literally the worst thing I have ever seen.,2,21 June 2017,"With incoherence all around and godawful characters, The Last Knight makes Revenge of the Fallen seem like Casablanca.The film is overall awful, and as a fan introduced to the franchise through these films, I found myself nearly screaming at the screen as the film proceeded to rape it's original material.There are one or two funny scenes (given one is only funny because it shows how low the THREE writers have gone). The story is confusing, but able to be followed, barely.SPOILERS Dear. God. Why? This film wastes every imaginable possibility for a real story it has. The moon seen in the trailers that many (including me) thought would be the infamous Unicron. However, it's Cybertron. The planet that imploded itself 2 movies ago, neat. As we learn, Earth itself is Unicron, dun dun DUN! Except the fact that Cybertron still exists is too distracting for anything else to matter. There was a potential for an actual character arc for Lennox. As he is now on an Anti-Transformers Task Force. Except the film just has him stay the same. He spares Autobots but continues to be part of the team for some reason.Also the main antagonist is named Quintesa. A 'god' as the film calls her. Why not just work the G1 creators, into the story. And she's a pretender. What were these writers on? Bath Salts?Cogman is a head master. The film does say that. Except he doesn't even transform. He's pretty much a needless robot that could've been replaced with a human bookworm. Hot Rod is also in this film. He shares a name with his G1 self. And that's all they have in common. This Hot Rod can't even pronounce his name because he likes the French accent. And has literally NO personality, but that goes for all of Bay's Transformers.If you cared enough to notice that Megatron is no longer Galvatron, I hope you didn't expect an explanation. Because the film never explains it.Speaking of Megatron, he now has a 'crew' and now they sound like bad fan fiction characters. Some cringe worthy names include: Mohawk, who is literally Skids and Mudflap again. Berserker, who does nothing. Nitro Zeus, who has Shockwave's head for some reason. And Onslaught! Leader of the Combaticons and brilliant strategist for the Decepticons! Except he gets killed off instantly. The only potentially good character. And I kid you not, Drift says ""Can't get much deader than that."" What the hell is that writing?Not to mention, some scenes are unintentionally frightening, a new character has the body of DOTM's Topspin but Leadfoot's head. That is truly terrifying to anyone who cares enough to notice it!The second act of this film is needlessly complicated and literally made me forget I was watching a film about Transformers. Megatron has his Fusion Canon now. Yay! Except he hardly ever uses it. It is the most iconic and effective weapon in your arsenal, USE THE DAMN WEAPON!Bumblebee gets his voice back in the film, except he got it fixed in the first damn movie! Did I just misinterpret the film, or does Bay just have that bad of a memory. Oh yeah, I forgot, gimmicks!Naturally, Prime and Megs have their mandatory throw down. Megs has his canon, they both have swords. I've played Fall of Cybertron, this should be good. But then Megs gets his canon arm severed. I thought it was over. But Megs brings up how they were 'brothers', maybe it'll still be cool! But then Prime kicks him through a wall and the fight is over. That's the 3RD TIME the films have done this. Fans don't like this! Please stop doing it!Not to mention the kid and the kid appeal character make it into the third act, and actually do things that effect the plot. The kid literally says ""This might have been a bad idea."" If only the writers had said the same thing to themselves.Despite the anti-climactic fights, the third act is pretty good. Giant robots finally punch each other in the face! And then Prime gives a cliché ""We can rebuild"" narration. And tells other Autobots to come to Earth. Like he did in the first film!NO SPOILERS Overall, the film is too much, it's confusing, it's a wasted idea and none of it works. The highlights are the scenes when robots fight and there's no plot other than, ""I'm going to punch your face!"" and ""I'm going to stab you!"" Not a good sign when your film's best moments are the fights, unless it's John Wick. That film's great. Please don't waste your money on this film. I would rather break off all of my toenails with a pair of wire cutters and then cut off my hands with a hack saw than watch this dumpster fire!

I gotta admit it was as worthless as everyone says it is , BUT ...as an avid viewer since the first movie ( also the animated series ) I must point out in the Animated series Prime is revered as a leader one whose death makes even his enemy (Megatron) shout out in dismay ..such is the respect every character has for Prime . In the movies we fail to see that respect ( except among the autobots ) . This movie...for me personally was a redemption for Prime giving him the respect he deserves . From his initial glory into the mind controlled slave ..then to the fallen hero ...and towards the end a true Prime . Mark Wahlberg plays a very dedicated Cade Yeager who actually does more justice as the human accomplice than Sam Witwicky did . Trying to incorporate Sam's family name into the movie particularly did nothing (except add another 2 minutes to the screen time ) .When you look at it as a human being ,a kid who grew up with these alien robots ....These movies have all had an inner message of hope ...but for me this Movie actually portrayed that quite nicely . In life you will encounter a lot of people some stay for long periods of time ..others leave very fast ..some have a positive effect on your life and some others a negative effect .....everyone will have to fight for someone else...thats when we realise that some people are worth fighting for ..and Cade Yeager's faith in Prime is an amazing example of blind faith in the ones you care about the one's worth literally fighting for . Final review : Is it good ? not the best transformers movie made Should you watch it ? Depends on you Is it as worthless as people say it is ? NO!! The true power of faith...and the glory of Prime is shown in a manner it has not been portrayed before on screen . I like it ..even made me a bit emotional when prime was beaten down and almost killed .",Transformers - The Last Knight

Action-packed as usual, top notch visual effects, amazing performance from the human cast (especially Anthony Hopkins), an OK story/plot could've been a little better put together but nobody goes to transformers for an extremely complex narrative. Lots of transformer screen time surprisingly, a definite upgrade from the 4th movie. No more pixelated transformations like the 4th movie. The auto bots are given more personality which I personally enjoy. Brand new Decepticon characters again with interesting personalities. And an action packed boss battle at the end with a slew of exciting explosions, fights, and twists to the movie which make this film easily the second best of the franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight
473,tiny-56017,Can someone teach Michael Bay how to edit ***** Possible Spoilers *****,7,24 June 2017,"Overall, a great popcorn movie. I only have two complaints besides all of the plot holes that would take too long to go into. First, the editing in this movie was terrible. Scenes were cut too short, therefore there was a lot of scene jumping before you had a chance to digest what was just said. The pacing was way too fast. Bay apparently wanted to get a 4 hour movie into 149 minutes. Now I've always liked how Bay incorporates history and legends into the Transformers movies, but please slow it down. Maybe this is his last installment, and he had a lot to cram down our throats. Second, the whole Izabella story line was a waste of time and unnecessary. I'll let you be the judge. All I gotta say that if that was my teenage daughter that Bay tarted up for this role, he and I would have a major problem. All the junkyard scenes including the baby Dinobots should have been left on the cutting room floor. Maybe it would have helped the pacing for the remaining scenes. Now if the WWII scene with Bumble Bee was a precursor to his stand alone movie that's on the books, then I will be looking forward to that prequel spin off. Overall there were just too many scenes that could have used a little more explanation or just a few seconds added to help the rushed pacing. Not to mention the ludicrous Megatron negotiation scene that screamed Suicide Squad. Like I said earlier, one could go on and on about the plot. Again great popcorn movie, lots of action, and Bumble Bee kicked some butt. Give this movie a chance and then decide.",Transformers - The Last Knight
474,hydrofal78-19007,A pileup of noise and blabbering,1,13 May 2018,"Never expected it to be so bad.

The pictures are clearer so the spectator can figure out who is who what is what etc. though it is not a motion picture in the end rather than a long collage of montaged clips.

I think they were trying to establish plot but then they were like ""screw plot, more explosions, explosions, EXPLOSIONS!!!!!""
I'm a big transformers fan and felt insulted by this movie. At this point They didn't even care anymore. You'd think that Michael bay would listen to the criticism about transformers 4. Just like he did with transformers 2, and make some improvements for the nest instalment. But of coarse he didn't he made it worse.

Two six year old children playing with their Transformers toys would have created a more interesting and entertaining story. Michael Bay knows nothing about film directing other than the occasional slow-motion action scene and big explosions. There was quite literally nothing of value to this movie, as any gems that could have been refined and polished were left to decay in the hands of an inept film-maker and a more inept screen writing crew. Movies that were more fun and enjoyable include Cabin Boy, any of the Ernest P. Worrell movies, and the worst Sylvester Stallone film ever made. I feel really bad for Sir Anthony Hopkins, who must have chosen to be in this movie out of sheer economic necessity. If he needs money that bad, perhaps I should start a Gofundme for him. That will at least give me a modicum of satisfaction in doing something worthwhile which, alas, this movie utterly failed to provide. Quite literally, the best part of the past two hours was the stale popcorn I ate at the theater.",Transformers - The Last Knight
489,jacksonm95,It delivers what it promises,9,21 June 2017,"I have to be fair, this movie isn't good enough to justify a 10. But people need to get off their high horses and judge these movies fairly. It's a movie about robots that transform into cars based on a cartoon from the 80's that originally existed only to sell action figures. You have to take the stick out of your butt and appreciate it for what it is. This movie delivers exactly what it promises: nonstop action and fun.My biggest critique is that the middle of the movie dragged on a little bit longer than it needed to. There really is not much to complain about beyond that.It was epic, fun, visually appealing, and it tied things together well. It didn't feel as detached from the rest of the franchise as the fourth one did. Also, John Goodman as Hound was absolutely fantastic, as he was in the previous installment.Watch this movie with an open mind, don't seek to pick it apart for every little thing, and enjoy the ride.",Transformers - The Last Knight

This is the kind of movie that it takes a lot to understand the story because it's a bit rushed, in some scene you will wonder ""how *swear word*did that get here or what the f**k happened last 5 minutes""...so like I said the story is messy, but to be honest I didn't went to see transformers for the story, because let's be honest...we don't go to transformers for the story...we go for the effects, for big explosion, for robots fighting robots...this movie has plenty of colorful effects, it's marvelous...on the big screen, it looks amazing...it's one of the few 3d films that had good amount of effects and I saw clearly with the 3d glasses on. Michael Bay also incorporated good humor in the movies, which I personally quite like. So if you are the kind of person that wants to see story and criticize every aspect of it, this movie isn't for you...however, if u are the kind of human being that enjoy big explosion, a lot of action this IS for you.

496,HeavenlyKing,One of the worst Transformer movies ever,2,23 September 2017,"I gave a 2 out of 10 just because of sympathy... I could give only 1 star too if i wanted to.Pros: 1. Let's all agree that the graphics and special effects of the movie were once again amazing. And i guess that everyone loved the animations of the transformers. 2. The end was the only thing that actually made the movie a bit worth watching...Cons: There are so many wrong and weird things happening on this movie: (SPOILERS!) 1. First of all, why they put a little girl acting against transformers or let her interfere in a war zone? Once again, let me repeat myself... WHY THE FK THEY PUT SPECIFICALLY A LITTLE GIRL aka the Mexican ""bro"" in this movie? Is she the ""supergirl"" too? LMAO... This was probably one of the biggest fails of all movies together. That was just a dumb move... 2. The movie is called ""The last knight"", but it's basically (NO WONDER!) about a woman that saved the world at the end of the day by grabbing a staff that everyone wanted. It should be called ""The heroine wizard""... 3. The evil and more powerful character of all characters was, once again, a woman that was presented as ""the god"" and the creator of Optimus. How? Why it should be a woman again and why some random machines would need an alien creator? Shouldn't be a human? Or another machine? Why an alien and a woman? It makes no sense... again! 4. Once again, in another common movie of N.W.O, we can see that they demean men and they exalt women by saying how smarter and more capable they are than men. 5. Why they put an old man acting like the hero of the day by just shooting Megatron by himself with his pistol from 10m. away??? It was inevitable that he would die after that by just a punch of Megatron. lmaoAnd so much more... There were so many wrong things and gaps of the script of this movie, unfortunately.I have come to the conclusion that since the past decade, every fking time they put women in famous movies and they give them a star role, then, most of the times, these movies always fail...

500,theandrewahern,Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) Movie Review,5,28 June 2017,"'Transformers: The Last Knight' – long rumored to be director Michael Bay's final contribution to the blockbuster 'Transformers' franchise – isn't exactly the type of movie you'd want to end your franchise with. If this really is Bay's final entry in his 'Transformers' series before handing the reigns to a new director, it's a strange place to walk away at.'The Last Knight' is the fifth film in the series featuring the giant humanoid robots, and it not only builds upon plot points introduced in the fourth film – 'Age of Extinction' – but it also introduces characters and threads that suggest a sixth film will eventually arrive; that is – assuming it survives the onslaught it's currently enduring at the box office. It's odd that Bay would choose to walk away now, (a more fitting departure point would have been after the third film – 'Dark of the Moon' – as it wrapped up the first three movies). Perhaps Michael Bay is beginning to get tired of the poor critical reception of these films, and – like the ones that came before it – 'The Last Knight' unfortunately deserves it.While the first three 'Transformers' movies focused too heavily on the human characters to propel the ""story"" forward, the two most recent entries have done a better job balancing the screen time between the humans and the Transformers. Or, at the very least, the human-related plot lines have become more interesting – for the most part. The latest entry into the franchise doesn't do any better when it comes to adhering to continuity and lore set up in the previous films, and like the four before it suffers from unnecessary cartoon-humor and poor editing. Not only does the movie contain plenty of jarring jump-cuts, like the previous films before it, but 'The Last Knight' throws a new wrench into the mix – an ever-changing aspect ratio. Because the film was shot partially with IMAX cameras, the aspect ratio changes constantly throughout the movie – adding black bars to the top and bottom of the screen at random times and in the middle of scenes that didn't need it. Plenty of films shoot partially in IMAX nowadays and successfully manage the aspect ratio changes, but this isn't one of those films.As for characters, this time around there really isn't much to say about them. Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, and Glenn Morshower all reprise their roles from previous films, but none of them deviate from what they've done before or offer anything new. Even the inclusion of the great Anthony Hopkins didn't add much to the movie. The one human character who stood out to me was Merlin, played by Stanley Tucci. Tucci played a different character in the previous installment and was one of the best parts about that film, and he does a great job with what little screen time he is given here, too. The Transformer characters are, unfortunately, in the same boat as the humans. None of them stand out, including Optimus Prime – who isn't even in the movie for long, despite being heavily featured in the trailers and marketing for the film.The biggest issue with the movie, however, lies in the sheer number of things that were going on. More so than any 'Transformers' film before it, 'The Last Knight' has way too many plot elements racing adjacent to each other. Normally I'd give praise to a movie that pays attention to little details in the plot and weaves things together, but when those plot points are being bogged down by poor dialogue and terrible editing, it becomes difficult to follow exactly what's going on. I will say, however, the fight action sequences were easier to follow and worked better with the musical cues than in the previous 'Transformers' movies.While it isn't the worst entry in the series, 'Transformers: The Last Knight' isn't the best, either. That being said, it feels like it's time to reboot the property and give a new creative team the chance to work their magic in transforming these characters into versions worthy of being on the big screen.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Not that the other Transformers movies claim to be great Cinema, but at least you enjoyed the effects and a basic story structure for a couple of hours. This movie has nothing to enjoy. A horrible script, mixing Aliens/Transformers with Knights, King Arthur, Merlin, talismans and Antony Hopkins in -perhaps- the worst role of his career.

511,lodmot347,.One of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters,3,25 June 2017,"I haven't seen a Transformers movie in a pretty long time, so I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this film. But I can tell you that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. I literally fell asleep in the theater because my mind just gave up.First and foremost......... the editing...I've never seen a high-budget motion picture edited this badly before, and that's the main aspect that made it virtually unwatchable. I don't know if the same thing happens in the IMAX or 3D versions of the film, but whenever the movie cuts between different shots in a scene, you can notice some shots have a vertical letterbox while others don't. Whoever worked on the editing didn't bother to check that all the raw footage was exported in the same aspect ratio. So what you get is some shots that are in regular widescreen (16:9), other shots that have a slight vertical letterbox, and then a 3rd group of shots that have a much more apparent vertical letterbox. Seriously-- I've never seen something so ridiculous in my life. And this anomaly occurs throughout the ENTIRE 2 HOURS of the film. Visually, it's really distracting and I have to force my eyes to concentrate on what's going on in the scene. I can only hope that the filmmakers noticed this already and are now working to re-edit everything so it looks correct for the Digital/Blu-ray releases.The second problem with the editing is that the pacing is really bad. I don't know how to explain it exactly, but the best way I can describe it is, it feels like I'm watching a 2-and-a-half hour trailer for an action movie. Every scene feels extremely rushed, the camera angles change all the time, and it not only makes it hard to follow the story, but it kills the mood of some scenes where you're supposed to connect with the characters. It's really bad.Let me finish off this review with the best aspects of the film, and why I gave it a 3 instead of a 1.To begin with, the acting in this film was rather good. I personally really liked the actress that played Izabella; she did a great job and was very believable.The script/dialogue was pretty good too. There were a couple jokes in the film where I was able to laugh.The best part of the film for me was definitely the CG. Visually, the movie looks AMAZING. There is so much detail in the transformers themselves, and when they change into cars the transitions are flawless.Unfortunately due to the horrific nature of the editing, the good aspects of the film can easily go unnoticed.",Transformers - The Last Knight

One thing I will say in this film is that elements of the script are really very good. We enjoyed the 'butler' robot very much with his sarcastic remarks bringing humour to the film and tied nicely with his master's equally dry sense of humour. I really wish I could rate it higher because we were left saying 'that wasn't bad' when the credits rolled but honestly I can barely remember the storyline it was shifting so rapidly.

The ridiculously pathetic story they came up with for The fate of the furious made me believe the nightmares of sh*t movies for this year was over, and it can't get any worse than that. I kind of hoped Transformers 5 would turn out otherwise than I had predicted butoh well. Another franchise ruined within the first 28 minutes of the movie.The way it started was ridiculous! Don't get me wrong. I'm fond of the Middle Ages. I absolutely love it above all else. But the way they portrayed Merlin and his meeting with that Transformer. I mean... come on! My five-year-old son would write a better scene if I had one. The way Megatron's crew was introduced, that's when the movie completely lost me. Not Merlin's portrayal, not even Optimus' unexplained and unreasonably changed character...but the introduction scene. Someone must have seen Suicide Squad. A brief sidetrack: not the best movie to take examples from. Up until this point, I'd watched the movie with a straight face; not showing any emotions or interest whatsoever. And I'm not only talking about the plot, which is something dreadful but the motivationless characters and the fact that I couldn't care less whether they live or die. This seems to take less and less effort by each year.

528,PatheticCinephile,just the worst...of the transformers franchise,1,30 June 2017,"So if you don't know this I have watched every single transformers movie and I hated them all. But even though they have awfully shot action sequences full of repeated shots or clichéd characters and clichés and nonsensical plots the films before this one had some form of being at least watchable. Even the previous one which many claimed to be unwatchable was still in my opinion watchable even though yes it is very long. This one is the complete opposite of what the others are. This FIFTH(REALLY!!!) installment of the crappy franchise is fascinatingly bad and the strangest part is how unwatchable it is. I mean there are some things it does better than its predecessors one being that it removes stereotypes. In the previous films there were many sub-characters which were just a bunch of stereotypes and it was very insulting and it seemed the director wasn't even familiar with the term. Luckily this movie didn't have as many but it did have some rude stereotypes, so be afraid. The other thing this movie did better was that it didn't objectify women as much. But there was one scene which had the typical female objectification the other movies had with one the characters wearing a very revealing dress.Anyway now I have to get to why this movie was unwatchable. The first reason was the plot. This movie basically has no plot and has more than a million subplots making it quite hard to follow and also made it quite nonsensical. Some of the subplots were also quite pointless. It also has what you would expect in a Transformers movie which is the clichés and clichéd characters. I don't really have to say anything about that because they are always so overabundant in these movies so I am just not going to say anything about that. The other thing that irritated me was how pointless the changes of the aspect ratio were. Nolan in the dark knight franchise changes aspect ratio whenever there is a fight sequence so that you get a better view of the scene. In this case I am not really sure what the director's aim for the aspect ratio change is because it just changes at any random scene. The other problem was the camera-work. I felt sick at every shot because every single shot is so shaky and it feels like the cameraman was drunk. The final problem is how unfunny the elements of humour are so overabundant. The humour always felt tired and I don't think it was even trying to be funny.Overall this movie is overall a clichéd, awfully written and poorly executed mess of a terrible but still entertaining franchise and just like every installment in the franchise I am going to give it a 1/4. Do not watch this movie and encourage a stop to this terrible franchise please.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I grew up with the Transformers cartoon. I thought the original 2007 film was fantastic at the time and I still enjoy watching it. It has holes, sure, but it's entertaining and a well told story. The second film was hastily put together to make money and while it isn't awful it was a bad sequel. Dark of the Moon corrected some of the garbage from first sequel and in my opinion is a strong and fun film with really epic action sequences that teetered on the edge of too much but was still entertaining. The wingsuit jump is still one of the most adrenaline-filled moments on film.The Last Knight tried to weave yet another mythology into the Transformers story in such a ridiculous and convoluted way it honestly felt like a joke at times. It was as if they forgot all about the All Spark and the Matrix of Leadership so they created yet another monumental ""source of power"" to bring to the table in order for the Transformers to somehow connect with the legend of King Arthur. It fails miserably.Honestly, I had no expectations coming into this film as the trailers made it look extremely uninteresting. My assumptions were correct. They brought in new characters that seemingly had no real purpose or forced some kind of purpose onto them in such a way it was painful to watch. No knock to the actors who put in their efforts, but this was a complete and total mess of a film and really puts a bad taste in my mouth for all of the Transformers films now.",Transformers - The Last Knight

As usual, any movie benefits from having Anthony Hopkins in the cast and he did an excellent job. My only two concerns is that Optimus Prime was literally in the movie for only 5 minutes and was the bad guy for even less than that. The hype surrounding this movie was based on Optimus being the bad guy, but he didn't really do much. Also, the whole King Arthur plot didn't seem to really fit into this genre. It didn't make much sense, but it was still fine. I loved the new Autobots, but there's also no way that Megatron could've known about the sword. Overall the movie was as good as expected.

In fact, one gets the feeling that action sequences were shot at will and then added together added to that the movie was a long one and you would want to escape from the movie after 30 minutes of run time. I thought that the last Transformers outing was bad but this one beats it hands down. The best thing about the movie was the effects they are perfectly made and executed and the worst was the whole narration.

Finally, the cons: I had a great expectation for this movie.. i really did. This was supposed to be great. This movie was supposed to deliver.. argh never mind. Lets just say the movie could be Batman but instead Bruce Wayne turns into some whiny lazy good for nothing kid . All the plot holes, all the logics, all the stories left unexplained to the viewers.. ""how did it get to this?"" ""how did he do that?"" ""where did he come from?"" ""how is that even possible?""

I hoped for a good and long robot to robot fight scenes, especially optimus v megatron, but instead, all i got is some lame drama and a bunch of military guys acting like they are the hero and knows what they are doing.Anyways, i can spend hours pouring my disappointment into this review, but i have a life so..",Transformers - The Last Knight

541,alias_wavefront,Disappointing,3,17 August 2017,"Setting the film in Arthurian legend throughout its run time could have made for an interesting historical fiction sci-fi hybrid. There was a good opportunity to let Optimus & Bumblebee rest and use a new, smaller, cast focusing on Arthur, his knights, and the TF knights as they struggle to overcome a superior human army + some TF oriented threat.Instead it is an incoherent mess of a film. Wait for your local public library to get the DVD/Bluray. Spoilers below.Pros 1. Beautiful landscape shots 2. Incorporation of Arthurian legend 3. Badass 3 headed TF dragon 4. Dinobots 5. Cogman 6. Anthony Hopkins 7. Upheld franchise tradition of wantonly destroying Ospreys (including QTRs) 8. CGI, for the most part 9. Bumblebee's voice 10. Earth is Unicron 11. Less consumer product placementCons 1. Dialog - all of it, not a single memorable line in the film 2. Plot 3. 14 year old boobs (actress is 16) 4. Expletives 5. Nazis (yawn) 6. ""Vaguely racist"" white man v American Indian joke 7. Lame Decepticon introduction scene 8. Bumblebee the vicious Nazi killer 9. Optimus Prime stripped of everything that makes him great, yet again 10. Megatron is weak and useless, yet again 11. Unidentifiable throwaway Decepticons, yet again 12. Prime v Bee for 30 seconds then BFFs again 13. Lennox talks a lot, accomplishes nothing 14. Unicron is Earth 15. Douchebag NASA ""it's physics!"" guy 16. Sqeeks 17. Marky Mark 100% committed then gives up and whines like a man baby 18. Marky Mark reprimanding Grimlock and Grimlock taking that sh!t 19. Foul mouthed kids 20. Snarky sexpot with a PhD female lead (100% boobs, 0% personality) 21. Token black guy with dialog. At least he didn't die first this time. 22. Score. Was there one? Couldn't hear it if so 23. More US military product placement. F-35 & LCS = awesome. 24. Cybertron comes to Earth. Again. 25.

I don't recall actually watching any transformers films and I wish I hadn't watched this one. 
It starts of with Merlin the magician and King Arthur and medieval times, then has some Mexican chick with a Volkswagen headlight thing and then Marky mark gets all up in there.. the stupid robots are hanging around being jackasses and then the dude from silence of the lambs comes out of his castle after he kidnaps a British Megan Fox and then who knows that happens.
I stopped watching to clean the house and go on eBay and try to find Hank Hill from King Of The Hill sew on patches... I was unsuccessful in my search, if anyone does have some for sale please let me know.
King of the hill is a far better and more realistic show and much much more watchable. 
I still have about 45 mins left of this rubbish but I cannot guarantee that I will finish it. Oh and British Megan Fox is related to Merlin the Magician it turns out. 
One good thing I can say about this is that mark wahlberg has long ish hair and it seems to lol good slicked back (in one particular scene anyway) also I think John Goodman plays one of the robots.. in voice anyway. He dies.
John Goodman is a dude and is a fantastic actor, check out the big lebowski. So good.
Also the world is half destroyed because of robots but England looks sick and pristine. Why is that?

554,Toronto_CDN,Transformers: The Last Movie - PLEASE!,4,1 October 2017,"I loved these movies, so i was super excited to hear another was being released. Even after the slight disappointment of the last movie, i still wanted to see this one. I was hugely disappointed and failed for me in so many ways.#1 - It's supposed to be about the robots - not in this movie for me. It was all about Mark Wahlberg & Anthony Hopkins. I LOVE Anthony Hopkins, but Mark Wahlberg is one of my least favourite ""actors"". I wanted to see more of the Autobots & Deceptacins in battle. I felt like the last hour of the movie was the only necessary part to this sleeper of a movie. FYI, i fell asleep 3x trying to watch this movie in 2 nights.#2 - The story for me was all over the place. Nothing kept me interested or intrigued. Not much of it made sense to me with all the back & forth - no clarity until the last hour. Too many explosions and not enough depth to the plot to keep me interested or hooked. Cheesy writing and surprisingly so with the team of writers that have brought some great writing & movies to Hollywood.#4 - Horrible casting with Mark Wahlberg. His daughters character & her boyfriend were missing. He had no on screen chemistry with his co-stars. The music made this movie for me. Steve Jablonsky delivers once again with genius scores & compositions. Take that away from the movie and you are left with Mark Wahlberg and his cheesy acting.If Michael Bay's idea of a ""reboot"" with Mark Wahlberg, he failed big time! Shia LaBoeuf and cast were a fantastic ensemble with a lot of on screen chemistry with each other and fit into the plots so effortlessly as if the movie was written for them. I didn't feel that way at all with The Last Knight. I was anxiously waiting for the movie to end.

Don't get be wrong, it's a high end product with nice CGI, awesome sound effects, long list of nice super-cars and on paper good actors -but as a whole thing just falls apart, it could have worked as a music video on MTV next to Jersey Shore - it just as pointless, except Jersey is entertaining.Tried to read trough some of the other review, and it seems you either give it 1 or 10... 1 is too low, there are worst films out there... 10 is just ridiculous, even the most hardcore Transformers fans must admit there are so many better films out there..so Considering this is a X00 mil. budget film and how rubbish it is, I can't give it more than 3 stars -2 of those are for the CGI and ars alone, if nothing else you can watch that to pass time..

572,d-jerch,Transformers meet the Da Vinci Code - this movie delivers,10,4 November 2017,"There might be spoilers, I guess ...I'm reading these one star self absorbed dickhead reviews and I'm wondering: 1) what movie were they watching? 2) what movie were they expecting? There seems to be some collective ""let's hate on Michael Bay"" hysteria going on, with reviewers racing who will more artfully regurgitate the tired cliché of ""that awful"" Bay's signature approach to Transformers. It's like no one even bothered to really watch the damn movie. Ups? Mark Wahlberg kills it. Anthony Hopkins absolutely kills it. The chemistry between the main characters is awesome. Laura Haddock is fatal, I'd eat corn out of her dung just to say I had lunch with her. The story is somewhat complex, but bearable, if you can't follow that, you know shi7 about history and also your attention span is shi7. Downs? Optimus Prime's part is cringe-worthy. ""I am Optimus Prime ..."" Yeah we know, shut up. Some Autobots are Jar Jar Binks level annoying. But it's a transformers movie! Last 30 minutes are WTF, right there with running with the dinosaurs in King Kong ... in any case, completely over the top, but hey, it's a transformers movie, we've seen worse, believe me.I was expecting a drawn out meaningless epilepsy inducing 2-hour long music video, but I found myself thoroughly entertained.

575,tbonewill23,Perhaps the Best Film in the series!,10,7 February 2019,"Through world's edge filmography Michael Bay again does his over the top sharade. This movie, however, does it right. In past films there were times with no direction for such theatrics. As clearly as can be defined- this film has that missing direction. With Optimus Prime having changed sides and Cybertron itself colliding with Earth Anthony Hopkins adds a great addition to the cast among others. The additon of King Arthur's round table novelty also brings home to Transformers a sense of storytelling yet to be told in the series that combines greatly with the Transformers universe seamlessly. Unlike other films in the series this story, cast of characters and transformers, and theatrics never deviated from the overall message by distracting the audience with drawing the content thin. That message is autobots and humnity can live together. The film garners that reality with the begininning of humanity's relationship with them, and ends it with a new beginning to contiue that friendship. The movie has a balance that fits and leaves you wanting to watch it over and over again.",Transformers - The Last Knight
576,lmo-916-930971,This is rated way too low!,10,27 February 2019,"I have to say that I was a big fan of Transformers back when Shia Lebouf was the lead actor. The first two movies was about him and Megan Fox, but when both Shia and Megan were out the story kind of fell apart. I think that Transformers have really struggled to figure out what their storyline should be, but in this movie they found it. They found a core that says ""Us or them"". Humans or Transformers. I can follow and understand this path. And this makes sense.None the less, a Transformers Movie are mostly enjoy because of the magnificent sound effects and the beautiful picture. And this one also had I storyline that was followable. You can't whis for more in a Transformers movie",Transformers - The Last Knight

Putting everything together without logic, this is what the movie is. Oh, by the way, his knowledge about physics never go beyond what his parents told him in kindergarten.There are more than enough critics on plot and poorly told stories; I'm not going to repeat. But I have to point one character: the Old Man. Who cares what his name is (I didn't get it AT ALL) I don't know what kind of personality Michael Bay want to create. What I saw was a rude, uneducated, changing man with a lot of money. It was so awkward while he dump the famous names into my ears and declared that all those people tried to keep that stupid secret. I don't know what he said ""I can't go with you"" because he eventually was there, and...just died there.After 10 min, the only though I had was to see how bad the movie can be.

579,sallykendell,A somewhat entertaining flick that falls short on poor editing,5,22 June 2017,"First thing's first: the editing . . . and the cinematography. Michael Bay started out in the film industry directing music videos (Do It to Me) and commercials (Got Milk?), many of which were short, snappy and full of numerous edits and bizarre camera-work. In The Last Knight's case, these components are what suffer the most due to the film's mish-mesh structure and meandering focus, leading to some scenes lasting all of a few seconds whilst others are drawn out over ten minutes. In other words, the film feels like a Youtube video drawn out to 10 minutes for the sake of ad revenue. Speaking of Youtube, ever heard of Techrax? If so, you'll definitely know what I mean in terms of this film.When I first left the cinema, all I could think about was the atrocious editing. Entire scenes either flick by or are given so much attention as to leave other, more important, plot points out; shots flicker around, never staying in one place for long. I counted each any every frame, and only a handful (namely some shots in the climax) were longer than a few seconds. Often, you saw characters speaking over themselves - a style choice of some kind? In one scene, Sir Anthony Hopkins is leading our characters out of a building, and as he talks, the shots cut to them walking through a hall to them outside. It isn't a narration, it's him talking AS they're travelling. This happens so many times, wherein characters appear to jump across entire locations in an instant, seemingly at random. This incoherency leaves entire action scenes feeling like sloppily stitched together.The cinematography is also all over the place. I didn't hate it as much as the editing, but Bay seems to feel as though a majority of the need to be blaring sunlight into the lens, extreme low- angle (pretty unflattering) or a fast crane-shot. If done well, a shot mounted on a crane can look extremely skillful and aesthetic, but throughout action/dialogue scene, the camera sways drunkenly or shakes around to the point of becoming completely incoherent (but don't worry, the editing makes them last only two seconds long anyway). All in all, the cinematography really seems to have no real structure, no planning or methods of composition. The polo scene near the beginning resembles an advert so closely (close up of hooves, punctuated heavily with slo-motion) that it's as if we've entered another film altogether. But all in all, the climax of this film is enjoyable enough, with enough flashy effects and unique locations to keep viewers entertained. Mark Wahlberg delivers a typically Wahlberg-y performance despite seeming to copy Labeouf's shouting and screaming, and the British Robot (I forgot his name) has a great deal of personality as Hopkins's butler. Too bad there's not much Optimus Prime - at all. Overall, it's worth watching if you're really looking for something to muddle your brain until it resembles an egg in a microwave. 6/10",Transformers - The Last Knight

My 6 year old son has recently developed an obsession with Transformers based on some cartoons that are on Netflix. He heard the movie was coming out and wanted to see it. As stated earlier, WAY too much cursing.Now, with that said, the movie was very entertaining.

588,kniles-28167,Why does almost every Transformer have to be a total joke?,3,25 November 2017,"That's what I don't understand; Why make the Transformers clowns?I said in my review for the last movie; I understood that in the very first Transformers, Bumblebee was the one that had a sense of humor. That made him more relatable from the Transformers that were more serious. It made him seem a little more human. It was a working character trait.Now he has been (mostly) reduced to be a kid with behaving issues and the rest of the cast apart from Optimus and Megatron are complete on- screen jokes, stereotypes, caricatures.See a new transformer that's an old tank and think it'll probably be cool... well, he has PTSD from WW1 and has ""robot dementia"". Ha. Good one. Another really inventive stereotype and another comic relief. And it's all Jar Jar Binks level humor too. AND it's not even consistent; When bumblebee suddenly needs to be serious again, he goes from the jokester calling someone a punk-ass to some valorous knight for the convenience of one single moment.I get it; these movies appeal to kids, but I've seen Disney and Pixar animations with much better humor and way less naive storytelling.Some parts of these movies are spectacularly well made visually. Even in this one when I saw Barricade make a return and Megatron, who looked slightly more like himself this time, I felt like this might be going to a little more serious direction than the previous one... This made me excited in the beginning, but nope, in comes a misbehaving massive dinobot, some sort of .. baby-bots.. the old cast of caricatures from the last one, same humor that makes literally EVERYTHING seem like a joke and needs to be riddled all throughout the midpoint of the movie, yet the movie tries to take itself seriously with ""impending doom"" and tired ""world needs a hero"" narratives among a cast of characters that never really takes any threat seriously, up until the very last ending climax that suddenly wants us to see all characters in a different light than they were depicted earlier. The serious parts do show, that if someone were to make a more serious and WELL WRITTEN Transformers movie with this sort of production quality, it would have the potential to be absolutely incredible, but this series has strayed further and further away from anything serious let alone cohesive.In this one, it has a really hard time trying to figure out what it wants to do resulting in this constant mix of serious and immature.You know how some movies use a well timed joke to relieve tension? Well this movie seems to use badly timed jokes to prevent the buildup of any tension. There are moments that are meant to be serious, but can sometimes even pass you by when you're still thinking about something naive, like how ridiculous the gangsta behaving decepticons are that were just ""released from prison"" and have chains hanging on their necks as bling, who were introduced in this big bombastic kind of fashion where their names are literally written on the screen one by one, but they have a total screen time of probably less than a minute. Just another example of how this movie has no idea what it wants to go for and tries to go for anything and everything.So, what's the story? ""Impending doom of all that we know/enemy of my enemy is my friend/good guy goes bad/the father you miss who was always distant was actually a much bigger part of the big picture, Lara, erm Vivian/Your father left you a clue/You are the last descendant of the bloodline, you are our last hope - also you, you're also our last hope Cade, also you, you are also our last hope Optimus, featuring King Arthur and the round table, Nazis, THE CHOSEN ONE and one amulet to rule them all""... Honestly, I don't think even a parody movie could've thrown in more story clichés in the mix. None of those story lines really even ""take"" yet all of them have a beginning buildup, but just then kinda end up as this mishmash of something that reminds you of things you've seen before.(spoiler)By the time you see something ""tragic"" like Anthony Hopkins character's death on screen, you somewhat expect his corpse to grin and go ""Well this ain't quite right!"" exactly as a transformer character did prior in the movie.It is just so riddled with childish jokes you can't take the rest seriously, yet ohhh when it shows you serious stuff it wants to be taken incredibly seriously. Soldiers, patriotism, doom.... *cut to 5 minutes of autobots fighting like children and joking around*Sure, it is not all bad; some scenes are well made and I think a few of the jokes made me at least grin for being so absurdly idiotic (like ""Witwiccans""), but for every cool moment there are at least 3 that make you roll your eyes. It's absolutely all over the place. The very ending climax seems to put the constant jokes aside for just a while but this far in the movie, it was a little hard to suddenly get serious and actually care.It's definitely a bad movie but is visually very well done. Quality of these movies has been steadily declining and I'd say we've gone at least one point down from the beginning score of 8 with each new Transformers movie.. so I'd say this is about a 3/10. Even in saying that, I think I'm fairly generous.One you can watch with kids though, but it'll hurt seeing if you're an old Transformers fan.",Transformers - The Last Knight

599,Chimar99,"AuthenticReviewer - 6.5/10 - Engaging first half, the last half hour gets almost comedic and pointless",7,28 May 2018,"Short Review -
If you are a Transformers fan and don't wish to take a break from the franchise, watch it for some really engaging sequences scattered throughout the movie. If not, I don't know what to say as the movie is 2.5 hours long and you won't be coming out of the movie very satisfied either.Long Review -Cheesy seems to be the ""in"" word going around nowadays inside Hollywood houses.For a Transformers fan, I liked the first 1.5 hours. After that, the movie steadily went downhill, for me.
The movie is chock-full of action scenes, no.... it is almost bursting with action and the makers used every opportunity to fill it up with one action scene or the other.Except, this formula didn't really work out. There's wasn't a good build-up, (or maybe there was one but it was betrayed by a disappointing last half hour with pointless action and a hurried ending). The movie suddenly went from engaging.... to one with ""big action toys and loud noise"" making it a pain to watch.Note to makers: You are making things hard for your adult fans to go watch this movie. And, if you are targeting kids, please churn out another Animated series. Just don't try to appeal everyone at once.About the movie itself:
The story begins with the Dark Ages where Britain is at war. The historic scene is very well portrayed. You wonder what the heck is going on and that is when Transformers enter the story.Back to the present, and you have a lot of parallel stories running throughout the movie - one with Wahlberg, one with Hopkins, one with Optimus Prime, one with Decepticons, etc. etc.A lot is happening in the movie at once, so it is difficult to put it here in writing.Anthony Hopkins is great as usual and good performances overall by the main cast.The emotional engagement is lacking overall, even more so near the end. For this reason, the Dark Of The Moon stays one of the best movies in this franchise - a definite, engaging story line, good build up, and engaging action.Just WHY did you ever let go of that winning formula?",Transformers - The Last Knight

The CGI and Soundtrack were priceless.The action was too qiuck, althought half of the autobots, dinobots and decepticons could've had more scenes. Bee vs. Nemesis was the best scene in the movie, but too short, the fight ending was like Batman vs. Superman style.
The decepticons were shown as an ultimate Suicide Squad.I give this movie an average rating, CGI is better than previous 4 movies and is an improvement.

We may have sat through the previous disasters of this franchise so when we watch this movie, we know better to expect Oscar award winning performances, a decent plot or anything sensible for that matter. If you've had a long day and want to just chill out without having to use your stressed-out brain, then watch this film. You won't have to put a single thought into what is happening. The writers sure didn't. If you want to have the gang over and have a movie that can run in the background while you all chit-chat and occasionally glance at the screen and the movie will still make as much sense as whether you were watching itnwith your full attention, this is your pick. While you watch this, your expression will be exactly the same as Mark Wahlberg's. He constantly has that, ""I don't know why I signed up for this, I have no idea what I'm doing here"" expression. You may wobder why Anthony Hopkins is in this movie. I still don't know, neither does he. In short, you know what to expect. Do NOT try to comprehend what is happening on screen. Your IQ will go down. If you are a person who has never done drugs but wants to know what it feels like to do drugs without actually doing drugs, watch this movie.

After the previous two I hoped for a change in direction or something to return to the relative success of the first one. Sadly not!! This is the worst one yet! Rehashed nonsense plot and even reused lines and near identical optimus prime summary at end.
Michael Bay had earned a good name for himself with some great action movies, but now I think I will avoid his stuff forevermore. I mean seriously, did he run out of ideas a decade ago, did he read the script before embarking on this project or did he get alzheimers or something.
Wors editting ever, action scenes are confused and vague. Most of the acting is terrible, I feel for Anthony Hopkins a little as his lines and scenes were lame, he seemed to at least give it a go, but this was one to take a pass on.

Like WHAT?? CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN THIS TO ME IM SUPER CONFUSED!!, moving on, The only positive things I could say about this film is the VFX, obviously The Transformers movies have good VFX i mean who said that Transformers has the worst VFX and CGI? Another Problem about this movie is Optimus Prime, obviously he's the main character and he gets 99% of screen time in the movies, this film he has less screen time and the human characters do? What? I'm actually glad Michael Bay is no longer directing these movies anymore, I'm not saying he's the worst director, but still, if he still did, he would've made the movies even worst....",Transformers - The Last Knight

It's unfortunate, despite the very low quality of the past 4 of 5 films, they all made gigantic profits world wide and allowing MB to come back and making same lame films over and over. No doubt he's got talent,but his taste just doesn't live up to the expectation that was set with the very first release. TF needs to be darker, emphasize more robots and less human. It needs to be rebooted with totally different direction by someone else. I am tire of seeing those little bitty annoying autobots with lames jokes they make. Started with a such great foundation and theme with unlimited potential, but heading nothing but south since the first release.",Transformers - The Last Knight
609,kymmee,Waste of a Sunday afternoon,1,23 October 2017,"I rarely am motivated to write reviews- only when they are really good, or really bad. My husband wanted to see this, so we rented it. I did not expect to love it, but I thought I could sit with him and pay marginal attention at least. I was wrong. I very much enjoy special effects. I love high action. But when the movie is composed entirely of exploding, machine blowing up, fire, bombs, guns, and screaming/yelling of all dialogue, I quickly become shell shocked and need to get away. I ended up retreating as far as possible to get away from the NOISE, that is this movie. It was literally giving me a headache. As for plot? I cannot combine in any way in my head, that makes sense, Lancelot, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table, with Transformer robots. The plot(?loosely used) jumped around so much it made no sense, and felt like random bit pieces tossed in to try to add some story to the explosions. The acting was so underdone I didn't even care about actors I normally like, like Anthony Hopkins. Mark Wahlburg has never been an outstanding actor in my opinion; in this, he seems to try even less. Of course, there is not much to work with. I suppose the audience is more geared to teenage boys wanting to simply see action and special effects.

There was far too much going on. This movie is X-Men Apocalypse bad. It's like Michael Bay was doing four different movies that have nothing to do with each other and tried to make it into one really bad movie. If you're a 6 year old that likes fireworks than this movie is for you. I own 500+ movies and I hated this one. I would rather watch Octonauts on repeat than this movie.

I am a keen Transformers fans. I loved the first movie, the second was slightly rubbish and the third made up for it. Then for some reason we had this change of direction. They got rid of the humour and replaced it with boring and mundane. The fourth film was awful and I felt then that I would not give this movie a chance, however I did, in the hope that they had learnt from their mistakes. How wrong could I have been?
The film is a mess. 
I am getting fed up of CGI films. Batman vs. Superman was ruined by the over use of CGI and so have other films recently. 
I like to watch films that have a sense of realism to them and that could be believable. 
Some may now say - ""well transformers aren't real"". But what I am after is, if they were real, then what would it be like?
Looking back at the first movie. It was so simple. It had charm, it had humour (something Whalberg cannot pull off). They didn't need to go massive and pull Cybertron from its space in...well space. The original was believable. 
I'm not going to go through the whole movie and analyse the mess. But please... if the Transformers saga is rebooted in the future, please just make it small or simple. Earth is now practically destroyed and theres no going back. What a waste of my time watching this film.",Transformers - The Last Knight
628,tristensmith,highly under rated,7,16 July 2017,"Thought it was definitely one of the better movies of the series. Had a great cast as well. Enjoyed a lot of the new characters of this film. I was almost dreading going to see this after reading reviews and seeing the ratings it received, but i'm glad I decided to go and see it anyway.I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I was thinking beforehand the series was starting to get old and thought they should probably just put an end to it. But after seeing this I wouldn't mind seeing a couple more. I think you pretty much need to be a fan of the cartoon series to fully appreciate these films and maybe that's where the reviewers and raters for this film went wrong. I hope there are more out there that appreciate this film and write good reviews of it like I have or at least get the word out that it was no where near as bad as there saying.",Transformers - The Last Knight
629,matthew3079,Painful to watch,1,14 May 2018,"Got bored last night and decided to watch this film on Now TV, completely regret it. The film is actually painful to watch. This can be attributed to a few things: the story that is so bad it reminds me of one I wrote at the age of 10, the constantly shifting aspect ratio of the film (something that actually gave me nausea) and the great injustice given to what were some of my favourite characters from the show. One again this film falls fowl of Bay's rapid cut editing, something seen in fight scenes in most films, that he seems to like to use on shots of empty rooms, it also doesn't help that in order to make the film more action packed and jerky he used his usual technique of removing frames every so often, which almost entirely defeats the purpose of the high resolution and playback ratio.
Overall this film managed to give me not only a headache but actually managed to make me feel ill and is a great injustice to the original characters be they Transormers or even Arthurian legend.",Transformers - The Last Knight

It has a confusing, pointless plot with heaps of holes, shocking acting, and unlikable characters. However, I didn't watch this movie with the intention of being a critic; I watched this movie one afternoon when I felt like watching a crappy action movie with robots, explosions, and the occasional fart joke. And in that sense, the movie nails it. I had no idea what was going on the whole way through but I'd be damned if I didn't love every minute of it. Mark Wahlberg's acting is disappointingly terrible and that's awesome, and the editing is absolute chaos. It was perfect.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I rarely write any reviews for films but after watching this film I have to write one. I LOVED IT. i mean its like being a football fan or being in love with someone yes you still have to support and love them through their good and bad times. i got late to the movie when i got in it was already started so i might have missed a few minutes but from what i watched the film did have a few flaws. the studio should not have made changes to the writers the previous writers were awesome. there is a lot of unnecessary scene which ruins the film. SPOILERS: the kids scene at the stadium, i think this should have been completely removed it was unrelated. through the whole film the writer tried to fit in stories that made the linear timeline change. other than that i loved the film and i cant wait for it to come out on DVD Optimus Prime looked AAAAMAAAZING, he looked soo cool will all the changes made to him Spoilers.

I swear the first few movies had a better making and sense to the story behind it then it got sloppy so that takes away my enjoyment of a transformer movie. There was no explaination of how Megatron was not Galvatron anymore or if he was resurrected from his original being then where is Galvatron because how can a transformer become more advanced then never use that ability again? I agree with many other reviews that the story seemed to jump around and I swear I thought the staff was needed to control the dragon yet Quintesa had the staff and still the dragon was free to do what it wanted...and wasn't cybertron destroyed? How hard is it to follow through one movie into the next and slow down to make sure it make sense. Graphics looked phenomenal though at least but some more explaining is needed. If this even goes into a Beast Wars real life movie series in the future then I hope they keep to the story like the show does cause that makes sense!",Transformers - The Last Knight

It felt like the movie wanted too much. I liked the story but it took to long for it to actually happen or ""appear"". But when the story really got started it was intriguing, I personally felt like I wanted more sort of. I think the movie deserves a higher rating than what it currently has, it was good and I actually enjoyed it and as I said it was an intriguing story.

Not every movie is a Marvel Studios movie So if you like action movies you'll like this one, it has its funny moments as well. :)I hope this review was okay and helped!",Transformers - The Last Knight

It is really embarrassing for such a large scenario, great designs and drawings to hate vomiting. Quintessa's stages are enough to give me 10 points.

The Last Knight isn't very convinced to the critics, they complained the story,too many bombs and I have to admit that the plot does exist some loopholes. You might find that sometimes it really doesn't make sense in some of the parts. But it really doesn't affect the fluency of the film. The actors'performance is great, especially Anthony Hopkins.He helps to push the development of the story and his performance was tremendous good. I love the interaction between Cade and Vivian.The robot butler(sorry i cant remember his name) also created many funny and hilarious scenes for the audience. Everyone was enjoyed the film when I watched in the cinema last night. The fight scenes in the movie are very great and epic. Especially how Bumblebee clashed on Optimus Prime and Bumblebee's debut was also very amazing。 I believe people come to watch Transformers movie all because they just want to see how the autobots and decepticons fight to each other.To fulfill audience's expectation, you have to put more bombings , buildings collapse in the movie and obviously Michael Bay is the perfect choice for this kind of ordinary commercial popcorn movie.

This movie has a lot of good qualities, yet it does have flaws. The movie starts with 4 kids going into a locked down zone to see a dead transformer. This beginning where the kids meet Izabella, a new main character, and this first 20 minutes is amazing. It reminds you of a movie like Stand By Me or the Goonies and it is really enjoyable. I hope it is the style of the 80s set Bumblebee prequel that is definitely happening. The effects are beautiful, for the first time in all 5 of the Transformers movies, it is easy to tell who is who during the fight sequences. The models are so defined. The new characters in Sir Edmund Burton, Izabella, and Vivienne Wembley are great additions to the franchise and it will not be good to see Mark Wahlberg leave these movies.

I've seen recently some bad blockbuster movies, like Guardian of the Galaxy vol.2, but each one had a distinct style, maybe a poor plot but a plot at least. In this movie there isn't a real plot, logic doesn't exist. It's funny this movie gainsays totally what we've seen on Transformers for a decade. The problem is this ret-con is illogical and no-sense. Besides, there are too much characters (both humans and robots) managed badly. I think Michael Bay and the Production are completely disinterested in representing well or in the right way the Transformers!

The characters don't even get 30 seconds to introduce themselves, have dinner, or tell a joke that isn't rushed or too fast.

I would of preferred the film just to of been in beginning era as that section for me was the most interesting part and the part when Hopkins is speaking in the castle his lines were just terrible they had a tank which shot once and never appeared again like who the hell is that guy and how the hell does Sam Witwicky have to do with this film and the secret order pointless cameo. Overall my view is just don't bother worst transformers film and destroys some of the lore and so many plot holes.

I hope Michael Bay brings a better movie next time.,Transformers - The Last Knight
652,jambo-47594,Fantastic Summer Blockbuster,8,30 June 2017,"I can't believe the hatred this film is getting, I have loved all the TF films and this one is no exception. It is full of action, outstanding effects and great acting. The film contains plenty of G1 references and tons of TF lore, even setting up a major BIG character in future films. I had the pleasure to watch the film in IMAX 3D and have to say it is some of the best 3D I have seen. This film is non stop from start to finish with more robot screen time and development. I bet if Bay made a TF film with every single robot character ever conceived in their original modes and colours, people would still find fault! I never thought I would ever see a live action Transformer film and thanks to Michael Bay and the whole team behind these great films, I have and have enjoyed all of them. Bravo Mr. Bay you have done wonders for this franchise and I only hope you reconsider and stay on for future films. I have not awarded the film a full 10 stars as I would have loved to seen the transition from Galvatron to Megatron, more of the dinobots and the new decepticon characters last a little longer, although Nitro Zeus was very good. Bring on TF 6.",Transformers - The Last Knight

656,abhishekbinddas,Do not listen the haters and critic...IF you LOVE TRANSFORMERS,10,4 July 2017,I don't get it what the hell is wrong with everybody...it was such as awesome movie. From part 1 to 5 I have never seen any good ratings for TRANSFORMERS series.. (except past 4 for which I do agree that it was not that awesome but it was good thought) but If we talk about this current part. This is the most awesome of all. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen for even a sec. It consist of awesome story awesome acting and freaking awesome CGI If u are the true transformer fan and love all the movies I can guarantee that YOU WON'T GET DISAPPOINTED Nd don't miss this great movies just because of critic. Just go and watch you will thank me later...,Transformers - The Last Knight
657,cnik-83945,"Poor Bay, poor scenes, poor storytelling, <3 Transformers tho",6,30 June 2017,"To be honest, as a fan of Transformers and everything there is about them, this movie made me feel kinda in the middle of how good/bad the movie is. Bay failed this time, storytelling was just really bad. A lot of information that are just pieces, like if he gave us 30-40% of puzzles for a whole picture. There is no explanation of what is what, there is just BAM this BAM that. Because I wont write anything from the movie, I will try to say it this way. Like watching Tom & Jerry but cutouts from one episode. First you see Jerry, then Tom, Tom starts with his plan that is unknown to you and all of a sudden Jerry is caught, but no here comes Jerrys nephew and with just one flick of his arms kicks Tom out in the sky. Poor scenes? In like 40% of scenes where people were involved I felt the weird feeling like if it's not normal for humans to move like that, and kinda funny. Action scenes in first movie are better than in this one, even tho first one had cables and stuff to make cars move and sometimes not synchronized with the robots movement.It's typical Michael Bay in terms of Optimus Prime, like in every single one of the previous 4 movies. MEGATRON just comes in, like if he was resurrected, you can get how or what made him come to back to life just if you really pay attention to details, it is cool tho, but not ""told"" in movie for watchers. Good stuff? Well I am glad there is so much story in it, i was able to follow it throughout the whole movie and to stay in it. Happy i got to see all those big shots. And movie is solid 7, or a bit more, but bad stuff is what gets it down to 6 or more like 6.5. I didn't get the ""WOW!!!"" feeling of awesomely awesomeness. :/ Anyhow, if you liked it more than I did hit a rating that you think this movie deserves, or lower if you didn't liked it. Movie is enjoyable and i will take a second look, kinda have this feeling it will amaze me more after 2nd take.Worth watching, don't listen to these who say it sucks that bad.",Transformers - The Last Knight
658,gfcate,FABULOUS!!!,10,24 January 2018,This movie was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and felt like I was living in the movie because the characters seemed so genuine and the plot was richly developed. A must see!,Transformers - The Last Knight
659,dimetrodont,Great but not amazing,8,27 June 2017,"This movie was a great experience with old characters from the original movie like Josh Duhamel and that agent Simmons guy. It had the 4th movie's cast and new and old characters and gave us back barricade which was a Bad-@#$ and megatron. Optimus was in this and all the screen time he had were almost always great to see. This movie of course did have the hot female super model character but she had little to no sexy scene's which is great because think of the babies. One of the best parts of the movie was a scene when they showed title cards for the decepticons and the one of the last one's showed a character berserker who was like Hannibal lecter from silence of the lambs. Speaking of Anthony Hopkins is in this movie with a great performance and one of the best quotes ever. Don't touch that,That watch killed Hitler. At the end we see unicron which gives us a hint that the next movie will feature him.And that's my review",Transformers - The Last Knight
660,rcb-48150,Total waste of time,1,30 June 2018,Disjointed storyline; unnecessary cussing that seems to try and make it current but actually makes it seem so scripted. Such a disappointment. Walhberg has the pinkest lips I think Ive ever seen in this movie. Really bizarre.,Transformers - The Last Knight
661,spincus-02487,An Abysmal and Soulless Mess,3,22 June 2017,"As a child, I loved Transformers, and while I'm thankful my childhood has been brought to the big screen I'm disgusted by the way it's been executed. After the travesty that was Age of Extinction, I kept my expectations low for this film. But even that wasn't enough - I never thought this film could be worse than its predecessor, but nevertheless, it was. I'll explain a lot of the things that are wrong with the film. The Last Knight tries exploring the Transformers' mythology, but in doing so it creates an absolutely incoherent story. The editing is terrible - jumpcuts and continuity errors are all over. The cinematography, while amazing much of the time, is constantly ruined by shaky-cam which I found more prevalent than ever. And most of all, the movie loves jumping the shark. The film boasts a giant Autobot cast. Hot Rod is perhaps the only notable new Autobot. Sqweeks is pointless. Cogman started off as a likable character, but as the film went on he was loud and annoying. The Mini-Dinobots, Canopy, Bulldog (the WW1 tank) and Daytrader are introduced yet barely appear and serve no purpose. And why isn't Daytrader named Wreck-Gar? Wheelie returns for no reason. Topspin returns and hides out in Cuba with Simmons. In proving no one cares about the character, for whatever reason he now has Leadfoot's head instead of his own, and is credited as ""Volleybot"". Grimlock returns and has some cool scenes, but he disappears for the rest of the film because the screenwriters didn't want him in the final battle. Some new Decepticons are introduced - they even have names and voice actors! This would be awesome if they didn't have reused designs, dumb names like Mohawk and Dreadbot, and they weren't all killed off within five minutes. Everything said by Mohawk and Nitro is loud and offensive. Onslaught, a fan-favorite character, is a remodel of Long Haul who says one line and gets killed after five minutes. The movie takes after Suicide Squad in introducing its villains, and as you can imagine, it's done terribly. Excited to see Barricade? Don't be. He serves no purpose. At least he fights Bumblebee, right? Nope, he gets shot and tumbles down a street. He hardly appears and is last seen at Stonehenge - then he disappears. TF1 all over again. Megatron looks and sounds awesome. He has some cool lines and there's some awesome shots of him. But in the film's messy story, he quickly becomes lost. The story is nonsensical. Merlin is given this all-powerful staff, which can be used to resurrect Cybertron - but why was it given to him when he never uses it? What was the giant underwater machine? It contains Merlin's tomb and the Cybertronian Knights. Is it used to rebuild Cybertron? What was the purpose of Stonehenge? It appears for three minutes and that's it. The film's vast variety of plot points barely tie together. Cade is the last knight. What a let-down, The movie is titled Transformers, and the focus of its subtitle is a human - NOT a Transformer. Also, him wielding the Excalibur feels hilariously out of place.Lennox returns, but we don't know why he's against Transformers, having worked with the Autobots in the first three films. Because of this, his shady character never works with the story, especially when the TRF joins forces with the Autobots. Terrible humor and pointless humans are abundant. For the second time in the series Simmons says the word ""scrotum"". Viviane's family is obnoxious and unfunny. Bumblebee says ""sting like a bee"" after vanquishing Quintessa - very painful to hear. Why was there a wounded Cybertronian Knight in Chicago? I know he has to give Cade the talisman, but why isn't he in the underwater machine like the other knights? Quintessa sends evil Optimus to get the staff on Earth. Why didn't she have Lockdown do this in the fourth film instead of him going after Optimus? Evil Optimus (or Nemesis Prime) is a rushed and wasted concept. Immediately after arriving on Cybertron he is turned evil. He next appears on Earth, fighting Bumblebee, only to be redeemed after Bee speaks for once. Evil Prime appears for less than ten minutes. Optimus has red on his face - and so does Megatron. Why? Prime gets it because Quintessa corrupts him. Does she corrupt Megatron? But why would she? He already wants to destroy Earth/rebuild Cybertron. Earth is Unicron? The world-ending villain? Interesting. This is why Cybertron/Primus attacking Earth. But if Quintessa is evil and she wants to kill Unicron, does that make her a protagonist? It's confusing and never truly explained. The final battle is very underwhelming, which says a lot. The soldiers and Autobots start off the fight by shooting - at what? Infernocons? Bad editing/filming makes this inconclusive. Optimus leaves before the final battle to confront Quintessa - he's never shown doing this and randomly returns riding Dragonstorm (for five seconds). The Megatron final battle is underwhelming and he's defeated swiftly. No Autobots die in the final battle, which makes it feel weightless. There were some nice references to the other films. The pictures in Burton's castle, The Ark on the Moon, and Starscream's head. Love that scene where Megatron picks it up. I also love how Steve Jablonsky reprised ""No Sacrifice, No Victory"" to conclude the film - something he didn't do with TF3 or TF4. Nevertheless, these small details do little to save the film as a whole. The new writers created a terrible story, thank God this is Bay's last film in the series. It's obvious he can never succeed with it. Many thanks to my friends for seeing this abomination with me. May this series find its way, or come to an end.",Transformers - The Last Knight
662,Tetroy64,So Bad its Good,2,11 July 2017,This movie should be advertised as a comedy. Going into this movie I knew it was going to be awful but it even blew that low bar I had for it and was even worse. The special effects are amazing and Mark Wahlberg are the only reasons to continue watching the movie. It was way to long and at about the halfway point I just wanted the movie to end.There were many scenes in the movie that were supposed to be serious scenes but they were so poorly done that it made them extremely laughable.This is a movie that is so bad that it is good just for all the wrong reasons!,Transformers - The Last Knight
663,hdn-41511,A waste of time if you watch this movie,2,25 June 2017,"The last Transformers (age of extinction) is OK comparing with this movie. I gave ""the last knight"" score 2 just because of Industry Light & Magic. They made beautiful scenes. Ho ever, this movie is just a piece of trash: 1) Where is the story? Some movies have simple stories to tell. For example, Denver Wonder Woman and The Mummy's stories are simple but at least have some logic. What about this Transformers? They kept switching scenes without any indicators. Audiences have hard time to follow. AND, the story is discrete at all. 2) didn't find humans in the movie of any use. Human beings usually played important roles in making the movie move. In the movie, their roles could be all deleted. The actress only shows off her body without any actions. Mark and she said some stupid but not funny jokes. The old man told stories to the main actor and actress but he came to the fight at the end. He used a gun in his walking stick to shoot and caused damages. What?! The marine didn't cause any damage in many scenes with their guns but the gun in walking stick could? 3) a really long movie with too many ads. I might drink bud light even though they didn't put ads in the movie since they appeared in daily life frequently. I would never use the Kugou music and the used-car website even though it costs them so much to put ads in. Some apps/websites are deeply rooted in daily life. So if new apps want to take over, they need to improve themselves to attract customers. In conclusion, watching this movie is a waste of time and money. I'm sorry that my payment of tickets contributed to the income of the piece of trash. Would never do this again!",Transformers - The Last Knight

There was a sequence every like, 30 minutes, and they went back to using the army. I got bored of the army in the movies a while ago.

The only thing i didn't like was the way the story was going there were like multiple stories at once and at first i didn't really get the plot but afterwards i got it.And it's bad in a movie to make the plot seem understandable after like an hour.Talking about hours THE MOVIE WAS WAY TO LONG they could've made it a little shorter by eliminating scenes that were there for no reason. So after all this i would suggest you going to the cinema if you enjoy the franchise in general but buckle up because you'll have to stay in that seat for 2 and a half hours.,Transformers - The Last Knight

675,raonedead,No story-line and many plot holes.,2,6 July 2017,"*contains spoilers* *Heavy spoilers ahead!* * The movie was full of plot holes!! In the first movie, Optimus says that Cybertronians learnt the language of humans from 'world wide web.' Then tell me, how did the Guardian Knights Transformers, in the 5th century, learn the language of the humans? Don't tell me Merlin taught them. And, why are the transformers getting less screen time than the humans? There is literally only 1 dialogue between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Also, Isabela Moner was really irritating. That little idiot just goes unarmed to fight Megatron? Really? A 30 feet Autobot doesn't dare to fight that killing machine and that 4'11 girl tries to fight him? And also screams ""You think I am scared of you?""....... Cgi no doubt was fantastic but story line was really bad. They say that Earth is Unicorn. Wow. Amazing! Anyone who has watched the 1986 show knows that Unicorn is the same size as his twin, Primus/Cybertron. Then how the **** is Unicron Earth? Also, if he is indeed earth, then how did he transform into Earth?! Didn't know they could transform into Organic matter.... Decepticons are once again killed like they're ants. Oh, and Prime becomes the good guy after hearing Bee's voice, which first came back at the end of the first movie and then disappeared again, only to come back again out of no where in this movie. I mean wow. This was more absurd than ""My mum's name is Martha too! We should become best pal!.""Only gave it an extra star because of the cgi. Rest acting and story is BS.

It is soooo bad, that I took the time to register an account on IMDb to warn YOU the viewers to never ever touch this movie . I was never a fan of the transformers franchise and Michael bay. He even managed to ruin my beloved teenage mutant ninja turtles , yet I was intrigued by how far he would go to direct another 50 hour long movie after the disastrous age of extinction . I don't even know where to start , let's see an incoherent plot line that mixes knights of the round , GI joe , Blackhawk down and predators all in one. Way too many useless characters from both the robots and the humans. After 3movies all of a sudden the so called maker, aka God aka creator, decides to appear and tell Optimus to fetch a talisman .Which can save the robots home planet , it can turn into a sword and can be yielded by humans . The staff and the talisman are the driving plot of this entire movie , so you're telling me for thousands of years the robots couldn't figure out the importance of these items , and worse are having difficulties getting it from the humans .

680,juehokim,Why Transformers 5 is a pile of garbage,1,11 November 2017,"I'm going to tell you why transformers 5 is a pile of poop. This is just my personal opinion so no hates.The very first problem is the plot. The place and time is always changing and the scenes didn't really have a connection. The scene is vhangimg from restricted area,junkyard,cybertron,under the sea,Europe,and on and on. In my opinion,the junkyard wasn't really needed. It was only there to show the dinosaurs. Amyways these unneeded scenes make it more difficult to know what the plot is. Its like watching 10movies at once.Also, the characters don't make sense. The new characters don't have an origin story. For example,the baby dinosaurs, barricade, hopkins, new decepticons,and way more. They don't have an origin story so they can't just come out of nowhere. Also, some of these characters like Izabella and hot rod aren't really needed in this movie. Throughout this movie, I'm like why is she in this movie?Last,this movie is just a big 2hour advertisement. I hate advertisements because I'm not here to watch a advertisement. I'm here to watch a movie. Literally every 20minutes there is a advertisement of a specific drink. Michael Bay probably got all of his money through these advertisements. This is why I think transformers 5 is a pile of poop. So don't waste your time on this pile of poop because you're better off staring at the wall for 2hours and 30minutes.",Transformers - The Last Knight
681,therealmoftf,Michael Bay is now trying to singlehandedly kill the Transformers franchise,2,3 April 2018,"There is only one way to summarize this movie: Michael Bay has gotten tired of the Transformers brand. And it shows. Badly.This movie is simply completely nonsensical. It has so many plotlines going on at once that it is basically impossible to keep track of them all. The characters are horrible, one-sided and boring, with no motivation or personality driving them. The fighting and CGI is so intense it doesn't even feel epic (like the other movies), it just makes you feel dizzy. The tropes that has defined the franchise are even more apparent in this movie than before (everything seems lost but then suddenly something happens and now the autobots are winning again, the classic ""I am Optimus Prime"" speech where Optimus stands beside the main character with Linkin' Park music blaring in the background talking about how great the human race is).Not to mention the jarring cuts between scenes, with some scenes only lasting 15-20 seconds before suddenly being cut and jumping to the next 15-20 second scene. After about an hour I legit felt the urge to throw up as the cuts were simply so bizzare and confusing that it made me feel nauseated.It really says something about the movie when the funniest quote from it was ""Get out of the way you fat f*ck""",Transformers - The Last Knight

No need to bash plot and editing, as that is a very dead horse....but it's truly hard to follow and leaves one feeling like they just tried to discuss politics with a basement dwelling millennial.....angry, befuddled that they could be so stupid, and worried for the future. Wish I had the 2.5 hours back. Having grown up watching the original cartoons I am supremely disappointed. I have seen some terrible movies in my 43 years, but this one takes the prize.

First of all, every scene is not at all related to its previous scene. Seems like they had hundreds of different short films and they just joined them together. There is no continuation of the plot. Too many things going on without a clue. Who is going where or who is hunting whom you will have no idea.
Second, they tried the old ""cliche/corny"" humor in almost every scene but it just didnt cut. I mean they were so bad and the timings were so off w.r.t. to the scene.
Third, the dialogues didnt at all make sense. All of a sudden ""you are family"". I mean WTF !!! .... I think they had a ""Random Word Generator"" for the dialogues for any given scene.

The major issue however at the end of the day and why I gave this movie a 4/10 comes down to the fact that all the characters in this movie were inexplicably forced together, nothing happened holistically.

That being said I am not some blathering idiot, action-movie junky who will just watch a movie b/c sh^t is getting blown up! And that is all that this movie is...a series of scenes of sh^t getting blown up with ZERO plot, story, character development or drama. And here is my frustration...I would have avoided this movie but for Walhberg and Hopkins. Here's my thinking...if you are these guys you have enough $/balls/street cred to only take on movies that you think will be good...you can pass on the dogs and there is no way that this script (when read by any semi-literate human) could have come across as anything but a dog. It made no sense, had no plot and GOD the dialog! I am so tired of these movies casting the ""black guy"" as some idiot who's sole reason for existence is comic relief (I mean I get why they do it, but the attempts at humor are so bad that they border on gibberish). Maybe we are this stupid as a movie-going population...or maybe (more likely) all the quality writing/acting/production/direction has moved to TV (sure seems like it) but I , for one, wish I had not jumped on this train as early as I did!",Transformers - The Last Knight
701,bertkyle,So Much Fun,10,30 June 2017,"This movie is outstanding. You know how when you are a kid you and your brother throw over the toy bin and pull out dinosaurs, knights, tanks, submarines, Lamborghinis, Transformers, GI Joe, Voltron, some LEGO vehicles that can be disassembled and reassembled and a few Star Wars space ships? Maybe your sister wants to play so somehow a Barbie ends up in the mix. Then you have an absolutely epic battle with Knights fighting space ships and LEGOs transforming on the spot to whatever you want. Toys switch back and forth and fight for whoever is holding them. Complete insanity ensues. The story makes no sense because it can't but the battle is truly epic. Your brother grabs a chair and declares its his planet and throws it at your toys so you throw the couch at his. Finally your mom comes in and sends everyone outside, so you leave every toy out and all the furniture turned over to clean up later. Maybe your sister declares that Barbie just did something. That is this movie! It has absolutely everything and makes about as much sense as it can considering. This movie truly channeled second grade for me. I had so much fun and I cannot wait to go back! Definitely watch in 3D and try to watch in IMAX if it is available. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD.",Transformers - The Last Knight
702,Zanetron,The best Transformers movie since the first,6,27 June 2017,"Transformers TLK is a Micheal Bay movie. What were you expecting. If you saw the first four movies you could pretty much sniff this one out. Beautiful scenery, epic sets, lots of explosions, car chases and transforming robots. The latter being the most important. Spoilers, I guess Micheal Bay has FINALLY gotten rid of all the time-wasting human shenanigans. I don't care about Sam's sex/college life, I want to see his house explode and then transform and kick someones tail- pipe. That's what we get in TLK. (Sams house is not in this movie. In fact neither is Sam, save a framed ebay profile pic from the first movie.)Megatron and his Decepticons get some seriously needed screen time and personality. In fact they get so much screen time and personality you actually LIKE them. We even get a ""Decepticons, retreat!"" from Megs himself. The first 40 minutes of TLK feels like an extended episode of Transformers: Prime. TLK is easily the best one since the first. If you like Transformers and the Bayverse you'll enjoy this movie.",Transformers - The Last Knight
703,steveschillin,Sucked Hard - Ruining the Transformers Legacy,1,21 June 2017,"Michael Bay should have retired from Transformers after making Part 1. His understanding of the cartoon is weak and can be seen clearly by the horrible plots and ideas for Transformers he has come up with. Getting a big name actor like Mark Wahlburg was a desperate attempt to save his dying series in the last movie. I fell asleep for 20 minutes as the movie lulled me into a chaotic sadness. I love the original Transformers cartoon and toy line, to see the utter disgrace these movies do to the brand really makes me sad. I suspected this movie would fall in line with the rest as horrible, sadly I was right.Time for Micheal Bay to give up this dying horse and let a good writer/directer have a chance to bring back the ""real Transformers"" Horrible plot....All of the ""Ghetto Bots"" were in it again with dumb humor in every sequence. Also Optimus Prime has to announce ""I'm Optimus Prime"" like 4 times in the movie...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!, Like we don't know who he is, and like the autobots and the decepticons don't know who he is....and his lame speech to humanity at the end of the movie made me throw up a little in my mouth.

Feels like there are many movies going on in there at once and I honestly gave up watching. I did try for whole 2 hours at that point even my fandom could not keep me going. 
The franchise should go to a different director and different plot writer if they want to save this.",Transformers - The Last Knight
705,tschile,Good idea but bad execution,5,12 August 2017,"I grew up watching the cartoons, so the fantastic thing about this and the other movies is seeing the real-live Transformers. I enjoy that the movie had new characters, I'm very happy another Transformer from the cartoons appeared and the foreshadowing of the next movie. The things Bay gets criticised for happen here too, but less than in the other movies, so that's a plus.What destroyed this movie for me was the ""humour"". It looks like they thought - what joke or one-liner could we add to make the scenes funny and in the end they just added all. Good for some 10-year-olds, but for me it was too much. Sometimes I was smiling, sometimes I was just thinking ""Why am I watching this?"" There's a butler character I liked the first minute he was there, but then he made too many dumb jokes and it was just annoying.Another negative thing is the editing. I usually don't notice those things but here it was too obvious. As if they squeezed some scenes in just because they had them. Also, for me there was no real climax, no character-development. A lot of things happen but somehow nothing seemed worked out. I have to think hard to remember how the story went. I think the movie could have been good if it had been better edited and probably cut shorter. If it weren't about transformers I would have given for the story a 3 out of 10.So, if you liked the other movies and don't get annoyed by some Adam Sandler-Grown ups type of humour this movie will be entertaining for you.If you were hoping for a good story with good characters - just don't.I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't see it again.",Transformers - The Last Knight

There were loud hoots in the large IMAX cinema whenever Bumblebee or Optimus Prime came on screen. Whenever, the dialogue 'I am optimus prime' was heard, the audience excitement reached crescendo.

Now i hate myself for being so judgmental. This is a really good movie. The CGI effects and cinematography is top notch. The story has been developed really well, only the build-up of story of Vivian could have been better. The movie is a tad bit long for an action movie. I really liked how all different stories came together in the end and gave a sense of satisfaction by completing the picture. Michael Bay has done a fabulous job as a director. I got a feeling of suicide squad when a montage of Decepticons that were negotiated by the TRF and Megatron was shown.I had a surge in emotion towards the end when Optimus took responsibility of his actions, accepted his misdeeds and rose above all the hate to save everyone's home.This movie does appeal to the HERO inside everyone of us, those who do not feel so might never had a chance that challenged their mettle.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The plot is just a mess, lots of things thrown at the audience pointlessly. No purpose, no sense at all. The autobots are just too boring in this film.

Seems like the director just wanted to showcase the extent of CGI effects possible. No plot, no story-line. Bits and pieces crammed together.Some of the plot lines are picked up from the animated series of Transformers which I had really enjoyed watching. But that was portrayed over 3 seasons and multiple episodes and here we watch it in one movie without any background or any build up. So many plot holes and so much bad acting (remember the bots are anyway CGI).Overall a very disappointing movie.

They are people who are looking into the plot and trying to bring all the events in the movie to reality. Transformers need to be seen as a fan of transformers. Or an amateur who perceives all the fiction and gets an impression, just enjoying the film. I have been reviewing all the G1 and The Movie before, I have read all theories of creation. I also know a little and read about the legend of King Arthur. And I understood everything that the 13 screenwriters who wrote that movie wanted to convey to the viewer. It's just fantastic and great impression! Definitely worth it to go to the cinema itself, because this film was not made for TV or laptop screens. About the plot of human relations - here too everything was quite good, in comparison with the previous 4 parts. And in general, very dynamically came out with the transformers. This movie is GREAT!

The kids totally killed the movie, it´s almost unwatchable and I thought about stop watching the movie everytime the kid showed up. It´s not so much her acting as the scenes themself, they are plain awful to watch.The changing AR adds nothing, it´s just super annoying.

And when I say irrational, I don't mean, oh they are giant alien robots. No, it makes no sense in it's own world. You can see that there was no time spent on the script. Motivation behind what the people and robots are doing is at most times non existent besides the point of moving the story further. And to be honest you can see that in a lot of new movies. Then the ""science"" in the movie. How the f do they except us to buy all that crap about the planets colliding. Oh well the staff is no longer sucking the Earth dead, so now everything is cool, let Optimus hold a speech. NO NO NO. The Earth would change massively if something of the size if Cybertron was to basically bump into us. Not to mention all the environmental changes, we would probably all die in the process also. Then, HOW was Bumblebee suddenly able to speak? Didn't he rip out his own voice modulator or whatever they call it, back in the junkyard? And just because Bumblebee is talking to Optimus (now Nemesis Prime), he will remember who he is and change sides again? Although he was under the influence of a GOD?

The trailer, story, effect; everything looked great..until I saw the movie.I thought Bay would finally get a good story fit into this, further bringing us into the origins of the Transformers and how they could co-exist on earth with humans. Nope. This plot fell apart at the seams and never really gained focus toward any main story line. Nothing really gets explained, including Dinosaur transformers, the U.S. working with the Decepticons, Optimus Prime flying off after one of his motivational speeches and running back to the group, Bee reverting back to his radio frequencies after speaking in his original voice, etc. There's also way too many characters and what originally appeared to be some of the new main ones disappearing for 3/4 of the movie. To Bay's credit, the effects have never looked better; however, the fights were short and uninteresting. How does Optimus put his face mask on and is automatically able to slice through 5+ guardian opponents? One last gripe I had was the movie looking like it plucked stories straight from the worst DC comics movies. The military working with the Decepticons resembled suicide squad, and Prime fighting Bumblebee only to realize it by hearing his original voice rivals the terrible Batman v. Superman.Overall, there's a lot of flaws in a story that had so much anticipation. I left highly unsatisfied after waiting another 3 years for a new Transformers.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The movie had no real plot and most of the plot didn't make sense, there was no logical reason for most of the scenes.

Or better yet, let someone make a REAL transformers movie but don t call it transformers so you are free of the bullshit Hasbro wants you to do. If you do this: Use lasers instead of guns and follow the true Original G1 story line. Make it darker. Transformers is a battle for energon fought with laser's for god sake (and occasionally a energon blade in close combat). Hell, from the very beginning of the movie, it is clear that the makers are not serious about this film themselves. It is so so bad! which is just stupid because a Transformers movie could be the UGE! Put more effort in a good story line and character build up. Make it darker and more intense in dialogue and intrigue. Only use Bay if you need to get the action-scenes theatreproof, but I could live without if the atmosphere is good through good story, dialogue and screenplay. Make it more grown up. Or make it a silly animation movie that can be shown to 5 year old. But please don't try to do both. I hate the franchise now. Was a fan of the first and the second movie.

I think that is how the series should go,not bringing back galvatron and then megatron pops up in TF5 without any explanation,i was like 'WHUTTTT is going on,wheres galvatron?'.OK,maybe i am too furious about the galva mega thinggy but i must say that even TF5 is not really that good but Bay did a great job on it cuz it is like a base for the next transformers movies or should i say that it can create a lot of new things using what is inside TF5 (not gonna spoil ya all).Thats it,lets wait for transformers 6.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Cages become Cybertron(Primus) and Earth(Unicron).For some reason, Michael Bay decided that Cybertron should be desintegrated in the movie, and also added all kind of shits in the story like Merlin and the Nazis :)))Also the scenes, acting and sounds are awful.P.S: At least Bay got rid of the that kid and his pornstars girlfriends.",Transformers - The Last Knight

You've got Ryan Reynolds and plenty of budget yet you're left banging your head against the wall because it isn't Deadpool or Logan and it should be.Possible plot spoilers.If you have seen one Transformers movie, you have seen them all. Transformers molded the history of Earth and humanity, insert mcguffin, lengthy dialogue that serves no purpose other than to explain the poorly conceived plot to the audience, forced and awkward sexual jokes/innuendos, Optimus Prime repeating his name and giving numerous soliloquies, horrible adaptations of legacy transformers, and characters with 0 development.The 5th installment literally repeats the story of the first 4 almost verbatim while at the same time contradicting everything we have seen before and offering nothing new aside from new explosions and special effects. No one expects an Academy Award for Best Picture out of this franchise but given the amount of talent in the cast and the size of the budget it's frustrating that we can't at least get some resemblance of a new story.

759,psychofire-16303,Oh boy,1,19 December 2018,"I can't say expected much from this movie before entering the cinema. I had seen Age of Extinction and knew the bar was pretty low. Yet, I somehow still managed to be disappointed by this movie, if that somehow was possible. There is nothing about this movie I liked. The story is all over the place, there is a ton of characters introduced for seemingly no reason ( looking at you young, pointless girl person). None of the characters are likeable, and the acting is terrible. While I'm on the topic of characters, the worst part of this movie is the C3PO rip-off butler which is intended to make the movie more fun, but I tell you every scene he is in, is the opposite of funny. And on the topic of humor, this movie isn't funny. I admittedly laughed at one joke, about an unlikely interest in sum-marines. It had good timing and a good delivery from Hopkins, but one funny moment in an over 2 hour long movie isn't something to bra about.
Somehow the effects have become worse for every entry in this series, which makes no sense considering the first movie actually looked good for it's time. And it'sa obvious the don't even want to spend money on animating the transformation as they find more and more ""clever"" ways of avoiding showing the transformation in an ""transformers"" movie.
My biggest complain about this movie is the pacing. It's a looong movie, but I still felt like I couldn't keep up because of the fast editing. Scenes went by in seconds and the keep editing between characters so fast it feels like I watched the movie in double the speed. AND it still felt like an eternity sitting through the whole run time. How do you manage to make a movie feel to fast to pay attention and still a drag to sit through. That is actually impressive.
This movie has nothing going for it. There is literally no part of this movie that is done well and can be appreciated. And I'm not asking for much, it's a damn Transformers movie for god's sake. It's funny how they manage to make me despise this both as a movie fan and as a transformers fan. It's actually the first time I've gone into the movie theater and whished I could get the money and time I spent, back. Please stop.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Megatron returns with no real explanation as to how, you just have too guess. In terms of the plot for T5 it had so much potential and in places was really good however i just feel the people who wrote this create these great ideas and get to excited, rush it and lose control. Hopkins I thought was good but one of the worse bits of the film for me was releasing the new deceptions out of ""Jail"" this was very poorly executed, these big characters had 5 minute cameos and were very cheesy. I will say though the CGI is unreal and the action scenes especially the last 15-20 minutes were very enjoyable. It gets a 5/10, very watchable but a rushed film which is very hectic, I am huge fan of the first three but the last two for me unfortunately have had great potential but poorly executed",Transformers - The Last Knight
761,amp-15267,Awful & Awfully long Prolonging The Agony,1,3 July 2017,"Best part of this film was when it was over. It looked as if the writer and director were trying to appeal to a younger audience while also attracting older siblings. Their attempt failed miserably. Reasons as to why this film is despised. Yes I said despised...well here it goes:1) Had a young teenage girl (14) in the film running around in a skimpy top showing much flesh - for her age (or any age). Not the best way to garner parental support. Put another way, good parents might have reservations about showing this type of soft kiddy porn to their children. 2) At one point in the movie the geniuses who wrote and produced this American classic had a group of young teenagers break into a government restricted area making it seem fun and innocent. Then one of the young pubescent(s) makes a reference to steeling a vehicle within the confine hence stating ""lets hot-wire this b___h. Again, a good parent may have reservations, especially for a movie being marketed to a young audience. Dumb move by Mr Bay and the Hollywood moguls.3) Acting was terrible. Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins were horrible. Hard to understand what they were trying to accomplish? And if it were hard for me to follow then imagine the younger crowd. Silly story, bad acting and worse directing do not produce a good film. 4) Script was annoying, bulky and full of rantings about some sort of wizard leading to magic via the creation of Transformers... blah, blah, blah... Another Harry Potter rip off. Sorry, don't want my children learning witchcraft. Another brilliant move by holly weird.5) Lots of mindless action. The movie producers could not let this film end within a reasonable time for some reason? Most films are an hour and 1/2 or so. Not this one, no sir, they prolonged the agony. Finally walked out. Could no longer endure the torture. Summary Marky Mark would of done better going back and doing ""New Kids On The Block"". Or as the (Funky Bunch). Send Hopkins back to England as retired!

763,has-77788,TF5 has Cult Status! You Owe It That!!!,10,29 September 2017,"Here's my review (if I could call it that) of Transformers 5: The Last Knight. In case, I talk too much about the plot, this review may contain spoilers. I will try to spoil it as little as possible. However, I honestly wish I was calm, right now, but I'm Not and here's why! The 4th Transformers movie was at least better than this, but it's hard for Me to read and watch reviews of this movie, when I rated this chicken 10! I mean it! Michael Bay, who directed the last 4 movies is back to directing the franchise (which he has done for 10 Years). But here are the hard things about dealing with stuff like this. The reality is that Everything They Say About These Movies Is A Lie! Sure, I do hate the second one, too. That one is still the worst in the series. But when it comes to Whining about big budget blockbuster movies making money and how much All of you dislike them, you're being Drugged, Bamboozuled, Blind, Deaf and Tricked and even more so, when you hate something, before even Seeing it, because you think the other ones are bad, You Are Being Ripped Off! Obviously, if you like this first 4 Transformers movies, you will like This movie and if you hate the first 4 Transformers movie, you will Hate This Movie, but there is 100% More good things in the movie, than what you think you're seeing. From what I can tell from your reviews of the movie, all of you who panned it are Not really reviewing this movie, you're just reviewing the flaws of the other 4 movies, and even the directing style, which involves random stuff exploding. Even more so, all I want is a cartoon-based live action movie with positive reviews from critics and audiences and No, i don't mean Disney's live action versions of their animated features, because They are better received. I mean, live action movies based on animated television shows. What's wrong with that? What's even wrong with You? The acting in this new one Is awkward, the script Is stiff, and That is It! But what you Don't know is the Real number of redeeming qualities, it actually has. The cinematography in this movie is Amazing. This movie was filmed almost entirely with digital IMAX 3D cameras. The aspect ratio does change every few times in a while, which adds to the fun and charm of the action and dramatic tension, Not the perfection. (Hey, it rhymes) Obviously, Christopher Nolan changes aspect ratios in his movies and that's because they were filmed in IMAX. One example of this is Dunkirk, which came out, a while ago. Heck, I haven't even got to this movie's use of 3D. Remember when i said, this was filmed with IMAX 3D cameras. Well, you heard it right. This movie was filmed natively in 3D, and NOT post- converted into 3D. Everything pops out of the screen, so well, that you can tell how well the format was executed. The editing is impressive. The amount of the depth and rule-of-thirds techniques captured in this movie, helps the editing make Strictly sure the movie knows when to transition to another other scene and when to switch aspect ratios. Again, IMAX! The special effects are Beyond Legendary. The texture of the robot characters and everything else look so believable. A lot of the action scenes are entertaining to watch. The musical score is Epic! The pacing is less slow than in the fourth one, because it's 20 minutes shorter. Even though I know, that Michael Bay thought about this movie, being 3 hours long, which it does Not need to be. The Transformer robot characters have 90% more screen time than the humans, despite the fact that Optimus prime is in half the entire movie. Heck, we even get to see the action with both of them in the same scene together, once or twice. There's only less sex-object-portrayed women in this movie, then the last 4 films. The casting is brilliant. This movie even gets sad, a few times, like I was weeping for 1/3 of the movie, because Optimus Prime was almost on the evil side. At least, for 10 minutes. Now, listen to me! People, If you keep saying these movies, like this one suck, then I can Not tell you too much about what I want you to do, or what to spend your money, or Even How You Should Plan To Do Anything With Your Life! I mean, I could come to the set and drop hand grenades on public lawns, throw template balls, where the robots might be, blow buildings up, run around in havoc, and You should pay me, because I would play a better human character, than what you would see in these movies! And if I were to stop any of you from posting negative reviews of this movie, or anything else, then I am afraid, I have done my job and I specifically have your word! But if Not, then I will tell you, all critics, fans, and audiences in general, like I would tell this movie. This would be the Same Thing, that I would tell Michael Bay!

I even liked The age of extinction, but Michael Bay failed very hard with The last knight. The movie is full of deux ex machina moments, the solutions come out from nowhere and plenty of the characters have no a clear reason nor a excuse to be there. There are happening to many things in the movie, I believe it would had be better to divide the movie into two parts or, simply, redefine it because it gets too large, too large.

I honestly don't see why people are giving 1 out of 10's and 17%s. I really do think that this was the best movie in the franchise. It delves into the transformers mythos a lot more than the past few movies. I think the first half of the movie was better than the second and the ending wasn't ideal, some of the decepticons could've been had some more screen time but this movie isn't supposed to be going over every little thing, complaining about useless characters and being too long.

774,oshawott-11239,Underrated. Ignore the hate!,8,21 June 2017,"I have been seeing so much hate on this movie and decided to just put out my own personal opinion. I won't be spoiling the story, don't worry.This film, compared the others, is quite different. Watching this didn't but also did feel like a Bay movie. Your usual explosions and cheesy humor. But this, this wasn't different in a BAD way. This one actually had a GOOD story. Nothing being spoiled, again, but it isn't a bad one like in the past. The robots actually transform and get a ton more screen time, coupled with a lot of action. The jokes actually got a laugh out of me and the audience as well, unless it's just that we have an odd sense of humor. They cut down on screen time, although it does feel a little long, and I do feel some scenes could have been cut, but that's okay. Although I'll admit the movie is a bit too fast paced for me, it was good, and fun to see. Robot action eye candy as usual.Most complain about the film being messy and the story! Again, the story is much better than the previous ones. You can go into a theater and expect a better one than the previous films. So although The Last Knight was not my favorite, it's a good movie and recommend it. Don't have way too high expectations though. Personally, as a longtime fan of Transformers, I really like the movies.So, 8/10 from me. I watched this in IMAX 3D, so if you want exactly what I had experienced, then watch it that way. I think this movie has gathered too much hate as deserves better. Food for thought: Don't base your opinion off of other opinions, especially at Rotten Tomatoes. I tell you this only because I watched a review that was mostly hate to this and ruined my excitement, but truly enjoyed it. Please form your own opinion, and don't hate on it for ridiculous reasons (like the not accurate to original source...new is good! Redoing something in the past isn't fun unless it's a remake, and the movie franchise isn't what that is; it's Bay's own take on the Transformers.",Transformers - The Last Knight

777,nsaiger,Better story - Odd Jokes,8,21 June 2017,"At the beginning of it, i was truly stunned by some new way bay was telling the story to the audience. I really liked the intro with some major throwbacks on what happened over years.This time, the story is much better (doesn't mean it makes sense) compared to the last 2 Transformers films. Each new character was well presented. Otherwise than that, it was pretty time consuming. There were many scenes which were very overprinted and which could have omitted. That means it was sometimes very soporific, since not much happened.I also noticed that Bay aimed the franchise even more towards 14yr old's since many epic or serious scenes were afterwards destroyed with jokes. If you think a scene is epic, some odd/unfunny jokes will destroy the moment. Some jokes are funny (like a typical bay), some are too much (tried to be funny). Maybe i'm to serious to understand these jokes or they are really unnecessarily unfunny.The Story was better than ever before. Compared to the 4 Films before, it was a complete different way the story was told. The story connects better and goes from the middle age to the now (which was already seen in the trailers). It had more logic, was better to understand and also had a better plot.The movie raised the expectations with the stunning trailer and the visuals were as expected - phenomenal! ILM did a great job on the CGI, looked better and more realistic than ever. Besides the unfunny jokes and the sometimes too long drawn scenes (which is not too bad) i really like the movie and was entertained. You don't watch a ""Transformers"" Movie to learn something for your life, you watch it to get entertained and this movie reaches the entertainment-level 9/10.I really enjoyed the new Transformers and definitely will watch the upcoming ones.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The action scenes are what make me want to see the Transformer movies but even they were not groundbreaking; except for 1 scene that involved Bumblebee.There is some really stiff acting and dumb as hell jokes. It seemed like a long boring and awkward movie. The scene that was the tipping point - without revealing any spoilers - involved a professor , Anthony Hopkins and Mark Walhberg. So many things were wrong and unnecessary in this scene that my brain couldn't take it. Its like the writers said lets make sure the IQ of the audience goes down with this one. Go ahead and wait for it on DVD if you can.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I went in with absolutely zero expectations, I rate Bay as highly as I do JJ which is to say I don't; and still this movie was a disappointment from start to finish. With subject matter that should be good; an obviously large budget; this should have been a simple home run. This didn't even strike out, they cancelled the game and bulldozed the stadium, that's how bad this movie is. If you haven't seen it, don't.

Like the convoluted one that introduces Mark Wahlberg's and Isabela Moner's characters lacked a coherent thought process.Then we are introduced to Jerrod Carmichael's character which has its own sequence of terrible dialogues and situations.After 45 minutes of dealing with this misery, we walked out of the movie theater, couldn't stand it anymore. I've seen quite a few bad movies, and walked out of one before, this was my second.If you like Mark Wahlberg's movies and/or the Transformer series, don't watch this movie and ruin it.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Make it your last Transformers movie. Abort the mission....To be exact, if I would seriously rate this movie, I would rate it 4.5/10, and 4.5 is a very generous rating coming from me. I wanted to love the movie, I really wanted to, I loved the previous ones, but this one just felt so unnecessary, repetitive, and boring at some parts, I even found myself sighing and rolling my eyes at some scenes.*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOOOOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*What I did not like in TF:The Last Knight was that it was similar to the second movie in the franchise, Revenge Of The Fallen. In Revenge of The Fallen, the Cybertronians and the earthlings have crossed paths before, and in TF: The Last Knight, Humans (the Knights) and the Cybertronians crossed paths and fought together (Correct me if Im wrong). In Revenge of The Fallen, the Primes decided to hide the ""Matrix of Leadership"" by sealing it in a tomb. In TF:TLK, the 12 Knights of Cybertron had to guard the staff, just like how the Primes were guarding the Matrix of Leadership. The staff was housed in a tomb as well, the Tomb of Merlin to be specific, and the ship that the Tomb of Merlin was found in was also some sort of alien robots tomb. In Revenge of The Fallen, Jetfire the Oldtimer Decepticon told Sam and the others that only a Prime can defeat the Fallen, and in TF:TLK, only Vivienne can wield the staff of Quentessa. And TF:TLK had the same story where there was something that the Autobots/Decepticons were going after, just like in the first movie, they were going after the All-Spark, however, in this one they were looking for the Staff.....Everything just felt so repetitive, did we really need this movie ? When the trailer first came out, I expected it to be epic, and I was surprised that it wasn't as I expected it to be. Anyways, there's still one movie left to come (I hope), and I hope it is going to be way much better that this one. Also, I am kinda wondering how Unicron, which might be a colossal Decipticon, be portrayed in the live-action movie...Looking forward to Michael Bay's next, and hopefully last Transformers movie of the franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight

I guess human beings in the transformers world are the most dumbest ""Homo Sapiens"" of all the cinematic universe; I mean in almost all their movie they first try to eliminate transformers(or specifically our loved Autobots) but eventually Earth is saved by them (to be just destroyed in next movie), but what I really don't understand is that why they have trust issues with Autobots in the initial part when they are their only way to protect the Earth. That's just not justifiable. However, the story line is good but it is the editing and the way of presentation which causes the dent. I mean the movie is not properly presented to the viewers and its really hard to cope-up with the pace with which movie is going. This is the worst rating that I am giving to any movie; and it feels really bad when you have to give it to one of the best film franchise.",Transformers - The Last Knight

786,Cinema-Cam,"An ""Okay"" Transformers Movie",6,24 June 2017,"This was... okay. Wasn't great or god awful, but just...good. I did leave this film a bit underwhelmed, but I still enjoyed myself regardless (I feel very neutral about this whole thing). I do see where the critics are coming from and do agree with some of there gripes, such as pointless character, humor that doesn't quite hit the mark, plot points left unexplained, barely explained, or poorly executed (i.e. evil Optimus lasted only a few minutes towards the 3rd act, how Galvatron became Megatron and knew about the Staff, etc.), and so on. The trailers for this film gave me a drastically different idea about how I thought it would play out.But I still did find some things to like about it. The visuals are beautiful and love what they can pull off robot-wise (so many transformations!). Also, i did like some of the characters, such as Cogman and Anthony Hopkins' character. And the action is pure Michael Bay-hem.I did also enjoy the idea that Earth is actually Unicron (which they obviously got from Transformers Prime, but whatever) which could be built upon in the 6th film. The Transformers always being a part of history is always a cool concept to me. And having the final battle taking place on the ruins of Cybertron, rather than a city like 1,3, and 4, is a nice change and provides interesting visuals.For me, these movies are one of my guilty pleasures and works as a form of escapism and mindless entertainment (and also because I was a fan of the toys as a kid and love the Transformers lore as an adult today). If you loved it, that's fine with me. If you hated it, that's fine too. I'm just a guy giving his opinion on a movie he liked.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Too many unnecessary characters were involved who would simply add few minutes to the movie , unnecessary try to put some ""funny(comedy) sequence"". Among many things that raise my level of dislike ,one thing that i could not accept is-- how did Bumble bee evolve into an autobot who could detach its all body parts and join again at its own will? (last time of transformer1 i remember bumble bee had a broken leg and was being dragged by a towing truck driven by megan fox). One more event I couldn't understand is -- how does 'cade yeager' find an alien assault rifle of man size (as transformers are way bigger that human) not only he uses a rifle from previous movie, here he has a man sized alien hand-gun (pistol like)!

Not the case with The Last Knight. Coming out of the theater if you asked me what the movie was about I couldn't really tell you what happened because nothing really did. Characters are introduced and then five minutes later disappear, probably because there is more side characters than extras in the film. A lot of things appear and then disappear as well, I distinctly remember a scene where a truck hits a transformer, there's a small explosion and the truck disappears. There's also a lot of random cuts where things just sort of happen and there's a lack of visual continuity. But all that aside this is a movie about robots fighting, and that's what you pay for, except that's not what you get.

Transformers and TMNT! Dude just stick to Fashion TV please! This movie made no sense at all. from start to end. you tried to copy Logan with the kick-ass young girl....um, FAIL! she has no reason to be in the movie, and she does absolutely nothing. The movie starts with American kids disregarding clear stay out signs to a war-torn region of the city, sign of the American youth mentality, and then surprise surprise they get attacked, then of course this lil girl jumps out to save em, by almost getting her head blow own off. Somehow the American government has just decided to forget that the transformers helped save their asses before and now are hunting them. So she saves them, but then inevitably Mark has to save her and them, and then unofficially adopts her. Turns out he's hiding out with the auto-bots and Giant DinoBots somewhere very hidden, an above-ground junkyard in the middle of a barren desert. We're supposed to believe that with all the new tech the government has they don't have better satellites that can spot a giant metal T-Rex above ground stomping about. blah blah predictable battle follows. Of course the little girl decides to walk up to Megatron and call him out...points for moxy yes, brains no. I actually wanted her to get killed to show Bay had some balls. At one point Bay's porn fetish kicks in and has her running with her 14 year old tits bouncing around, fk was that awkward. Anyway later on her best line is quite aptly her response to Mark's question 'Why are you here?' to which she replies 'I don't know'. Perfect. Idiotic character and role. The main girl is just Bay's fetish for poofy gasping lips. Just because her character is a polo playing, super academically qualified academic does not make her empowered. She's not interested in Wahlberg at all at first sight, although he of course has fallen in love with her and her quite whore-ishly exposed tits(very appropriate for a professor hey), but as soon as she sees him shirtless her panties splash and she now has a soft g spot for him. Their kiss at the end is so FD and stupid and pointless and idiotic and misplaced and nonsensical ugh...kill me. She is as retarded pointless and ridiculous as a skydivers helmet or the chick from Jurassic World. This woman is the key to foiling the Creator of the Transformers plans??LMFAO!!! Idiotic!! Mark is Mark, blegh. just like Will Smith and a glass of sand he can only play one character type. This movie is simple...far less people, or no people ideally, and Oh I dunno..perhaps more transformers transforming in battle.... The first movie was awesome, when StarScream transformed on the street during a battle I fell in love! Anthony Hopkins, dude I love you, but it is OK to turn down a role. Also how did the Knights bury Merlin on the Alien spaceship which ended up at the bottom of the ocean? Bay just give it up please. Please! Megatron and Optimus are in the movie for all of 20 minutes altogether! yes, 20 minutes! WTF. The best, or should i say the most fongdonkeyhopscotch-worst was Megatron, the baddest motherfather in the universe negotiating with lawyers to get his Decepticons released!LMFAO!! How fkng arrogant, retarded and deluded are Americans that they think a race of alien sentient GIANT Warrior Mechas would have to sit down and talk terms!

Michael Bay's directing, the plot holes, the story moving too fast, etc. but as an avid Transformers lover, I was thoroughly pleased. Growing up with Transformers, I am always open minded about each new movie, but usually leave feeling a sense of joy and excitement. The one part I did question was how to Galvatron go back to being Megatron... There was no backstory or showing what happened after he left in Age of Extinction, but that was the only thing I couldn't wrap my head around. I did enjoy the added humour to the movie, as well as the lead up to the, yes, sixth movie.As fast as the rest of the story went, I was able to keep up and take in, but I will need to see it a second time to fully understand everything. Optimus Prime was bad-ass, which is why he's my favourite.

806,rakhmatov,Total rubbish film!,3,22 June 2017,"In brief it is: incoherent, underdeveloped and illogical. Audience is taken for idiots who wouldn't care about the quality, but rather just have a massive amount of random shootout.Scenario is quite a mess, without much explanation which leaves you second guessing on what is actually happening. The emotions of the scenes are detached from one another, as if there is a lag, for e.g. the whole world is being destroyed, but characters are not up to speed with their emotions/worrying. Also the story line is quite shallow and scattered. So many scenes without much depth. Feels like jumping around from one to another. Also a lot of irrelevant and unnecessary scenes and characters, just wasting time. Director should have focused more in depth, rather than trying to broaden the film.The earthly physics and logic have been completely abandoned. In some scenes characters survive the super heavy crash, hit or fire without a scratch or some after effects. Bullets seems to just go through the main characters, without ever hurting them.The ""Queens English"" pretentious accent is present throughout. It being pretentious just makes you want to throw up.

807,galvacron,A very enjoyable experience for a devoted Transfrormers fan.,8,22 June 2017,"I know not everyone enjoys the Transformers by Michael Bay. This one doesn't feel as much like Michael Bay Directed it. With the impressive and moving dialog of Sir Anthony Hopkins, and the much needed lore of the Transformers universe, I find myself greatly pleased to walk out of the theater. The acting was very well in aspects, and is easy to follow, again, if you keep up with the lore of the past movies and how they all have tied into The Last Knight. I believe many people dislike the movies due to a lack of understanding of the plot that the last four movies have directed. The movie was rather long, but I was also engaged most of the time, by the action scenes, or the many funny scenes that were presented, such as Cogman the servant of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the movie, who played the role of Sir Edmund. I greatly enjoyed seeing Unicron finally make a stance on the series, in a way similar to that of the Transformers: Prime Cartoon, where he himself, is the Planet Earth. Quintessa, a Quintesson, is also very unique, being a much needed addition from the classic series. The Quintessons created the Transformers. This finally bridges some of the cartoon and movie together, in a sense. For aesthetics, I enjoyed the areas filmed, as well as the CGI work. Seeing Cybertron again, as well as a redesigned Megatron is a great thing. His new design is menacing and really calls out to fans of the fearless Decepticon gladiator. This is no doubt his greatest appearance, especially with the great Frank Welker voicing him once again.I am overall pleased with the movie, and look forward to the direction that Hasbro will take the franchise, now that Michael Bay is stepping down from the series.",Transformers - The Last Knight
808,leoestaniel,Definitely better than Age of Extinction,6,23 June 2017,"Watched this movie in 3-D, enjoyed it especially the war scenes which showed some of the smoothest renderings ever for the Transformers franchise. Liked the fact that a lot of the fight scenes did not revolve around vehicles brandishing their logos beside the Autobot/Decepticon insignia like ads on boxing shorts. The focus on melee combat instead of plain gunfights was quite excellent, as it made the robot fights much more exciting. Lighting was great, you could clearly observe each Transformer character and how they move. Once again, the writers were trying to introduce and do so many things, cramming so many plots and subplots while trying to keep the movie under 3 hours. Lines of Anthony Hopkins were a roller-coaster of humor and wisecracking while also trying to remain regal and commanding, which can be confusing. Mark Wahlberg meanwhile was clearly the hero and yet he didn't sound at all like a hero and seemed to be scared of the spotlight and attention. Overall, will recommend watching this movie on a bigger, premium IMax screen. Has good replay ability, should be a part of any sci-fi movie collection.",Transformers - The Last Knight
809,kellenm-50899,This movie is a work of art,8,23 June 2017,"This movie I think is a very well made work of art from Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg. They have made this great movie with amazing quality, great effects, and an easy to follow and understand story. They didn't have too many Transformers on screen to confuse you with the amount of names to remember and didn't introduce too much. I think this movie deserves a 8/10 because of all of these examples, and I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the series, and anyone who is looking to get into the series.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Mark Walberg ? Really ? is he hard up for money? and Anthony Hopkins? why?I seriously wanted to walk out of the theater but my wife wanted to stay to see how it ended...that was 2 1/2 hours i will never get back. The Cheeze in this movie was soo over the top. At least in the movie Wonder Woman I could suspend disbelief, because the movie was Great and the acting was very good as well as the writing, also because I'm fond of Gal Gadot.Seriously tho, don't waste your time or money, don't even wait for it to come out on DVD or Netflix, in fact don't even bother streaming it on your favorite Pirate site...You have been warned.",Transformers - The Last Knight

812,apollocreate,Great Movie among cynical reviews!,9,23 June 2017,"PLEASE READ FOR TRUE REVIEW We've all been waiting for it and here it is in all it's glory, TRANSFORMERS THE LAST KNIGHT. First off i would like to point out that some of these critics like to pull apart every detail and show it as not close to perfect but newsflash Michael Bay does not make Transformer movies to be critically acclaimed and they are not put up for Academy Award winning for story. And from what you've been hearing from all the YouTube channels and big brand reviews that say TF5 is a downright horrid and awful movie you may be thinking that you might not want to spend your hard earned money to see the film and here is where I am going to tell you different. Yes, some might think I'm crazy but think about it, the YouTube channel reviews and critics from newspapers and what not only represent a small number of people who dislike the movies and go into the film before seeing it thinking it will be bad because of Michael Bay. THEY ARE DEAD WRONG!! This movie is exciting and shows great honor among characters with an interesting plot where in small places got me confused but mostly I was able to figure it out. The visual arts of the transformers and the voice acting was spot on as always and contributed to the IMAX experience making you feel there and kept you right in the action without a dull moment but good breaks to keep from nonstop action which would eventually bore the viewer. The acting was spot on and had great one liners at times which didn't feel forced contrary to what some will say. Although there are a few minor plot holes and misrepresentations from the trailers(Izabella having a large roll) the film kept me excited and interested with a smile on my face the whole time.",Transformers - The Last Knight
813,voidemail,"This story line is all over the place,and so are these spoilers",3,24 June 2017,"Let's start from the top. Within the first 10 minutes I had an opinion about this movie, and it wasn't a good one. The whole story line is all over the place and completely shatters all previous story lines in previous Transformers movies. I am a huge fan of the first 3 movies, in particular the first 2. One piece of this shattered mess is megatron. One thing the 4th movie got right was the rise of galvatron after the death of megatron. However galvatron has mysteriously disappeared and megatron is back from the dead. Another problem is Optimus Prime, there's not a lot of him. Another qualm I have is the humor, and it's that it's awful. I love the humor in these movies, but this one has too much. Not one scene can be taken seriously in this movie. So is there any pros? Few at best, one good thing is that as far as action scenes go, it delivers and keeps delivering just like any Bay film. Next is the score. Jablonsky redeems himself for the 4th movie's score, it has a great selection that brings you back to the first 3 films. Overall transformers fans are going to want to see this film and I was in the same boat, however if you haven't seen the others don't let this garbage ruin it for you. It's a great series of movies with just a disappointing ending.",Transformers - The Last Knight
814,gclayla,What the second movie should have been,6,25 June 2017,"I made the mistake of reading the reviews on here before I went to watch the movie. I was already reluctant because the past movies were generally just not good. I don't know if it's because I went in expecting a horrible movie and received a relatively good movie or if the movie is actually relatively good. I'm a sucker for Optimus Prime though, and I LOVE little details Bay puts into his movies. Unfortunately what you love visually about the first movie is recreated so much that it loses it coolness. I actually genuinely enjoyed it. It is fast paced and Mark Wahlberg is good. One thing I don't like is how it seems they need to pack as many one line jokes as they can into one scene. Take the other reviews with a grain of salt.",Transformers - The Last Knight
815,zachnbala,"Plot is messy, but what do you REALLY expect from a Transformers movie?",8,25 June 2017,"I would specifically rate this movie a 7.5 out of 10. I know this review is contrary to most reviews on the internet, but I'll give you a reason why. When one thinks of a transformers movie, the first thing that comes to mind is robot action. What most people truly come to see transformers movies for are action and entertainment, not the most in-depth plot and outstanding character development. On that note, I think it is fair to say that this movie did the transformers franchise justice. It is true, this transformers film is a bit more focused on humans, but it is still action packed. The plot can be a bit hard to follow with the setting changing constantly, but think for yourself. All critics have been hard on all of the transformers movies, but everyone still goes to see them and enjoys them. If you enjoy robot action, then go see Transformers: The Last Knight. This movie was just as good as movies 1-3 and will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Transformers - The Last Knight

818,goesprotocall,Bad links and good links,6,26 June 2017,"Isn't it magical how Bee's long lost voice just brought back Optimus's 'soul' aka broke the curse/mind control? YAY!But like WTF!!? Did fighting with Optimus 'magically' fixed Bee's voice box? Didn't he ripped out the female voice before and didn't get a replacement? Was it the strike to head with the sword that kinda missed? Why didn't the fix remain afterwards tho?So human tech (cars/planes and the notion of automotive) was inspired by cybertron tech like how the Nazi's poison gas was transpired by an evil god? And the Germans basically lost the war due to the involvement of gods and aliens? Can Stephen Hawking, given who he actually is, verify the Transformer lore? He's like the only non-fictional person in a fictional story that still lives today.Was that plane that flew Cade to UK the vehicle version of Cogman? How the sh1t did Bee fit in that little plane?Are the Stonehenge protected by the powers of mighty Merlin or whatnot, so they're practically indestructible amidst heavy firepower fights, or did it just slipped the CGI artist's mind to add in some debris?If Cybertron was already an inhabitable sh1t-hole since a few movie installments back (or since the 12 knights stole the staff?), where did that Quintessa bit(h and her monstrous lackey come from? And that old knight that landed recently and got busted by kids, where was he between the timelines? Was he one of the original 12 that came to earth? Hmm, don't remember seeing all 12 Transformers holding their swords up around the table in the flashbacks.So many broken links and questions marks Michael Bay is gonna start losing way more fans of the franchise than I like. That, or is it a troll move to leave all these questions marks in the minds of the viewers, so as to generate more interest and research after the seating, to generate more hype and buzz online?????Failing on the side of ""intra-links"", the movie is doing quite well with external-reference, starting with Bee doing the Iron Man self assembly sequence. And when the soldier dude and Viviane was bickering during the ""drop the staff scene"", I could practically see Shia Lebeouf shouting the whole green screen motivational speech thing in the background. And when Izabelle shouted to Squeaks ""Andale Ándale!"" (without the Arriba Arriba! tho). And when Optimus came to senses and asks ""What have I done?"", it's like its paying tribute to the Linkin Park soundtrack to the best installment in the franchise 10 years ago. Also Cogman singing to the tune of Ludicrous in the car was funny. Btw, who's the better robot butler? Jarvis or Cogman? Jarvis's voice in Cogman's body and a mix of their personalities would pretty much hit the spot I guess.#MindFuck #MindDump #Signedupjusttosaythis",Transformers - The Last Knight
819,ssamperi-08287,"New Concepts, Great Action, Bad Humor, Quick Pace",7,26 June 2017,If you want to watch alien robots continue to destroy each other this is a pretty good movie. I was expecting a 9/10 out of 10 but there were a few issues. I am more generous with my rating than most because I just went in to see robots fight and I got plenty of that. Action and fight scenes were amazing. Some of the new stuff was really cool.Humans took up half the movie and most of that was pointless. The little girl was promoted a lot but she was annoying and pointless too. most of the humor had bad timing and felt awkward. The pace of the movie made me feel a little uncomfortable at times. Optimus and Megatron were not in the movie enough.There is a rumor that Bay actually made a 3hr movie but he was forced to cut out 30 mins just for the sake of time. Supposedly he cut out scenes with Optimus and Megatron. If a longer director's cut comes out it may significantly redeem this movie.,Transformers - The Last Knight

Don't Do IT!,1,27 June 2017,"So 1st off there's these kids that are all in the trailer but are in like 1 scene throughout the movie. The 14 year old girl starts crying about this cliché story about her family DURING a battle. She then goes with that lame buff guy and meets the new robots or whatever. The girl starts saying some more bull about her family to buff guy (MY GUESS trying to copy the Logan route but failed miserably). So much was going on 1st their in England, than explosions, then that old rich guy, and then their underwater. Transition scenes were horrendous. Honestly I forgot what happens after this it was that boring. They TRIED to copy that robot from rouge 1 and Rody from Ironman. If you are only watching the movie for your kids DON'T. There is a lot of swearing for a pg 13 movie. Cheesy 1 liners that'll make you cringe. Serious moments made me laugh because the acting was terrible. The movie theater was surprisingly full at 1st but at the middle of the movie it was practically empty. I'd rather die than watch THAT again.",Transformers - The Last Knight

First of all, it almost never happens, and when it does it's because the woman is ugly or a dunce or the guy has won a 9-figure PowerBall. Even then, it's unlikely to work. In this movie we're expected to believe that blue collar dumb ass Donny Walberg's 6-pack and heroic posing somehow wins him a polo-playing Oxford professor with 2 PhDs. It doesn't help things that there is pretty much no on-screen chemistry between Walberg and Ms. Haddock - just as there would be none in real life. Language is a good indication of compatibility. Walberg' s blue collar brogue would make him unwelcome at dinner party with the posh Viviana Wembly's family or friends. . If a movie's first hurdle is to suspend the viewer's belief, then studios need to make love pairings more believable. Walberg' ability to pull in viewers can't offset the fact that no believes him as an inventor. There are actors who can pull off the role of educated bad ass like James Franco, Matt Damon or Ben Affleck but, then, they'd never sign on to this movie. Even the poor, maligned Shia LaBeouf was much better in the role. It's sad that education isn't recognized by Hollywood as a primary attractor in mating.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The action was enough to distract the normal viewers but fans could tell all from the biggest to the tiniest detail that the movie got wrong. The movie also looked like Michael Bay used only the cover of the comic or the cover of the VHS tape as source material.

One moment Mark Wahlberg's Cade Yaeger rescues some children by bringing them outside of the city and when the shot changes he immediately is in the middle of the city again. The thing that bothered me the most is that the original idea that Bumblebee couldn't speak but communicated with his radio speaker was brilliant, but got canceled at the end of the movie when Nemesis Prime tries to kill Bumblebee. He immediately can speak with his own voice while that hasn't been working for 4(!) movies!TL:DR; Disappointed by the decisions Bay made this movie.",Transformers - The Last Knight

A single particular detail stultified my pleasure in the movie: A beautiful scene of a desert was displayed and described as; Namibia, West Africa. Now: as an African and particularly a Zambian with Namibian descent, the inaccuracy with which Namibia was described got me wondering if the Writers, Script editors, Prompters, Producers and Directors of this movie could be bothered by the perception of its African and Namibian following. The corollary to this is: is Africa considered (by Hollywood) as one enormous country as opposed to the vast and divergent Continent that it is?Indulge me Mr Michael Bay, Ian Bryce, Tom Desanto, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Brian Goldner et al.

841,fizzyboyfatty,Awfully rushed. A collection of plots and subplots crammed together.,1,17 July 2017,"Disgusted and disappointed. Let me start from the beginning. So the movie starts and you have a group of children entering a Restricted Zone. The problem here is that there are huge gaps in between movies and new characters are thrown at us at every corner. These children are a waste of time, a waste of plot, and a another set of characters that confuse the audience. The ""zone"" is a wasteland which just happens to be inhabited by a 14 year old who is wearing inappropriate clothing. She is a child! This girl saves the kids, as she is made out to be a bad-ass veteran with war scars from the wasteland. She just isn't. Throughout this film, the dialogue is trash, lacking any emotion. Most of the films are trash, since they are like a cheap version of the first one, just with more bots and cons and the ever growing human cast. This girl has made friends with two bots, one who dies and one who saves earth, despite being smaller than a 6 year old and being defenceless. TRASSSSSSH. Bring us some NEW action scenes that are concise but move on the plot with stunts to make the audience gasp. Bee gets his voice back somehow and after 20 minutes of showing Optimus becoming evil, it takes a second to change him back and think up a plan. Quintessa is a potentially-amazing prospect that SHOULD have been grown over a few films, same as Unicron and Primus and the Knights and the history of Transformers on Earth. We need a different concept, instead of just uncovering the past, we could develop the future and present, and think about new ways of creating action instead of chases that last for ten minutes and add nothing to the story. Optimus was barley in the film and he is a father figure, a leader to the bots. If we were to create a new range of films which is what we need, we could think about cybertron and the war, or even a completely different plot with a different plot. Maybe Optimus had a brother, bigger, better and more bad-ass. So many simple things could change it all. We need to cut the crap and add new, original scenes and subplots.

There is lots of bad language which is no effective to moment when its used(not funny nor bad-ass). And the actors were just lazy in this movie, non of them seems to be putting any greater effort or they had just a really bad script and producers, so they couldn't do it how it would suits them to make it better. And plus almost 90% of the action was already in trailer.",Transformers - The Last Knight

The action was good and even more of scenes with Bumblebee ,there seemed less of Optimus which was a downer ,but with the Autobots from the previous film , this felt like a sequel. Some of it was quite confusing and overloaded ,but the action was put together well , loved the humour parts as well. Far too much criticism from a lot of reviews ,but this film was action packed which made it great . One major positive was that we got a twist in the credits which will make us wonder what will happen in the next film..",Transformers - The Last Knight
848,izopia,Not enough action and explosions,5,8 September 2017,"First review here,in my opinion this movie was made for people who were complaining about the action and the explosions, well they are gone in this part, and honestly i wasn't very satisfied after leaving the theater. I myself like action,explosions and big robots and this is the damn reason i go to the cinema, i don't care who directed, scripted or whatever the movie is, i want to see the juice and the thrill in the movie. In the previous parts it was easy, as soon as I see ""another Michael Bay explosion crap"" or whatever, I knew this movie is perfect for me. So if you are a story lover, I do believe this movie is perfect for you ( if you don't mind the fantasy stuff ), but if you are like me ... honestly its a bit pointless. Please don't get me wrong, movie without a story line would be very bad as well, but as in other Transformers parts, and tons of other movies, big start -> story line for ~ 30-50 mins -> rest is the thrill and the action and a finishing touch at the end, if you add a bit of comedy in the middle I do believe the score would be 6-7 stars , where movies of that kind should be.//p.s. to all people who went to the cinema to watch a Transformers movie, and complain about the Sci-Fi and the explosions, go see a doctor... really...",Transformers - The Last Knight

I wanted more of Optimus Prime but I saw more of a bloody teenage girl (Absolutely unnecessary) and bloody humans. Not a SINGLE real fight scene just human crap.

I'm a huge transformers fan, and I really tried hard to like this one. But no, it just wouldn't happen. Michael Bay thinks that he can put together pieces of story lines and plots and action, and make a nice movie out of it. NOPE. That ain't gonna work this time. It is literally what he did in the previous 4 movies. The first one turned out to be a success, the second one was fairly good, the third one was... meh..., the fourth one was a start to a bad future, and now, the fifth one is a disaster. Honestly after seeing the fourth one, I kinda expected this one to go downhill. You can literally put the ratings of the five movies on a line graph and you will see the line beginning its crash landing to 0 stars.Oh and one more thing. I'm also kind of a die-hard Star Wars fan... Michael Bay seemed to be out of inspiration and ideas. In the movie, there were parts which were clearly Star Wars ripoffs. For instance when the drones were dispatched to hunt down Cade. The drones were literally mini TIE fighters!!!!!! Disney should be sueing Michael Bay's ass for that intellectual theft.Transformers has gone stale. If only they can find a better director for this franchise, there will be some hope of recovering this franchise. Transformers, you just thousands of fans.

It has good actors but Michael bay really screwed up with this movie and the other problem is that the movie if focusing only on Cade and bumblebee the others are just left out.Overall the movie is not that bad.,Transformers - The Last Knight

It is like they came up with the plot in five seconds and then focused on action and explosions. Even worse the entire film made no sense and why Anthony Hopkins signed up for this bull crap i don't know. This film basically made no sense, had major plot holes and the actions scenes didn't make up for this failure of a movie. I even think that this film was worse than Birdemic when i come to think about it, and trust me that was a bad film. I would recommend that you don't waste your money on this piece of SH*T.

Then the movies got worse and worse. This new Transformers movie, just make me stop watching this series. Its the first time i switched off a transformers movie. Acting is bad, jokes are bad, story is very very bad. I think Michael bay targeted this movie for young children/teenagers, because the story is so cheesy, like he didn't had time to create a story, but just made something up while shooting this film.Megatron died like 3 times in the series, and now is back again without any story behind it. He just shows up as the semi bad guy. Also the little girl and her toyrobot, are very bad characters without any story behind them.

Any semblance of hope I had that Tranformers wouldn't be butchered further by this hack were dashed against the rocks again. Shame on me for having hope.I hope the actors, directors, and writers watch this movie and hate themselves for this disgusting cash-in. I hate myself for just paying them for this horrendous product of cinema because now they think audiences want more of this stinking feces.The story was rushed and all over the place is putting it nicely. The characters might as well have died for all I cared (and at times I hoped they did). The transformers had great graphics, but that's all they had. Only an under-developed mind like a young child could see this movie as anything other than just terrible.And leave it to Hollywood to make intelligent characters look like fools, poking fun at physics and inventors, but foreign academic liberal arts Doctor polo players in high society are so much more superior Mary Sues according to Michael Bay and his team of sell-outs.The only circumstances to watch this movie are if you're a masochist, you can see it for free, or you're being held hostage and they demand you watch ""Transformers: The Last Turd"" or face immediate execution.

864,zickzicky,"As the era comes, both robots and humans have evolved in the past few years with now all being endangered since the disappearance of Optimus Prime",2,28 September 2017,"Let me get this straight, Transformers 5, surprise they made a 5th sequel with now featuring King Arthur in the scene. Once again robots are invading as fast as possible with now a space aspect, and what's this? Our main hero has turned to the dark side? An interesting twist? Or just a gimmick?With the new movie starring Mark Wahlberg and Laura Haddock as the main stars of the show with Shia Labeouf not being around to enjoy the battle. As Mark plays the man of the show in this film portraying as your typical father figure. In addition with Laura Haddock as the Megan Fox on this new sequel which I would say she played a better character, with adding more intelligence and reasoning to the plot rather than going it with the flow.Now moving, what did the film did best and what did they do wrong? Well there's some to uncover. Starting off with the dialogue in the film where I would say it was too sloppy and simple with lack of depth, similar to how a elementary student would write. Next was how the story goes. Now it goes very fast like super quick in the first half which would lead to audiences being confused in the middle to understand what was even going on in the film. Lastly, additions to the drawbacks of the film would be about the CG and the cinematography of the film which seems like Michael was putting less effort every sequel with camera shots being too shaky and disturbing, less lighting on the main objects the movie was trying to focus on and the low quality CG he has did where I would admit he did a better job in the previous films.Now this movie was shot in IMAX as Michael has stated. Thinking of it seems cool right? Seeing a full movie being shot at its full potential? Well no, the mistake I would say he did was he mixed both regular shots with IMAX shots which most of the time changes the sizes of the screen as well as the quality of the images which was quite disturbing and distracting.Either way, the movie did have it's ups too. With now introducing a new plot with now focusing more on the planets rather than the robots themselves. With the addition of the new team with more diverse characters I see. And with every great action movie comes a great climactic battle scene.In conclusion, in my opinion, overall the total movie was a complete waste of time and money, but to the hard core transformers fans, Michael Bay fan boys or just couple of kids who thinks robots are cool. I'm not recommending it but it's worth for some good family laughs together.The movie was out on cinemas in 21 June, 2017 (USA)",Transformers - The Last Knight

I do not recommend anybody watching this, it shouldn't have more than one star, for the following reasons:1. Script: doesn't seem to exist, there are a lot of things that simply don't make sense, even after taking into account the sci-fi aspect. 2. Horrible camera action. 3. Scenes abruptly change, nothing connects, no transitions. 4. Disastrous acting. 5.

This movie really makes watchers sea sick or you get banned unnoticed, growing epileptic subtle illness.This is a way of directors to blur their incompetence of creating good quality shots. Trying to gather viewers attention with cheap and poor tricks. Throwing a bunch of unstructured impressions without real content into a humans brain, is just exploiting natural behavior, the brain cannot resist and creating an illusion of attraction.No wonder many kids these days have ADHD.

868,taylorshore-00931,"Overall, not my favorite and has to be one of the worst of its series.",3,2 November 2017,"Transformers: The Last Knight--An expected CatastropheThere are hopes for this film to be action packed with shocking fight scenes to make this sci-fi masterpiece with the lead role of Mark Wahlberg and the use of worldwide sets, but it falls short. The poor implementation of mythology--placing mechanical cars into history-- is incoherent and convoluted the plot, making this a relief that this is the last cinematic downfall of the franchise for Michael Bay.Although there were some great ideas, the film didn't put it into action well. It wasn't a big stretch to see a few mechanical dinosaurs in the previous film, Transformers: Age of Extinction. But for there to be a mechanized, fire breathing dragon that can be controlled by the Merlin with a magical staff is quite outrageous. The all new nemesis is Quintessa who is CGI created. She doesn't offer much threat or chilling fear which is exemplified when she says, ""I've been waiting for you, Optimus. Come meet your maker"":a rather very poorly designed villain which could have been easily created better. The film also suffers from the lack of returning characters such as Cade's daughter or her boyfriend. This leaves us with Mark Wahlberg, who has to carry the film through by himself, which he was unable to do in this film.Overall, no one seemed to care and was just another directionless film which led there to be no single great scene to remember the film by so I rate this 3 out of 10.",Transformers - The Last Knight

Of course if you assume the president is Trump, it would make sense ;) Anyway, a good explanation for this was missing.OK, maybe they see all Transformers as Enemies, but then they decided to work with Megatron the Transformers who already tried to destroy the earth more than once.At the end when they arrive at the alien ship the TRF guys decided for no reason to switch over to the ""good"" side and Cade is from one second to the next their friend. Why? And unfortunately we still have some really silly stuff in this movie, like when Cade and Vivien arrived at their house, going to the upper floor, searching for the magic wand, and it sounds like they having sex.My suggestion for the next installment, prevent not to do to many unexpected twists, or at least make them more logical and reasonable.Leave out the silly stuff, funny moments are OK, but not silly ones.",Transformers - The Last Knight

There are a lot of wasted potential but I still enjoyed it. It is a whole lot better than Revenge of the fallen but not the others. BUT! It turns out that Michael Bay has cut about 40 minutes of the movie out which was a bad mistake. Hence why the pacing, the action sequences and certain important scenes was cut out and it could have made the movie better.The robot characters have a lot personality and 40% of the movie focused on the robot cast which was an improvement.

The jokes are yet again bland and unfunny as ever especially the wimp black character as he was there crack up jokes that nobody can find the least bit funny. The whole subplot of Optimus Prime going evil did barely anything to progress the story and lasted for like what? 5 minutes? Despite the marketing telling it would play a huge roll in the film. The transfomers themselves also feel useless as ever, the most obvious one were the Deceptions, nearly every single one played no role other than just be use as canon fodder for the autobots to beat up and kill, the humans also feel bland and feel like a set back for the movie, especially for the girl Izabelle, whom in the trailer said to play a big role in the film despite doing NOTHING in the film of any importance, the fight between Optimus and Bee ended in such a anticlimactic way and the trailers literally showed everything about this fight.

It just didn't seem likethey decided what kind of movie they wanted it to be whether a gigantic robot death match, rom-com, etc. That caused the plot didn't make a lot of sense. In this installment I felt that Michawl Bay, the director, tried to do too much all at the same time. He tried to combine humor with romance with huge fighting robots and the result is a mess. The talent of many of the actors and actresses were wasted as well and most of them should've either never been cast or should've had a different role in my opinion. While I like Wahlberg I don't think he ever should've been cast in this movie, frankly I don't think he has the talent or charisma to pull it off. The talent of actors like Anthony Hopkins was wasted. While I like Jerrod Carmichael, he never should've been cast in this movie either, he was just funny at the wrong times. The humanoid robot thing in the movie also shouldn't have been included, I thought he was simply just awkward. Overall, I think they should've done a better job of tying this film to the Transformers comic books and TV shows, creating a plot that you could follow along and actually casts actors and actresses that have a reputation for carrying their own movies and have enough talent to play their roles correctly. I also think that if they actually based this movie off of a well-known Transformers story arc it would've been better. Those of us that were fans of the TV shows as well as the comics were thrown off by the way they tried to tie this into the greater Tranformers universe because it didn't make any sense and wasn't developed enough throughout the movie anyway.",Transformers - The Last Knight
