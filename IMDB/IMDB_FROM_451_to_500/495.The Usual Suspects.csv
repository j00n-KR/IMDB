0,MartinHafer,Well made...it just isn't the sort of film I particularly enjoy.,8,21 February 2013,"language a bit confusing during boat attack, where were cops? hard to like anyone in film""The Usual Suspects"" is a well-made film from start to finish and I do recommend you see it...maybe. Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, ""Good Fellas"" and ""The Fight Club"" are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like ""The Fight Club"" or ""The Crying Game"" and so I'll stop with that.The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then ""The Usual Suspects"" is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film! Seriously.",The Usual Suspects
1,TheLittleSongbird,Magnificent film that deserves to be re-watched over and over,10,12 June 2017,"As an avid cinephile, who watches a lot of films to help me to be distracted from the pressures of everyday life, old and new and of all genres (have never had a bias against any genre and never love older films and dismiss new films, or vice versa), 'The Usual Suspects' was one of the finest films personally seen in a while.Other films to have that effect on me (and garnered 10/10 ratings, a rare rating for me these days) are 'LA Confidential', 'Amores Perros', Orson Welles' version of 'The Trial', 'City of God' and 'The Song of Bernadette', though some films came close as well as re-watches of favourites like 'Se7en', 'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993) and 'The Remains of the Day'. Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Usual Suspects
2,bkoganbing,A Gang Formed During A Police Lineup,9,25 March 2009,"Five hoodlums are hauled into a police station in a dragnet roundup of The Usual Suspects that are brought in for questioning when something big breaks. Good chance any one or all could have been involved. If you remember in the film The Brink's Job, there is a scene where within a day a lot of Boston's known hoodlums are brought in for questioning. The dragnet brought in Stephen Baldwin, Bernicio DelToro, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak. From this motley crew a gang is born.Flash forward to several years later when there is a horrific fire on board a freighter where there has been a gun battle with many deaths. Kevin Spacey managed to survive along with two others of the freighter crew and is being questioned in the police station by US Customs Agent Chazz Palmenteri and LA cop Dan Hedaya.After a couple of other jobs, this crew winds up working for a criminal mastermind from the Balkans who is known as Keyser Sose who is known to be so ruthless that the criminal population itself is scared to death. This guy is spoken of like he was Satan himself and of course the police want him big time also.I can't say much more because the plotting of The Usual Suspects is so intricate and filled with unexpected twists that to spoil this film would be a crime itself. Some here like Stephen Baldwin give their best performances on screen. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar, this one in the Best Supporting Actor category. The category has me stumped because it's his character that's the key to the whole film. The other Oscar The Usual Suspects won was for Christopher McQuarrie for one highly original Screenplay.The Usual Suspects has enough action for those who crave that, especially when we do see the final battle on that freighter and it's also some highly literate dialog for those who appreciate that. It's best compared to that granddaddy of all caper films The Asphalt Jungle, it's that good.",The Usual Suspects
3,SnoopyStyle,Then comes the twist,10,6 January 2014,"Death and mayhem comes to the docks. The police picks up Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). In the interview, he recounts the events leading to the havoc at the docks. The crew meets at a sketchy line up after a truck robbery. They start working together until they are contacted by the mysterious Keyser Söze.This is densely packed crime drama. For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.The five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin. They are all acting at the top of their games. They needed to be great to sell this noir crime drama. This is one of the best.",The Usual Suspects
4,Hitchcoc,I'm Glad I Finally Got a Chance to See It,9,8 December 2009,"I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.",The Usual Suspects
5,Horst_In_Translation,Perfect example on how a twist makes the movie,6,20 September 2013,"After the fairly unknown ""Public Access"", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator/kidnapping scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser Söze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known to stand for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement.I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime stories are among your genre preferences.",The Usual Suspects
6,claudio_carvalho,Who is Keyser Söze?,9,10 December 2017,"After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos""",The Usual Suspects
7,kosmasp,More than usual,10,6 February 2021,"Another day, another rewatch. A classic in the thriller genre, with a cast that is exceptional. But also with a script that can be considered tight. It does hinge on something that actually is able to bring the whole house down. Considering what the aim was or one of the target in the movie, certain things seem to make not much sense.But suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride (and keep guessing where it's going) the first time around. After that you can watch it again (and again?) to see the clues and disect the movie in your head. Try to connect the dots and maybe understand what really went down .. then again, considering the premise and the twist, are we actually able to tell? You'll understand once you've seen it ... because it does leave a lot in the open. It does however also have lots of clash between characters and the spite they have for each other ... I won't go into detail, but there are certain convenient (timing wise) incidents. Just accept them and don't overthink them ...",The Usual Suspects
8,classicsoncall,"""One cannot be betrayed if one has no people"".",10,22 October 2011,"Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) knew he was smarter than Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), but didn't fully realize it until it was too late. That's the brilliance of ""The Usual Suspects"", a film with a twist ending that leaves you shaking your head and going 'Whoa! well past the finale. Here's how I see it - A lot of comments on this film revile it for being a story that never happened because of the reveal at the end. But that's not really the case. Following the opening scene, the picture flashes back to the police lineup that brought five petty hoods together. Well, three of them were petty; Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Verbal Kint are much more than they seem. The emerald heist of the NYPD 'taxi service' and the ripoff of jeweler Saul Berg were real enough events involving the resources of all five criminals to pull them off. Where the story really takes off is with the introduction of Kobayashi (Pete Postlewaithe). From about that point on, and only in retrospect, do we come to understand that Verbal's story telling skills are meant to obfuscate and defy credibility. He follows up with the legend of Keyser Soze, a mythical Hungarian no one has ever seen (except one Arturo Marquez), who's reputation for fierce vengeance has become as legendary as the man himself is ethereal.That Verbal Kint is a con man is unquestionable. He was pegged with a sixty two thousand dollar swindle at the NYPD lineup, enough to convince McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollack) that he was in their league, as long as he could convince Keaton to go along. With the disgraced ex-cop vouching for him, Kint was allowed to mastermind the 'blue and white' emerald heist without anyone getting killed. Then came his increased stature by finishing off Saul Berg during the second job. The idea that details like Redfoot, Kobayashi and the Argentinean drug deal were all made up doesn't detract from the fact that Verbal Kint/Keyser Soze had an agenda. That agenda, all the way at the bottom of the totem pole, was the murder of Arturo Marquez, a character mentioned but never seen, a character who might have known the real identity of Keyser Soze.So we know Verbal made up a lot of this stuff on the fly. But what about Kujan? In one moment, Kujan tells Verbal that Keaton was Keyser Soze, and a few sentences later says he doesn't know. Did he make up the story about Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) being killed? Who would have killed her, and for what reason? Most likely Kobayashi if Marquez could identify Soze. The one thing we can come away with is that Verbal Kint, besides being a fake, is a remorseless, relentless killer, who's con man gig is the ultimate con on movie viewers everywhere. Verbal Kint was Keyser Soze, but the blast of it is - there was NO Keyser Soze - and he's become one of the screen's most intriguing characters of all time.",The Usual Suspects
9,lee_eisenberg,The greatest trick the Devil ever played...,10,19 October 2005,"""The Usual Suspects"" made Kevin Spacey a household name, and rightfully so. One of the cleverest movies ever made, the ending is more than a shocker. The plot of course involves customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogating hoodlum Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) to try and find out what happened at a crime scene earlier. But this is no ordinary interrogation; what we find out here may be the end of normalcy as we know it. And I don't just mean what we find out about Keyser Soze (whether early on or at the end); this movie has more twists and turns than Lombard St. With perfect performances from Spacey and Palminteri - and from Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and Dan Hedaya - this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.Every time when I'm talking about this movie with someone, I start...well, doing what we find out about at the movie's end. You'll know it when you see it.",The Usual Suspects
10,jboothmillard,The Usual Suspects,8,23 September 2005,"I remember seeing this film once before, I obviously didn't understand it properly and only remember bits and pieces, so I was definitely up for seeing it again to judge it more efficiently, from director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns). Basically there was an explosion on the waterfront of New York, and criminal Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) was the only witness, and FBI Agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and U.S. Customs special agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) wants him to answer their questions about what happened. Through flashbacks Verbal, who suffers cerebral palsy, tells the story of how he and four other con-men were brought into custody as ""the usual suspects"" that could have carried out a truck hijack. In the lineup were former police police officer seemingly giving up crime, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), short-tempered professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), his partner Fred Fenster (Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro), hijacker Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal. None of the five men are found guilty of th crime after questioning, and afterwards to get some kind of revenge McManus convinces the others to take part in a robbery targeting the city's finest taxi service. After this they sell the loot in Los Angeles to Redfoot the Fence (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene), who talks them into doing another job, and even though Keaton said the previous one would be his last he agrees anyway. The robbery goes well despite the fact that it was heroin rather than money or jewels, and Redfoot reveals the job came from lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who the five thieves meet, he says that he works for Keyser Soze, a renowned but unseen criminal mastermind. Kobayashi blackmails them due to the fact that Soze has been associated with their crimes in the past, he wants them to attack a ship on the San Pedro harbour filled with cocaine. In the present Verbal tells about the legend of Keyser Soze, a criminal feared like the devil who apparently killed his own family when they were threatened, and who no-one has ever seen the face of. Back in flashback, Fenster was killed earlier on when he dropped out, and the four remaining criminals go ahead with this job on the docks, only to realise it is some kind of trap and they are killed one by one, with Verbal and Keaton the last two alive. Of course Verbal explains that he supposedly watched Keaton being shot and burned before the explosion by the mysterious and unseen stranger, possibly Soze, but the officers aren't sure he saw anything properly. Verbal seems to be upset that they believe Keaton is Keyser Soze and may still be out there, and with his bail posted they let Verbal go with his possessions, and he limps away. The ending however is the big bang, when the police officers are relaxing one gazes at the wall of newspaper and photo clippings in the room Kint was being interviewed, and he drops his mug realising everything the conman had been saying was built up around the various words and names on the wall, Verbal as well in seen with his limp disappearing and left arm restored, and diving away with ""Mr. Kobayashi"". The final quote of the film is a repeat of the words Verbal said to the police, and where we realise he really was Keyser Soze, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" ""And like that, he's gone."" Also starring Suzy Amis as Edie Finneran and Dan Hedaya as Sgt. Jeffrey 'Jeff' Rabin. All the performances are fantastic, including Byrne and Postlethwaite, but especially of course the mesmerising Spacey who was not a big star back at the time, only known for small roles like Glengarry Glen Ross, he deserved the Oscar, the story is clever with a witty script and some exciting gun play and explosive moments, a good old fashioned and engaging crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Verbal Kint was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",The Usual Suspects
11,rmax304823,Devil makes work for idle hands.,8,28 June 2005,"This is a well-made and ambitious crime thriller, nicely acted and directed, and with a most unexpected ending.I won't bother with the story since I'm sure it's been thoroughly described elsewhere.The construction is a little complicated. Kevin Spacey, a small-time con man, is telling his story of a band of thieves and murderers to an investigator, Chaz Palminteri. The are multiple flashbacks and the transition from the present to the past isn't obvious. What I mean is, you will not see the pages flapping on a desk calendar while harp arpeggios strum in the background. Instead, there are quick cuts back and forth, sometimes with a time and date at the bottom of the screen to help orient us, and it works. We're never confused about when or where we are.I must say, though, that the rules of film making have become a lot more, well -- relaxed over the years. Around 1950 Alfred Hitchcock was taken to task for including what critics called a ""lying flashback"" in ""Stage Fright."" They were bothered by the fact that Hitchcock used a flashback to illustrate a story being told by Richard Todd and part of the story was false, yet it still appeared in the flashback. Yes, film grammar has changed. Ain't it wonderful? When I said the movie was ambitious I meant that it seemed to strive for a significance greater than that provided by the exploits of a handful of losers. The mysterious villain may or may not be real. He is said to rule just about the entire criminal world. There is nothing he can't or won't do. The movie conjures up Professor Moriarty -- or Macavity the Cat at the least, the Napolean of crime. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled,"" says Spacey, ""was convincing us that he doesn't exist."" Do the ominous shadows cast over the plot by this invocation work? Yes, kind of. We get a sense of the hopelessness of trying to pit ourselves against an irresistible power. It also drains away some of the realism that so many cop movies fuss over. If we don't believe in an arch criminal running the dark universe, then it's hard to believe the plot of this movie. In paying attention to its loftier goals the movie lacks the down-to-earth and familiar quality of stories like ""L.A. Confidential."" But what the heck. It's a good movie. If it doesn't tell us too much about human nature it gives us characters we get to know a bit about, lots of colorful and well-handled action, and something of a sense of tragedy. Mephistopheles outlives everyone.",The Usual Suspects
12,Tweekums,What really happened?,10,27 July 2009,"This is one of the most gripping films I've seen, it is one of those films you have to watch again so that you can appreciate early events in the light of what is revealed later in the film. Even now that I've seen is several times I'm not 100% sure what is true and what is misdirection.The cast all do a great job, especially Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic ex-corrupt police officer Dean Keaton who is trying to go straight after a life of crime, Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Kobayashi and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled con artist who is explaining what happened to the authorities (and us) what may have happened in the run up to his arrest.The film opens in the aftermath of a battle on a boat in a harbour in Los Angeles, there are only two know survivors; Verbal and a badly burnt Hungarian. Dave Kujan, a US customs officer, is sure that Keaton masterminded the attack and has escaped so he interviews Verbal who has done a deal with the police and is soon to be released. Verbal tells a tale of how the group met up when they were all hauled in by the NYPD for a robbery and put in a line up together. There they plan a job to get back at the police before heading to LA to lie low and to fence their ill-gotten gains. Here they are approached by Kobayashi, a lawyer claiming to work for Keyser Soze, a mysterious character who strikes fear into the hearts of criminals even though none have actually met him. Kobayashi explains that they must do one job for Mr Soze. All this is told us by Verbal so we never really know if he is telling the truth, and if he is lying is it to protect himself, his friend Keaton or perhaps he is just making up a story for his own personal amusement while awaiting release.The story is brilliantly told and it is rightly considered a modern classic, if you haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend watching it... twice! Although even then you'll not fully understand what has happened.",The Usual Suspects
13,moonspinner55,"Interesting, engrossing, but might have benefited from a stronger cast",6,8 August 2007,"Five disparate men, crooks involved in a drug heist gone awry, have their story unraveled by the sole survivor of the mishap. Colorfully profane screenplay done a disservice by the rather lackluster cast (particularly Chazz Palminteri, who does nothing fresh playing a smug investigator, and Stephen Baldwin as a cocky cut-up). Similarly, the direction also takes a while to warm up, although Kevin Spacey overcomes the awkward handling and won a Supporting Actor Oscar. Spacey, who often strikes an indifferent presence on-screen, is eerily haughty here and almost removed from the surroundings, yet his actorly tics are colorful and he works his hypnotic eyes with quiet drive. The movie has intriguing passages and certainly improves as it continues, but the twisty finish is more outlandish than surprising, especially as you consider all that came before it. **1/2 from ****",The Usual Suspects
14,dbdumonteil,the American thriller of the nineties,10,12 December 2005,"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches ""the Usual Suspects"" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this ""coup de theatre"" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",The Usual Suspects
15,blanche-2,The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...,10,14 July 2008,"1995's beautifully structured ""The Usual Suspects"" is really a very simple story. One of only two survivors of a ship explosion (Kevin Spacey) tells a story to the police detective (Chazz Palminteri) in charge of the case about how five career criminals - the ""usual suspects"" - met in a lineup and wound up working for the man whose very name strikes terror into the hearts of men - Keyser Soze.As a result, two names were on everybody's lips for some months to come: Kevin Spacey and Keyser Soze.With a crackerjack script by Christopher Quarrie, great direction by Bryan Singer and terrific performances, The Usual Suspects couldn't miss. And it doesn't. Thirteen years later, I remember it as vividly as the day I saw it. I just saw it again, and it's as good as ever.Its other stars are the handsome Gabriel Byrne as Keaton, a bad cop who at one point faked his death to avoid criminal charges; and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, still a distance from stardom, Kevin Pollak, and Giancarlo Esposito as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's persuasive assistant.As a scared, not very bright gimpy man, Kevin Spacey is a knockout and well-deserving of his Oscar, his Golden Globe, his SAG Award, his New York Film Critics Award and all his other honors. The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter. The Usual Suspects is a modern classic.The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist...and then he's gone.",The Usual Suspects
16,Quinoa1984,"Good film, but over-rated from my perspective",6,8 December 2004,"Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a clever (if not too clever) film that showcases some good actors in a better than average cops and robbers movie. Unfortunately, Singer brings some flaws (not immense, after all, how would Christopher McQuarie win a Oscar for his screenplay is the film's flaws weren't immense). That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.Still, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for). Not bad Overall. B+",The Usual Suspects
17,sunwarrior13,Invites Multiple Viewings,10,17 January 2012,"Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, says, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different.The Usual Suspects is a neo-noir film written by Christopher McQuarrie and directed by Bryan Singer. It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey and Pete Postlethwaite.The film follows the interrogation of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a small-time con man who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and four other criminals to the boat, and of a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex.Expertly shot and edited, The Usual Suspects gives the audience a simple plot and then piles on layers of deceit, twists, and violence before pulling out the rug from underneath.A terrific cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in seductively slick fashion by director Bryan Singer.Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie's tough-guy dialogue gives the ensemble cast every opportunity to shine, and they do in this freshest, funniest and scariest crime thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction.This will definitely tempt the viewer to appreciate it for it stands up under and would definitely invite multiple viewings.",The Usual Suspects

Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.",10,9 May 2020,"The Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10",The Usual Suspects
20,Theo Robertson,Not Sure If I Understood It,7,25 September 2003,"!!!! MAJOR SPOILER !!!!I remember watching THE USUAL SUSPECTS for the first time and being totally convinced the ending had satanic/supernatural overtones with Verbal being able to walk properly because Keyser Soze was indeed the devil and his reward for keeping his mouth shut was the use of his leg , but in a later conversation with my brother in laws sister she told me the ending was the coventional non pre-destination/non supernatural ending of Verbal making up the events by reading the bulletin boards in the police office . I actually thought this might have been the ending after all but still clung to my own interpretation . It`s a very ambiguous ending and I don`t believe for a moment that Christopher McQuarrie meant the ending to be so open to interpretation which means it`s not as clever as is made out . I think THE USUAL SUSPECTS is rather over rated and doesn`t deserve to be number 17 on the IMDB top 250 list",The Usual Suspects

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It all started with five guys in a lineup,10,8 June 2009,"I knew the secret to this for years before I ever got a chance to watch it. That it was still immensely effective should provide an idea of how well-made this is. This was Singer and McQuarrie's second feature, together and at all, and they both do incredible in it. The direction is beyond reproach. The writing is spot-on, in all areas. The dialog, which is also well-delivered, the characters, all of them treated to perfect portrayals, and the plot, that develops impeccably. The acting is excellent, there's not a single performance that can particularly be criticized. Cinematography in this is gorgeous. The editing is sharp and marvelous. This is film-making at its finest. I understand the arguments for the twist of this being cheap, and thus the overall movie, undeserving of the praise it receives. I don't agree, however. As the ending unfolds before our eyes, the point of this becomes clear. Highly interesting use of the concept made famous on celluloid in Rashômon. A certain aspect of this, I don't know if it was intentional, or a sacrifice necessary by virtue of the fact that this was made in Hollywood, and for the mainstream crowd, but while it is unfortunate, you can't have everything. There is little to no visual sexuality, various disturbing content, some relatively mild violence and plenty of strong language. I recommend this to any fan of competent thrillers and/or any of the people behind it. 10/10",The Usual Suspects

It's the kind of movie that garners a cult following (which it has) and that's better enjoyed if you know nothing about it. There's a big surprise ending (one of the most famous in film history) that will spoil the film if you know it beforehand. In fact, I wonder if the film would hold up as well to a second viewing once you know what's coming.Received Academy Awards for its screenplay and for the performance of Kevin Spacey, before anyone realized that Spacey would just deliver the same sardonic performance in every movie he'd make from that point forward.Grade: A",The Usual Suspects

Note:Due to the two time periods that the films storyline takes place in,I am splitting the films plot into two parts.The plot: The past- Five petty New York criminals,who are each regularly chosen to stand in police line-ups decide to form a gang to get there own back on the cops.The first thing the gang does,is expose some very corrupt cops,who are accepting bribes from some very powerful criminals to be ""taxis"" for them,so all the criminals have police protection where ever they go.With their first plan having gone very successfully, (and also very richly,due to them stealing some cash from one of the criminals)one of the gang (Mcmanus) tells the others that they should take the stolen cash to LA,where a jewel thief that he is friends with lives.When they get to LA,the thief tricks them into robbing a ""jewel dealer"",who they discover,was actually a Heroin dealer. All of the gang do everything they can,to get the thief to reveal why he lied to them about the robbery.The thief says that he was not the one that wanted the Heroin stolen.Instead,he says the he was ordered to set up the robbery by a lawyer called Kobayashi.When they meet Kobayashi,he sends shivers down all their spines,when he tell them that he works for Keyser Soze.(Soze is a man known for being an almost mythical criminal,due to no one having seen his face for years and for a very infamous,disturbing story where,With his family being held at gunpoint by thugs,Keyser kills his family and the thugs,and then goes and every family member or friend that the thugs ever had.)They are then all told that,all of there so-called petty crimes actually damaged some of Keyser Sozes underground empire.This has,understandably,made Soze furious.Surprisingly,Kobayashi tell them that unless they steal millions of dollars worth of Cocaine from a cargo ship in an LA harbour,that Keyser Soze will kill every one that they care about.With only those two options,they all decide to go on Sozes suicide mission...The Present: Police officer Dave Kujan and agent Jack Baer are each separately investigating a massacre on a ship in an LA harbour,which has only left two survivors (though Kujan suspects that one of the gang members that boarded the ship,may have fled the scene early and could still be alive.) With one of the survivors (gang member Verbal Kint) being given a slap on the wrist fine for having a gun without a licenses,he has been given immunity by the police,since he has told them that he was one of the gang members who boarded the ship.Due to Dave Kujan only being allowed to keep Verbal in custody for two hours,Kujan realises that he has to do what ever he can to find out in those two hours what really happened on the ship with Verbal Kint and the rest of the gang... Meanwhile,unbeknown to Kujan,agent Jack Baer is at a local hospital with the only other survivor-a Hungarian man,who has suffered 60% burns all over his body.To the agents amazement,the man stars talking and,though he can hardly make out any of the words that the man is saying,the man suddenly yells out that he has ""Seen the face of the devil.""Baer quickly rushes to find a sketch artist,due to the man being the only known surviving person to have seen the face of Keyser Soze... View on the film:The star of the film,that kept me griped from the opening credits,to the now-famous ending was the screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie.Whilst most writers would have either given very big sign posts to let the viewer know which way the film is probably going to go or,have built a very weak-rushed story so they could quickly get to the big twist ending.McQuarrie cleverly makes sure that the film is not held down by the heavy-weight ending.This is done by Christopher spending a good amount of the film building up the story bit-by-bit,and by looking at most of the Usual Suspects characters backgrounds and current (troubled) situations (although I do feel that Benicio Del Toro is slightly under used in the film.)When looking at the film on a second viewing,I was extremely impressed by McQuarrire dropping tiny hints of the ending threw out the whole film.Which,on first viewing seem to be some very minor moments until you get to the end,when you realise that the ending has been scaring you right in the face the whole time! While most people praise the great performance by Gabriel Byrine and the shining A-List making performance by Kevin Spacey are,understandably praised.I feel that the excellent performance by Chazz Pacminteri as Dave Kujan is sadly over-looked.Pacminteri works as a great counter- point to Spaceys great Verbal Kint,with their fantastic interrogation scenes being some of the most gripping moments in the film. Something that I now find surprisingly easy to see,is that director Bryan Singer would go on to make the first two X-Men films.Singer shows how he is able to give all of the actors great moments in the film.Even though it was only his second film,it is very clear to see that at this point, Singer knew how to make an exceptional film with interesting characters and a very well-written story Final view on the film: A very intelligently written screenplay,with great tension building and a truly jaw-dropping ending,matched by amazing performances from a stunning ensemble and some very smart and gripping directing.",The Usual Suspects
28,AaronCapenBanner,Twist-Laden Story.,7,25 September 2013,"Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement.

He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong...Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about.

Five men are rounded for a line-up, and grilled about a truck hijacking. Least pleased is Keaton, a crooked cop - exposed, indicted, but now desperately trying to go straight. The cops won't leave him alone though, and as they wait for their lawyers to post bail, he is talked into doing one more job with the other four. All goes well until the influence of the legendary, seemingly omnipotent ""Keyser Soze"" is felt........There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece of a movie. It's easily one of the best films to be released in the nineties, and along with Shawshank, Leon, and Pulp Fiction, its in really good company, because whenever you mention one of the above films, you instantly think of the others.The film works so well because of the narrative between Kint and Kujan. Yes, the story is fascinating, but its Verbals narrative that constructs the way he story goes, it's his story, his narrative, his film if you would, hence 'Verbal'.When you watch this film for the fifth or sixth time, you begin to ask yourself, just how much of the actual story is true?, just how much exposition, and juxtaposition has he put into his story?All of the other characters are important to the story, but not necessarily the narrative, because the story doesn't have a clear path, because it's all Verbals version.The cast are wonderful, and it's really strange to see just how careers went after this. They are all career defining performances. Set pieces are terrific, but Verbals story of Keyser Soze still gives me goosebumps, Spaceys delivery of that speech is one of the most perfect pieces of acting I've ever seen.Harking back to noir movies of the forties, the film is an exceptional piece of cinema, and whoever thinks they know who Keyser is, it's perfectly clear that Verbal was the one with brains....",The Usual Suspects
30,Wuchakk,Who IS Keyser Söze? Who freakin' cares?,4,29 November 2016,"Released in 1995 and directed by Bryan Singer, ""The Usual Suspects"" is a crime drama/mystery about five thugs who decide to team up and get revenge on the police (Keven Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Baldwin, Keven Pollak and Benicio Del Toro). After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Söze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and he's interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Söze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Söze's right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs. This is a ""twist ending"" flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just ""wait for the twist,"" it isn't actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey's character is somewhat interesting. As such, it's next to impossible to care about them. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn't really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I'm not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren't worth it. The film didn't make me care enough to watch again. Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination. And, for me, the convoluted journey in ""The Usual Suspects"" is just dull and laborious. If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but that's not the case. Then there's something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing 'hip' tough-tawkin' hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign. I can't believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; the movie's seriously overrated.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City. GRADE: C-***SPOILER ALERT***I want to emphasize that this review does not criticize the film based on pretending to ""know the twist all along"" (as stated above, I was able to figure out who the mystery man likely was, but not the other details). The problem is that the entire movie is based around listening to a guy make up a bunch of stuff. Gee, so all we really know is there was a ship that got torched and Kevin Spacey's character doesn't really have a limp. Okay, thanks for wasting my time with everything else. Great storytelling (rolling my eyes).",The Usual Suspects

Would a person today be able to see it coming? Not sure, but no question does the movie still hold up. It's a playful exercise in misdirection with the novel camera tricks, jumbled narratives and central burning question: ""Who is Keyser Söze?""

Flash forward to the next day. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palimenteri) is forcing a statement out of the only surviver of the explosion, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, in the role that made him a star). Verbal recalls the last few weeks to Dave, who listens intently.We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control. He makes them steal drugs off a docked ship, and as we see in the beginning, the men all die save Verbal. Hmm, who could Keizer Soze be? How did all the people die? Who is Lara Croft? Oops, wrong tagline.""The Usual Suspects"" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow. The ending, though surprising, doesn't really click together as well as some other films with surprises. I wasn't confused by the ending, I understood it, I just thought it was a bit shallow compared to some other flicks.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!In the end we find out Kevin Spacey is Keizer Soze...I think...or is he Soze's henchman? Or is Soze just a legend? It's open to debate. But what makes it a bit more shallow from other films is that Verbal Kint is the one who tells this long story to Dave Kujan, and assumably he made most of it up because he was the criminal all along and had to cover himself up...so there's no real ""wow!"" element. If Verbal made up the story and turns out to be the man behind the killings, well, it's just a bit shallow as compared to some other films. We are expected to be amazed that he is Soze, but if the tale he told Kujan and us was for the most part a lie, then the fact that he was Soze all along isn't quite as amazing...umm...do you understand what I'm saying?But I'm not saying I dislike this movie. In fact, that's far from it. I really enjoyed this flick. It's terrific. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Spacey, who won an Oscar for his role. Even Stephen Baldwin was good in this movie!""The Usual Suspects"" is a lot like ""Basic,"" a film starring John Travolta. There are a lot of plot twists, but the duration of the film is a bunch of lies, and many of the ""twists"" don't make sense, and are there simply to confuse the audience into thinking something else. Behind all the gloss there isn't a whole lot there. But ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film, and though the end is slightly shallow, and the duration of the film is an excuse for the ending, it's still surprising and effective. And unlike ""Basic"" which dragged on for over two hours, ""The Usual Suspects"" knows when to stop its banter and get to the point.Effective film-making, but slightly overrated and shallow.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",The Usual Suspects
36,KineticSeoul,Smart and clever mystery crime thriller,8,22 July 2016,"After watching ""Reservoir Dogs"" I could slightly tell the similarities between this film. Although their maybe a lot of people that may disagree, I thought it was slightly similar. This is a cool and clever, film that build suspense and interest as it goes. This is more of a mystery movie, but it's not a mystery movie where the audiences will try to piece together all the puzzle pieces. Instead it's a intricately woven mystery crime thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. Maybe because of the multilayered direction, the really well done editing and clever storytelling. So the story is told from Roger ""Verbal"" Kint about what went down on the before, during the ship heist. With him and his dysfunctional and yet effective crew getting set up for a task and how they went about it. And what the motives of each of the crew members were and so on. The lighting and camera work was also really good and it felt like you were following the heist crew and following through with the process to a slight degree. Bryan Singer started making this movie at the age of 27 and to craft a clever and smart movie at that age and got the resources and cast together is one heck of a accomplishment.

I don't mind complicated plot lines when they add to a coherent story, but this story simply wasn't that coherent.

There are then so many twists and turns and so many different angles introduced that I found I simply didn't have the energy to keep up with it all.Now, most of the cast (most importantly Kevin Spacey as Kint and Gabriel Byrne as Keaton) did a decent enough job on this. They took it seriously; they were believable in their roles. I just honestly felt that those who came up with the story were trying too hard to keep the viewers off balance, with no idea what was coming next, and to do that they came up with a plot that really just didn't flow all that well.As far as I could see, the greatest strength of the movie came in the last 10 minutes, when the ongoing mystery about the truth about Keyser Soze was finally revealed. (Yes - it does get revealed eventually.) I was glad of this, because it was the one point of an overly-complicated plot that kept me interested. Was this guy real, or was he in fact a piece of fiction? I was glad to see that resolved - and, no, I didn't see the ultimate resolution coming. So, credit for that ending, but the movie as a whole just didn't strike home with me. (4/10)",The Usual Suspects
38,sol1218,Making a simple plan complicated doesn't make one brilliant,7,7 April 2004,"******SPOILERS****** Highly overdone movie about a mass killing in a shoot-out and explosion of a ship docked at San Pedro Harbor with connections to a notorious Hungarian drug gang. As well as a crew of hoods recruited out of NYC who tried to rip the gang off of the 91 million dollars of coke on the ship. Added to that a mysterious mob kingpin who set up the whole operation, for very personal reasons, to use as cover for him to knock off a witness on the ship that was to be turned over by the gang to the FBI as a witness against him that could land the mob kingpin behind bars for life. All this is seen in flashback, at the San Pedro Police Station, with Special US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, Chazz Palmintri, interviewing Roger Verbal (Kevin Spacey),the only survivor of this holocaust, for what seems like the time you would have sat through an old movie triple-feature with cartoons newsreels and coming attractions added on. We're bombarded by Verbal's story that goes on endlessly about how he and his fellow hoods were recruited by Mr. Kobayashi, Pete Postiethwaite, back in New York City some six weeks earlier to do a job for the mysterious Kayser Soze (?) ,whom they are told by Kobayashi that they are in debt to. Verbal goes on endlessly talking about this very strange and confusing plan that the Kayser concocted which in the end turns out to be an elaborate hit, by himself, of a protected government witness. You would think if this Kayser Soze was as smart as the movie makes him out to be why didn't he or his mouthpiece, Kabayashi, tell these hoods just to knock off the witness instead of having all this killing going on at the San Pedro Harbor as well as all over the country with all of them ending up dead except Verbal? And even more important why did he, The Kayser, have to kill the witness himself leaving himself open to being killed or captured by the Hungarian drug gang as well as the recruited hoods themselves if they ever found out who he was, and what he was planing for them, or the police? Another thing that doesn't make sense about the movie ""The Usual Suspects"" is that this Kayser Soze who is so unknown and secretive even to his fellow mobsters, it seemed that only Mr. Kobayashi knew just who he was, would be that well known by the FBI or local police to be identified and arrested? And who would their protected witness know who to finger if this Kayser Soze was so unidentifiable? What was so important about this person that the Kayser was dealing with, and wanted to knock off, that he would reveal his real identity and place of residents to him where he would blow the cover that he so painstakingly built up over the years? Was this individual involved in preparing the Kysers Federal and State Income Tax returns? Even at the end of the film when it was finally revealed just who the Kyser was you still didn't really know who he was since he was using an allies just like the name Kayser Soze itself obviously was. And even if the FBI and local police really knew who he was and where he was and went to arrest him would the murderous and cunning Kayser Soze just stay there and let himself be taken into custody? With all the avenues of escape and control with his mob's vast resources available to him? The ending of the movie shocked you only because it seemed to make sense at the time that you were exposed to it but after getting over the shock and realizing just how irrational it was, as well as the whole film, you began to see that's all it really was: An end to the movie.",The Usual Suspects

i watched this when it first came out, before i was ready to. and all i remember is the ending. i feel like that was the primary driver for this movie so knowing it took a lot away from enjoying a movie that i felt like i was watching for the first time. i gave it a half star bump up for that",The Usual Suspects
40,Robert_duder,The character actors ultimate epic...sure to become a classic of cinema,8,10 September 2006,"The Usual Suspects ironically calls itself that and casts itself with some of Hollywood's biggest recognizable character actors. What is a character actor exactly?? Is that truly another word for an actor who doesn't make it as a leading man or woman?? NO. I don't think so at all. A character actor is a very versatile actor who takes on a mix of roles and appears in many, many film after film popping up everywhere. Sometimes they may get a lead role, sometimes not but they don't need to be at the top of the credits to make an appearance and they play important and significant roles and get many more parts than other actors. The Usual Suspects is jammed full of these character actors led of course by the incomparable Kevin Spacey who I must say has become much, much more of a leading man now than a character actor but at the time he was the best at playing these offbeat roles. The Usual Suspects is not exactly a brain science of a film, it doesn't really offer anything incredibly unique to the ""heist"" genre of films, it's almost stereotypical and yet it has this feel, it has this quality about it that makes it an unmistakable classic. I expected from what I heard of it that it would be gritty, violent, bloody, horrifying and it is gritty but everything else kind of just fits in with most films but it still has that unmistakable must see quality.Oscar Winner for this role Kevin Spacey plays Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a talkative man with a limp who is known on the street for his elaborate cons. Spacey is brilliant and psychotic and watchable and nearly lovable as Kint. This is one of his best roles and he deserved that Oscar hands down. He does a terrific job in this role. Verbal Kint goes down as a memorable character in film history. Gabriel Byrne, who I've always enjoyed in his roles plays self appointed leader of the Suspects Dean Keaton, a man trying to go clean from his criminal ways. Byrne really doesn't have great range as an actor, most of his roles are very similar but he still has a certain presence on screen and he demands attention and comes across very powerful. Benicio Del Toro plays a smaller yet definitive role as Fred Fenster, a fast talking mumbler that provides the small bit of comic relief to the film. He does well in his quite small part. Stephen Baldwin plays hot headed Michael McManus and I'm surprised this part didn't mainstream him more for big films because he has the star quality and his performance is noteworthy in this film. Kevin Pollak who has done some great work plays Todd Hockney and is kind of back seat to Byrne and Spacey but his performance is also well rounded. Chazz Palminteri does a great job playing ""bad cop"" Dave Kujan who spends the entire film interrogating Spacey and their chemistry and banter is very well done. Brilliant character actor Dan Hedaya plays the ""good cop"" half as the other cop interrogating him and although he doesn't get a lot of screen time he performs his usual great role. And finally but notably Pete Postlethwaite plays Kobayashi, a liaison between the suspects and big time mythic crime lord Kyzer Soze. He is always a pleasure on screen in small but pertinent roles and I was happy to see him. He has a dark air about him perfect for the part.Bryan Singer is a brilliant director there is no doubt about it. He seems to have a way of bringing out the human in every film. He made the Xmen come to life and more recently created a whole new Superman for a new generation no matter how it was received it had the Singer touch and this is very different for what he has done recently but it still has his stamp of reality on it. The whole story boils down to tracking the mysterious and deadly Kyzer Soze through a crime spree involving assassinating a witness who can identify him. It's an ensemble cast of men without egos and it works so incredibly well from the opening scene and very famous line up to the closing twist of an ending. Now I admit I did kind of figure out the ending so it didn't really come as a shock like it should have, I think they make it far more evident than they needed to but it doesn't diminish the quality of the plot or story. It's an action crime thriller that will most certainly be a classic if it is not already. At best you must watch these to see some truly under-rated actors work brilliantly and to see a dark gritty tale that keeps you entertained until the very last minute. A SOLID 8.5/10!",The Usual Suspects
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,It's true what they say- you'll have to see this film at least twice to completely understand it,10,23 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A group of known criminals are rounded up for a police line up in a rather unusual fashion. As their lawyers wait to post bail, they agree to pull off another job together. Told in flashback, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) a crippled, informed member of the group recounts to a hard-pressing customs officer (Chazz Palmenteri) how the others were killed and the possible involvement of the mysterious, mythical 'Keyser Soze.' I decided I'd been a film connoisseur far too long to have not seen or reviewed this extremely critically acclaimed work. And last night (after a failed recording on Sky Movies a few weeks back!) my dream finally came true. Back when it originally came out, I guess you could say I had a sort of different slant on what made a film appeal to me, but now I am far more eager to seek out and review far more acclaimed work such as this.Shot in just, I think it was 30 days?!?, like Reservoir Dogs, this was a low budget production with a shining concept behind it to ultimately make it stand out more than any of the summer blockbusters that had been released shortly before it. It's a fairly simple story (not really high-concept in any way) that could have had a really simple delivery, but the film cleverly twists and turns it into another one of those ones where you have to pay attention to everything that is being said and inferred. It's probably one of the most impressive efforts of such a film I've seen, in as much as I only saw it last night and, yep, like other critics before me said I would, I still think I need a repeat viewing just to have another go at trying to make sense of it all.Like RD, this film head-billed a group of debut/small-time actors and sent their respective fortunes spiralling either way. Benicio Del Toro went from strength to strength, whilst Spacey would go on to achieve Hollywood gold status. On the other hand, Gabriel Byrne still only enjoyed co-starring appearances in various films, whilst Stephen Baldwin just plopped back into mediocrity and the other guy (says it all that I can't even remember his name!), well, I think I saw him working in Tescos the other week (Hollywood can be so cruel...) Also, like RD, the film made a name of it's director, Bryan Singer, who would go on to enjoy further success with the X-Men films.Occasionally, just occasionally, I think Hollywood needs films like this to pop up and flush a load of new talent on the screen. I'm certainly glad I finally saw it and look forward to a (possible) second viewing tonight. *****",The Usual Suspects
42,ElMaruecan82,A Masterpiece of Manipulation ...,10,24 August 2011,"Approaching ""The Usual Suspects"" as a mystery thriller with an iconic ending disregards the real matter that cemented its greatness: the script. ""The Usual Suspects"", more than any film, is a masterpiece of effective manipulation on which the final twist is only the icing on a rather delicious cake.I'm inclined to believe that most of the fans realized the magnitude of ""The Usual Suspects"" on TV, VHS or DVD rather than in a movie theater. The movie has a fair share of thrills and action but is richer in terms of plot, subplots, and sub-subplots and demands more than one viewing. Although I catch one or two subtleties every once in a while, I think I got now 99% enough to consider myself a true fan of the film, and again, this is not just because of the finale.""The Usual Suspects"" is like a modern ""Rashomon"" in the way it plays back and forth with flashbacks through an interrogation between a police officer, David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a dim-witted cripple and the only survival of a harbor massacre. This is the mystery the movie opens with, as the game consists on finding out the 'why' and the 'how' lying beneath a bloody killing that killed everyone for 91 million dollars worth of an inexistent dope. And progressively, the mystery deviates to a more harrowing 'who' question, incarnated by the haunting presence of a criminal mastermind, named Keyser Soze, a human devil whose identity remains secret. The film puts us in Kujan's shoes, he who pretends to be the smarter, still, both Kujan and us, take Kint's words for granted until we're fooled by the shocking finale, but again, everything is in the build-up.The build up is why the comparison with ""Rashomon"" takes its full significance. Kurosawa's masterpiece didn't just pave the way for non-linear narrative films, it was also revolutionary through the introduction of subjective narration, inviting us not to believe in everything we see from a character's point of view. Not that most of what Kint reveals is a lie, but what Kujan will believe won't be necessarily the truth. This is manipulation at its best, to make you believe something from your own thinking, by still respecting your intelligence. And this is the irony of the film, while we expect a twist, we're never discussing the veracity of what is said, it's like approaching the virtual core of the truth without never touching the inner verity. This is why the ending is literally spectacular; we're literally blinded by the unbearable truth's light. But this effect wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for what preceded.As a reference to the iconic line from ""Casablanca"", the usual suspects are five criminals joined in the famous line-up for a mysterious truck robbery. What strikes the most is that they are criminals of higher caliber, when in general; you've got one tough guy and just some bums put there as fillers. There were obviously lined up for another reason, a mission for Keyser Soze, the criminal whose reputation exceeds the limit of believability, a myth, a spook story? His absence is as chilling as his presence anyway. And there was absolutely no way for them to refuse, the tightly written script leaves no plot holes, only stuff left to interpretation, but for the rest, and every single detail, every line or look on a face, makes perfect sense. It's an elaborate puzzle where you can get the final image until the last piece and nothing can match the first time you experience the film, and not just the ending.And the greatness is that the build-up of Keyser Soze's character contributes to show him as man so evil, and so present, that his non-existence would be unacceptable if not implausible. He's here, and he's surely one of the usual suspects, and since we feel we're being tricked, we ought to think, maybe Keyser is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) or this Kobayashi lawyer (Pete Postelwhaite) or who the hell knows, maybe Kujan. It's not thrown in our face, we really try to believe this and when Kujan releases Kint, whatever the truth is, we feel like any coming twist must be both convincing and spectacular. Well, the wall board was probably one of the greatest cinematic revelations ever, getting us the final piece of the puzzle as we understand how Kint used the wall to insert some realistic details in his story. We got the final move of a psychological chess game, an extraordinary manipulation highlighted by the succession of quotes in voice-over in a masterstroke of sound editing sublimated by a perfect music and a revelation reaching its pinnacle on the sidewalk. Check-mate. When the movie ends, we realize what came before really needs a second viewing.And besides the writing and the editing, there are the little details you re-discover. When Kint is looking earlier at the wall, he looks dumbly detached but the second time you realize that he's building his story. When Kujan drinks coffee, you can see Kint glancing at the bottom of the mug, and you know how he got the Kobayahshi's name from. The details are also in these little something that made the movie so human, the hilarious line up is genuinely authentic, , it's not a movie with big-stars names, but the casting convey the feeling of underdog criminals with no small roles, hell, even Benicio Del Toro, who plays a minor character found the perfect note to make him memorable.Still, Kevin Spacey outperforms everyone as the character you stop looking at him the same way after each viewing. If not the greatest, he's certainly one of the most fascinating villains of cinema's history, whose shining moment is the last minute where in one look, he metamorphoses.Well, I guess the ending of the film is a big part of its greatness after all",The Usual Suspects
43,paul2001sw-1,Unusually good,8,7 October 2003,"Brian Singer's thriller tells a slick, ridiculous but hugely entertaining yarn, with a postmodern twist: much of its shock value deriving from confounding the expectations of the audience rather than from the innate properties of the story.  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal Kint, the man with a tale to tell the police; and the film as a whole is sharp and concise, leaving the viewer with an appetite for more.But in spite of this, the film is good, rather than great.  There are holes in the plot, and the essential device is actually a breach of the universal contract between the movie-goer and the the film-maker: the only way to avoid being suckered would be to adopt a scepticism so thorough-going that it would be impossible to enjoy this (or indeed any other) fictional tale. Neither of these things really matter, but what is more of a problem is the nugatory quality of what results: instead of delighting us with alternative realities, the film destroys its own premise without putting anything concrete in its place, as if it has no purpose beyond teasing.  Teasing, however, is something it does extraordinarily well.  In conclusion, 'The Usual Suspects' is a superior work of contemporary entertainment; but too empty to be rated a masterpiece.",The Usual Suspects

I really do not think so, but it comes close.This story is about a guy named Verbal Kint who is interrogated by a federal agent and he tells the story about how some mob boss commissioned him and four others to do a job and also about the massacre upon a boat.This movie has relatively unknown actors. Kevin Spacey was the guy I recognized the most and he did a really fantastic job. The rest of the cast gave convincing performances including Gabriel Byrne and the late Pete Postlethwaite.This movie is known for the twist ending. I did not expect that to happen at all. The movie really did a good job keeping you in suspense.Now this movie is somewhat overrated. I was lost a few times in the story and I thought the screenplay could have been better.

49,The-Sarkologist,A extraordinary crime thriller that will leave you speechless,9,27 December 2013,"My first comment is that if you have not seen this movie, stop reading now and go and watch it. It is phenomenal the first time you see it. Do not read any more as what I write will give away too much of the plot.My friend's comment about this movie was that when he saw it in the cinema, at the end everybody left in dead silence. The ending of it so shocked them that there was literally nothing to say. The Usual Suspects is a movie with a brilliant twist and flows constantly through to the end. On TV it sucks because you simply lose the flow of the movie as the adds interrupt it.It is impossible to describe the plot without giving too much away, so I will simply say what happens at the beginning and a few other things about the themes in the movie. It is not a thematically deep movie, but it is one that the characters work well and the plot is very well constructed.It begins with an explosion on the LA waterfront and lots of corpses are dragged out of the water. One man, a cripple, is found alive and is taken in for questioning, but he has to be released due to some immunity he has. Anyway, the story is told through the mouth of this cripple, and seems legit.It begins with the hijacking of a truck in Queens and five people - the usual suspects, are brought in for questioning. Of course they have nothing on them and their lawyer forces the police to release them. Angered at the police's treatment of them, they decide to bust open a conspiracy where the police offer taxi services to criminals.One of the lines in this movie shows the idea that once somebody is a criminal, they are always a criminal. It is the line that says, ""you get to a point where you no longer have any rights - no matter how you try to live a straight life, they will always come after you to pin something on you."" This is the story of Dean Keaton. He was a cop who went corrupt but now is trying to make good with his life. Unfortunately the cops won't let him do that. Not only will the police not leave him alone, but when he tries to make good, his past always comes back.The police believe that Keaton is not just a bad guy, but the bad guy. They are so obsessed with making sure that Keaton is dead that they completely miss the real person whom they are looking for and this person simply walks right out from under their noses while they try to force them to admit that it was all Keaton's fault.Another theme is that we are never truly free - there is always somebody that is in control, and not only that but what ever we do always affects somebody, and in some cases somebody whom we don't even realise. All of the suspects in the movie did something that upset the wrong person, and they did not even intend on upsetting him, they simply did not think about their actions.Finally there is a somewhat relative message in this movie. On one hand, things are not always what they seem, but on the other side, the truth is really only somebody's subjective interpretation of events. Even then, we can generally not accept what people say because there is always a subjective intention behind it.The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie. It is not as good the second time round as you already know what will happen, but for the first time, it is simply leave you speechless.",The Usual Suspects
50,briancham1994,Relies too much on its twist,6,23 April 2021,"The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film.",The Usual Suspects
51,tomgillespie2002,"Riveting stuff, even after its umpteenth viewing",8,17 May 2014,"Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.After what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).While the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.The now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Usual Suspects

54,Dr_Coulardeau,"Never believe appearances, or how you can fool the police",9,12 July 2008,"It is not a recent film, indeed. The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a bogeyman under the bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this bogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, suspicious, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The Usual Suspects

Check This Film Out!,9,11 March 2017,"Before I offer any analysis of ""The Usual Suspects"", I would first like to say that (as is well know by now) the film has perhaps the most mind-blowing ending in the history of American Cinema. I have long been a fan of movies with endings that are shockers (The Sixth Sense and The Others stand out as favorites), but this movie took it to an entirely new level.I won't give away the ending here, but I will say that this film follows a narrative pattern such that guessing the ""big reveal"" is difficult, as information is revealed in flashbacks, thus getting more complex as the story continues. However, many other Amazon reviewers have said that, after repeated viewings (I have only seen the film once), it IS possible to somewhat predict what is going to happen.I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I knew I was not a fan of gangster/crime films, so I was a bit leery. However, the story is so expertly crafted that one (myself included!) completely forgets that the main characters are criminals and instead focuses on the plot twists and turns.So, I would highly recommend this film to two categories of viewers: First, those of you like me who have never seen this classic film until ""now"" and are wondering what all the buzz is about, you won't be disappointed. Second, those of you who love surprise endings (even if you aren't too keep on cop/police dramas) will obsess over this film for weeks or months after viewing!",The Usual Suspects
56,johnnyboyz,Quite ingenious crime film that lets you in and then doesn't give you so much as a sniff unless you can spot all the visual clues and then some more.,10,21 July 2008,"Only a film as cryptic as The Usual Suspects could keep you coming back for more and more. A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around. The mere fact the ending and whole idea has featured in these other texts only confirms The Usual Suspects' cult status and is really just an appreciation or 'acceptance' that it is truly a fantastic film.The film is an all over the place (in the nicest possible way), crime drenched neo-noir which cuts back and forth from police station to detective trying to get to the bottom of a supposed drug deal gone wrong on one equilibrium; but also to the flashbacks which are the making of the drug deal on another equilibrium. The film sees visual references, audio references, what characters do as well as general dialogue drop hints as to what is coming and what the truth really is  hell; in one instance, where a certain character looks is an important clue. But The Usual Suspects is more than a series of tricks and gimmicks masquerading under a decent cast and a well shot, well lit crime saga. It is a journey into a world of the detective; it is a race against time and it is a non-linear crime saga revolving around organised crime, criminals and drug lords.I have to admit that I didn't fully understand the film first time I saw it, but with the added aid of research and DVD extras, The Usual Suspects quickly became one of my favourite films in terms of atmosphere, narrative and the general pacing of the story being unfolded. The film also carries a certain air of manipulation and ambiguity in its presentation, forcing us to think one thing; forcing us to recognise with seemingly the most unnecessary things imaginable: the way a certain character speaks nearer the beginning; the direction a certain character looks and what they're looking at as well as what certain characters are telling other characters and how they're reacting to it despite the fact we've already seen it.If it all sounds complicated then that's because it is, but that's the beauty of the film when it comes to multiple viewings. Everything is set up in a fast and urgent manner after a more sedate and much more calmer opening in which the aftermath of a shoot out on a boat introduces the prologue to the main strand of the film: an interrogation (or a 'friendly chat' according to the interrogating police man) between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and the officer, David Kujan (Palminteri). The brilliance in the delivery of Kint's story to Kujan lies in its parallel placing with the scenes revolving around the rounding up of the criminals which culminates in that famous line up shot; the developing of their friendship/hatred; the jobs that they do for a mysterious figure known as Redfoot (Greene) and the situation they all find themselves in once crime king Keyser Söze (can't put actor's name in brackets) catches up with them.If we look at how the criminals consisting of McManus (Baldwin); Keaton (Byrne); Fenster (del Toro); Hockney (Pollak) and Kint are rounded up in the first place, we can see that out of all the arrests Keaton's is given the most dramatic and most coveted. When he is arrested, he is in an expensive restaurant indulging in a rich conversation as opposed to the others whom are crudely rounded up on street corners and in garages. From here Keaton is made to look, perhaps not the most criminal, but certainly the most intelligent of the band but the rest of them are petty criminals or in Kint's case, crippled. This immediately places a higher opinion on Keaton in our minds and already, the film is attempting to brainwash us with its 'who's who'. The extensive dialogue later on constantly keeping Keaton in the dark as to who he could really be helps maintain this doubt as does his scrachy background and his failure to get a business empire off the ground.Then there is the manipulation of the supporting characters. I mentioned Redfoot being mysterious, something the film establishes with eerie music as his car rolls up to the gang. They meet amongst some odd looking Japanese mise-en-scene definitely un-associated with the location they're currently in: Los Angles, further adding to the bizarre and somewhat surreal nature of both the scene and the film. But there are several incidences where what you think was right, indeed wasn't and as the film develops things become increasingly dramatic culminating in a scene involving a notice board that still chills me even after so many viewings. Quite simply; The Usual Suspects is a smart and engaging film, the likes of which can be revisited time and time again.",The Usual Suspects

59,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The very definition of a movie you have to watch twice,9,2 December 2008,"""The Usual Suspects"" starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into an almost classic mystery. It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery. I've seen the film twice, but years apart, so my insight into the tremendous cinematic achievement of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie is there but limited.""Suspects"" is derived from a concept of a line-up of hardened criminals who have been brought in not with any evidence, but just because they are ""the usual suspects."" Their union, however, soon finds them all on a job that ends up with a giant boat explosion and only two survivors, one of them being only one of the criminals, ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey) a constantly rambling cripple who must explain the entire situation to the police. The story is told almost entirely from Kint's perspective, which already adds a shade of suspicion to the plot.The film lines up in strong cast with Spacey including Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Toro and Chazz Palminteri. Their characters, especially the criminals, all add an interesting dynamic to the film, keeping all the scenes interesting when the greater mystery is really the film's greatest asset.McQuarrie has lined the script full of gems so carefully that when he unloads one of the best twist endings in cinematic history, you are slapped across the face and filled with absolute glee. There's no other way to put it. Credit for this also should go to Singer and Spacey. There's no question that Singer's direction keeps up the intensity. It romanticizes the criminal lifestyle a bit, but it's necessary. Spacey's incredible portrayal of Kint, not only in his mannerisms but in his dramatic highs and lows keeps the storytelling engaging too.You simply have to watch this film and then watch it again. Then you will unquestionably like it to some degree. If you need a heavy dose of action in all your crime films, that degree will be lesser. This movie does rely heavily on script and character to keep your attention. However, as far as pure mystery goes, you can't beat ""The Usual Suspects.""",The Usual Suspects

61,Anonymous_Maxine,Best crime movie. Ever.,10,2 April 2001,"(spoilers) The Usual Suspects is one of those rare movies that comes along and takes advantage of all of the expectations that audiences develop as a result of an overabundance of formula films. One of the things that really sets The Usual Suspects apart from other crime films is that it has an excellent story, but it is also very uniquely presented. The whole film is told in a series of flashbacks by Verbal Kint, performed flawlessly by Kevin Spacey. The script has the rare quality of being extremely intricate but also very involving, you never get lost despite the tremendous amount of detail that the story has.(spoilers) Benecio Del Toro shows up in one of his earlier roles as Fred Fenster, the character that, as Brad Pitt has stated, makes it okay to be incomprehensible (Fenster influenced Pitt's performance in the excellent film Snatch). Gabriel Byrne is the perfect actor to play the part of Dean Keaton, the usual suspect who doesn't quite fit in with the rest and who is temporarily revealed to be the fearful Keyser Sosey. Stephen Baldwin makes a good criminal, and his performance is very effective. And Kevin Pollack did a very good job as well.  On a trivial point, you'll notice that Keaton's hotel room in The Usual Suspects is the same room that was used as Quentin Tarantino's hotel room in the hilarious black comedy, Four Rooms.The ending of The Usual Suspects has become known to be one of the best endings to a film in years, especially because of the shock value. Not only is it entirely unexpected, but it also reveals the ingenuity of the script, especially when we realize that Verbal fabricated the entire story, using names and locations that he simply read off of the wall in the room of the police station where he was interrogated. This ending has become famous enough to be re-created in a number of spoof movies. It was very amusingly done in Wrongfully Accused, but unnecessarily done in the idiotic Scary Movie. The Usual Suspects is an excellent film. It has great performances, good direction, and a flawlessly presented story. It's too bad that it's so rare for a movie to have so much thought put into it, so it's nice to see one come along every once in a while that just seems to do everything right.",The Usual Suspects
62,imseeg,"""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt excist"".",9,5 July 2018,"""The Usual Suspects"" launched Kevin Spacey's carreer into stardom instantly. He won an oscar for his magnificent role, but the story itself is the true star of this movie. Not many stories have had this influence and power over the imagination of the public as ""The Usual Suspects"" has had. It is intriguing till the very end. And when the plot is revealed at the end, it is chillingly exciting and satisfying to find out the truth. In a poll on IMDb, the movie was voted as having the best plot twist, beating out The Sixth Sense (1999). Kevin Spacey had to read the script twice when he first received it, to make sure he fully understood it.It is an intelligent movie, made on a shoestring budget back then. Shot in only 35 days. That's truly minimal. It had gotten only a limited release in America, because it wasnt expected to do very well. How wrong could they have been! Never underestimate the intelligence of the audience. This is one of those movies that grew bigger and more popular long after its release, just by word of mouth reviews.I had to watch this movie at least 3 times before I really understood HOW I was being tricked into NOT knowing who the mysterious crimeboss Kayser Soze was. That trick is pulled off very simple. But the most clever cons are often the simplest ones. What is this fascinating story about? Without giving away any spoilers I can safely tell you that Kayser Soze is a mysterious crimeboss who no one has ever seen, but who every criminal fears. In this story Kayser Soze orders 5 criminals to do a heist on a docked ship in the harbor, which is full of cocaine. The criminals refuse at first, but they are blackmailed into doing the heist anyway. Will the 5 crinminals survive the heist on the ship? And who is Kayser Soze anyway? Reading my own written synopsis of the story above I must confess it doesnt sound mysterious at all. Sounds rather childish. But wait till you'll see the movie, which really has had an immense power to fascinate audiences worldwide. Acting is great! Debut of Benicio del Toro. Superb role of Gabriel Byrne and Chaz Palminteri. Photography and editing are masterful. Soundtrack is mysterious. And the direction by Brian Singer was just pure excellence. Writer Cristopher McQuarrie got an oscar. But both director and writer went on to make only mediocre action movies after this first huge succes at the beginning of their careers. Well at least they gave us this mysterious gem, which I must have seen over 20 times by now and I still get a kick out of it. What a thrill of a mystery!",The Usual Suspects
63,Vartiainen,Game-changing crime mystery,6,1 August 2014,"The Usual Suspects is one of those movies everyone even slightly interested in thrillers knows and has most likely watched at some point in their life. But, if you're a newcomer and hearing about this film for the first time, trust me when I say you're in for a treat.It's best to approach this film with as little information as possible. It has tremendous rewatching value, but when you're seeing it for the first time, it's best to know as little as possible. The script is so iron tight, so twisting and turning that it loses something if you have some inkling about what's going to happen.It's also a very well-acted film. The team of five conmen, the suspects as they are, are all played by some very talented people giving their performances of a lifetime. Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Spacey deserve special mentions for portraying Michael McManus, tough, aging conman trying to get out of the game and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, his neurotic, twitchy friend, respectively.

65,thinker1691,""" The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled""",9,12 July 2007,"Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",The Usual Suspects
66,freemantle_uk,How did this film not win more Oscars?,10,2 May 2008,"The Usual Suspects is a modern classic. It is an intelligent, complex film, that was well written, acted and directed. It showed how good an actor Kevin Spacey was and helped Bryan Singer's career which led him to direct the first two X-Men films and Superman Returns. If it was up to me Braveheart wouldn't have won an Oscar and this film should have got Best Film and Best Director. The Usual Suspects treats the audience with some intelligence and makes your brain work, whilst Braveheart see the audience as idiots and tries to get away of with murder when it comes to the fact, plot and characterisation.The Usual Suspects is a crime film, which when done right can produce some of the best films made, such as the Godfather and Goodfellas. This film focuses on a one off crime, a raid on a ship which had gone wrong. Verbal (Kevin Spacey), was arrested by the FBI and he tells them the story about the raid and how the team he worked with was formed. This included attacking a secret taxi secret run by crooked cops in New York. It then turns out that these men have all crossed plans with a major crime lord, Keyser Söze and his representative demanded they repay him by taken part in the raid on the ship in San Pedro.

67,dee.reid,"""The Usual Suspects"" is not the *Usual* mid-1990s crime-thriller...",10,18 July 2015,"I have a strange history with the 1995 neo-noir crime-thriller ""The Usual Suspects.""I saw the film for the first time when I was in middle school; I remember being thoroughly impressed with the picture and I may (or may not) have rented it a few times from Blockbuster Video (I entered middle school in the late 1990s). And then I never really saw it again, but I do remember that ""The Usual Suspects"" always stuck with me, even if 15 years has passed since I last saw it. And then on a whim, I watched the movie again today. My opinion has not changed on this movie at all, but today's viewing has only reaffirmed my glowing praise for this picture.The other reason that this movie stuck with me for so long was because this film made the reputation of its director, a then-29-year-old Bryan Singer. I came to know Bryan Singer through his work on the ""X-Men"" movies - ""X-Men"" (2000) and its superior sequel, ""X2"" (2003). Although I won't go into the details why, I've long been a fan of the X-Men superhero team and I've long believed that Singer - through certain aspects of his personal background - was the perfect director for the first two films in that series and he brought those particular aspects of his personal background to make those films his own. That is something I'll always be thankful to him for, and ""X2"" is my personal favorite film that he's ever done (if not necessarily his best).But still, let's go back to the film that started it all for Bryan Singer...Let me just say that I consider ""The Usual Suspects"" to be the best crime-thriller of the '90s. Yes, I said it, ""The Usual Suspects"" is even better than ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); while I like Quentin Tarantino, I've never truly liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and have considered that to be Tarantino's weakest effort - yet Tarantino won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, so he obviously did something right. I don't think that it's any coincidence that a year after Tarantino won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his script for ""The Usual Suspects,"" which I obviously feel is the better of the two. I've just found ""The Usual Suspects"" to be far more inventive - and watchable - in its story and characters, and complex and involving story-line.""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the most compelling, original, frightening, and (occasionally) blackly humorous thrillers ever made, with one of the greatest, and shocking, plot twists in cinematic history. The film begins in the aftermath of a mysterious ship explosion and firefight in San Pedro Bay in Los Angeles, California. The police arrest cripple and con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance here), who was only one of two survivors. While being interrogated by U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Kint reveals that six weeks earlier in New York City, he and four other small-time criminals - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt ex-cop who's since been trying to go straight; professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin); McManus's partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro); and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker and explosives expert - were arrested and interrogated by the New York City Police Department on trumped-up charges in connection to a gun shipment robbery.Kint goes on to further explain a rich and complicated back-story, in which the five of them enter into a series of complex criminal schemes that eventually brings the attention of a mysterious crime figure named ""Keyser Soze,"" whose criminal exploits and ruthless reputation are so feared that he has earned a near-mythical status in the criminal underworld. It all leads to a shocking revelation of just who it is that's been pulling the five men's strings the whole time - Keyser Soze, or someone else?I have to admit that I loved every moment of ""The Usual Suspects."" This movie definitely earned every bit of praise heaped upon it by the mainstream and independent movie press upon its release in 1995; just as an aside, this film was released into theaters three days after my tenth birthday in 1995. Kevin Spacey earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor here in one of the great performances of the '90s. Though the work of the four principal actors cannot be discounted - Gabriel Byrne is by far the most sympathetic of the quintet as their de-facto, albeit highly reluctant, leader, Dean Keaton; Stephen Baldwin (whom I personally took the greatest liking to) as Michael McManus and this is probably his best-known film role before his career took a hit in the late '90s and early 2000s; Benicio Del Toro as the mangled-English-speaking Fred Fenster, who would go on to become an Oscar-winner himself in just a few short years (for ""Traffic"" in 2000); and Kevin Pollak as the one true common-man of the group, Todd Hockney.Neo-noir crime-thrillers were big in the 1990s after ""Pulp Fiction"" almost single-handedly reinvented the cinematic medium; ""The Usual Suspects,"" with its gripping story and characters, and snappy dialogue, was the next (and arguably) greatest thing to come from that era. It's a brilliant, mesmerizing viewing experience from a film-making team that struck cinematic gold. And how can anyone not mention John Ottman's touching, occasionally brooding and mysterious film score?

71,MaxBorg89,The best thriller of the '90s,10,15 September 2005,"The first and best reason to remember The Usual Suspects is one single line, spoken by low-level crook Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey): ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"". The cult phrase refers to Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal mastermind who, while unseen (or not, depending on the point of view), dominates the events of Bryan Singer's small yet massive masterpiece, the most accomplished entry in the thriller genre made during the '90s.Christopher McQuarrie's complex, intelligent and Oscar-winning script (lots of flashbacks in this one) kicks off with the final stage of a massacre, culminating in the execution of a certain Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and the explosion of the boat on which 27 people were brutally murdered. The sole survivor, the aforementioned Verbal, tells Detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone stole a truck, and five ""usual suspects"" were lined up and arrested. These included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), the dim-witted McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and the latter's lover, the hard-to-understand Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, who apparently really had problems when it came to making his lines intelligible).Now, as Keaton pointed out then and Verbal points out now, the usual strategy is putting one real criminal alongside four random buffoons who practically participate in line-ups for a living. Why were those five sharing a cell, then? The answer pops up after their release: the five suspects are contacted by a sinister attorney who goes by the name Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and told that they have to fulfil an assignment for Keyser Soze, otherwise they will all die. As the story proceeds, the incredulous police come to realize they're not dealing with the usual crime, or the usual perpetrators for that matter.The film is clearly an independent production (all scenes were filmed in a limited number of locations, mostly indoors, and the director himself famously appeared in front of the camera in some of the close-ups), but it certainly thinks big, like most smaller films from the late '80s and early '90s. The title is of course an explicit homage to Casablanca, one of Singer's favorite movies, and the intricate plotting is blockbuster-worthy (if only most blockbusters were written this well). What it lacks in size it makes up for in mood and tension, both of which are provided largely through John Ottman's editing and music.The other key attraction, sort of inevitably with such a cast, is the acting: Del Toro's performance promised a very bright future (and Traffic and 21 Grams have done nothing to prove him wrong), Byrne, Baldwin and Pollak delivered the last truly memorable silver-screen work of their careers (not that Baldwin had that much to speak of in the first place), and in the crippled, verbose Kint Spacey found the perfect role to impose himself as one of the fundamental screen presences of our time. And that's without mentioning the elusive figure of Keyser Soze: whether he's physically portrayed by someone or not, he is rightfully remembered as one of the most enduring cinema villains ever created. Not bad for a guy who hardly has any screen-time at all (or does he?).Alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, The Usual Suspects qualifies as the most intelligent and enjoyable thriller of the '90s. The extra points it scores are all due to the particular nature of its ""central"" villain: even more than Hannibal Lecter, Keyser Soze and his tricks won't leave your mind very easily.",The Usual Suspects

He is terrific in this movie. I also enjoyed Benicio del Toro although his character dies way to soon. The background music is your typical 90s suspense theme, but seeing this movie 15 years after its making you can say it is timeless nonetheless. This thriller is one of my favorites along with Seven, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs. After I finished watching this film I felt the same way as I did with all those cult classic movies. I was expecting the plot twist because that is what everyone talks about all the time, but I still loved that twist it was great. I love movies that slowly build up to a great ending. That boat shootout scene was just excellent. The movie had me hooked from the opening scene, Kevin Spacey is just great when he narrates a film. Excellent film, one of my favorites from the 90s and has a good twist at the end almost as good as The Sixth Sense. Very well constructed movie and great job by Bryan Singer as a director.

My first blush impression is that it's very much of its era. Not so much in its fashions and other such baubles and beads as its attitude. It's very much of that mid-90s explosion of ""indie"" neo noir crime films like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Fargo'. Like those films, it has an exceptional ensemble cast and a story that demands you pay close attention. That said, I guessed the twist (which I had somehow avoided for these past twenty years) pretty early on. I'm usually pretty oblivious to these things, so I was surprised to have seen it hiding in plain sight as it were.Stylishly made and boasting strong performances, 'The Usual Suspects' is a tight little mystery. I wasn't exactly blown away, finding the total a bit less than the sum of its parts, but at least I can finally use that Keyser Soze line without being a poser.",The Usual Suspects

75,NateWatchesCoolMovies,and just like that...hes gone,10,4 December 2016,"No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece",The Usual Suspects

Benico Del Toro is also in the picture and gives a good performance, a bunch of criminals are all lined up, and they proceed to tell their stories of what they believe happened during a series of flashbacks. their stories are murky at best and the viewer is left to decide what really happened, then you have to get to the ultimate question, who is Keyser Soze, and the better question does he exist.... watch and find out,, a very good movie,, but I won't give it a 9 or 10 just yet.",The Usual Suspects
79,drystyx,total of all stereotypes in formula routine film with no assets,7,23 May 2007,"Lets see. There's a kaiser who is considered a real bad ass because he gunned down his wife and little kids. Real macho, yes? He doesn't exist, but he does? He can't be killed (like we haven't seen this before). His imagination and creativity are so bad he can't even come up with names or stories, but has to take them off of coffee cups and posters. Add to this, the entire story. He orders a police line up, but the police don't know who ordered the line up. Now, we all know most police departments are incompetent, but this belongs on the NAKED GUN series. Then there are the characters. According to the narrator, they can't be broken, because they are hoodlums. Talk about your street myth that people in power would love to have you believe! But it doesn't wash. It isn't even remotely credible. And no one cares. I happen to be watching it while working on something else, and was in a public place where they showed it twice. I naturally assumed it was some sort of ""Worst films"" festival, which it might have been. I was stunned to see it ranked so high on any critic's list. Now, for the reality. That was the surface appearance on first viewing. The writers claim it's just fluff, but it doesn't make a bit of sense as noir.It makes complete sense as a supernatural thriller, though. It will take a few viewings to realize that the original line up of suspects had a replacement, just as Wargrave replaced one of his victims in Ten Little Indians. The fifth ""suspect"" is actually Keaton's girl friend, and we get clues from the clandestine meetings they have. The ending tells us that they actually played with the devil, and tried to make a contract to outwit him. The ""five suspects"" are the five who dared to challenge the devil's turf, and the clues are there, but so subtle that the entire team of writers, director, everyone, failed to see them.",The Usual Suspects
80,gcd70,"Will have you thinking, and talking, for some time",8,7 March 2008,"If you're after a movie that makes you think, then ""The Usual Suspects"" is for you. The clever, slick plot from Christopher McQuarrie is full of double-cross and twists, but is occasionally difficult to keep up with and perhaps the film could have been a little longer.Director Brian Singer has opted for a fast paced narrative rather than drawing out the conclusion. ""Pulp Fiction"" was criticised for being over long, as are many gangster-thrillers, so Singer and his editor are determined not to let ""The Usual Suspects"" get away from them. I for one though feel that sometimes more is more, and that maybe another half an hour could have added some clarity, depth and extra intrigue. Sometimes one gets the feeling that a few pieces of the puzzle are missing, perhaps due to over editing. Not that any of this takes away from the entertainment value of this pic, but wouldn't this have made a great series in the ""Twin Peaks"" vain (not ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" but ""Who is Kaiser Soze?"").The cast is headed up by Chazz Palminteri who is good as the inspector questioning the timid but sly ""Verbal"", a strong showing by Kevin Spacey. Commendable support comes from Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Suzanne Amis, Giancarlo Esposito, Dan Hedaya and Pete Postlethwaite. Gabriel Byrne makes a marked impression as Keaton, an ex-cop turned corrupt.McQuarrie's story, which is really too clever to be told in under two hours, contains plenty of intrigue as it tells of five criminals who are mysteriously brought together by an unseen crime boss who forces the motley crew to participate in a suicidal raid because they owe him. All the characters are fantastic, but we really don't get time to absorb them fully. Comedy is prevalent early on, but is found wanting as the film heads towards its conclusion. The finale itself is a complete surprise, with almost what one could classify as two endings. It's possible Singer and McQuarrie couldn't decide which was the better resolution, so they offered us both. This, I might add, is too the audience's benefit. Over all a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment that will have you thinking, and keep you talking, long after you leave the cinema.Saturday, January 13, 1996 - Astor TheatreThe title of this film hardly prepares you for what you're about to experience. There is nothing usual about ""The Usual Suspects"".Bryan Singer's film of Christopher McQuarrie's story is intricately interwoven and ingeniously, teasingly presented. Even seeing this flick a second time is most rewarding. We may know the answer to the mystery, but we are able to put it all together from the beginning and perhaps appreciate much more the subtleties of the plot.The whole attraction of the film is the tale itself, as it is told from the eyes of ""Verbal"", the crippled, petty thief who is caught up in a criminal subterfuge that seems beyond fathoming. Performances from the whole cast are assured, with Kevin Spacey most impressive as the nervous ""Verbal"", and others such as Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin giving impressive turns. Music from John Ottman is right on the money, being compelling and mysterious.I still say this pic would have made a great t.v. series : ""Who is Kaiser Soze?"".Sunday, April 20, 1997 - Video",The Usual Suspects
81,Agent10,Not enough good things to say,10,1 June 2002,"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",The Usual Suspects
82,aidanratesmovies,"I wanted to love it, I ended up liking parts of it",7,16 June 2020,"Maybe it was because I was told it was one of the greatest thrillers ever made, maybe it was because I could see the twist coming a mile away, or maybe because the movie isn't as smart as it thinks it is- for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy The Usual Suspects as much as I wanted to. That being said, it isn't a bad movie, just an overstuffed film- with some other obvious issues as well. The film is very cool with its atmospheric tones, and intriguing with its large cast of interesting criminal characters, all of which provide excellent performances while on screen. The film is largely relying on the performance of Kevin Spacey, and he is more than up to the task, providing a nearly perfect performance for the role allotted. Gabriel Byrne also gives a very notable performance, and besides Spacey, is the obvious standout in the film, and he truly does give the role his all. The direction in the film is very well crafted, as well as the score and cinematography. To sum it up, the film looks good, acts good, and sounds good- but what it lacks is anything of much better value. At the center of it, the film feels empty, relying on plot twists, a convoluted plot, and a screenplay that doesn't seem to really be going anywhere =- or at least anywhere of any importance. The film can be very entertaining to watch at times, but it's the times where everything is getting set up and explained that is truly boring. I don't care for films that feed you information, I want to understand and see the story. In the end, The Usual Suspects may be a better time around the second time, but as well crafted as it can be at times, it has plenty of flaws that make it far messier than it has any right to be. Kevin Spacey gives a great performance and the film has a cool concept, but not much is delivered in the grand scheme of things, which will leave you feeling more satisfied than awed when the film finally reaches its long awaited conclusion.My Rating: 7/10.",The Usual Suspects
83,ShootingShark,"It All Makes Sense When You Look At It Right - You Gotta Stand Back From It, Y'Know ?",8,20 May 2010,"Five professional criminals meet when they are pulled on a trumped-up charge into a police lineup in New York City. They plot a revenge job which goes well, but are then blackmailed by a shadowy figure, Keyser Söze, into hijacking a big drugs buy. Is Söze for real, and if so, what is his secret agenda ?In my view, The Usual Suspects is the best crime thriller of the nineties and one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Perhaps what's most astonishing about it is the confidence and style of director Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, both of whom had only made one feature film before (the low budget Public Access). The movie was made independently and for pretty meagre money but looks sensational, has a deliciously harebrained mind-bending plot, truckloads of fancy-pants dialogue (""Now you talk to me, or that precious immunity they seem so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.""), an elegant and stylish atmosphere, and a payoff of such witty proportions that I guarantee you will never forget it. Most movies, if they're well made, have maybe two or three really interesting characters in them - this one has at least eight, and every crazy situation they're thrown into brings out all of their intriguing facets. Why did Keeton reform ? Who is Kobayashi, and does he even exist ? Why is McManus such a hothead ? What is Fenster saying ? And of course, is Verbal really who we think he is ? These characters dance around each other in such variable and complex circles that just when you think you've got a handle on things the movie pulls the rug out from under you again. Repeated viewings only enhance the delicious enjoyment of this, and the entire cast seem to peg exactly the tone Singer is going for. Spacey is simply unforgettable (watch his eyes as he reads the cue card in the lineup) and won an Academy Award, Byrne is a supercool bad apple, Del Toro gives an amazing, career-making, what-in-the-hell-was-that physical performance, and Palminteri takes the standard cop exposition part and revs it up so high it shifts the entire movie up a gear. Another crucial element is the combination of the equally brilliant score and editing, both by John Ottman. The link between music and cutting is vital in any film, and how many professional movies have it done by the same person (aside from Ottman's work with Singer, John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13 is the only other example I can think of). There is a delicious tap-tap-tap suspense score with heavy strings which ticks along like a pressure cooker, and pares everything to the tense minimum; the action scenes are taut and fast, and Ottman carefully reserves a few choice moments to take his time, like the scene where Verbal shoots the jewel dealer. The movie is a textbook in good editing for pacing, atmosphere and suspense. There are some films which just seem to gel together seamlessly and this is one - it's a gleefully evil flick, hand crafted with loving care by and for those who love crime stories and gangster pictures. McQuarrie (who was twenty-seven) deservedly won an Academy Award for his script; Singer (a ripe old thirty) should have won as well - the two have since teamed again on Valkyrie. Trivia - the memorable title comes from a throwaway line in Casablanca.",The Usual Suspects
84,triple8,Who is Keyser Soze?,10,4 January 2004,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Uusual Suspects is REALLY good-if you haven't seen it-stop reading this now because there are SPOILERS THROUOUT!I will confess, at first glance it doesn't seem like it's gonna be a classic-I was rather bored at first-not unmanageably so but it seemed like your typical crime movie. Obviously it's not or it wouldn't be so loved-I think there's a few things here that distinguish it besides the ending-which DOES make it into the movie hall of fame for ""biggest punch in the gut ending ever!!""Firstly, there's the cleverness of the whole concept-the movie teases, hoodwinks and toys with it's audience-Some people don't like the movie for that reason, they feel manipulated-while I can understand that, I don't agree with it. The whole concept of the movie was so simple it's brilliant-as the movie goes on is there a movie viewer out there who doesn't get sucked into what Verbal is saying? He cons on screen AND off screen-the audience buys into just one man's WORDS-nothing more-until out of this simple story we begin, in our heads to make up incredibly complicated scenarios to solve the puzzle.Who is Keyser Soze?The answer, is of coarse right in front of us. Now here is something else. I guessed the answer relatively quickly and WAS SHOCKED ANYWAY when what I had thought came to pass-I got so sucked into Verbal's verbal torrent of words that I forgot my original premise-or maybe it wasn't forgotten but just put to one side-even if this idea floats through briefly your brain there is no clue AT ALL the end will play out as it does.Then of coarse, there is Keyser Soze himself, who takes on a sort of mythical legendary status in the movie to the point where the movie has made it's viewing audience crazy to know the identity of someone who's name WASN'T EVEN INTRODUCED as a character until well into the movie! The name Soze begins to take over the whole film and completely alters what everyone thought it was gonna be about.The ending-Without a doubt this is one of the best twist endings of all time-not just who Soze really is, but the METHOD of how it comes out-deserves to be up there as a great movie for that alone.Also-even though it's not perfect(I was actually as mentioned very bored at times in the beginning)you just sort of know your watching something that's gonna become a classic. There's just something about it.It can also be watched more then once(and should be!) and rather then dissipate, the movie's intrigue does not lessen at all with multiple viewings. The mystique is still there, strong as ever and the end still sends chills down the spine. A great film!I wouldn't rank this as my favorite movie of all time but I can see why it would be someone else's. It is clever, it has style, it is refreshingly different and it has some of the best acting I've ever seen. A must see if you haven't seen it.",The Usual Suspects

I see.  Two of you.  Hands up everyone who thought it was an outrageous cheat.  (The author raises his hand.)  Well, people in the first camp MIGHT think that `The Usual Suspects' is clever, fair and satisfying, even though it's even more of an outrageous cheat.  If you want a good twist, stick to old Agatha, or to those of her works that play fair - `Witness for the Prosecution' (1957) and `Endless Night' (1971) are particularly good screen versions - or try ... I don't know, any number of things.  `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997), for instance. It not only plays fair: it also paces itself correctly.  For that's the other problem with `The Usual Suspects' - we are fed no intriguing information whatever as we go along.  Even referring to the few surprises as `twists' is generous.  The film opens with a confrontation, followed by an explosion, on a boat, and from then on we listen to one of the characters narrating events leading up to this explosion - and he takes FOREVER.  It feels as if he's saying, `And then we had to kill a bit more time before we got to the boat exploding, so we robbed a bank.  Then we went to the beach.' If we weren't so busy glancing at our watches while waiting for the denouement, we'd be bored stiff.The ending had BETTER be worth it, we think - and it turns out to be one of the weakest (and did I mention it's a cheat?) in the history of cinema. Usually, after the killer revelation, our minds are abuzz.  `Of course!' we think.  `THAT'S why the ring was on her left hand - because if she hadn't been to France, where else could they hide the microfilm?'  But `The Usual Suspects' leaves one feeling flat.  There's nothing to think about.  While it's impossible to work out what happened, it's all too easy to come up with consistent theories about what happened, and any one of these theories is about as good as the rest of them.Damn it - I really want to play the Grinch who stole Christmas and TELL you what happens at the end, just so that you'll know I'm right.One final point - the title is an allusion to a line from `Casblanca'.  We can spot the allusion pretty early on.  Pay no attention to it.  It is NOT, as you might expect, a subtle hint to the audience; nor is it cunning misdirection.

89,Movie-ManDan,The Best Brain-Popper Since The Maltese Falcon.,10,15 January 2015,"I think The Maltese Flacon was the first movie that required multiple viewings because of how complex and confusing the story is. Fast-forward almost fifty years to the movie that is just as hard to follow and just as good as Bogart's classic. (""The Usual Suspects"" actually comes from a line in Bogie's best-known film, Casablanca.) In fact, this is such a confusing movie, famous and knowledgeable film critic, Roger Ebert called it one of the worst movies of 1995. Why did Ebert not like it? Because he couldn't figure it out! I have seen The Usual Suspects enough times that I know exactly what it's about and I could help anybody understand it. It really feels good figuring out an all-too complex story.The complex story unfolds with a massive explosion at a harbour where one mangled survivor in the hospital puts together a police sketch of Keyser Soze: the crime boss and brains behind the operation, who has never been seen. Meanwhile, disabled Verbal Kint (Spacey) escaped and spills his guts to Agent Kujan (Palminteri). He confesses that he and four other con men (Baldwin, Byrne, Del Toro, Pollack) met at a rigged line-up and do a series of heists that leads to the infamous Keyser Soze's right-hand man (Postlethwaite) to do the ultimate job. As Kint's story progresses, the movie becomes all that more confusing. As the movie nears the end, twists erupt with an ending that will leave you speechless. It is one of those endings that is just as shocking as finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost is The Sixth Sense and Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father. It is also one of those endings where the viewer has to make some rash decisions about what they think they saw. Once all the pieces of the puzzle are in place and you fully understand the movie, the greatness of the flick grows and you feel a great sense of accomplishment.4/4",The Usual Suspects
90,framptonhollis,Too Much Hype Can Ruin a Good Movie,5,7 August 2016,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a very entertaining and engaging mystery thriller. Most of the time, the plot kept me pretty engaged, I enjoyed the movie's style, and I thought the twist as well done. Of course, the best part of the film is the ACTING! Kevin Spacey's performance blew me away, since he was so interesting, entertaining, and funny throughout the whole movie! He played the best character and gave the best performance. The rest of the cast does very well as well, but Spacey is the only one who REALLY stood out, and he earned a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.However, besides the acting, nothing really stood out to me as particularly GREAT about ""The Usual Suspects"", it was just an entertaining crime story that was very well made and well acted. There's nothing wrong with that! But, it feels a little slow at times and there were no true signs of GREATNESS that I could see. Despite this, the film is the 25th highest rated movie on IMDb! That's crazy! It's so over-hyped, which is probably why I didn't enjoy it more! I might've even given it an 8/10 if nobody else really liked it, but when people are rating a film so highly, I expect it to be better than just a good, fun thriller with an excellent performance and a surprising twist. Obviously, I am not AGAINST good, fun thrillers with excellent performances and surprising twists, but they aren't normally 25th greatest movie of all time material.A large part of the reason of why I can't give ""The Usual Suspects"" a higher rating is my own fault. I just don't see why the movie is SUCH A BIG DEAL. It's fun to watch, yes, but it isn't much more than that.I recommend the film overall, but I do NOT recommend you to watch it expecting a masterpiece.",The Usual Suspects
91,PredragReviews,"""I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze""",10,7 May 2016,"Wait a minute... five criminals in one lineup? There's something wrong here, right? Right... In ""The Usual Suspects,"" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts. Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it. The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - ""the devil,"" Keyser Söze. You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time. Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur). You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser Söze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor. And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first)... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around. This masterpiece of cinema deservedly won the best screenplay Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar for the wonderful Kevin Spacey in 1995. The film is a modern day classic with all the elements of great film making coming together. A fantastic script combined with brilliant direction and a cast that seemed to be thoroughly enjoying itself, this is 1940's film noir at its very best, brought thoroughly up to date for the 1990's, combining clever little references to the past with very modern settings at that time.

And the corners are just as blind.There's a mysterious master-figure who you don't want to know and really don't want to cross.There's drama, comedy, tension, wit, dialogue, script and more.It's directed with stealth. The plot moves quickly and slowly. It jumps a groove and flashes back. The viewer is playing catch-up right until the very end, with its utterly outrageous denouement.It's a serious movie, but its so well made it's actually fun to watch. And afterwards you sit for a few moments quietly mesmerised.It's certainly no moral movie. It couldn't be called an epic. But it's a masterpiece.If ever proof were needed that cinema is an art-form, here it is. There are plenty of directors out there who must agonise and blush to see how feebly their own efforts compare.Watch it and luxuriate in the craft. If you see no other movie in the world, see this one.And that's about it.",The Usual Suspects
94,brando647,Bryan Singer's First Big Hit,7,11 April 2012,"I guess you don't get the same effect when you first watch a movie like THE USUAL SUSPECTS more than fifteen years after it was first released. Any chance of being ""surprised"" at the ending is ruined because spoilers have long since become common knowledge. I knew who Keyser Söze was way before I ever bothered to hunt down the movie. Of course, if you're reading this there's a possibility you haven't seen the film and, on the off chance you've somehow managed to avoid exposure to the oft-spoiled ending, I won't mention it here. I'm just here to explain if I enjoyed it, which I did for the most part. The movie is your conventional crime drama with a strong cast and some sharp writing that prevent it from fading into obscurity. It begins in the aftermath of a boat explosion where three career criminals were killed and evidence of a rumored multimillion dollar drug deal is no where to be found. What brought these criminals together and what went wrong on that boat? Only one man might hold the answers: Verbal Kint, a smalltime criminal with cerebral palsy and one of only two survivors from the botched operation. In an interrogation with Agent Kujan of US Customs, Kint will explain how it all came together: how five con-men with their own agendas were brought together with the help of a police lineup and eventually found themselves employed by the mysterious Keyser Söze. But the question remains, who is Keyser Söze?Having seen this movie so long after it originally hit, I've got to say: wow, it feels dated. When I was watching it, it consistently screamed 90's. The editing, the cinematography, just the overall style is firmly planted in the decade. In a sense, it kind of sucks. As much as I've heard and read about the movies over the years, I guess I expected something with a little more of it's own style. It doesn't detract overwhelmingly from the movie. It's still a solid story with a great cast of characters, but it's just visually unimpressive. It's a pretty basic premise for a movie and I think it was the ""twist"" ending that grabbed a lot of people's attentions. Really, it's not so much a twist because it didn't really have that much of a bearing on the story. Looking back, the big revelation could've involved any character and it wouldn't really have been any different. It makes the ending memorable, sure, especially the means in which it was accomplished during the interrogation. That much was cool, no doubt. Christopher McQuarrie has since gone on to prove himself a capable enough screenwriter and his nonlinear storytelling keeps the movie intriguing (even when, in my case, you know how it ends beforehand). I suppose the best thing to come from this movie was director Bryan Singer's first major success. I can't imagine he would've been able to bring his vision of X-MEN to life if he hadn't knocked this one out of the park with audiences.Going in, I knew Kevin Spacey was in the film and, as anyone who's even seen Kevin Spacey in a film can attest, he's guaranteed to be awesome. And he was. He brings his best in every role he adopts, and Verbal Kint is no different. Kint is a strange man, seemingly small time compared to the situation he's found himself in but you can't help but feel there's more to his character. Speaking of characters, let's go back to how I mentioned the overwhelming 90's vibe and take a moment to bring up the cast. If this cast doesn't feel ripped right out of the decade, I don't know what does: Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, comedian (with a penchant for dramatic roles) Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, and (I kid you not) Stephen Baldwin. To be fair, Del Toro has gone on to continuing success in his career and I love his character, Fenster. Del Toro has admitted that Fenster only serves the movie as a plot device about halfway through and took the opportunity to have a little fun with it, giving him near indecipherable speech that steals scenes from the heavyweight performances going on around him. These guys make for an interesting, if eclectic, bunch. Byrne is great as the movie's ""hero"". His character, Dean Keaton, is a formerly crooked cop who's gone straight but finds himself reeled back into the world of crime. Even Baldwin does well here. All of the elements are here for a fun crime drama and new viewers are sure to find something here to enjoy.",The Usual Suspects

It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged Soeze at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Kaiser Soeze?Please, before anyone attack me, let me say everyone has a right to express their opinion, even though they don't agree with you. I'll explain why I hated this movie and why it was so bad, unlike many other millions of people who loved this movie.Okay, starting with one huge complaint: The movie is not interesting, but more confusing. I know you all must think it's stupid to hate this movie because I didn't get it at all but when I read it in Wikipedia, where it explains everything so I can understand, I still didn't like the movie, so there you go.I thought I might've been a stupid moviegoer to not understand but Wikipedia explains the plot points in a straight-forward telling. It doesn't go into all this confusing scenes like the movie did. I was confused and didn't care what happened in the movie.Yes, I've seen ""Scary Movie"" before this movie. Why? Because that movie spoofs this movie's twist ending (I don't know how I got that information without even watching The Usual Suspect, but I knew for some reason. I forgot) so I thought the twist ending was obvious and very stupid.Some good things about the film was the greatly written score and some good performances. Now, back to the subject. Is the movie good? No. Should you watch it? The only reason you should watch it is because of the surprise ending, if you haven't seen ""Scary Movie"", yet.

96,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Usual Suspects""- An electrifying and complex thriller. One of the best films of the 90's.",10,13 November 2016,"There is always that handful of films that help to define their era, shaping popular culture and influencing new talents in storytelling and performing for years- even decades- to come. The 1990's, a strange sort-of transitional period in American culture, brought forth many a modern day classic. Films such as Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" and Wes Craven's ""Scream"" revolutionized then-modern cinema and showed a degree of class and complexity within their given genres unlike any we had seen before. And of course, another of these now iconic films was this one... director Bryan Singer's mind-warping and electrifying crime thriller ""The Usual Suspects."" It's a film that has continued to live on and attain respect as perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made in the twenty plus years since its initial release.We follow the recollections of con-artist ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is apparently one of the few survivors of a bloodbath on the San Pedro Bay. He is interrogated by Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) over what went wrong. Kint weaves an extraordinary tale of five criminals including himself, former crooked cop Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack) and Fenster (Benicio del Toro), who were brought together seemingly by chance and began to take a series of jobs together just six weeks ago. However, their actions eventually place them into the cross-hairs of a mysterious and mythical figure in the crime world. And they will be forced to perform one last job for this twisted mind known only as ""Keyser Soze.""Director Singer, now known for his work on big-budget studio pictures like Fox's popular ""X-Men"" film franchise, excels at his art in this film- only his second feature-length work. I've long been a fan of his as a skilled and talented visual storyteller, and here he shines with very subtle and even old-fashioned touches that give the tale a degree of timelessness. He eschews the tendency for mid-90's entertainment to constantly be flashy and in-your-face to instead give us long, drawn out and highly deliberate sequences where the entire scene is defined by only dialog or the look of reaction on someone's face. Which is then perfectly accentuated by a few key moments of pure, kinetic style, mainly during the twists and turns the film takes at key moments. It compliments the classic tale of corruption and intrigue being presented and builds off of the expert writing of Christopher McQuarrie.McQuarrie's script plays a constant and carefully thought-out balancing act that builds suspense and drama on a constant basis, while also giving us plenty of nice, human touches for the frequent piece of levity. It's a film that strikes an admirable and even highly likable and entertaining tone while also subtly hinting towards an ever-pervasive sense of dread beneath the surface. The handling of character is also stunning, with each and every player feeling completely defined and developed regardless of the amount of screen time spent with them through believable and organic dialog and reaction. Even characters that are more unbelievable, such as the mastermind that is Keyser Soze come off as thoroughly engrossing because they are grounded in a sense of reality- in this case as a figment that has become a myth due to his infamy.This is also very much an ""actor's movie"", and everyone present gives work that is nothing less than stellar. Spacey and Byrne particularly steal the show as our two ""leads."" Spacey, now a highly respected legend of the industry, gives the performance that helped define his career and stardom here as an unsure and worried man dealing with the events that have transpired. He also gets much praise for portraying a character dealing with Cerebral Palsy in a realistic and sensitive way. Byrne knocks it out of the park as a man trying to move past his career in crime but can't quite let go- there's some powerful stuff going on beneath the surface with his character. Baldwin, Pollack and del Toro make for a great rest of the gang, and supply plenty of laughs and many a gasp with their turns. Supporting roles by Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Suzy Amis and Giancarlo Esposito build towards creating an ideal ensemble and all act their hearts out no matter the size of their role.The fact of the matter is, this is one of the new classics to emerge from Hollywood in the past thirty years. And it's impact not only on filmmaking but culture as a whole is undeniable. Even to this day, the perplexing question of ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" is a highly recognizable and important piece of pop-culture entertainment, and no matter where you are, if you ask someone ""Hey, have you seen 'Usual Suspects'?"", chances are you'll be met with a smile from someone who has seen and adored it as much as everyone else. And for good reason! It's a wonderful film. Filled with keen visual storytelling, phenomenal writing and some of the greatest acting chops ever put on-screen. It's a masterpiece of its era and is still very much a valuable and entertaining film today.It easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing and go out to pick up a copy. It's well worth it.",The Usual Suspects

98,bandw,Stylish crime drama with little content,6,6 February 2006,"[**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of ""Law and Order"" without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over.",The Usual Suspects

The Story is told by Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) while being questioned by the police. The Line up is no coincidence, and the usual suspects are all suspicious, and we, the viewers are deeply confused.The Cast is simply brilliant (Kevin Spacey's first Oscar was well deserved) and no-one's performance is weak. The Direction by Bryan Singer is quite incredible, this is not an easy film to make work, it really is very complicated and the truth is very well guarded.Despite your enjoyment, you will feel confused for much of the time, puzzling over the various plot elements as they intertwine and twist you around, but its all down to the clever direction, there are not many movies out there, like this one. The good news is this - the ending is totally satisfying, and that alone is a rare thing to witness.Despite the complexity, this film works, but if you don't give it your full attention, it may just pass you by.

102,DeeNine-2,Testosterone thriller cleverly done,8,1 February 2007,"The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in ""Throw Mama from the Train."" But this is not a comedy. It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either. It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody. The title is the tip off.""Round up the usual suspects"" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know. Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says ""round up the usual suspects"" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order. It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but. The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types. The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film. In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley). Consider these similarities: In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an ""at your throat"" style. In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane. In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs. These guys are not your run of the mill actors. They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies. They know how to look and act authentic.But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue. In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different. In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play. Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody ""Mister"" like an English butler. And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist."" Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak. And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois. That will help to unravel the plot. The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics. But it's a little better than that. And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem. While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience. Personally I thought the movie was a laugh. I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it. But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it. Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology. They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f-you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world. And there's some truth to it.Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified. He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else. I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre. A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint. You might want to write one yourself.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

103,sme_no_densetsu,"""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""",8,20 September 2009,"I've seen ""The Usual Suspects"" several times since its release so it's somewhat difficult for me to judge it now. After all, once one unravels the film's central mystery it cannot possibly produce the same reaction again. That being said, the film is one of those instances whereby a repeat viewing is rewarding since actions and events take on a different meaning.The cast is surprisingly good for a low-budget film. Securing Gabriel Byrne was a coup and Kevin Spacey delivered the goods in an Academy Award-winning performance. The rest of the cast includes dependable character actors like Pete Postlethwaite, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Esposito & Dan Hedaya. Benicio del Toro stands out in a memorable supporting role but I have to say that Stephen Baldwin & Kevin Pollak leave something to be desired. Nevertheless, on the whole, the acting is in good hands.However, it's the screenplay that justifiably gets most of the credit for making this film memorable. Opening with the aftermath of an apparent drug deal gone wrong, we're led through the preceding events as related by 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey). He tells of how the titular 'usual suspects' got together and how they came to be embroiled in a mystery that has the cops baffled. All of this leads to a climax that I can only say I hope no-one has spoiled for you.On the technical side, Bryan Singer's direction is well-handled as he manages to imbue the film with a distinct sense of style without going overboard. Editor John Ottman also scored the picture and he did a fine job on both counts. The efforts of Singer & Ottman give the film a polish that defies its relatively low budget.Ultimately, it's difficult for me to judge this film (or any film with a twist) since I've seen it multiple times. That being said, the fact that I have seen it multiple times shows that the vaunted twist is only a part of the film's appeal. Nevertheless, for a first time viewing I'd be tempted to bump the film's rating up to a 9 out of 10.",The Usual Suspects

Well I believe in God and the only thing that frightens me is Kaizer Sauze. "" Verbal KintSo is one the coolest lines in the movie.  And it is a line that sums up how this movie is great at playing with your mind and your emotions and takes you on a journey from point A to point B, then C and then Z and all points in between.As the story goes 5 cons are brought together suspiciously in a line up and are eventually thrust into a crime spree together.  But what happens later after their apparent one job is completed, puts all of their lives in danger.  They may have been hired by the mythical "" Kaizer Sauze "" ( who strikes fear in mens hearts just by the mere mention of his name ) to complete one further job where, if they succeed, will be free to divide up 91 million dollars in drug money.  Quite the tempting proposition.  But the story is just one of the elements that make this film work.The men chosen to play the roles of Keaton ( Byrne ) Hockney ( Pollack ) Fenster ( Del Torro ) McManus ( Baldwin ) and Verbal Kint ( Spacey ) were probably done so because they were not major Hollywood players.  Even Kevin Spacey at this time was a B actor at best.  This was before his academy award and before Seven.  And the budget for this film was not that large. But what the casting did by having these actors play the roles of these five men was create excellent characters that are now so familiar to us that I don't believe anyone could have played the roles better.  The energy and charisma that they have together is amazing and watching certain jarring sessions between men is like watching Shakespeare ( if you're into that sort of thing. )Of course the most brilliant thing about the film is how it is summed up at the end and if you do figure it out before they tell you everything, hats off to you.  But my guess is that you won't and that makes the movie so much fun.  This is a near perfect film and it is worth watching many times.",The Usual Suspects
106,mstomaso,A Perfectly Crafted Mystery - (very ambiguous spoiler),10,4 February 2005,"Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?"", and - as silly as it might seem - ""is he the devil himself?"". Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing.",The Usual Suspects

108,hnt_dnl,A maddeningly meticulous and crafty film!,10,13 July 2008,"My top 10 films of the 90s EASILY include this film, THE USUAL SUSPECTS. I remember seeing it shortly after it first came out in 1995 and being enthralled by the story, dialogue, and characters, then came the punchline at the end! No matter, I still think of it as a fascinating piece of film-making. Because of the trick ending, it is debatable as to what is real or not in the film. If you watch it objectively, it is just a damn entertaining, complex, well-plotted film noir piece with an exciting climax. If you take the subjective route, which you pretty much have to because of the ending, then what you've got is perhaps the most puzzling film ever made, one that even with multiple repeated viewings will make you second (and third and fourth, etc.) guess yourself. Regardless, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is one spectacular film! THE USUAL SUSPECTS starts off with the film's supposed protagonist, Dean Keaton (terrifically played by Gabriel Byrne), being assassinated by a mysterious figure (unseen to the viewer) named 'Keyser'. I think it's safe to say that this opening scene is objectively told. It really happened. Then Keyser burns the ship that Keaton and a bunch of other men (who we find out about later) are on. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the cops and FBI question the sole survivor of this massacre, Verbal Kint (played by Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Kevin Spacey). Verbal is the only one who can tell what happened. He is our link to the story of THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Leading the investigation is US Customs Agent Dave Kujon (effectively played by Chazz Palmentieri). Kujon grills Kint relentlessly in order to piece together all the events that led up to the massacre. Kint begins with the events weeks before when Kujon and his fellow agents had arrested Keaton and the other 'usual' suspects Kint, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). These 5 men were suspected of a hijacking and were brought in for questioning.As Kint continues and the film progresses, we find that the 5 criminals were manipulated into the situation by Keyser Soze, a Hungarian uber-gangster/drug dealer who they all think is really a myth until his #1 lackey Kobyashi (played with cold efficiency by Pete Posthlewaite) pays them a visits after their release from jail and tells them that indeed Soze is behind all this. Soze wants them to to do job for him by killing his Hungarian competitors, who are making a huge drug deal with some Argentinians on a ship docked in LA. This leads us to the climax and back to the events that started the film.THE USUAL SUSPECTS, whatever one's feelings about the surprise at the end, is one brilliant example of modern day film noir. Nobody is innocent, yet every major character is multi-dimensional and draws you into the story. There is quite a bit of action and violence, but it is tight, well-placed, and quite convincing. The beauty of the film is that you can watch it at least two different ways: objectively to be entertained and subjectively to try to figure out what the heck is really going on! The acting is uniformly superb, the Oscar-winning screenplay crackles, and the film is NEVER dull. One of the best of the 90s!",The Usual Suspects
109,Stampsfightclub,disjointed crime film,5,14 January 2007,"Despite the uproar and praise for this 1995 Oscar winning crime drama about a man recalling the days he lived in a crime life, I could not settle into the fairly disjointed uninteresting plot.The acting by Spacey (K-Pax) is good, personally not sure about Oscar deserving but he did well enough to capture the essence of the troubled misleading criminal who recalls the days he was part of a criminal group.The direction is very well crafted; especially some of the final scenes are exceptionally shot.It's the story that lets the film down however. Its slow, its boring and I had trouble staying awake. There is slow and there's too slow, and this film was the latter. There seemed to be too much focus on the characters. The relationships were continuous trying too hard to create tension and surprise but unfortunately it did not come off for me. At points the plot jumped too quickly ahead, especially at the beginning when audiences should be getting to know the characters but the film simply does not allow them to settle into the main story and that way allows audiences to play catch up.It conforms to the genre well with plenty of gun fights, angry money wanting criminals and depressive coppers and these conventions are not portrayed as well as they could have been.The story is told through Kevin Spacey's character as he explains what happens to the cops. Its an interesting technique and through his vulnerable persona are audiences able to feel some attachment to his character and the plot.The ending confused me slightly and although it allows audiences to ask questions, it is quite frankly a disjointed ending.",The Usual Suspects
110,khanbaliq2,"A slick triumph of casting and wordplay, The Usual Suspects was one of the most fiendishly intricate American films of the 1990s.",9,4 February 2010,"A story related in flashbacks, of five petty crooks, wrongly accused of a crime, who meet in a police line-up and unwittingly plan robberies together, before it dawns on them that a master criminal may (or may not) be controlling their every move.The Usual Suspects is a fabulous con-trick of a film, playfully tweaking the traditions of story-telling, raising expectations and encouraging assumptions before changing tack with dizzying grace, and finally resolving itself with an explanatory tour de force that leads audiences to question everything they have already seen. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the hangdog Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, but everyone in this literal rogue's gallery plays his part. The brilliance of the story's structure encouraged a whole generation of screenwriters to emulate its feat. Commercial gold dust, in the sense that people were drawn to see it again, to pick up on the clues they missed first time round. On June 17, 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its ""Ten Top Ten""—the best ten films in ten ""classic"" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. The Usual Suspects was acknowledged as the tenth best mystery film.",The Usual Suspects
